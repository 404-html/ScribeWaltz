00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.930
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is one of the episodes that we

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:06.510
filmed during the Psi Phi program.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.160
Joe Rogan questions,

4
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:13.161
everything it is brought to you by Ting Ting is a cell phone company that gives

5
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.940
you cell phone service that makes sense for you.

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.290
They allow you to cancel it anytime.

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.660
They don't have contracts,

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.550
they use the sprint backbone.

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.650
So you're getting dependable,

10
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:26.520
reliable,

11
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.050
excellent cell phone service,

12
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.860
but you're getting it in a way that you probably wouldn't get from a big

13
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:32.221
company.

14
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:33.054
Like for instance,

15
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.610
if you don't use all of your minutes,

16
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.090
if you use less minutes than you thought you would,

17
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.710
ting will actually knock you down to the lower level and then credit you the

18
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:45.060
difference on your next bill.

19
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.950
That shit is unheard of.

20
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.580
No company does that and I think that's an awesome way to do business.

21
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.990
They're not trying to rob you,

22
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:55.590
they're just trying to sell you something that's really good and it's an

23
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:56.730
excellent exchange.

24
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.870
And even exchange,

25
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.400
you give them money,

26
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.700
they give you good cell phone service at a reasonable price.

27
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.600
Um,

28
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.340
ting has on their website a lot of examples that people have sent to them about

29
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:10.650
how much money they have saved by using ting.

30
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.150
But I can tell you personally,

31
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.530
I have spoken to many people on Twitter and social media that have sent me a

32
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:21.150
thank you saying that ting saved them a ton of money and it gave them excellent

33
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:24.270
service with really high end cell phone devices.

34
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.140
They use the android phones and they have all sorts of other different kinds of

35
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:28.974
phones as well.

36
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.480
But the high end android phones like the Samsung Galaxy s four,

37
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.040
the HTC one,

38
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:38.940
all the really top end nice devices that you can get a,

39
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:40.980
I recently just got uh,

40
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.331
one of these,

41
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:46.650
a galaxy note threes is a fucking ridiculous phone.

42
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:47.610
It might be too big.

43
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.570
I don't know if I'm going to keep it,

44
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.740
but right now I got it and I am very impressed with the android operating

45
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:53.101
system.

46
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:55.290
I haven't fucked with this in a long time.

47
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.510
I got one a long time ago,

48
00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:01.860
like maybe three years ago or something like that.

49
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:03.360
And it was like a drunk iPhone.

50
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:05.040
It was such a hunk of shit.

51
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.000
But boy,

52
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:07.710
have they caught up in a big way.

53
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:10.620
And this screen is magical.

54
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.210
Anyway,

55
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.520
I'm waxing poetically about learn my new phone.

56
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.120
What I'm telling you is that Ting will save you money,

57
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.170
give you awesome cell phone coverage and make you feel good that you're

58
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:24.270
connected to a reliable but,

59
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.150
but ethical company that's not trying to fucking rip you off.

60
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.840
So go to [inaudible] dot ting.com and save yourself $25 either off service or

61
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:33.834
device.

62
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.823
It's your choice.

63
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.251
And,

64
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:35.610
uh,

65
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.120
enjoy.

66
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.953
And I guarantee you,

67
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.600
if you're looking for some cheaper,

68
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.610
but yet excellent cell phone service,

69
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:44.010
it doesn't make you feel like you're getting fucked over to.

70
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.460
Here's the way to go.

71
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.333
That's the new song.

72
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.430
To use the word Tuco rogan.tang.com go get your freak on a before this podcast

73
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:54.721
airs.

74
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:58.860
I just want to say thank you to the fine folks at Psi Phi and Arthur Smith,

75
00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:01.150
the production company that made my,

76
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.130
my show Joe Rogan questions everything.

77
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.400
Thank you to Tim and Wayne from Scifi also for allowing us to put this on the

78
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:09.600
air.

79
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.090
Um,

80
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.080
as a podcast,

81
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.980
one of the things that we did when we were filming the show is we wanted to

82
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:17.890
incorporate the podcast into the show because first of all,

83
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:20.890
it's the best method that I know of for discussing an issue.

84
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.730
There's one,

85
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.060
one of the things that I found about the show that was kind of awkward.

86
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.710
I really enjoyed doing the show.

87
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:30.310
I really enjoyed the opportunity to explore all these different topics.

88
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.600
It didn't come out perfect.

89
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.430
There's a lot of things that I want wasn't happy with,

90
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:37.180
but that's all just a part of the growing pains of creating a show.

91
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.110
Um,

92
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.860
but one thing that I did find is that having conversations in front of people

93
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:46.300
standing up and weird circumstances like in a hallway or you know,

94
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.100
in a laboratory or whatever,

95
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.450
the many,

96
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.880
many different scenarios that we,

97
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:52.450
uh,

98
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.180
had conversations on the show is very awkward.

99
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.980
The best way to have a conversation is on a podcast sitting down across each

100
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:01.690
other in a comfortable chair,

101
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.260
in front of a big oak desk where you're relaxed,

102
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.500
you feel confident,

103
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.400
you're comfortable,

104
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:10.720
rather you feel comfortable,

105
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:12.220
you feel it's quiet.

106
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:13.054
The room is,

107
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.810
you know,

108
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.440
it's,

109
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.920
it's a,

110
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.030
it's a fun place to be.

111
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.893
It feels good.

112
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.430
There's,

113
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.880
there's good energy here and we control that for the most part by having a,

114
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.120
in a podcast form and my favorite aspects of the show,

115
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.750
we're actually Dunkin and myself talking to these people on the podcast and it

116
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:34.360
was kind of a revelation and a lot of ways it's like,

117
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:38.270
my favorite part of doing this show is the stuff that I was already doing before

118
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.280
I was doing the show.

119
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.050
But I want to thank thanks Phi for allowing us to do it that way because it

120
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:44.381
really,

121
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:44.631
uh,

122
00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:45.464
it came out great.

123
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:46.420
Um,

124
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.253
those parts of it.

125
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.150
And so now you're going to get the full unedited podcast.

126
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.110
This first one is,

127
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.470
uh,

128
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.440
from the big foot episode and it's Doctor Jeffery Mel,

129
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.393
Mel Drum.

130
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.640
Dr Jeff Meldrum is,

131
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.481
in my opinion,

132
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:03.820
the most credible of all the big foot believers.

133
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.700
I shouldn't say the most credible because maybe there's some out there.

134
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:08.260
They're just as credible that I haven't met.

135
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:10.990
He's the most reasonable guy that I communicated with.

136
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.011
And a,

137
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.870
I really respect him for his,

138
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:14.470
first of all was,

139
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.470
is stepping out and saying that he really thinks this is a big real undiscovered

140
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:22.240
primate living in the Pacific northwest,

141
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.240
which takes a lot of balls for someone who's a legit professor.

142
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.171
Uh,

143
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:26.501
you know,

144
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:29.480
cause people amazingly think you're fucking crazy if you tell them there's an

145
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.090
unknown monkey living in the woods.

146
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.460
He doesn't just do that.

147
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:36.010
He does that from an academic point of view.

148
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:36.611
He's very,

149
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:37.570
very bright guy.

150
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.630
And he also does that as an expert in human movement.

151
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:43.270
And I found his theories on the Sasquatch,

152
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.630
uh,

153
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.990
combined with this knowledge that he has about human movement to be very

154
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:49.930
fascinating and his analysis of footprints and what,

155
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.210
what's unique about these footprints and why it mimics actual real PR,

156
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.920
real primates and not human beings.

157
00:05:56.921 --> 00:05:57.530
In fact,

158
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.701
uh,

159
00:05:57.701 --> 00:05:59.660
I thought it was also incredibly fascinating.

160
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.020
He's a brilliant guy and a very nice guy and I appreciate very much that,

161
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:03.110
uh,

162
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.930
he took the time out of his busy schedule to come on the show.

163
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.951
So enjoy.

164
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:08.840
This is doctor Jeff Meldrum and once again,

165
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:10.490
thanks to everybody involved in the show,

166
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:12.500
everybody from the cameraman on down,

167
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.240
it was a amazing,

168
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.700
cool place to work for a few months.

169
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.720
So a big kiss.

170
00:06:18.721 --> 00:06:23.721
See you all and now enjoy a podcast with powerful Duncan Trussell n Dr Jeffrey

171
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.923
Meldrum.

172
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.530
<v 1>[inaudible] tell me when we're ready.</v>

173
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.310
Dr Meldrum.

174
00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:46.090
First of all,

175
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.110
<v 0>thank you very much for coming here and talking to us about all things squatch.</v>

176
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.570
Don't give an I or a very excited about this.

177
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.770
How many years,

178
00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:54.520
first of all,

179
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.810
have you been involved in this?

180
00:06:55.811 --> 00:07:00.580
Were you in that Leonard Nimoy in search of bigfoot show?

181
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.941
No.

182
00:07:00.941 --> 00:07:01.780
That predated.

183
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.561
Predated,

184
00:07:02.561 --> 00:07:02.800
yeah.

185
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.550
Okay.

186
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.320
That's the Oji of bigfoot shows,

187
00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:05.900
right?

188
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.430
Yeah.

189
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.430
I remember seeing that when I was a kid and being so convinced and excited that

190
00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:13.930
there was a big hairy man living in the woods,

191
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.950
obviously back then I didn't realize that it could be a species.

192
00:07:17.951 --> 00:07:20.410
It wasn't just like one individual dude,

193
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.330
but a whole species.

194
00:07:22.331 --> 00:07:25.690
And I've been fascinated by it since I was a little child.

195
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.771
I don't know why.

196
00:07:26.771 --> 00:07:27.550
I don't know what it is.

197
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.650
What is it about big foot?

198
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.441
Maybe you could tell us,

199
00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:31.780
what is it about big foot that speaks to man?

200
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.451
<v 2>I there,</v>

201
00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:33.440
there are different levels.

202
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:34.161
I mean there's the,

203
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:35.480
just simply the mystery,

204
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:38.120
something that's undiscovered unresolved.

205
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:38.921
Uh,

206
00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:41.960
I think there's an added mystique because it's so human.

207
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:42.320
Like,

208
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.153
I mean,

209
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.990
that's been a,

210
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.990
an icon and an archetype of the human experience since the beginning of history.

211
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.870
Some of the earliest heroes hung out with Wildman,

212
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.270
whether it was a Beowulf Grendel or,

213
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:57.410
um,

214
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.400
Gilgamesh and Inca.

215
00:07:58.401 --> 00:07:59.181
Do you know,

216
00:07:59.181 --> 00:07:59.501
there,

217
00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:04.040
there were these denisons of the forest that maybe represented are,

218
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:09.530
are sort of lost connection to wilderness into wild places.

219
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.280
<v 0>Do you think there's a certain amount of arrogance and assuming that we have a</v>

220
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:16.520
full detail of the entire fossil record of primates,

221
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.331
when you know,

222
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.220
you see things like Homo Floresiensis,

223
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:19.701
the Hobbit,

224
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:23.310
man Dinetia and the evidence of gigantic [inaudible],

225
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.111
which is only,

226
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:24.321
you know,

227
00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:25.160
the 1920s,

228
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:25.701
they found that,

229
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:25.901
right?

230
00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:26.734
Yeah.

231
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:27.371
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

232
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:27.730
This is,

233
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.550
this is a theme that it really is placing Sasquatch in a,

234
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:31.840
in a very different context.

235
00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:35.650
And one that I keep pushing because I can see this unfolding,

236
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:36.430
uh,

237
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.790
with every new discovery of,

238
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:39.910
of a hominid like Homo Floresiensis,

239
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:40.860
uh,

240
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.041
the,

241
00:08:41.041 --> 00:08:42.310
the tree of,

242
00:08:42.311 --> 00:08:45.160
of Hominid radiation gets bushier and Bush here.

243
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.300
And then discovery after discovery shows that some of these lineages have

244
00:08:49.301 --> 00:08:53.380
persisted to much more recent times in the past than has ever been acknowledged

245
00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:53.891
previously.

246
00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:54.330
So,

247
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:54.740
you know,

248
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.000
homofloresiensis 13,000 years old,

249
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:57.931
a new,

250
00:08:57.931 --> 00:08:58.950
a neanderthal site,

251
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:00.720
maybe 10,000 years old.

252
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.231
Really?

253
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:01.740
Yeah.

254
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.920
And so the,

255
00:09:02.921 --> 00:09:06.240
the notion that we're the only hominid on the planet,

256
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.330
contrary to all experience in the past,

257
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:12.090
when there were multiple hominids coexisting on the landscape,

258
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:12.800
uh,

259
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.490
may be a real misnomer,

260
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:16.230
real misrepresentation of fact.

261
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:20.340
And these relic humanoids may be the rule rather than the exception.

262
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.380
<v 0>It's,</v>

263
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.100
it's a real tricky subject.

264
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.780
The bigfoot Sasquatch subject.

265
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.810
I have brought it up with people that I love and respect and they have mocked me

266
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.850
right in front of my face.

267
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:33.991
Join the club.

268
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:34.351
Dana,

269
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:34.921
Dana White.

270
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:38.840
Dana White mocked me the other night at dinner right in front of my face and big

271
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.070
guy.

272
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:39.541
I tell you,

273
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:42.960
I was pretty disappointed when I heard you were going looking for bigfoot while

274
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:43.561
I was like,

275
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:44.850
how dare you sir.

276
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.280
What do you know about big foot man?

277
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.900
It's one of those things.

278
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.100
Yeah,

279
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:54.100
big foot is like ghosts or flying saucers or crop circles in lumps.

280
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:56.220
You in a Weirdo category.

281
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.180
It does.

282
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.810
But that's because there is a lot of Weirdos that believe in big foot.

283
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.440
That's right.

284
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.440
You guys know that you probably experienced more lunatics then psychiatry is

285
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:07.970
due.

286
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:08.930
<v 2>And that's what,</v>

287
00:10:08.931 --> 00:10:09.171
uh,

288
00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:10.004
that's what,

289
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:10.560
uh,

290
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.370
uh,

291
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.500
Warren's off a lot of my colleagues is they don't want to navigate,

292
00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:17.750
try to navigate that morass of,

293
00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:19.370
of the lunatic fringe.

294
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.030
And so you don't have the luxury of just simply going out and collecting data.

295
00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:25.790
You have to win through all this chaff to find,

296
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.653
find the colonel.

297
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.350
<v 0>It's very,</v>

298
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.741
I'm sorry,

299
00:10:27.741 --> 00:10:28.340
it's very,

300
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.790
it's like when they lump you in like it's a stain.

301
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.670
It really is a stain on your career and credentials.

302
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.361
They can say,

303
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:35.511
oh,

304
00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:36.770
he's that big foot guy.

305
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.470
<v 2>Absolutely.</v>

306
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.710
Well,

307
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.490
there was a moment as I was sitting here contemplating these footprints that

308
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:43.290
sort of pulled me into this subject when I,

309
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.240
I was familiar with Grover Krantz,

310
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:49.110
I knew the grief that he'd suffered at the hands of his colleagues because of

311
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:50.430
his pursuit of this subject,

312
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:50.581
you know,

313
00:10:50.581 --> 00:10:51.414
in his career,

314
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.190
stalling his career.

315
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.220
And I contemplate for a moment,

316
00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:57.930
do I really want to go down that road or not?

317
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.090
But how could you not when you have 35,

318
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:03.840
45 fresh footprints laid out in front of you that are so clear,

319
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.920
so compelling,

320
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:05.790
so persuasive.

321
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.080
I mean,

322
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.760
for me that's what science is about.

323
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:10.080
It's going after those.

324
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.740
Interesting.

325
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.000
Even if are anomalous,

326
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.780
uh,

327
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.613
data points.

328
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.020
What was it that got you started on this?

329
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.311
Well it was that,

330
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:17.581
I mean,

331
00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:17.701
I,

332
00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:17.880
I,

333
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.180
you could,

334
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.560
we could go clear back to my childhood when I was born in and a,

335
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.420
in the Pacific northwest and knew of bigfoot,

336
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.610
knew of Roger Patterson and his film.

337
00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:28.200
He came to Spokane where I lived as a,

338
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.470
as a youngster and showed his documentary showcasing that,

339
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.363
that film clip.

340
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.850
But my academic interest began in 1996 when I was shown a very,

341
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.150
see this,

342
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.130
the same line of tracks I just referred to in the blue mountains outside of

343
00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:44.940
Walla Walla.

344
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.391
And,

345
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:45.840
uh,

346
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.190
I tell you that the hook was set.

347
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.890
<v 0>Is there ever been a moment we stepped back and said,</v>

348
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.080
hang on,

349
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.220
am I wasting my time

350
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.060
<v 2>on some hooey?</v>

351
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:55.720
Sure.

352
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:55.841
Oh,

353
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:56.141
sure.

354
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:56.671
Is there a button,

355
00:11:56.671 --> 00:11:58.180
a lot of hooey involved in the subject?

356
00:11:58.181 --> 00:11:58.661
Because there is,

357
00:11:58.661 --> 00:11:59.000
yeah,

358
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.490
you got to get past that.

359
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.260
But I tell ya what,

360
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:04.870
I have seen what I've experienced firsthand,

361
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.100
uh,

362
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:06.661
be it too,

363
00:12:06.661 --> 00:12:06.821
you know,

364
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:09.340
finding tracks in very remote areas myself,

365
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:10.630
hearing vocalizations,

366
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:11.980
having rocks thrown at me.

367
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:12.650
And what have you,

368
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:15.640
will tell us about your experiences that you've seen tracks where there's no

369
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:16.870
people like deep in the woods.

370
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:17.320
Yeah.

371
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.040
What'd you say?

372
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.940
On several occasions?

373
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:19.510
Well,

374
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:19.930
one,

375
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:24.010
one was in connection with a kind of an interesting it possible interaction.

376
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:26.290
We never actually saw something or anything,

377
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:27.191
but,

378
00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:27.520
uh,

379
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.640
when you eliminate,

380
00:12:28.641 --> 00:12:28.950
uh,

381
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:29.260
you know,

382
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.280
when you eliminate the,

383
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.671
the,

384
00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:31.450
uh,

385
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.190
likely,

386
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:32.830
uh,

387
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.000
scenarios,

388
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.730
then the unlikely is what you're left with.

389
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:38.320
And in this case we had,

390
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:41.230
we were in the Siskiyou wilderness of northern California,

391
00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:44.470
one of the first expeditions of sorts that I participated in it.

392
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:49.780
We'd gone off from our base camp quite some distance off trail to investigate

393
00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:52.120
some lakes we thought might've been shrunken up in the,

394
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:52.661
in the,

395
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:53.440
uh,

396
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.310
in the heat and exposing mudflats for more tracking opportunities.

397
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.620
We did find a set of tracks in a,

398
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:01.210
on a dusty stretch of the trail.

399
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:01.820
You,

400
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.280
you know,

401
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.060
if you've ever been out to camping,

402
00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:04.721
you get up early,

403
00:13:04.721 --> 00:13:05.171
early in the,

404
00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:05.551
and the,

405
00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:09.340
the dust of a camp site is still moistened with the do when you step out of your

406
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:10.600
tent and everything sticks to your foot.

407
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.630
Those were the kind of footprints that we found on the trail.

408
00:13:13.631 --> 00:13:14.464
One morning.

409
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.710
They were just as clear as it could be something with let's 16 inch foot,

410
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.190
five toes had stepped in that,

411
00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:20.560
uh,

412
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.390
that do laden dust and it just lifted up a perfect to outline of a footprint now

413
00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:26.530
as a big foot freak.

414
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:26.830
Yeah.

415
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:27.940
What was that like for you?

416
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.440
This is like your first piece of evidence.

417
00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:30.880
You're stumbling upon it yourself.

418
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:31.570
That's right.

419
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:31.870
Yeah.

420
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:32.051
Well,

421
00:13:32.051 --> 00:13:32.890
it was freaking out.

422
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:33.460
No,

423
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:33.641
no.

424
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:34.330
I mean it was,

425
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.163
it was confirming.

426
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:36.281
Yeah,

427
00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:37.540
me too well at that,

428
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.190
but by that time,

429
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.440
yeah,

430
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.440
there were moments we'd been in the woods already for over four weeks and so we

431
00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:47.170
had kind of gotten to the point,

432
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:47.800
uh,

433
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:47.981
you know,

434
00:13:47.981 --> 00:13:52.840
you have to sort of steel yourself against that natural fear reaction to those

435
00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:53.770
circumstances.

436
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:54.810
Right.

437
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:59.040
<v 3>I think this is something that a lot of big foot hunters assume,</v>

438
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:04.460
which is that big foot is sweet or big foot's this harmless being that's out

439
00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:08.880
there picking flowers and printing his footprints in the do.

440
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.620
This could be a killer.

441
00:14:10.621 --> 00:14:14.250
This thing could be a deadly angry,

442
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:15.690
tired,

443
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.460
bitter old jungle ape.

444
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.360
Aren't you worried the,

445
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:20.960
in your quest for bigfoot,

446
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.830
you actually might find him?

447
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:23.930
<v 2>Well,</v>

448
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:24.360
uh,

449
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:24.900
uh,

450
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.110
find one of them to,

451
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:26.370
you know,

452
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.020
let's make it clear.

453
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:27.870
There's more than one.

454
00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:28.051
Yeah.

455
00:14:28.051 --> 00:14:29.900
This is not one loan monster Roman.

456
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.510
That's right.

457
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.100
Yeah,

458
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:31.440
but,

459
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.273
but,

460
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:33.510
but you're,

461
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.950
but your points we'll take in,

462
00:14:34.951 --> 00:14:36.180
I mean clearly this,

463
00:14:36.181 --> 00:14:36.710
this,

464
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.381
if it exists,

465
00:14:37.381 --> 00:14:38.131
this is a large,

466
00:14:38.131 --> 00:14:38.821
powerful,

467
00:14:38.821 --> 00:14:40.580
potentially dangerous animal.

468
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.910
Yeah.

469
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.030
It should be shown deference,

470
00:14:42.031 --> 00:14:42.721
but I mean,

471
00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:44.270
if they were killers know,

472
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.300
like grizzly bears,

473
00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:48.960
they would have been hunted to extinction just like grizzlies were in the lower

474
00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:50.490
48 for quite a period of time.

475
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.160
There really isn't.

476
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.770
The only stories you hear about,

477
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.350
uh,

478
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.580
uh,

479
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.690
antagonistic,

480
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:57.543
uh,

481
00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.200
uh,

482
00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:58.580
uh,

483
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.810
behavior towards humans is usually precipitated when the humans have shot at

484
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:03.200
them.

485
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:03.500
They've,

486
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.550
they've started the coral,

487
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.740
but otherwise they seem to be,

488
00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:06.861
you know,

489
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:07.521
it's just like with,

490
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:08.150
um,

491
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.983
with gorillas,

492
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:13.490
gorillas were build by Barnum and Bailey is the most terrifying creature on the

493
00:15:13.491 --> 00:15:14.324
face of the planet.

494
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.950
But now were they cry?

495
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.480
They're considered the gentle giants,

496
00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:17.781
you know,

497
00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:18.021
the,

498
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:18.350
the,

499
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.771
the,

500
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:18.891
uh,

501
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:22.090
the vicar of the endangered a imperiled trucks,

502
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.983
<v 0>good for us.</v>

503
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:23.310
Right.

504
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.761
The,

505
00:15:23.761 --> 00:15:26.400
the predatory primary to the ones that the most dangerous,

506
00:15:26.401 --> 00:15:26.701
right.

507
00:15:26.701 --> 00:15:29.910
Like chimpanzees are more dangerous than gorillas because they're predatory.

508
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.510
True.

509
00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:31.230
Yeah.

510
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.900
This apparently what the law is,

511
00:15:33.901 --> 00:15:34.681
what people believe,

512
00:15:34.681 --> 00:15:37.410
at least is that if Sasquatch is a real thing,

513
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:38.760
it eats animals,

514
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.910
probably eats elk and it probably falls elk migration.

515
00:15:41.911 --> 00:15:42.510
Sure.

516
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:42.810
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

517
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:43.051
So,

518
00:15:43.051 --> 00:15:44.250
so there is always that risk.

519
00:15:44.251 --> 00:15:44.900
I mean,

520
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:45.210
you know,

521
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.710
anyone who's going out in the woods should,

522
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:47.460
should use,

523
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.150
do,

524
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.980
do caution.

525
00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:49.160
<v 0>No,</v>

526
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:49.401
I mean,

527
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:50.540
people eat people.

528
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.490
Exactly.

529
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.320
You Paki do you pack heat?

530
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.800
It depends on the surface that it's not,

531
00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.030
not for the doctor.

532
00:15:56.031 --> 00:15:57.200
Dooney carries a gun.

533
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.250
How dare you?

534
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.720
He's about to say pack seat.

535
00:15:59.750 --> 00:15:59.901
Oh,

536
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:00.734
sure.

537
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.671
No,

538
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:02.061
it wouldn't.

539
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:02.570
When we're in the car

540
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:02.960
<v 2>field,</v>

541
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.120
I mean we're in areas where there,

542
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.900
where there are grizzly bears where there's cougar,

543
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.191
you know,

544
00:16:06.191 --> 00:16:07.070
northern California,

545
00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:10.310
they've got lots of issues with,

546
00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:10.520
uh,

547
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.830
with cougars preying on or attacking people.

548
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.300
Cougars were personal security should be something.

549
00:16:15.301 --> 00:16:15.490
Yeah,

550
00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:15.830
<v 0>Kuvan.</v>

551
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.730
I know Joe Pepper spray to pepper spray and I'll thick jacket,

552
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:21.420
just cougars you want,

553
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.070
you want some,

554
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:22.341
some,

555
00:16:22.341 --> 00:16:23.270
a lot of protection.

556
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.770
I prefer 10 millimeters so that to son and get some Kevlar,

557
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.833
maybe a sword.

558
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.001
<v 3>Well,</v>

559
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:32.450
what a predicament you're putting yourself in because let's say you do run into

560
00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:34.970
a tribe of these things and they've,

561
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.020
they're smart enough to know that they can't be discovered.

562
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:44.021
You've got to decide between not getting ripped to shreds by these big foot or

563
00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:47.350
blasting them into oblivion.

564
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:47.840
Sure.

565
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.673
Why do you pick?

566
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:49.721
<v 2>Well,</v>

567
00:16:49.721 --> 00:16:50.501
that's a good question.

568
00:16:50.501 --> 00:16:50.681
I mean,

569
00:16:50.681 --> 00:16:51.430
it's a,

570
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.640
I hate to speculate too much on a what if scenario.

571
00:16:54.641 --> 00:16:58.790
I don't think that they're in tribal social organizations or,

572
00:16:58.791 --> 00:17:00.490
or that they are that intelligent.

573
00:17:00.491 --> 00:17:00.671
I mean,

574
00:17:00.671 --> 00:17:01.504
I think we're,

575
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.410
we're dealing with,

576
00:17:02.411 --> 00:17:02.770
uh,

577
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:03.011
you know,

578
00:17:03.011 --> 00:17:03.640
at least,

579
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.450
uh,

580
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:08.080
a large prime made a large Ayp and at most,

581
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:08.341
uh,

582
00:17:08.341 --> 00:17:09.010
a very,

583
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:09.580
uh,

584
00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.710
early off shoot of the Hominid radiation that,

585
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.410
you know,

586
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.820
has intelligence that's not much higher than that of a chimp or a gorilla.

587
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:16.840
Um,

588
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.210
I just have no experience to back up anything beyond that.

589
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.170
<v 0>If I could let you pick a toe,</v>

590
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:28.770
any tow tow and we hacked that sucker off and then immediately take you to big

591
00:17:29.001 --> 00:17:29.560
foot,

592
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.690
my camera's crew.

593
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.740
Whole deal.

594
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.180
You get to see Sasquatch,

595
00:17:34.181 --> 00:17:35.380
a whole sound squash family.

596
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.800
Yeah.

597
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.611
Do you accept that?

598
00:17:36.611 --> 00:17:39.610
Do you hack off the toe to meet Sasquatch and know for sure.

599
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.350
I could probably get by without a pinky.

600
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.880
Oh my goodness.

601
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.050
You got a bad,

602
00:17:44.051 --> 00:17:44.470
sir.

603
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.300
I know you're ready to chop off toes.

604
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:47.670
I'll chop off my toe,

605
00:17:47.671 --> 00:17:49.000
throw my pinky end of the time.

606
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.710
You really,

607
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:50.511
absolutely.

608
00:17:50.511 --> 00:17:51.630
I love my pinkies.

609
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.221
We're not going to do that.

610
00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:53.910
What's it for?

611
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:54.420
What does it,

612
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.140
what does it do?

613
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:55.973
What is a painter?

614
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.780
She move around your freak.

615
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.710
I wouldn't barely wiggles to the left.

616
00:18:01.711 --> 00:18:04.620
And when it pushes off and helps you stabilize the Pinky Taupe?

617
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.070
Yes.

618
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.480
Is there for a reason early at Vienna sausage,

619
00:18:07.481 --> 00:18:08.320
it's like this.

620
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.080
Maybe as mine's very active.

621
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.460
It's hard to,

622
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:12.920
hard to clip that little nail.

623
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:15.510
Oh my goodness.

624
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.340
You guys are both sick.

625
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.750
How dare you?

626
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.430
It's tempting though.

627
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.970
You would transform human history with this video.

628
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.661
I want my toes,

629
00:18:24.661 --> 00:18:25.494
dude.

630
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:27.563
Discussion over.

631
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:28.723
Not shopping,

632
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:32.221
but it's a little,

633
00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:35.040
it's a valid question because I mean a guy like you who's been studying this for

634
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:36.000
how many decades now?

635
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.380
Nearly two decades.

636
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.370
Nearly two decades.

637
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:40.170
Think about all that time and effort

638
00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:41.890
<v 2>just to see it.</v>

639
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.440
But it's been a great ride.

640
00:18:44.441 --> 00:18:45.274
I mean,

641
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:45.800
you know,

642
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.290
I've got to see places on this planet and see some of the most beautiful

643
00:18:50.291 --> 00:18:53.620
landscapes and terrains and meet all kinds of interesting people.

644
00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.030
So it's been a,

645
00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.200
it's been an interesting experience.

646
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:56.661
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

647
00:18:56.661 --> 00:18:57.620
As we talked to one,

648
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:58.760
a Sasquatch hunter,

649
00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.660
what he said was that even if he doesn't find tasks,

650
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:01.890
<v 2>watch,</v>

651
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:02.723
she's still camping.

652
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.370
Oh sure.

653
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:03.790
Join him.

654
00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:04.970
I'll exactly on those.

655
00:19:04.971 --> 00:19:05.780
Tell people,

656
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:06.340
you know,

657
00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.050
cultivating an appreciation for natural history,

658
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.190
enjoying the outdoors.

659
00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.320
Because it's like me with fishing,

660
00:19:12.321 --> 00:19:14.300
if I don't catch a fish in the first five minutes,

661
00:19:14.301 --> 00:19:15.890
I'll start to lose interest pretty soon.

662
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.450
And if you're that way,

663
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.880
chances of you catching a fish or having a Sasquatch experience in the first

664
00:19:22.881 --> 00:19:23.270
weekend,

665
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.671
you go out,

666
00:19:23.671 --> 00:19:24.504
it's pretty slim.

667
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:25.760
So enjoy what you're doing.

668
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.600
You,

669
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.630
you mentioned that these creatures throw rocks.

670
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.480
How big are their oxidate?

671
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.331
Well,

672
00:19:32.331 --> 00:19:33.770
in my experience,

673
00:19:33.771 --> 00:19:34.160
uh,

674
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.810
when we were there in the Siskey use,

675
00:19:35.811 --> 00:19:36.170
uh,

676
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:36.711
we had,

677
00:19:36.711 --> 00:19:38.390
it was about a softball size drunk.

678
00:19:38.391 --> 00:19:38.601
I mean,

679
00:19:38.601 --> 00:19:40.220
if you want it to cold cocked me,

680
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.570
it could have probably,

681
00:19:41.571 --> 00:19:42.560
but I think it was more of a,

682
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.330
I got the impression it was just,

683
00:19:44.331 --> 00:19:44.870
uh,

684
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.240
letting me know that we were close.

685
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.781
And,

686
00:19:47.781 --> 00:19:48.380
uh,

687
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.700
I got the sensation in fact,

688
00:19:49.701 --> 00:19:53.570
that we had stopped to take a break at a spot that was on,

689
00:19:53.571 --> 00:19:54.230
uh,

690
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.580
one of the pathways that they fall.

691
00:19:55.581 --> 00:19:57.170
It was where we had found that the footprints,

692
00:19:57.171 --> 00:19:57.621
the first,

693
00:19:57.621 --> 00:19:58.454
the first go,

694
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.710
the Siskey use in north,

695
00:20:00.711 --> 00:20:01.940
in northern California,

696
00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.030
six rivers national forest and Siskiyou wilderness.

697
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:05.791
<v 0>So the,</v>

698
00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:07.890
the primary theory when it comes,

699
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:08.470
what's tomorrow?

700
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:09.950
<v 2>Scoot just a little tear.</v>

701
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.241
Right?

702
00:20:10.241 --> 00:20:10.580
There you go.

703
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.150
Perfect.

704
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:11.860
Sorry.

705
00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:12.693
Sorry.

706
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:17.930
<v 0>So is the primary theory about Sasquatch is that it was something along the</v>

707
00:20:18.391 --> 00:20:22.590
lines of a gigantic pikas that was in Asia came down the Bering strait with

708
00:20:22.591 --> 00:20:24.330
humans and that's why there's so many of them.

709
00:20:24.331 --> 00:20:28.080
Habiting the dense rain forest of the Pacific northwest that had just found it

710
00:20:28.081 --> 00:20:29.100
to be ideal habitat.

711
00:20:29.101 --> 00:20:29.934
So just stayed there.

712
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:30.191
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

713
00:20:30.191 --> 00:20:30.581
that's,

714
00:20:30.581 --> 00:20:31.420
that's one model.

715
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.500
I mean in gigantic mythic issue have a primate that's the right size and the

716
00:20:35.501 --> 00:20:39.760
right place at the right time to have expanded its range over the Bering land

717
00:20:39.761 --> 00:20:40.091
bridge.

718
00:20:40.091 --> 00:20:43.450
And there were times when that land bridge was a corridor of forest,

719
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:43.810
not,

720
00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.920
not an Arctic Tundra.

721
00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.070
So it wasn't like they were migrating,

722
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.490
they were just expanding the range.

723
00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:50.370
I mean each generation would expand into the available.

724
00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:53.180
<v 0>So from Asia all the way in North America was for us at one point in time</v>

725
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:53.821
<v 2>times.</v>

726
00:20:53.821 --> 00:20:54.091
Yeah.

727
00:20:54.091 --> 00:20:54.924
Off and on.

728
00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:55.830
It wasn't all was,

729
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.270
uh,

730
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.091
ice locked.

731
00:20:57.091 --> 00:20:57.924
And so,

732
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.361
uh,

733
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:01.860
and that would have proceeded probably the time that humans came.

734
00:21:01.861 --> 00:21:06.780
So they were probably here before native Americans are Paleo Indians arrived in

735
00:21:06.781 --> 00:21:07.650
North American.

736
00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.790
<v 0>There's a lot of speculation as to how intelligent it is.</v>

737
00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:12.510
You seem to think it's very apelike,

738
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.120
but I've talked to other folks and thank you.

739
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.070
It's almost a human right then.

740
00:21:16.071 --> 00:21:18.470
It's like something in between us and a chimpanzee.

741
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:19.080
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

742
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.900
Well a lot of those people who attribute to,

743
00:21:21.901 --> 00:21:22.350
you know,

744
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.750
primal people or some kind of primitive human,

745
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:25.590
um,

746
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.240
often also attribute,

747
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:27.480
uh,

748
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.840
various paranormal qualities there in psychic communication.

749
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.150
They're being taught by them,

750
00:21:33.151 --> 00:21:33.361
you know,

751
00:21:33.361 --> 00:21:35.820
this ancient wisdom and et cetera.

752
00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:36.540
And,

753
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:36.960
um,

754
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.410
you know,

755
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:42.410
I don't have any personal experience upon which to evaluate those kinds of

756
00:21:43.081 --> 00:21:43.550
subjects.

757
00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.320
<v 0>How very respectful of you that was so scientific.</v>

758
00:21:46.321 --> 00:21:51.060
That was a nice way to say they're fucking crazy as scientist because you're

759
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.903
learning.

760
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.851
So yeah,

761
00:21:53.851 --> 00:21:54.840
it is a weird thing,

762
00:21:54.841 --> 00:21:55.261
isn't it?

763
00:21:55.261 --> 00:21:55.540
That it,

764
00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:00.540
it falls into that Crystal's channeling energy thing oftentimes gives me Agida I

765
00:22:03.811 --> 00:22:06.990
got to get out of the room when someone starts talking energy and crystals.

766
00:22:06.991 --> 00:22:07.460
I really,

767
00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:07.720
it's,

768
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.553
it's,

769
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:09.810
I'm allergic to it.

770
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.270
We had it yesterday.

771
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.390
Someone started talking about the energy in a safe zone,

772
00:22:15.391 --> 00:22:16.141
safe space.

773
00:22:16.141 --> 00:22:16.441
I was like,

774
00:22:16.441 --> 00:22:17.040
yeah,

775
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:17.851
I gotta get Outta here.

776
00:22:17.851 --> 00:22:18.070
Yeah.

777
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.180
Yeah.

778
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.520
It's like immediately I feel like I'm threatened.

779
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.840
My sanity is threatened.

780
00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:23.940
I might get sucked in your stupid vortex.

781
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:24.530
Oh,

782
00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:25.363
come one of you.

783
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.041
<v 3>Why is that?</v>

784
00:22:26.041 --> 00:22:26.760
Why,

785
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.420
why do you think big foot is aloone magnet?

786
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.960
Do you think it's because when you have people searching up for other things

787
00:22:33.961 --> 00:22:38.580
like butterflies that they theorize that might exist or other undiscovered

788
00:22:38.581 --> 00:22:39.414
species,

789
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.700
they haven't gone completely mad.

790
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.250
But for some reason a lot of these big foot hunters,

791
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:48.120
it seems like they've lost their mind in this pursuit.

792
00:22:48.121 --> 00:22:48.420
Why?

793
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.290
Why do you think that is?

794
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:49.681
<v 2>Well,</v>

795
00:22:49.681 --> 00:22:50.940
I think part of it is that,

796
00:22:50.941 --> 00:22:51.390
um,

797
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:51.720
uh,

798
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.051
when,

799
00:22:52.051 --> 00:22:55.920
when big foot sort of fell into the lap of academia back in,

800
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:56.191
well,

801
00:22:56.191 --> 00:22:58.230
it was coincident with the Patterson Gimlin film.

802
00:22:58.231 --> 00:22:58.591
Essentially.

803
00:22:58.591 --> 00:23:00.750
That's when it was thrust under the nose of,

804
00:23:00.751 --> 00:23:00.991
of,

805
00:23:00.991 --> 00:23:01.110
of,

806
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.070
of science,

807
00:23:02.071 --> 00:23:03.090
the scientific community.

808
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:04.950
Before that it was just a bunch of,

809
00:23:04.951 --> 00:23:05.120
uh,

810
00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:05.370
you know,

811
00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.900
loggers stories and foresters stories coming out of the,

812
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:13.380
the northern woods of British Columbia or northern California,

813
00:23:13.381 --> 00:23:14.880
which was still really wild back then.

814
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.373
Um,

815
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.830
it,

816
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.830
it came at a time that preceded a lot of what we understand now about,

817
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.090
uh,

818
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.720
early human evolution and a great ape natural history.

819
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.490
And it was just,

820
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.620
there was no place to put it.

821
00:23:31.621 --> 00:23:33.390
There was no pigeon to stick this in.

822
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.220
And so it was rejected by the scientific community and then that vacuum came the

823
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.720
amateur fortune seekers or enthusiasts or you know,

824
00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:44.670
those that thought it was left here by a,

825
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:50.360
or traveling through interdimensional portals or any type of explanation as to

826
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:51.980
why we aren't finding them.

827
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:54.200
What makes them different from other common wildlife?

828
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.990
<v 0>I think what it is is that there's,</v>

829
00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.670
there's first of all,

830
00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:01.330
I think there's two different types of people that get attracted to like really

831
00:24:01.331 --> 00:24:02.900
following up on,

832
00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:03.701
on Sasquatch.

833
00:24:03.701 --> 00:24:05.140
And one of them is the loons.

834
00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.500
One of them is the people that if it wasn't there,

835
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.130
if they weren't looking for Sasquatch,

836
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.380
they would be looking to remote view or they'd be looking to find out the cause

837
00:24:13.381 --> 00:24:14.520
of chem trails or the,

838
00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:15.840
they would just fall,

839
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.130
they would find some mystery and lock onto it.

840
00:24:18.131 --> 00:24:18.520
Sure.

841
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.520
The other one is courageous people who aren't afraid of looking like kooks

842
00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.510
because like yourself,

843
00:24:25.511 --> 00:24:27.190
I think you look at it,

844
00:24:27.191 --> 00:24:28.870
you're obviously a very intelligent man.

845
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.280
You,

846
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:29.681
you are,

847
00:24:29.681 --> 00:24:30.790
you're an anthropologist,

848
00:24:30.791 --> 00:24:31.720
you're a professor,

849
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:32.261
you know,

850
00:24:32.261 --> 00:24:33.370
you know what you're talking about.

851
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.600
You look at this and he'd go,

852
00:24:34.601 --> 00:24:35.380
you know what?

853
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:35.980
Um,

854
00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.330
I don't think I can dismiss this.

855
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.021
You know what?

856
00:24:38.021 --> 00:24:39.130
I think there might be something here.

857
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:39.670
Right,

858
00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:40.090
right.

859
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.680
Even though it sounds crazy to say it.

860
00:24:41.681 --> 00:24:42.670
I'm sorry guys.

861
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.950
This is why there might be something here.

862
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:45.460
That's right.

863
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:45.970
What is it?

864
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:49.450
What's the most compelling piece of evidence if you were trying to convince a

865
00:24:49.451 --> 00:24:50.170
person,

866
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.060
if a person was on the fence and they were like,

867
00:24:52.061 --> 00:24:52.241
well,

868
00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:53.110
she's talked to him,

869
00:24:53.111 --> 00:24:53.471
Belgium.

870
00:24:53.471 --> 00:24:53.921
I don't know.

871
00:24:53.921 --> 00:24:55.750
I mean he seemed like a normal guy.

872
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:57.820
I'm really big foot.

873
00:24:57.821 --> 00:24:58.031
Like,

874
00:24:58.031 --> 00:24:58.990
tell me in,

875
00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.940
in a paragraph what's the most compelling piece of it?

876
00:25:01.941 --> 00:25:02.050
Yeah.

877
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:02.470
<v 2>Nice.</v>

878
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.801
Well,

879
00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:03.221
for me,

880
00:25:03.221 --> 00:25:03.551
again,

881
00:25:03.551 --> 00:25:05.290
from my point of expertise,

882
00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.430
it's the footprint evidence.

883
00:25:06.431 --> 00:25:08.520
That's what drew me into this because my,

884
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.260
my study of the evolution of human bipedalism,

885
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.670
uh,

886
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:14.261
prepared me,

887
00:25:14.261 --> 00:25:14.801
I guess you'd say.

888
00:25:14.801 --> 00:25:15.041
I mean,

889
00:25:15.041 --> 00:25:15.580
why,

890
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.820
why wouldn't I be fascinated by the possibility that there's another bike ped

891
00:25:18.821 --> 00:25:19.654
out there?

892
00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:19.841
I mean,

893
00:25:19.841 --> 00:25:23.260
it's a perfect natural experiment to against which to compare and contrast our

894
00:25:23.261 --> 00:25:25.300
own adaptation for walking on two legs,

895
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:29.170
which is otherwise considered to be unique amongst primates.

896
00:25:29.171 --> 00:25:29.830
And so

897
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.960
<v 0>was gigantic ethic is thought to be bipedal or is that</v>

898
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:33.600
<v 2>bait?</v>

899
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.433
It's in debate.

900
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.700
Grover Krantz made some arguments based on the,

901
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.000
the shape of the jaw,

902
00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:40.050
given the breadth,

903
00:25:40.051 --> 00:25:41.160
the angle of the jaw.

904
00:25:41.161 --> 00:25:45.300
Is that supposed to be a gigantic good chat is that's one of the two of the

905
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.000
examples of the largest species of gigantic Pythagoras,

906
00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.410
Blackie Yam and heard of it,

907
00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:51.900
but yeah.

908
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.380
Yeah.

909
00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.010
Well yeah,

910
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:53.843
those are massive,

911
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.240
massive Maulers apps.

912
00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:56.520
Yeah,

913
00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.353
absolutely.

914
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.160
Gigantic ethic is blackie.

915
00:26:01.161 --> 00:26:01.301
Yeah.

916
00:26:01.301 --> 00:26:02.760
After the discover,

917
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.050
how rude.

918
00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:05.883
Yeah,

919
00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:06.890
that's what,

920
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:07.530
that's his name.

921
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:07.860
Well,

922
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.191
the,

923
00:26:08.191 --> 00:26:08.341
uh,

924
00:26:08.341 --> 00:26:11.010
the thought is that they look more Orangutang liked and gorilla,

925
00:26:11.011 --> 00:26:11.844
is that correct?

926
00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:12.500
Well,

927
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.333
again,

928
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.250
speculation,

929
00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:14.881
speculation,

930
00:26:14.881 --> 00:26:16.410
because they're found in Asia,

931
00:26:16.411 --> 00:26:19.380
they're part of what we call the Shiva pithy seen radiation,

932
00:26:19.381 --> 00:26:24.381
the thicker enameled apes of which orangutan is the only relic species in

933
00:26:25.321 --> 00:26:26.400
existence today.

934
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:27.240
Uh,

935
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.290
but again,

936
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.580
there's no way to know.

937
00:26:29.581 --> 00:26:30.414
I mean,

938
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.350
gorillas and chimps are closely related and yet their skulls look quite

939
00:26:34.351 --> 00:26:35.940
different from one another in many ways.

940
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.240
<v 0>So the foot,</v>

941
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.700
the foot print evidence is in your opinion,

942
00:26:39.701 --> 00:26:40.630
the best evidence.

943
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:41.020
Right.

944
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:41.321
And,

945
00:26:41.321 --> 00:26:41.780
uh,

946
00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:42.340
the,

947
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.350
this one that have,

948
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:44.640
we both have the same one,

949
00:26:44.641 --> 00:26:44.791
right.

950
00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:46.620
What is the origin of this footprint?

951
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.770
<v 2>This was cast by a deputy sheriff by the name of Dennis Hereford in the 80s in</v>

952
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:51.910
Grace Harbor County,

953
00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.780
Washington state.

954
00:26:52.781 --> 00:26:54.820
So over at the base of the Olympic peninsula.

955
00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:56.021
And,

956
00:26:56.021 --> 00:26:56.290
uh,

957
00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:56.711
he,

958
00:26:56.711 --> 00:26:56.830
uh,

959
00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.220
was responded to report of a disturbance at a construction site and they're on

960
00:27:00.221 --> 00:27:00.870
that,

961
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:05.870
that spur road hard packed dirt with a layer of fine pulverize dust from the

962
00:27:06.281 --> 00:27:08.920
movements of the heavy machinery wet down by a rain,

963
00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:09.970
uh,

964
00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:11.950
left this remarkably clear,

965
00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:13.090
uh,

966
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:13.690
imprint.

967
00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:13.871
The,

968
00:27:13.871 --> 00:27:17.770
these are actually desiccation cracks where that wet mud was beginning to dry in

969
00:27:17.771 --> 00:27:19.390
the sun and shrink and crack.

970
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:23.770
But the extrusion of the mud around the footprint and between the toes and all

971
00:27:23.771 --> 00:27:24.670
left a very,

972
00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:25.750
uh,

973
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:26.650
very striking,

974
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.810
a facsimile of,

975
00:27:27.811 --> 00:27:28.644
of that foot.

976
00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.980
It seems so uniform.

977
00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.190
That's where I start to get well skeptical again,

978
00:27:33.191 --> 00:27:33.341
it's,

979
00:27:33.341 --> 00:27:34.210
it's the remarkable,

980
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:34.451
uh,

981
00:27:34.451 --> 00:27:35.560
conditions when,

982
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:35.870
you know,

983
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:37.420
there were photographs of,

984
00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:37.920
of a,

985
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.240
a number of footprints at that site,

986
00:27:40.241 --> 00:27:41.530
including some interesting,

987
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:42.191
uh,

988
00:27:42.191 --> 00:27:45.010
what I refer to as half tracks that a,

989
00:27:45.011 --> 00:27:45.611
that terminate,

990
00:27:45.611 --> 00:27:46.060
I mean,

991
00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:46.361
the,

992
00:27:46.361 --> 00:27:48.130
the details on here remarkable.

993
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.850
You can see what looks like the head and the base of the fifth metatarsal.

994
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.120
Maybe a little bit of arthritis or some kind of injury to the joints there.

995
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.960
Uh,

996
00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.770
this bolt right here then is the key though that that you have on the side of

997
00:27:59.771 --> 00:28:00.221
your foot.

998
00:28:00.221 --> 00:28:02.260
If you left a wet footprint on the cement,

999
00:28:02.261 --> 00:28:03.220
when you came out of the pool,

1000
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.290
you'd see that bulge and it's at the,

1001
00:28:05.291 --> 00:28:05.860
uh,

1002
00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.270
it's positioned at the,

1003
00:28:07.271 --> 00:28:09.730
what we call the cow Kaneohe cuboid joint,

1004
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.890
which is a right there.

1005
00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.690
Now in Apes,

1006
00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.201
the,

1007
00:28:14.201 --> 00:28:17.230
these two joints across here are much more flexible.

1008
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.600
They're adapted to climbing trees.

1009
00:28:19.601 --> 00:28:22.030
If this were a chimpanzee would look more like this,

1010
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.160
and when they're grasping that branch,

1011
00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:28.660
then you have to be able to lever the foot without disrupting the grip.

1012
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.801
We've,

1013
00:28:29.801 --> 00:28:30.071
we've,

1014
00:28:30.071 --> 00:28:33.850
we've changed that all together by relinquishing that grip and incorporating the

1015
00:28:33.851 --> 00:28:36.910
big toe into one stiff lever like this.

1016
00:28:36.911 --> 00:28:38.470
So the whole foot acts as a,

1017
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.700
as a mechanical lever,

1018
00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:41.470
but there's moves here.

1019
00:28:41.471 --> 00:28:46.471
Remarkably Sasquatch foot appears to have retained that,

1020
00:28:46.901 --> 00:28:47.734
uh,

1021
00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:48.071
uh,

1022
00:28:48.071 --> 00:28:49.930
that ape like degree of flexibility,

1023
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:51.041
which is actually pretty,

1024
00:28:51.041 --> 00:28:51.280
uh,

1025
00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:51.790
uh,

1026
00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.520
elegant adaptation to climbing the on very steep,

1027
00:28:54.521 --> 00:28:56.200
rugged mountainous terrain.

1028
00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:01.220
<v 0>What would be the evolutionary benefit of keeping off a human like foot as</v>

1029
00:29:01.221 --> 00:29:05.120
opposed to like a gorilla or a chimp where they can grab and climb with their

1030
00:29:05.121 --> 00:29:05.520
feet?

1031
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:05.911
<v 2>Well,</v>

1032
00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:07.200
when you're 800 pounds,

1033
00:29:07.201 --> 00:29:09.540
it's kind of dangerous to climb up into trees.

1034
00:29:09.541 --> 00:29:10.450
Besides what,

1035
00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.280
what would you look for up there that we don't have fruiting trees in the

1036
00:29:14.281 --> 00:29:15.350
coniferous forests.

1037
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.300
The fruit element of your diet is in the understory.

1038
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:19.320
The berries in the,

1039
00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:20.190
in the shrub layer.

1040
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.141
<v 0>So I've only,</v>

1041
00:29:21.141 --> 00:29:23.030
I've heard a couple of people say they climb trees.

1042
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:23.890
You think that's who he is?

1043
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:24.130
Well,

1044
00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:25.030
<v 2>it's probably,</v>

1045
00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:25.600
uh,

1046
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.010
juveniles maybe to,

1047
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:27.440
you know,

1048
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.030
put in a youngster up in a tree in order to get it to away from potential

1049
00:29:31.031 --> 00:29:32.890
predators if you're parking it there while you,

1050
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:33.231
while you,

1051
00:29:33.231 --> 00:29:34.990
while you're off foraging for example.

1052
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:36.101
But no,

1053
00:29:36.101 --> 00:29:36.551
I don't think,

1054
00:29:36.551 --> 00:29:36.761
I mean,

1055
00:29:36.761 --> 00:29:40.780
just as large male gorillas don't spend much time climbing up in the,

1056
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.570
because of fall even,

1057
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.140
you know,

1058
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:48.820
even for humans to fall from 10 feet can be fatal if you're experienced rock

1059
00:29:48.821 --> 00:29:49.181
climber.

1060
00:29:49.181 --> 00:29:49.660
Yeah.

1061
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.870
<v 4>It seems like if you wanted to fake that,</v>

1062
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:57.320
you would have to have a very advanced understanding of gorillas from you.

1063
00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:00.450
If you are going to draw that thing and spend the time doing it,

1064
00:30:00.451 --> 00:30:04.920
you'd have to have a deep understanding of your really shitty and making a fake

1065
00:30:04.921 --> 00:30:09.270
foot and you just got lucky incorporated something that looks remarkably similar

1066
00:30:09.271 --> 00:30:10.680
to that metatarsal brick.

1067
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:11.731
I don't know.

1068
00:30:11.731 --> 00:30:12.421
That's a pretty,

1069
00:30:12.421 --> 00:30:13.320
that's good luck.

1070
00:30:13.321 --> 00:30:16.530
I would never throw an accidental metal metatarsal break.

1071
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:17.551
That's not what it is.

1072
00:30:17.551 --> 00:30:18.470
And metatarsal breaker bar.

1073
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:18.960
Make that up.

1074
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.171
No,

1075
00:30:19.171 --> 00:30:19.940
that's right.

1076
00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.470
Yeah.

1077
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.070
How are you going to accidentally draw a metatarsal break,

1078
00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:23.851
but at where,

1079
00:30:23.851 --> 00:30:25.510
where has calluses,

1080
00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:25.860
what?

1081
00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:29.250
It seems like its feet are kind of shave down or Fanuc.

1082
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:30.480
Beautiful.

1083
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.300
It's like he could it go to the beach right now.

1084
00:30:33.301 --> 00:30:36.630
He could go and lay out and people would think he had great feet.

1085
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:37.571
<v 2>Well,</v>

1086
00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:37.901
again,

1087
00:30:37.901 --> 00:30:38.081
the,

1088
00:30:38.081 --> 00:30:38.381
the,

1089
00:30:38.381 --> 00:30:40.540
the conditions of that particular footprint,

1090
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:43.540
we're just really quite remarkable making it very clear imprint.

1091
00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:44.650
But um,

1092
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:45.040
you know,

1093
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:45.480
there,

1094
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:45.940
it's,

1095
00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.990
it's indicated that the sole pat is probably pretty substantial and pretty

1096
00:30:49.991 --> 00:30:50.411
thick.

1097
00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:54.130
We have some examples of them where they've stepped on rocks or stepped on other

1098
00:30:54.131 --> 00:30:56.230
obstructions in that Solo Pad,

1099
00:30:56.231 --> 00:31:00.850
that substantial sold pat is able to accommodate those intrusions quite,

1100
00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:01.210
uh,

1101
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.050
quite remarkably.

1102
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:02.721
But it,

1103
00:31:02.721 --> 00:31:03.010
it's,

1104
00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.210
it's the composite.

1105
00:31:04.211 --> 00:31:04.361
You know,

1106
00:31:04.361 --> 00:31:06.700
if you take one example and you look at it,

1107
00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:11.110
you can dissect it and criticize it and pick it apart and question it.

1108
00:31:11.111 --> 00:31:12.010
But when then you see,

1109
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:12.461
you know,

1110
00:31:12.461 --> 00:31:13.181
as you point out,

1111
00:31:13.181 --> 00:31:14.890
repeated appearances,

1112
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.120
not only showing,

1113
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:17.920
for example the midtarsal break,

1114
00:31:17.921 --> 00:31:18.131
but,

1115
00:31:18.131 --> 00:31:20.230
but these correlated half tracks that,

1116
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.010
uh,

1117
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:21.701
where they're running.

1118
00:31:21.701 --> 00:31:21.881
I mean,

1119
00:31:21.881 --> 00:31:22.091
when,

1120
00:31:22.091 --> 00:31:22.990
when we run,

1121
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.250
because of our stiff arch,

1122
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:24.700
we,

1123
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.010
if we're sprinting not having a,

1124
00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.660
not exhibiting a heel strike,

1125
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:32.080
we'll leave just an abbreviated footprint because we're up on the ball of our

1126
00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:32.860
foot.

1127
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.300
Since their foot's flexible,

1128
00:31:34.301 --> 00:31:34.990
when they run,

1129
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:36.650
they run like this and it,

1130
00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:39.640
and it imprints the entire four part of the foot.

1131
00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.391
So in other words,

1132
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:41.770
if this individual were running,

1133
00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.930
it's running track would look like that.

1134
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:45.760
And again,

1135
00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:45.891
so,

1136
00:31:45.891 --> 00:31:48.310
so that's the question I've often asked.

1137
00:31:48.311 --> 00:31:49.144
If this is a,

1138
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.330
if this is all just spurious convergences of,

1139
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:52.661
of,

1140
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:52.900
uh,

1141
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.111
you know,

1142
00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:56.500
would be hoaxers who's passing out the little black book,

1143
00:31:56.501 --> 00:31:58.210
giving instructions on how to fake a,

1144
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.850
how markably consistent uniform is that.

1145
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.140
It's all remarkable.

1146
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:03.071
Remarkably.

1147
00:32:03.071 --> 00:32:03.460
Yeah.

1148
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.410
Example after example after example.

1149
00:32:05.411 --> 00:32:05.591
I mean,

1150
00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:07.630
to the point that I took the,

1151
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.680
took the leap of,

1152
00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:08.980
uh,

1153
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.490
uh,

1154
00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:11.980
intellectual faith,

1155
00:32:11.981 --> 00:32:12.814
if you will,

1156
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.793
of uh,

1157
00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:14.643
uh,

1158
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.330
naming the footprints.

1159
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:21.360
There's a convention of taxonomy called Ecmo taxonomy that applies Linnaean

1160
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:26.491
classification schemes to trace evidence like footprints where the maker of the

1161
00:32:26.681 --> 00:32:27.820
footprint is unknown.

1162
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:29.380
And so,

1163
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:29.740
uh,

1164
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.340
we can now call these footprints a published peer reviewed,

1165
00:32:33.341 --> 00:32:33.730
uh,

1166
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:34.563
the name,

1167
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:35.201
uh,

1168
00:32:35.201 --> 00:32:37.330
anthropoid a Pez Amera Borealis,

1169
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:39.130
which is North American eight foot.

1170
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.213
Hmm.

1171
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:45.200
<v 5>And how silly would that be if it's all fake though whole would be beautiful</v>

1172
00:32:45.201 --> 00:32:46.310
sounding Latin name.

1173
00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.280
It's going to be hard to prove that something that doesn't exist though.

1174
00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:49.670
Well,

1175
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:50.503
I guess so,

1176
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:51.950
but that's not what science is all about,

1177
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:52.151
right?

1178
00:32:52.151 --> 00:32:52.510
It's special.

1179
00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:56.180
It's not proving it's things to exist based on evidence based on the evidence.

1180
00:32:56.181 --> 00:32:56.841
And that's it.

1181
00:32:56.841 --> 00:32:58.280
It's based on the diagnosis,

1182
00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:58.410
uh,

1183
00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:58.670
that,

1184
00:32:58.670 --> 00:32:59.503
that,

1185
00:32:59.570 --> 00:32:59.871
uh,

1186
00:32:59.871 --> 00:33:01.580
of distinguishing characteristics.

1187
00:33:01.581 --> 00:33:05.150
These are not just facsimiles of enlarge human footprints.

1188
00:33:05.151 --> 00:33:05.600
Like,

1189
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.740
like this example,

1190
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:07.521
you know,

1191
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:08.990
this is actually pretty large.

1192
00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:09.290
Uh,

1193
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:13.550
this would represent an individual with a foot is probably in the upper 1% of

1194
00:33:13.551 --> 00:33:14.630
the human population.

1195
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.190
Have you ever seen skill and Neil shoe?

1196
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:16.701
No,

1197
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:17.121
I haven't.

1198
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:17.990
I've always wanted to do that.

1199
00:33:17.991 --> 00:33:18.501
A photo.

1200
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:19.910
I got to remember to get it to you guys.

1201
00:33:19.911 --> 00:33:21.050
It's a picture of me,

1202
00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:23.120
my face next to Shaquille O'Neal's shoe.

1203
00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.660
It's bigger than my entire head.

1204
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:25.543
Yeah.

1205
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:26.331
I'm not kidding.

1206
00:33:26.331 --> 00:33:27.164
It's bigger than this.

1207
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.980
Yup.

1208
00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:28.610
Totally.

1209
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:29.490
Totally bigger than that.

1210
00:33:29.491 --> 00:33:30.590
So she kalo Neil,

1211
00:33:30.591 --> 00:33:31.390
if he wanted to,

1212
00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:32.900
it could be the greatest big foot,

1213
00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:34.743
big foot.

1214
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.031
I mean,

1215
00:33:35.031 --> 00:33:36.410
if he went and wandered through the woods,

1216
00:33:36.411 --> 00:33:37.550
he's seven feet tall.

1217
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.490
He's more than 300 pounds.

1218
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.020
Yeah.

1219
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.110
He's just slap some fur on him,

1220
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.540
put his foot up the same kind of bend.

1221
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:45.111
No,

1222
00:33:45.111 --> 00:33:45.590
it wouldn't.

1223
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:46.423
That's the thing.

1224
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:50.100
Even even as large as his foot is and it's not,

1225
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.720
it would probably not be in a,

1226
00:33:52.721 --> 00:33:56.300
and I don't have his metrics to say this with the certitude,

1227
00:33:56.301 --> 00:34:01.250
but I would predict that his foot is not as wide as as this imprint.

1228
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:02.360
Most likely.

1229
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:02.730
Yeah.

1230
00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:02.980
Mosley,

1231
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.630
he doesn't have the mid tarsal but it doesn't have evidence of that.

1232
00:34:05.631 --> 00:34:07.490
He probably has probably been on him from the league.

1233
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.840
Last Sasquatch is cause if they ever did catch Sasquatch is and then they found

1234
00:34:12.841 --> 00:34:15.980
out the Sasquatches where people very similar to the neanderthals and they

1235
00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:17.150
wanted to start playing football,

1236
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:18.530
you'd have a real problem.

1237
00:34:18.531 --> 00:34:20.850
It would have been real problem with the problem.

1238
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:25.730
Football would be interesting for once they start banging all the white chicks,

1239
00:34:25.731 --> 00:34:26.564
first of all,

1240
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.210
why?

1241
00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:28.220
That'd be a huge problem.

1242
00:34:28.221 --> 00:34:29.600
You're going to have Sasquatch hybrids.

1243
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:31.520
The giant nine foot people,

1244
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:32.383
I'll take him.

1245
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:37.400
SASQUATCH is we'll want to enter into the UFC.

1246
00:34:37.401 --> 00:34:38.750
We'd have to make new weight classes.

1247
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:40.250
Everything gets better.

1248
00:34:40.251 --> 00:34:41.480
If you add a Sasquatch,

1249
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:42.560
I don't care what it is,

1250
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.480
they start showing up or set.

1251
00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.020
Now,

1252
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.270
gorillas are fairly intelligent.

1253
00:34:47.271 --> 00:34:48.680
Chimpanzees are intelligent,

1254
00:34:48.681 --> 00:34:50.500
dolphins are very intelligent.

1255
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.450
We have zero problem locking them up and swimming pools.

1256
00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:53.980
Sure.

1257
00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.120
If we did find a Sasquatch,

1258
00:34:56.121 --> 00:34:59.150
do you think because of the bipedal nature of it we there would,

1259
00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:02.150
it would probably be some pretty intense debate as to what to do with this

1260
00:35:02.151 --> 00:35:02.984
thing.

1261
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.531
Well,

1262
00:35:03.531 --> 00:35:08.531
are our humanity isn't defined by any one characteristic like bipedalism or

1263
00:35:08.991 --> 00:35:10.550
opposable thumbs or you know,

1264
00:35:10.551 --> 00:35:10.750
a,

1265
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:12.590
a non divergent big toe.

1266
00:35:12.591 --> 00:35:13.424
I mean it's,

1267
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.380
it's a composite of a,

1268
00:35:15.381 --> 00:35:17.030
of a number of characteristics.

1269
00:35:17.031 --> 00:35:17.700
And so,

1270
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.010
uh,

1271
00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:18.260
we're,

1272
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.150
we're beginning to understand that bipedalism,

1273
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.990
uh,

1274
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:25.040
was a characteristic of many different species of a very early Hominid and even

1275
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:25.821
some,

1276
00:35:25.821 --> 00:35:26.090
uh,

1277
00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.250
non Hominid ape species.

1278
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:29.781
So,

1279
00:35:29.781 --> 00:35:30.614
um,

1280
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.720
you don't think that it would be like people go like,

1281
00:35:32.721 --> 00:35:33.690
it's an man,

1282
00:35:33.691 --> 00:35:34.580
he's standing up straight.

1283
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:35.720
We can't put them in a zoo.

1284
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:36.230
Yeah.

1285
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.010
Well I'm sure there'll be some that will say that.

1286
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.480
<v 0>What did,</v>

1287
00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.380
what do you think they would do?

1288
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:40.760
What is your honest opinion?

1289
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:41.900
Would they detain him?

1290
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:44.660
Well they have to like let it hang out to him for a little while,

1291
00:35:44.661 --> 00:35:47.750
see if we can figure out his language or what if it's like killer whale.

1292
00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:49.450
Like he's just never figure out their language.

1293
00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:49.581
Like,

1294
00:35:49.581 --> 00:35:49.851
you know,

1295
00:35:49.851 --> 00:35:50.341
they're smart,

1296
00:35:50.341 --> 00:35:50.550
be like,

1297
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.950
I don't know what you're saying dude.

1298
00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.750
Eventually just let them loose.

1299
00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.251
<v 2>Well,</v>

1300
00:35:54.251 --> 00:35:54.461
sure.

1301
00:35:54.461 --> 00:35:54.611
The,

1302
00:35:54.611 --> 00:35:59.080
there'll be all kinds of ethical questions if we come to that point and what the

1303
00:35:59.081 --> 00:36:01.030
outcome will be.

1304
00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:01.150
Uh,

1305
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.391
you know,

1306
00:36:01.391 --> 00:36:02.620
it's really hard to predict.

1307
00:36:02.621 --> 00:36:02.771
I mean,

1308
00:36:02.771 --> 00:36:05.440
cause then you're not only dealing with the characteristics,

1309
00:36:05.441 --> 00:36:07.210
but you're dealing with human reaction,

1310
00:36:07.211 --> 00:36:08.230
human attitudes,

1311
00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:09.790
political agendas,

1312
00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:10.660
<v 0>whatever.</v>

1313
00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:10.871
Yeah.

1314
00:36:10.871 --> 00:36:12.070
I'm sorry to what if you to death

1315
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:14.450
<v 4>what Duncan and I do all day.</v>

1316
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:17.080
I think that's an important question.

1317
00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.870
I think when you're out there looking for this thing,

1318
00:36:19.871 --> 00:36:24.010
you do have to consider that your discovery of the thing might be the worst

1319
00:36:24.011 --> 00:36:25.810
thing that ever happened to Sasquatch.

1320
00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.580
You're his enemies.

1321
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1322
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:28.780
Well,

1323
00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:28.980
uh,

1324
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:29.350
you know,

1325
00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.640
that's been there had been suggested to me and brought up numerous times by

1326
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:33.750
various various people.

1327
00:36:33.751 --> 00:36:34.440
I,

1328
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:34.810
you know,

1329
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:35.191
and my,

1330
00:36:35.191 --> 00:36:37.800
one of my responses is simply the,

1331
00:36:37.801 --> 00:36:39.060
the formal recognition,

1332
00:36:39.061 --> 00:36:43.320
the discovery of the species isn't suddenly going to make it easy to go out and

1333
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:48.321
shoot a Sasquatch or to catch a Sasquatch is not going to change much at all.

1334
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.440
Uh,

1335
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:49.711
you know,

1336
00:36:49.711 --> 00:36:49.821
there,

1337
00:36:49.821 --> 00:36:50.041
there,

1338
00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.580
there's a study underway now to,

1339
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:55.250
to examine a extract an examine a DNA from,

1340
00:36:55.251 --> 00:36:58.530
from hair samples attributed to Sasquatch.

1341
00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.401
If,

1342
00:36:59.401 --> 00:36:59.640
uh,

1343
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.480
if that researcher,

1344
00:37:00.481 --> 00:37:02.460
Dr. Bryan Sykes from Oxford,

1345
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:06.990
if he discovers a novel sequence that confirms that there's a species out there,

1346
00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:07.860
we don't recognize,

1347
00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:09.650
it's not going to change that situation.

1348
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:11.640
We still won't know anything else about them.

1349
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:15.540
DNA will only tell us so much and they tell us about where it fits in the family

1350
00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:15.841
tree,

1351
00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:20.350
but not what it does on a daily basis or how intelligent it is.

1352
00:37:20.351 --> 00:37:20.630
Or

1353
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:21.860
<v 0>if I'm the president,</v>

1354
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:22.670
okay.

1355
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.040
And I come to you and I'm like,

1356
00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:25.491
doctor,

1357
00:37:25.491 --> 00:37:27.500
Meldrum enough is enough.

1358
00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.700
We need answers.

1359
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:32.420
We need a Sasquatch research team head up by you,

1360
00:37:32.421 --> 00:37:33.230
sir.

1361
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:34.610
Will you accept this position?

1362
00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.530
And you have unlimited resources to go find Sasquatch.

1363
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.633
What's your plan?

1364
00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:41.381
<v 2>Well,</v>

1365
00:37:41.381 --> 00:37:42.910
we've actually got an initiative.

1366
00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.380
Thank you for the segue there.

1367
00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:44.951
Uh,

1368
00:37:44.951 --> 00:37:48.100
it's entitled the Falcon Project and this is a,

1369
00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:49.440
<v 0>they're going to confuse people.</v>

1370
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:50.550
They're going to think you're looking for birds.

1371
00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:50.960
Well,

1372
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.793
when I called

1373
00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:52.653
<v 4>put project,</v>

1374
00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:58.080
why does it have to be just bad ass tobacco falconry project

1375
00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:01.060
<v 2>you,</v>

1376
00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:01.893
it doesn't cut it.

1377
00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:02.610
Um,

1378
00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:03.121
well the,

1379
00:38:03.121 --> 00:38:03.954
the,

1380
00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.440
the person who is the originator of this notion,

1381
00:38:07.441 --> 00:38:11.610
he picked that he tells me just because falcons fly high and see far and the

1382
00:38:11.611 --> 00:38:15.750
premise of this approach is to use lighter than air ships.

1383
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.940
The helium filled a durable,

1384
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:19.320
so it an unmanned drones,

1385
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.710
but with the capability of hovering,

1386
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:23.160
you know,

1387
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.060
and uh,

1388
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:25.790
and uh,

1389
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:29.490
doing a grid search pattern using the state of the art,

1390
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:30.090
uh,

1391
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:31.980
thermal imaging and high resolution,

1392
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.310
uh,

1393
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:35.320
videography and survey that way.

1394
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.430
Why a blimp

1395
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.731
<v 5>though?</v>

1396
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:40.090
I have balloon aside from the fact that it's incredible and I can't think of

1397
00:38:40.091 --> 00:38:43.990
anything more psychedelic than to release a balloon into the forest,

1398
00:38:43.991 --> 00:38:48.991
to look for bigfoot Zeplin music playing from one time project Falcon.

1399
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.200
So that would be the move balloons.

1400
00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.010
I think this is a not,

1401
00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:55.750
not a,

1402
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:56.640
not an entirely novel.

1403
00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:01.300
These techniques are being used in wildlife survey studies already.

1404
00:39:01.301 --> 00:39:01.751
I mean there,

1405
00:39:01.751 --> 00:39:03.970
there are companies that have popped up that uh,

1406
00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:06.790
that provide the service to government agencies,

1407
00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.920
a fishing game and so forth.

1408
00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:10.523
Um,

1409
00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:14.350
it's just the combination with this particular type of an air ship.

1410
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:17.230
But I think it's the way to get at a,

1411
00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.440
the daily behaviors and,

1412
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.270
and ranging patterns and so forth to these creatures on the ground.

1413
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:25.000
You're looking for that proverbial moving needle in a haystack.

1414
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:29.140
We're going to obviously combine the effort with ground insertion teams that

1415
00:39:29.141 --> 00:39:32.290
will attempt to follow up to find trace and physical evidence evidence.

1416
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:33.490
And how many people do you need?

1417
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:34.350
I'm the president.

1418
00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:34.670
Remember?

1419
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:35.503
Yeah.

1420
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.401
Unlimited budget.

1421
00:39:36.401 --> 00:39:37.001
Not that many.

1422
00:39:37.001 --> 00:39:37.640
We,

1423
00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:37.990
uh,

1424
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.750
let's see.

1425
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:39.040
Uh,

1426
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.530
a half dozen could do this and we're going to need you to take all these people

1427
00:39:41.531 --> 00:39:43.660
away from the DEA and give them real jobs.

1428
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.160
This is the move.

1429
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:49.180
Take the people from the DEA and put them in the Ba.

1430
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.141
Now,

1431
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:54.280
if the primal people though we may have the problems with the social rights and

1432
00:39:54.281 --> 00:39:54.970
so forth,

1433
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:56.000
if they are people,

1434
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.820
that does become an issue,

1435
00:39:57.821 --> 00:39:58.091
right?

1436
00:39:58.091 --> 00:39:58.390
Region.

1437
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.900
Yeah.

1438
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.000
Well there's people that have said that they've shot them.

1439
00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:04.450
And then of course now they've passed laws saying in certain states it's

1440
00:40:04.451 --> 00:40:06.160
actually illegal to shoot a Sasquatch.

1441
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:06.581
It is.

1442
00:40:06.581 --> 00:40:06.880
Yeah.

1443
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.080
Not In all 50 right?

1444
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:08.780
No,

1445
00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:08.980
it's,

1446
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.300
it's usually by county.

1447
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.641
Uh,

1448
00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:12.190
so Bennett county where I come from,

1449
00:40:12.191 --> 00:40:13.960
we have a safe haven.

1450
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:15.340
Yep.

1451
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:15.910
Wow.

1452
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.640
Now if someone did shoot a Sasquatch and your county,

1453
00:40:18.641 --> 00:40:19.240
what's the,

1454
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:19.991
what's the penalty?

1455
00:40:19.991 --> 00:40:20.950
It's like a parking ticket.

1456
00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:21.581
They would go to jail.

1457
00:40:21.581 --> 00:40:22.750
They were kind of vague on that.

1458
00:40:22.751 --> 00:40:22.991
Yeah.

1459
00:40:22.991 --> 00:40:24.580
What the penalty actually was.

1460
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:27.060
I guess we'd have to see that raises the question of,

1461
00:40:27.061 --> 00:40:28.000
of their status,

1462
00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.610
whether they're non human or human.

1463
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.880
Why have there been no bobbies?

1464
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.560
Why have there been no skulls?

1465
00:40:35.561 --> 00:40:35.741
Right?

1466
00:40:35.741 --> 00:40:36.970
Like has there been no hair?

1467
00:40:36.971 --> 00:40:37.450
Why?

1468
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.570
Why have there been lots of hair,

1469
00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:40.160
lots of hair,

1470
00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.470
but none of it like substantiated as in fact by way of DNA,

1471
00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.690
by way of morphology.

1472
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:49.150
We've got hair that can't be attributed to any,

1473
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:52.930
any commonly known wildlife that has consistent morphological characteristics,

1474
00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:57.100
one of which is a hollow or a cellular Mandala.

1475
00:40:57.101 --> 00:40:58.030
The central core,

1476
00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:01.390
which makes getting DNA from a hair that simply shed,

1477
00:41:01.391 --> 00:41:03.970
that doesn't have an actively dividing follicle.

1478
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:04.893
Uh,

1479
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.770
very difficult.

1480
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:06.520
Very challenging.

1481
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.680
But it was proven to be actual real hair.

1482
00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.520
Oh yes,

1483
00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:09.941
definitely.

1484
00:41:09.941 --> 00:41:10.451
Absolutely.

1485
00:41:10.451 --> 00:41:12.970
So it's an unknown animals hair.

1486
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:13.270
Right.

1487
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:14.051
Do you know whether,

1488
00:41:14.051 --> 00:41:18.160
what kind of animal is that known primate like primate will definitely,

1489
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:23.460
well in the sense that Ma non primate mammals for bearing mammals of North

1490
00:41:23.831 --> 00:41:26.710
America have have for rather than simply hair,

1491
00:41:26.711 --> 00:41:28.750
that means they have guard hairs.

1492
00:41:28.751 --> 00:41:33.751
These long course tapering a guard hairs that provide mechanical and then the

1493
00:41:34.371 --> 00:41:37.370
underlying that differentiated layer of insulating here.

1494
00:41:37.371 --> 00:41:38.240
Very fine.

1495
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.180
Uh,

1496
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.790
underfur that's like down.

1497
00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:41.290
Yes,

1498
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:41.710
exactly.

1499
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.931
Yeah.

1500
00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:42.680
Like down on a,

1501
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.850
on a bird bird has,

1502
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:45.560
they have down in flight feathers,

1503
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.700
um,

1504
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:47.031
in,

1505
00:41:47.031 --> 00:41:48.550
in mammals it's guard hairs.

1506
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:53.680
And a underfur primates though don't have that differentiation.

1507
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.780
They have hair that's kind of like a modified guard here,

1508
00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.420
but it's untaped it as long parallel tips,

1509
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:00.283
worn tips.

1510
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.570
No sign of ever been having been cut,

1511
00:42:02.571 --> 00:42:04.960
trimmed with a Flowbee that together.

1512
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.160
So squads with flow,

1513
00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:07.994
we got downs.

1514
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.080
What color is the hair?

1515
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:10.370
It ranges.

1516
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.320
We have an,

1517
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:16.760
it correlates with the reported colors of a Sasquatch is seen by eye witnesses

1518
00:42:16.761 --> 00:42:17.840
from a,

1519
00:42:17.841 --> 00:42:18.760
almost white

1520
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.351
almost.

1521
00:42:21.351 --> 00:42:22.181
Why is it the,

1522
00:42:22.181 --> 00:42:23.780
the ETI or actual Sasquatch?

1523
00:42:23.781 --> 00:42:24.430
Almost white.

1524
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:24.770
Uh,

1525
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:25.280
well,

1526
00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:25.711
SAS,

1527
00:42:25.711 --> 00:42:27.200
we're still still talking about Sasquatch.

1528
00:42:27.201 --> 00:42:30.320
So there had been white Sasquatch described by witnesses.

1529
00:42:30.321 --> 00:42:30.590
Yeah,

1530
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:31.040
rare.

1531
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.260
But that nevertheless seen the,

1532
00:42:33.261 --> 00:42:34.250
all the way to black,

1533
00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.400
the DNA on the hair comes up with nothing.

1534
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:38.121
Well,

1535
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:40.580
it's difficult to get DNA because there's,

1536
00:42:40.581 --> 00:42:40.851
you know,

1537
00:42:40.851 --> 00:42:45.710
the way hair is constructed that you have a cuticle and then you have a layer

1538
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:48.890
called the cortex and then a central core and in,

1539
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.370
in,

1540
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.850
uh,

1541
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:50.170
if,

1542
00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:54.530
if that core or mandala has cells stacked up in it,

1543
00:42:55.010 --> 00:43:00.010
then that's usually where the DNA is extracted from in animals that don't have,

1544
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:01.220
uh,

1545
00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.830
a mandala present as cellular Modela,

1546
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:05.750
then you have very little,

1547
00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.350
um,

1548
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:10.400
nuclear material of the sale left in that,

1549
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:11.660
in that shaft,

1550
00:43:11.661 --> 00:43:12.860
in that Keratin chat.

1551
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:15.790
And so getting any DNA in order to sequence it is,

1552
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:17.090
is almost impossible.

1553
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.070
What are the party poopers say that,

1554
00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:19.970
that Harris,

1555
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.841
well,

1556
00:43:20.841 --> 00:43:21.290
they don't,

1557
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:24.350
they say they say there's no evidence one way or the other.

1558
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:28.610
So it's basically you've got this hair that hasn't been identified,

1559
00:43:28.611 --> 00:43:29.301
but you know,

1560
00:43:29.301 --> 00:43:33.320
identifying hair's kind of more art than science because even on our bodies,

1561
00:43:33.321 --> 00:43:35.630
we have hair that differs in appearance,

1562
00:43:35.631 --> 00:43:36.171
had hair,

1563
00:43:36.171 --> 00:43:36.561
beard,

1564
00:43:36.561 --> 00:43:37.394
hair.

1565
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.390
Exactly.

1566
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.830
Pubic.

1567
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:40.760
You had to bring that up.

1568
00:43:40.761 --> 00:43:41.594
Mo Harris.

1569
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.410
Um,

1570
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:43.700
so it's different.

1571
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:44.521
Yeah,

1572
00:43:44.521 --> 00:43:45.440
it's definitely different.

1573
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:46.180
Yeah.

1574
00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:46.730
Um,

1575
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.971
yeah.

1576
00:43:46.971 --> 00:43:48.170
In the inside nose hairs,

1577
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:49.220
what the fuck are those all about?

1578
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:51.223
Those are ridiculous

1579
00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:52.253
<v 4>eyelashes,</v>

1580
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:54.160
eyebrows.

1581
00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.420
So it's going to fit.

1582
00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:56.440
Here's another thing,

1583
00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:01.780
in the same way that I can't imagine someone taking the time to fake those

1584
00:44:01.781 --> 00:44:02.614
footprints,

1585
00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:06.730
no one's going to go through the woods with a bag of weird hair and scatter it

1586
00:44:06.731 --> 00:44:07.520
through the forest.

1587
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:07.821
<v 5>No,</v>

1588
00:44:07.821 --> 00:44:09.050
but you might pretend you found it.

1589
00:44:09.051 --> 00:44:10.640
You don't have to go scatter it if you're attending,

1590
00:44:10.641 --> 00:44:11.480
you found it yourself.

1591
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:14.060
But there's a lot of people that are full of Poop,

1592
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:14.480
right.

1593
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.320
We know that.

1594
00:44:15.321 --> 00:44:15.831
You know that.

1595
00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:17.120
I know that and this,

1596
00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:20.960
this subject particularly attracts a lot of them.

1597
00:44:20.961 --> 00:44:24.470
I'm sure you're aware of the gentleman in Montana recently that was killed.

1598
00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:28.880
This hilarious but not hilarious cause poor fellows,

1599
00:44:28.881 --> 00:44:30.020
just trying to hope somebody,

1600
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:31.890
he had a big foot suit on,

1601
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.390
<v 0>got hit by one car,</v>

1602
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.450
driven by a 17 year old girl and then run over by another car.

1603
00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:37.770
Joe By 16 year old girl.

1604
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:39.960
He's an asshole.

1605
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:41.250
He's trying to scare kids,

1606
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:42.091
you know,

1607
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:42.930
that could cause a wreck.

1608
00:44:42.931 --> 00:44:43.320
Anyway.

1609
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:43.891
Well Yeah,

1610
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:44.221
look,

1611
00:44:44.221 --> 00:44:45.540
I have a 16 year old daughter.

1612
00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:46.260
If he gets good,

1613
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.830
she got scared by an asshole and fake bigfoot suit and got into a wreck,

1614
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:50.790
I'd be pissed.

1615
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:51.390
Yeah,

1616
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:52.050
sure.

1617
00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:55.020
So the world got a little lighter as Bill Hicks would say.

1618
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:57.480
We lost a moron.

1619
00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.070
The um,

1620
00:44:59.070 --> 00:44:59.903
this,

1621
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.100
this phenomenon for whatever reason is,

1622
00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:02.550
well,

1623
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:05.010
I guess there's a bunch of reasons why people would want to hoax it.

1624
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:05.671
First of all,

1625
00:45:05.671 --> 00:45:06.504
notoriety.

1626
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:07.021
Second of all,

1627
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:07.854
because it's fun.

1628
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:08.551
And third of all,

1629
00:45:08.551 --> 00:45:10.170
because it's so similar to us.

1630
00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:12.840
It's not like trying to w if we tried to hooks the loch ness monster,

1631
00:45:12.841 --> 00:45:13.950
that would be a pain in the ass.

1632
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:14.611
But,

1633
00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:15.010
uh,

1634
00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:15.321
you know,

1635
00:45:15.321 --> 00:45:16.590
you're a fairly big guy,

1636
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:18.190
will put you in a big monkey suit,

1637
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:19.440
puts you at a distance,

1638
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:19.891
you know,

1639
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:21.120
have you wandering around,

1640
00:45:21.121 --> 00:45:21.361
you know,

1641
00:45:21.361 --> 00:45:24.180
as long as there's nothing we could line up for perspective,

1642
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:25.620
you'd look like a little,

1643
00:45:25.621 --> 00:45:25.861
you know,

1644
00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:26.570
we can get it off.

1645
00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:26.670
Oh,

1646
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:27.210
shut it off.

1647
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:27.770
Oh yeah.

1648
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:28.830
There's lots of myths.

1649
00:45:28.831 --> 00:45:29.581
Identifications.

1650
00:45:29.581 --> 00:45:29.761
I mean,

1651
00:45:29.761 --> 00:45:30.930
that's one of the problems of,

1652
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:33.190
of eyewitness testimony is you,

1653
00:45:33.191 --> 00:45:34.260
you're not only,

1654
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:34.950
uh,

1655
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:35.711
at the mercy of,

1656
00:45:35.711 --> 00:45:37.920
of the witness's credibility,

1657
00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:38.610
but,

1658
00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:39.271
but honestly,

1659
00:45:39.271 --> 00:45:42.240
even if they're sincere and genuine in what they think they saw,

1660
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:43.171
your,

1661
00:45:43.171 --> 00:45:47.340
you have to evaluate their ability to evaluate their experience,

1662
00:45:47.341 --> 00:45:48.590
to interpret what they think.

1663
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.930
Yeah.

1664
00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:49.950
My memory's poop.

1665
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:51.870
My memories.

1666
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:52.860
It gets worse all the time.

1667
00:45:52.861 --> 00:45:53.110
She'll,

1668
00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:57.300
and especially because since we started doing the podcast and um,

1669
00:45:57.330 --> 00:45:57.930
you know,

1670
00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:02.690
just having all this information like rattled at me every day and dealing with

1671
00:46:02.691 --> 00:46:05.010
having these long form three hour conversations,

1672
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:09.720
I don't remember who I said what with or when and I confuse stories.

1673
00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:10.390
<v 4>Sure.</v>

1674
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.601
Yeah.

1675
00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:11.890
You know what also,

1676
00:46:11.891 --> 00:46:13.750
and I don't know if there's any statistics for it,

1677
00:46:13.751 --> 00:46:18.370
but I heard that there's this statistic that 40% of the people at Disneyland or

1678
00:46:18.371 --> 00:46:20.170
on ecstasy at any given time,

1679
00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:22.090
I heard that that's like a statistic,

1680
00:46:22.091 --> 00:46:26.410
like the number of people on psychedelics back in the same way in the forest.

1681
00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.070
How many people camping or hi,

1682
00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.120
what's the percentage?

1683
00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:34.510
Cause I think it's 90% of the people who go camping or high.

1684
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:38.350
And I don't think that this discounts the fact that there's big foot.

1685
00:46:38.351 --> 00:46:41.710
But I would say that most of the people who see big foot,

1686
00:46:41.711 --> 00:46:42.491
if they're out in the woods,

1687
00:46:42.491 --> 00:46:44.560
they're probably stoned on top of it.

1688
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:46.140
<v 0>It's possible that they are.</v>

1689
00:46:46.141 --> 00:46:51.141
But I think another issue is that you may only be able to contact big foot when

1690
00:46:51.661 --> 00:46:52.494
you're high.

1691
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:53.300
I are.

1692
00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:54.390
Maybe that's it.

1693
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:56.880
Maybe it's the cause of my problem northwest.

1694
00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:01.080
We need to get you on some mushrooms on the Pacific northwest is overflowing

1695
00:47:01.081 --> 00:47:02.160
with psilocybin mushrooms.

1696
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:03.000
I mean they're everywhere,

1697
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:03.720
right?

1698
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.010
It's so rainy up there.

1699
00:47:05.011 --> 00:47:09.450
It's just like the Purtell perfect fertile ground for them and a lot of people

1700
00:47:09.451 --> 00:47:11.700
go up there to to gather those things.

1701
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.190
Now if you were up there and you were gathering those things,

1702
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.580
maybe that puts your mind into a certain frequency when big like,

1703
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:19.890
I know this guy's trip and let's go fuck with them.

1704
00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.570
And then bigfoot chosen sal.

1705
00:47:21.571 --> 00:47:22.404
Hey Dude.

1706
00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.400
Plus pretty territorial.

1707
00:47:26.401 --> 00:47:29.890
So maybe they're just making up the stories to scare off the competition.

1708
00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.070
Are

1709
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.100
<v 5>they really hold their mushroom people would be the least territory.</v>

1710
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:33.521
Oh No,

1711
00:47:33.521 --> 00:47:34.390
there it's big.

1712
00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.620
How do you know sir?

1713
00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:39.690
I've run into a lot of Maro Miranda knickers and run into him.

1714
00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:41.710
He hasn't called them.

1715
00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:41.921
Hey,

1716
00:47:41.921 --> 00:47:43.060
meet me here with a bag.

1717
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:47.140
I've run into you and you've run into my chat,

1718
00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.013
my cash.

1719
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:51.300
I wonder if big foot eats those mushrooms.

1720
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:52.210
I of course he does.

1721
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:53.140
Why wouldn't he?

1722
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:53.740
Smart.

1723
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.570
The craziest trip is the trip and with big bigfoot being big flat.

1724
00:47:57.571 --> 00:47:59.050
Oh yeah,

1725
00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:00.200
yeah.

1726
00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.470
Tripping with bigfoot is definitely a great kids,

1727
00:48:02.471 --> 00:48:04.150
but I wonder if big foot is pissed at all.

1728
00:48:04.151 --> 00:48:05.340
The wolves killing the elk,

1729
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:06.070
you know,

1730
00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:07.930
they was like serious issues with wolves,

1731
00:48:07.931 --> 00:48:10.600
killing elk and deer now because they reintroduced the,

1732
00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.060
they took an un Un Canada Wolf,

1733
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:15.010
which is a larger version of the gray wolf,

1734
00:48:15.011 --> 00:48:17.820
and introduced them to Idaho and all these different areas and now they're

1735
00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:18.370
having a problem.

1736
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:19.540
These things are running rampant.

1737
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.500
There's thousands of them.

1738
00:48:20.501 --> 00:48:22.800
They're just massive packs killing things.

1739
00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.600
They just opened the season in Idaho on,

1740
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.430
on wolves that that disturbs the shit out of people.

1741
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.580
And that's just a wolf and it's because we,

1742
00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:30.700
we see it as,

1743
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:31.420
you know,

1744
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:32.380
as a dog,

1745
00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:34.031
I got to say,

1746
00:48:34.031 --> 00:48:39.031
I think that you are a courageous person because you seem very level headed.

1747
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.930
You seem completely logical and rational with all this stuff.

1748
00:48:43.931 --> 00:48:47.650
And I think it must take an awful lot of patients to constantly end up in

1749
00:48:47.651 --> 00:48:51.230
interviews with stoners asking of big foot eats mushrooms.

1750
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:52.920
Yeah,

1751
00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:53.260
yeah.

1752
00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:53.390
Well,

1753
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.601
there's,

1754
00:48:53.601 --> 00:48:54.520
there's a lighter side.

1755
00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:54.880
I've,

1756
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:55.660
I've got,

1757
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.400
I've got a notebook with all the,

1758
00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:58.234
uh,

1759
00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.640
all the lighter stories that I'll publish one day.

1760
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:00.880
All right.

1761
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.110
Now here's something that you said.

1762
00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:04.270
A chapter unfortunately disturbs me.

1763
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:08.260
Here's something that you said that unfortunately disturbs me and that is,

1764
00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.530
you talked about the Patterson footage as if it wasn't bs,

1765
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:13.810
that Patterson footage.

1766
00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:14.643
To me,

1767
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:17.500
it looks like a blurry video of a dude in a monkey suit.

1768
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:18.521
Well,

1769
00:49:18.521 --> 00:49:19.480
if it looks that blurry to you,

1770
00:49:19.481 --> 00:49:21.250
then you haven't seen the best,

1771
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:21.730
uh,

1772
00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.690
renditions of best copies of is on,

1773
00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:24.573
are they online?

1774
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.361
Uh,

1775
00:49:25.361 --> 00:49:25.900
there's one,

1776
00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.010
there's one that's online.

1777
00:49:27.011 --> 00:49:27.910
What's the best one?

1778
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.420
Well,

1779
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.520
I'm not sure if I can call it off top of my head,

1780
00:49:30.521 --> 00:49:32.470
but the producer of the show just looked at me like,

1781
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:33.281
oh no,

1782
00:49:33.281 --> 00:49:34.114
here we go.

1783
00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.670
Because he knows I got to thank for the prednisone footage.

1784
00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:36.851
Well,

1785
00:49:36.851 --> 00:49:37.684
one of the things,

1786
00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:39.880
we're fine.

1787
00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.990
We've got a lot of good stuff already.

1788
00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:44.740
One of the things that's interesting is every time the film is a sailed by a

1789
00:49:44.741 --> 00:49:45.610
critic or a,

1790
00:49:45.611 --> 00:49:46.810
or a pretender,

1791
00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:47.110
uh,

1792
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:48.040
to be the man in,

1793
00:49:48.041 --> 00:49:48.380
in,

1794
00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.120
uh,

1795
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.040
in the suit such as Bob or autonomous,

1796
00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:51.903
right.

1797
00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:52.813
Um,

1798
00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:53.771
the,

1799
00:49:53.771 --> 00:49:54.130
uh,

1800
00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:54.341
you know,

1801
00:49:54.341 --> 00:49:57.850
it seems that that new technologies have become available in the intervening

1802
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:59.590
period and they're applied.

1803
00:49:59.591 --> 00:50:01.630
One of those was,

1804
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:02.260
uh,

1805
00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:02.711
the,

1806
00:50:02.711 --> 00:50:02.831
uh,

1807
00:50:02.831 --> 00:50:07.831
it was digital imagery by scanning that film digitally.

1808
00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:09.461
The,

1809
00:50:09.461 --> 00:50:09.820
uh,

1810
00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:10.900
the image could be,

1811
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:11.230
uh,

1812
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:13.150
the color could be channel split.

1813
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:13.990
Uh,

1814
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.910
we know that the,

1815
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:15.251
the,

1816
00:50:15.251 --> 00:50:15.650
the,

1817
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:20.380
the lens that was used was not corrected for chromatic aberration.

1818
00:50:20.381 --> 00:50:23.420
So different colors refracting different inch wrench really through that Lens.

1819
00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.760
You sure talk a good game,

1820
00:50:24.761 --> 00:50:26.970
Mr. Somatic aberrations,

1821
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:27.880
dare you,

1822
00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:28.000
you

1823
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:28.833
<v 2>split,</v>

1824
00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:30.840
you know,

1825
00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.320
just well,

1826
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.340
just pop a mushroom and you'll understand what I'm talking about.

1827
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:35.590
Are these rainbow colors.

1828
00:50:35.591 --> 00:50:36.580
We split the colors.

1829
00:50:36.581 --> 00:50:41.581
We can subtract away the least clear channels and just limit the image to the

1830
00:50:42.401 --> 00:50:44.920
sharpest imagery and a boy,

1831
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:45.700
I tell Ya,

1832
00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.250
you see that image as you've never seen it before.

1833
00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:49.390
Um,

1834
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:50.500
and there are details.

1835
00:50:50.501 --> 00:50:50.711
I,

1836
00:50:50.711 --> 00:50:51.071
I've,

1837
00:50:51.071 --> 00:50:51.371
you know,

1838
00:50:51.371 --> 00:50:51.551
I'm,

1839
00:50:51.551 --> 00:50:56.260
I'm working right now with a gentleman who is a former Hollywood makeup artists

1840
00:50:56.261 --> 00:50:59.440
and fat and I'm a costume fabricator.

1841
00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:00.670
You'll bill months.

1842
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.380
He's also very good with,

1843
00:51:02.381 --> 00:51:03.130
uh,

1844
00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:04.210
with computer graphics,

1845
00:51:04.211 --> 00:51:07.540
with photogrammetry and we're doing some really interesting work on the film.

1846
00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:08.621
But you know,

1847
00:51:08.621 --> 00:51:11.440
when you stop and think about the materials that were available,

1848
00:51:11.441 --> 00:51:12.400
1967,

1849
00:51:12.401 --> 00:51:13.840
they didn't have four way stretch for,

1850
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:14.890
they just had for cloth,

1851
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.900
which when you make a costume out of it,

1852
00:51:16.901 --> 00:51:19.780
even a padded costume,

1853
00:51:19.781 --> 00:51:20.980
it looks like pajamas.

1854
00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:22.360
It doesn't look like a fitted,

1855
00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.580
a fitted.

1856
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:25.430
<v 0>It doesn't look real to me.</v>

1857
00:51:25.431 --> 00:51:30.431
That big guy walk like a gorilla walks like somebody who's late for a meeting.

1858
00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:32.160
Not only that,

1859
00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.260
there's not a girl,

1860
00:51:33.261 --> 00:51:34.490
there's the context.

1861
00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:36.080
There's something about,

1862
00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:36.590
uh,

1863
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:41.210
human beings where when a human being is wearing a suit or you,

1864
00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:44.600
you see a human being that's pretending to be something that they're not,

1865
00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.100
it doesn't seem right.

1866
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:47.390
They walk like a human.

1867
00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:49.280
You will think that you see that thing walk.

1868
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:51.440
That to me feels like a human being.

1869
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:53.600
I've seen chimps walk on two legs.

1870
00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:55.100
I've seen gorillas,

1871
00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:56.840
I've seen primates move,

1872
00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.000
they move differently than people do.

1873
00:51:59.001 --> 00:52:01.580
They have a completely different anatomical structure.

1874
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:02.840
They feel different.

1875
00:52:02.841 --> 00:52:03.674
When you watched him,

1876
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:07.280
this feels like an asshole pretending to be big foot.

1877
00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:08.060
Well,

1878
00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:08.893
I'll sell.

1879
00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:09.620
Here's the,

1880
00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:12.080
let me just play big foot advocate here.

1881
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:14.120
There is the possibility though.

1882
00:52:14.121 --> 00:52:14.954
I mean if you're,

1883
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:18.350
if you're shooting a big foot hoax video,

1884
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.720
you're going to walk better than that.

1885
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.670
This whoever did this is like,

1886
00:52:22.671 --> 00:52:24.560
it's like he's in between.

1887
00:52:24.561 --> 00:52:26.750
Takes going to use the bathroom or something.

1888
00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:29.400
Well this is just a dude does it with Bob Hieronymus,

1889
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.040
the guy who at the says it's him.

1890
00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:34.940
He's just a guy who was friends with Bob Patterson and we've already been over

1891
00:52:34.941 --> 00:52:39.220
the fact that Patterson wrote a bad check to pay for the very camera that day.

1892
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:40.490
He's a shady character.

1893
00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.470
He wasn't exactly the salt of the earth.

1894
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:44.030
And he went looking,

1895
00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:44.361
I'm sorry.

1896
00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:44.781
But he went,

1897
00:52:44.781 --> 00:52:47.170
he went looking for big foot and then found bigfoot.

1898
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:48.890
That sounds so ridiculous.

1899
00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:52.970
But if you're gonna take the time to go out in the forest with whatever that big

1900
00:52:52.971 --> 00:52:53.601
suit is,

1901
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:57.710
and to film yourself walking through the woods to make a hoax,

1902
00:52:57.711 --> 00:52:58.730
big foot video,

1903
00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:02.930
you're going to try to walk more like a gorilla or some supernatural thing.

1904
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:08.200
The stride of that thing is so bad and theme sell fake that it makes me believe

1905
00:53:08.781 --> 00:53:09.614
that it's real.

1906
00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:11.880
I,

1907
00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:12.200
well,

1908
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.320
I got baked one night at the Ice House and I was convincing myself for 20

1909
00:53:15.321 --> 00:53:15.591
minutes.

1910
00:53:15.591 --> 00:53:16.610
I mind fuck myself.

1911
00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:18.980
And I'd completely convinced myself that it was real.

1912
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:20.160
And then I woke up.

1913
00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:20.570
I was like,

1914
00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:21.403
that's ridiculous.

1915
00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:22.640
That's the kind of monkey suit.

1916
00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:24.620
<v 2>As Dr Melvin though,</v>

1917
00:53:24.621 --> 00:53:25.441
what he was studying,

1918
00:53:25.441 --> 00:53:26.220
the four big

1919
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:26.461
<v 5>foot,</v>

1920
00:53:26.461 --> 00:53:28.050
because it's Germane to his,

1921
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:28.351
okay,

1922
00:53:28.351 --> 00:53:28.980
we'll get to that.

1923
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:29.813
We'll get to that.

1924
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.300
But the,

1925
00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:31.750
this,

1926
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:32.400
this foam,

1927
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.990
have you ever looked at it and thought it was fake?

1928
00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:34.830
Hmm.

1929
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:35.663
Never.

1930
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.020
Well,

1931
00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:36.170
I mean,

1932
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:36.330
I've,

1933
00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:38.670
I've questioned whether it was authentic or not,

1934
00:53:38.671 --> 00:53:42.030
but I never come to a conclusion that it must have been faked.

1935
00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.860
It's the holy grail of big foot footage.

1936
00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:44.420
Uh,

1937
00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:44.590
well,

1938
00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:44.970
yeah,

1939
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:45.810
but that's not,

1940
00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:46.770
that's not the reason.

1941
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:47.740
I know.

1942
00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:51.930
I'm Oh sure it has set the bar.

1943
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:52.510
I guess I,

1944
00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:54.580
that's why I would rather look at it that it,

1945
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:56.520
it sets the bar as high as,

1946
00:53:56.521 --> 00:54:00.510
as it is for photographic evidence and anything that falls short of it,

1947
00:54:00.511 --> 00:54:04.070
since we're still debating it is certainly not going to tip the scale.

1948
00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:06.570
It would be devastating.

1949
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.021
Uh,

1950
00:54:07.021 --> 00:54:07.410
no,

1951
00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:07.561
no,

1952
00:54:07.561 --> 00:54:10.020
it wouldn't because we still have this dozens and dozens,

1953
00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:12.330
hundreds of footprints that fill my lab that,

1954
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:15.660
that form the basis of my conclusion.

1955
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:17.730
But I would think it would just be devastating just because people would be

1956
00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:18.440
upset.

1957
00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.950
They were claiming that it wasn't real.

1958
00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.293
It was real.

1959
00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.130
That would be,

1960
00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:22.860
you go wise,

1961
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:26.220
there will be a crusher is such a fringe belief anyway,

1962
00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:26.610
right?

1963
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:27.180
Sure,

1964
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.013
sure.

1965
00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:30.810
But if all I had to go on Wa was the,

1966
00:54:30.811 --> 00:54:31.500
uh,

1967
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:35.850
the correlated footprints were the correlated footprints from that film side.

1968
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:38.400
That would be enough to convince me that it's authentic.

1969
00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:38.700
Really.

1970
00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:41.280
The correlator Phil footprints were very good.

1971
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.701
Well,

1972
00:54:41.701 --> 00:54:42.180
yeah,

1973
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:45.090
this example that's so is that one from Bluff Creek?

1974
00:54:45.091 --> 00:54:45.950
That is that.

1975
00:54:45.951 --> 00:54:47.180
So that's from the Patterson footage.

1976
00:54:47.181 --> 00:54:48.390
That is man,

1977
00:54:48.391 --> 00:54:52.390
that exhibits that whole midtarsal and talk about it.

1978
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:54.600
And you can see that kinematic,

1979
00:54:54.601 --> 00:54:57.990
that action in the foot of the film subjects.

1980
00:54:57.991 --> 00:54:59.640
So it looks to me when I watch it,

1981
00:54:59.641 --> 00:55:01.590
it looks like a guy walking with ice skates on.

1982
00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:03.480
You know when you have ice skates can't walk.

1983
00:55:03.481 --> 00:55:03.900
Right.

1984
00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:04.733
Well that's it.

1985
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:06.270
That's that effective.

1986
00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:08.010
The compliancy of the gate,

1987
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.390
they don't walk.

1988
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:09.870
You know,

1989
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:11.240
you said it doesn't look like a chimp.

1990
00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:12.270
It doesn't look like a gorilla.

1991
00:55:12.271 --> 00:55:15.180
And that's absolutely true because gorillas and chimps are quadrupedal.

1992
00:55:15.181 --> 00:55:15.990
They're not bipeds.

1993
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:17.820
Well actually I said it looks like a person.

1994
00:55:17.821 --> 00:55:21.270
That's what I see when you watch a chimp move and you watch a gorilla move,

1995
00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.530
they don't look like human beings.

1996
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.850
This looks like a human being.

1997
00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:24.240
Right.

1998
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:24.430
And,

1999
00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:29.400
and that similarity is largely due to the fact that this is another bypass that

2000
00:55:29.401 --> 00:55:33.780
uses a mode of locomotion that's very similar but not identical to our own.

2001
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:35.220
And one of those differences you,

2002
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:39.120
you pointed out with the ice skating is that effect of the compliant gate.

2003
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.601
You know,

2004
00:55:39.601 --> 00:55:41.630
one of the things you notice often notice in,

2005
00:55:41.631 --> 00:55:44.310
in many of these footprints is compared to a human,

2006
00:55:44.311 --> 00:55:45.690
there's not a real distinctive,

2007
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:46.200
uh,

2008
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.240
he'll impression and a ball impression,

2009
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.520
which is the result of our arched foot,

2010
00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:54.450
that constant straights pressure under those ends of the arch.

2011
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:56.670
So we have a heel strike and a toe off when we walk.

2012
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.310
This creature because of its great mass,

2013
00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:03.780
has to distribute his weight over a larger surface area so it walks more flat

2014
00:56:03.781 --> 00:56:05.250
footed without an arch.

2015
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.620
And then you've got the action that mid tarsal brake,

2016
00:56:07.621 --> 00:56:10.080
you can see here's the deepest part of the footprint right there.

2017
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:11.730
And then the pressure Ridge,

2018
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.710
the pressure release that's pushed up behind it.

2019
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:18.540
But in order to also reduce those reaction forces,

2020
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.070
that impact of the step,

2021
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:22.380
it walks with a slightly bent ankle,

2022
00:56:22.381 --> 00:56:23.214
knee and hip.

2023
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:28.620
And so instead of the head bobbing along like we walk when we're walking briskly

2024
00:56:28.991 --> 00:56:29.441
down,

2025
00:56:29.441 --> 00:56:29.741
you know,

2026
00:56:29.741 --> 00:56:29.981
the,

2027
00:56:29.981 --> 00:56:30.814
the sidewalk,

2028
00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:31.890
uh,

2029
00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:32.410
smooth.

2030
00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:33.160
Exactly.

2031
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.900
I've had eye witnesses when they saw it.

2032
00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:38.380
They thought it was either levitating floating through the air.

2033
00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:39.401
One described it,

2034
00:56:39.401 --> 00:56:39.601
he said,

2035
00:56:39.601 --> 00:56:43.180
look like it was on a bicycle because its head was just moving horizontally

2036
00:56:43.181 --> 00:56:44.440
through space as it was,

2037
00:56:44.441 --> 00:56:45.010
uh,

2038
00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:46.510
as it was walking so smoothly.

2039
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:47.561
So that's a,

2040
00:56:47.561 --> 00:56:49.120
that's an interesting distinction.

2041
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:50.590
But to my eye,

2042
00:56:50.591 --> 00:56:51.220
that's,

2043
00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:55.240
that confirms the credibility rather than refutes it.

2044
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:56.763
That's interesting.

2045
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:58.330
Still excited to do it in a monkey suit.

2046
00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:58.721
Well,

2047
00:56:58.721 --> 00:56:59.830
it does at first clients,

2048
00:56:59.831 --> 00:57:00.040
you know,

2049
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.050
but when you start looking at things like,

2050
00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:02.321
you know,

2051
00:57:02.321 --> 00:57:03.260
you're a bodybuilder,

2052
00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.360
the attachment of the [inaudible],

2053
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:07.193
I am

2054
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:10.240
the attachment of the Trapezius.

2055
00:57:10.241 --> 00:57:11.170
On the back of the head.

2056
00:57:11.171 --> 00:57:13.840
You can see the traps come down to those massive shoulders.

2057
00:57:13.841 --> 00:57:15.490
You can see the definition of the deltoid.

2058
00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:18.970
Or you see a dude who has football pads on inside a gorilla.

2059
00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:25.930
You have such a smooth voice in such an easy way of talking about this.

2060
00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:28.610
You could make me believe in the Leprechaun.

2061
00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:29.773
None of corn.

2062
00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:30.813
You mean you don't,

2063
00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.220
it's easy to get me to start believing,

2064
00:57:36.221 --> 00:57:36.521
man.

2065
00:57:36.521 --> 00:57:36.701
I,

2066
00:57:36.701 --> 00:57:38.080
I started looking at it over and over again.

2067
00:57:38.081 --> 00:57:39.370
I'd be watching the video the entire time.

2068
00:57:39.371 --> 00:57:40.720
We're talking like maybe,

2069
00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:42.010
maybe man,

2070
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:44.500
nobody would want it to be real more than me.

2071
00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:47.410
That's why it disturbs me that I think it's fake because man,

2072
00:57:47.411 --> 00:57:49.870
I would want that to be real so bad.

2073
00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:51.070
Almost as much as you,

2074
00:57:51.071 --> 00:57:52.190
you first meet.

2075
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:54.880
Like one of the interesting thing,

2076
00:57:54.881 --> 00:57:55.250
you know,

2077
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:57.370
Roger's no longer here to defend himself,

2078
00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:58.780
but Bob Gimlin,

2079
00:57:58.781 --> 00:57:59.680
his partner is,

2080
00:57:59.681 --> 00:58:01.450
and Bob was kind of pulled in on this.

2081
00:58:01.451 --> 00:58:02.284
He was a,

2082
00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:07.330
he was the friend who had the necessary horse trailer and equipment and so forth

2083
00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:09.020
to make this kind of happen.

2084
00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.030
And he got pulled in.

2085
00:58:10.031 --> 00:58:10.811
He was interested.

2086
00:58:10.811 --> 00:58:14.890
He heard the stories that Roger told him and went out riding with him every now

2087
00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:18.310
and again over by Mount St Helens and Mount Adams when you're near where they

2088
00:58:18.311 --> 00:58:19.144
lived in Yakima.

2089
00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:20.051
But,

2090
00:58:20.051 --> 00:58:20.260
uh,

2091
00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:20.650
they,

2092
00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:20.920
uh,

2093
00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:24.970
they had gone down there specifically because there had been footprints

2094
00:58:24.971 --> 00:58:26.260
discovered a month earlier,

2095
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.030
a long line of tracks.

2096
00:58:28.031 --> 00:58:30.130
If three individuals a of 15 inch,

2097
00:58:30.131 --> 00:58:31.720
which I'm convinced was her,

2098
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:33.940
and then a 13 and an 11 inch,

2099
00:58:33.941 --> 00:58:34.600
which probably were,

2100
00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:37.330
were juvenile offspring of hers that were just in tow.

2101
00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:38.410
Uh,

2102
00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:41.110
they'd been down there for two weeks already.

2103
00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:44.530
It's not like they just went down in two whole weeks.

2104
00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:45.281
Wow.

2105
00:58:45.281 --> 00:58:49.480
They put in the time they really deserve finding the shortest video footage ever

2106
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:51.910
of a giant ape like man thing.

2107
00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:52.311
Well it's,

2108
00:58:52.311 --> 00:58:53.021
it's dumb luck.

2109
00:58:53.021 --> 00:58:55.860
There's always a certain element of dumb luck or,

2110
00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:56.410
or,

2111
00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:56.621
yeah,

2112
00:58:56.621 --> 00:58:59.650
of course you can play it off either side of it,

2113
00:58:59.651 --> 00:59:01.060
but you got away the,

2114
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:02.110
you know,

2115
00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:04.390
even if even if you dismiss it on the basis or,

2116
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:09.400
or if you a hedge on the basis of those circumstantial evidence is then you got

2117
00:59:09.561 --> 00:59:10.630
to account for the film.

2118
00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:11.410
You know,

2119
00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:14.410
that was the year that planted the apes came out.

2120
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:18.610
Now that was the state of the art in the industry for costumes.

2121
00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:22.010
That has never been in the industry.

2122
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.300
We quickly past costumes and,

2123
00:59:24.301 --> 00:59:26.480
and if we were going to do it now we do it with CGI.

2124
00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:28.910
No one would even tackle that with a costume.

2125
00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:29.361
All right,

2126
00:59:29.361 --> 00:59:30.860
let me play devil's advocate real quick.

2127
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:34.250
Even the really good footage,

2128
00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.061
let's be honest,

2129
00:59:35.061 --> 00:59:35.750
it's blurry.

2130
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:37.550
If you went to see a movie and it looked like that,

2131
00:59:37.551 --> 00:59:38.301
you'd be pissed.

2132
00:59:38.301 --> 00:59:39.134
Sure.

2133
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.281
Shit movie.

2134
00:59:40.281 --> 00:59:41.030
Are you making?

2135
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:42.410
He came to see what's going on.

2136
00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:43.253
It's all blurry.

2137
00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:44.211
The trees,

2138
00:59:44.211 --> 00:59:45.350
you can't see the leaves.

2139
00:59:45.351 --> 00:59:46.850
Everything is like washed out.

2140
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:50.270
It's very difficult to distinguish really,

2141
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:52.640
really closely exactly what you're looking at.

2142
00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:53.331
Well,

2143
00:59:53.331 --> 00:59:55.620
there's enough detail that that you can see the,

2144
00:59:55.621 --> 00:59:55.971
the,

2145
00:59:55.971 --> 00:59:57.140
you know the deep set eyes.

2146
00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.130
You can see the nose,

2147
00:59:58.131 --> 00:59:59.660
you can see the split of the mouth.

2148
00:59:59.661 --> 01:00:02.600
You can see the see something.

2149
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:05.220
What about Bob Hieronymus,

2150
01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:08.930
the guy who says that he was in the suit and the guy who when he walks looks

2151
01:00:08.931 --> 01:00:09.764
like bigfoot.

2152
01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:10.250
Well,

2153
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:11.061
he doesn't actually,

2154
01:00:11.061 --> 01:00:11.894
one interesting thing.

2155
01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:12.140
No,

2156
01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.150
he doesn't look anything like it.

2157
01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:15.600
His limb proportions are completely off on,

2158
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:16.760
is not wearing a suit.

2159
01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.670
Here's a funny little telltale hip telltale sign.

2160
01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.070
Okay?

2161
01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:23.270
You notice that when he tries to imitate the Patterson film,

2162
01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:24.980
he walks like in Egypt,

2163
01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.010
he turns his,

2164
01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:27.640
his backhand back far.

2165
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:28.820
There was a,

2166
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:32.960
there was a frame from the Patterson film that was widely published sometime

2167
01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:33.231
after,

2168
01:00:33.231 --> 01:00:37.940
it was actually a copy that was in the possession of a Renee to Hinden and it

2169
01:00:37.941 --> 01:00:42.560
had a little blemish on the copy that made it look like there was almost like a

2170
01:00:42.561 --> 01:00:46.760
thumb and forefinger making an okay sign that made it look like that hand was

2171
01:00:46.761 --> 01:00:48.110
turned back like this.

2172
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:50.870
That's an artifact of the,

2173
01:00:50.871 --> 01:00:51.640
of the copy.

2174
01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.170
The hand is actually positioned like this.

2175
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.000
The palm doesn't face backwards,

2176
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:59.570
but Hieronymus trying to exemplify,

2177
01:00:59.571 --> 01:01:04.571
trying to emulate the posture exaggerates this Egyptian hand posture may stop

2178
01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:07.550
that widely.

2179
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:08.450
Uh,

2180
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:08.991
published.

2181
01:01:08.991 --> 01:01:12.770
Publicized sounds to me like someone's got a little confirmation bias

2182
01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:16.060
wants it to be real.

2183
01:01:16.061 --> 01:01:16.520
Oh,

2184
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:16.671
no,

2185
01:01:16.671 --> 01:01:16.821
no,

2186
01:01:16.821 --> 01:01:17.031
it's,

2187
01:01:17.031 --> 01:01:17.550
it's,

2188
01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:17.890
it,

2189
01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:21.950
it sounds that way because I'm throwing out things that are based on their

2190
01:01:21.951 --> 01:01:25.020
exhaustive evaluation of the film.

2191
01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.490
Exhaustive evaluation of Bob [inaudible] walk like an Egyptian hands.

2192
01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:28.911
Oh,

2193
01:01:28.911 --> 01:01:29.300
sure.

2194
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:29.511
Yeah.

2195
01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:33.040
I'd have to buy everything that he's allowed to be replicated or

2196
01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.280
<v 4>can I throw my pinky and with a doctor here?</v>

2197
01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:37.743
Please do.

2198
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:38.531
I just want to say,

2199
01:01:38.531 --> 01:01:39.130
look,

2200
01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:39.963
here's the thing.

2201
01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.380
If I'm going out in the woods and I've got this futuristic big foot suit and

2202
01:01:44.381 --> 01:01:45.820
horses and a camera,

2203
01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.460
I'm going to walk in a weirder way.

2204
01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.590
I'm not going to walk into buddy,

2205
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:51.280
right?

2206
01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.360
May I would walk exactly like this guy in the monkey suit.

2207
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:54.520
You would walk like that.

2208
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.030
I would never know number one about the head movement thing.

2209
01:01:58.031 --> 01:02:01.720
I wouldn't know that this was some kind of primordial thing.

2210
01:02:01.721 --> 01:02:06.721
So these people seem to have deeply studied it to make something seem so fake or

2211
01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.010
it's just walked straight and they filmed it all blurry and then we add all

2212
01:02:12.011 --> 01:02:12.844
these things to her.

2213
01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.720
Why is it exhibiting behavior that's so uncharacteristic of every other

2214
01:02:16.721 --> 01:02:17.710
Sasquatch sighting?

2215
01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:19.320
Every single Sasquatch there,

2216
01:02:19.321 --> 01:02:20.010
like in the middle of

2217
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.371
<v 5>the woods,</v>

2218
01:02:20.371 --> 01:02:23.160
they don't come out in the open and you don't stand there and when they walk,

2219
01:02:23.161 --> 01:02:24.630
why would they walk that way?

2220
01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.370
Why wouldn't it go right back in the woods?

2221
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:27.840
Why is it walking diagonally?

2222
01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:28.230
Well,

2223
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:32.070
when you have to give you a nice long view of itself as he got your camera,

2224
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:33.870
it seems that way seems staged.

2225
01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:35.163
One,

2226
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:36.510
there's several possibilities.

2227
01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:36.781
Just,

2228
01:02:36.781 --> 01:02:38.430
just give you an unapologetic.

2229
01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:39.020
Okay.

2230
01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:39.591
First one is,

2231
01:02:39.591 --> 01:02:40.171
is bullshit,

2232
01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:40.500
right?

2233
01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.850
First one we looked here this bullshit,

2234
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.400
but the other is that one of them is that a,

2235
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:47.880
first you have to know the lay of the land there and we've been to the site,

2236
01:02:47.881 --> 01:02:48.860
we've surveyed the,

2237
01:02:48.861 --> 01:02:49.531
the line of marks,

2238
01:02:49.531 --> 01:02:49.951
the trees,

2239
01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:50.910
the stumps and so forth.

2240
01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.690
This is a very deep canyon with very steep walls at that point.

2241
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.030
There's a wide girth that there,

2242
01:02:57.050 --> 01:03:01.020
because of the flood that he essentially scoured out that that creek bed and

2243
01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:04.110
left that very convenient if you will,

2244
01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:07.200
a sandbar where those beautiful tracks could be laid down.

2245
01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.720
But it made a beeline up,

2246
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:10.550
uh,

2247
01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:11.460
upstream,

2248
01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:12.361
some distance,

2249
01:03:12.361 --> 01:03:13.320
cross the creek and,

2250
01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:15.030
and once it was passed that steep,

2251
01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:16.523
narrow,

2252
01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:20.130
it opened up a bit and that's where it immediately went up to higher elevation.

2253
01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.430
One explanations that's been offered is that it was,

2254
01:03:23.431 --> 01:03:25.140
now remember I said that a month earlier,

2255
01:03:25.141 --> 01:03:26.880
there were actually three sets of tracks,

2256
01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.040
possibly two juveniles.

2257
01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:31.260
Those aren't obvious here in,

2258
01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:32.220
in this footage.

2259
01:03:32.221 --> 01:03:32.301
And,

2260
01:03:32.301 --> 01:03:32.881
and like I said,

2261
01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:37.140
I'm quite convinced that her tracks match those of the other 15 inch set of

2262
01:03:37.141 --> 01:03:37.920
tracks.

2263
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.620
So she's obviously a female if it's real.

2264
01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:41.851
Uh,

2265
01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:42.570
and so she,

2266
01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:46.320
if she has some young and toe one behavior of,

2267
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.460
of um,

2268
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:47.701
you know,

2269
01:03:47.701 --> 01:03:52.200
that exemplifies the maternal instinct is that broken wings syndrome where the

2270
01:03:52.201 --> 01:03:57.201
mother walks off nonchalantly to lead the intruders away from the sequestered

2271
01:03:59.191 --> 01:04:00.024
offspring.

2272
01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:00.421
Oh,

2273
01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:02.100
so the offspring are over here,

2274
01:04:02.101 --> 01:04:06.240
so she's like straight making them follow her and her offspring.

2275
01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:07.253
Yeah.

2276
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:11.310
Isn't that an odd thing to do in a place that's filled with predators and then

2277
01:04:11.311 --> 01:04:12.270
you seem to predators,

2278
01:04:12.271 --> 01:04:12.991
that's how they do it.

2279
01:04:12.991 --> 01:04:13.680
They would,

2280
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:14.513
well,

2281
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:15.451
you know what,

2282
01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:15.591
how,

2283
01:04:15.591 --> 01:04:16.291
how much,

2284
01:04:16.291 --> 01:04:16.621
uh,

2285
01:04:16.621 --> 01:04:17.080
of a,

2286
01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.390
of a threat are humans,

2287
01:04:18.391 --> 01:04:18.841
you know what I mean?

2288
01:04:18.841 --> 01:04:20.580
I would think they're a huge threat,

2289
01:04:20.581 --> 01:04:22.050
which is why Sasquatch is a hiding.

2290
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.621
Otherwise,

2291
01:04:22.621 --> 01:04:24.120
if they came down and got food from us,

2292
01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:25.380
we would feed him every day.

2293
01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:25.680
Sure.

2294
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:25.861
I mean,

2295
01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:26.850
I feed squirrels,

2296
01:04:26.851 --> 01:04:27.210
dude.

2297
01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:27.700
You tell me.

2298
01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:30.270
I wouldn't feed a Sasquatch Sasquatch shut up in the yard.

2299
01:04:30.271 --> 01:04:30.860
Sure.

2300
01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.580
How have they avoided trail cams?

2301
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:34.010
Well,

2302
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.290
uh,

2303
01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:36.840
there are a lot of animals that are capable of avoiding trail cams.

2304
01:04:36.841 --> 01:04:37.021
I mean,

2305
01:04:37.021 --> 01:04:37.111
there,

2306
01:04:37.111 --> 01:04:40.080
there's actually a growing literature showing everything from,

2307
01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:40.261
uh,

2308
01:04:40.261 --> 01:04:40.471
you know,

2309
01:04:40.471 --> 01:04:41.600
coyotes specifics,

2310
01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:42.563
especially,

2311
01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:43.111
uh,

2312
01:04:43.111 --> 01:04:45.540
other predators like fields that,

2313
01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:45.800
uh,

2314
01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.240
uh,

2315
01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.610
exhibit avoidance behavior,

2316
01:04:47.611 --> 01:04:50.070
whether it's a electronic emissions,

2317
01:04:50.071 --> 01:04:51.180
whether it's light leakage,

2318
01:04:51.181 --> 01:04:52.200
whether it's sent,

2319
01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:57.440
whether it's just the novelty of something on that regular use trail that wasn't

2320
01:04:57.901 --> 01:04:58.890
there the day before.

2321
01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:00.510
Probably smells like piano or something.

2322
01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:01.230
I had a,

2323
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:02.041
I had a friend,

2324
01:05:02.041 --> 01:05:02.280
uh,

2325
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.170
he's a wildlife biologist.

2326
01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:08.580
He's been working over in Southeast Asia and he said recently a BBC crew came

2327
01:05:08.581 --> 01:05:13.581
over and they wanted to get images of elephants and they put out 18 trail cams.

2328
01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:16.590
The elephants found in destroyed over half of them.

2329
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:17.380
Wow.

2330
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.250
So elephants

2331
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.120
<v 2>are very smart.</v>

2332
01:05:19.121 --> 01:05:19.670
Exactly.

2333
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:21.550
Kind of strange how smart they are.

2334
01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:22.443
Exactly.

2335
01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.261
No problem.

2336
01:05:23.261 --> 01:05:23.860
Locking them up,

2337
01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:24.310
Ma.

2338
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:24.850
Well,

2339
01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:25.061
yeah.

2340
01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:25.421
Again,

2341
01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:26.170
but it's a,

2342
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:31.170
it's a question up in part of rarity of solitary city and intelligence and

2343
01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:33.310
behavior and so on.

2344
01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:33.820
You know,

2345
01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:38.820
<v 3>isn't it possible that this creature has evolved the ability to hide that,</v>

2346
01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:39.761
wait,

2347
01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:40.594
let me ask that again.

2348
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:45.340
Isn't it possible that this creature has evolved beyond other beings when it

2349
01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.990
comes to the ability to hide?

2350
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.370
Maybe whatever this is,

2351
01:05:48.371 --> 01:05:52.830
is super advanced and camouflaging itself in a way that we've never seen.

2352
01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:53.431
<v 2>Well,</v>

2353
01:05:53.431 --> 01:05:54.150
it's possible.

2354
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:55.480
I don't think that you,

2355
01:05:55.530 --> 01:05:59.880
we really have to resort to extraordinary explanations for it at hiding.

2356
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:00.780
I mean,

2357
01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:05.040
other animals are very capable of remaining undetected.

2358
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:06.480
It's just a matter of odds.

2359
01:06:06.481 --> 01:06:06.900
I mean,

2360
01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:08.670
how many times when you have gone out or,

2361
01:06:08.671 --> 01:06:09.270
you know,

2362
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.870
people,

2363
01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:10.110
uh,

2364
01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:11.550
I just drove through Yellowstone,

2365
01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:11.841
you know,

2366
01:06:11.841 --> 01:06:15.150
and got caught up in these traffic jams where people would,

2367
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:16.190
um,

2368
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.800
uh,

2369
01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.140
stop to see the bear or the bison.

2370
01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:23.040
But there are hundreds of bison out there that are never seen,

2371
01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:23.520
you know,

2372
01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.710
but when you have that many scattered across the landscape,

2373
01:06:25.711 --> 01:06:28.290
the chances of bumping into one increase.

2374
01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:30.660
But if you're talking about a very rare animal,

2375
01:06:30.690 --> 01:06:30.871
you know,

2376
01:06:30.871 --> 01:06:33.630
something like a wolverine or a Fisher or Martin,

2377
01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:34.621
you know,

2378
01:06:34.621 --> 01:06:37.920
you can talk to people who have spent lots of time in the woods who have never

2379
01:06:37.921 --> 01:06:39.690
had a side into one of those animals.

2380
01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.010
So it's just,

2381
01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:41.460
you know,

2382
01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:42.300
for me it's,

2383
01:06:42.301 --> 01:06:44.190
it's a matter of statistics,

2384
01:06:44.191 --> 01:06:44.431
just,

2385
01:06:44.431 --> 01:06:45.630
just probabilities of,

2386
01:06:45.631 --> 01:06:46.464
of encountering.

2387
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:47.041
But Gee,

2388
01:06:47.041 --> 01:06:47.520
you don't,

2389
01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.080
if we don't see something move,

2390
01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:50.310
a vertical line,

2391
01:06:50.311 --> 01:06:51.270
especially is,

2392
01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:53.790
is very cryptic in the woods.

2393
01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.010
We're,

2394
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:57.660
we're usually the scene things that are horizontally oriented,

2395
01:06:57.661 --> 01:07:00.600
like the back of a deer or a bear or whatever.

2396
01:07:00.601 --> 01:07:05.550
But it's kind of like that a closing scene in Harry and the Hendersons when

2397
01:07:05.551 --> 01:07:06.330
suddenly the,

2398
01:07:06.330 --> 01:07:10.140
how dare you quote Harry and the Hendersons when you come on a show to talk to

2399
01:07:10.141 --> 01:07:13.020
us about serious science.

2400
01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:14.611
By the way,

2401
01:07:14.611 --> 01:07:17.160
that's a pretty obscure reference pal for most normal folks,

2402
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:18.810
almost normal folks.

2403
01:07:18.811 --> 01:07:20.670
And not like quoting Harry and the Hendersons.

2404
01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.810
And what happened in Harry and Anderson on the final scene when Harry's sent

2405
01:07:24.811 --> 01:07:25.970
back out into the woods,

2406
01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:30.630
then out from the landscape emerges his whole family.

2407
01:07:30.810 --> 01:07:32.160
And they were standing there right in front of you,

2408
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:33.870
but they're just because they were still,

2409
01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:37.830
you didn't see them then as soon as they put cute when it's a movie.

2410
01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:38.301
Well,

2411
01:07:38.301 --> 01:07:38.480
right.

2412
01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.313
But yeah,

2413
01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:39.840
but there's,

2414
01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:40.680
there's truth to that.

2415
01:07:40.681 --> 01:07:42.180
We really pick up our,

2416
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:44.880
our brain zeroes in on a movement,

2417
01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:45.540
you know,

2418
01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:46.570
a movement in that.

2419
01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:48.600
But if it's absolutely still,

2420
01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.470
uh,

2421
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:51.960
we have a hard time sometimes in Predator.

2422
01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:53.003
Yeah,

2423
01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:53.890
exactly.

2424
01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:54.271
Another one.

2425
01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:59.040
How much credence do you give to the idea that they're all over the country?

2426
01:07:59.700 --> 01:07:59.851
Oh,

2427
01:07:59.851 --> 01:08:00.580
very little.

2428
01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.030
Um,

2429
01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:01.470
they're,

2430
01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:01.960
they're,

2431
01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.480
their distribution,

2432
01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:04.170
again,

2433
01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:05.520
assuming they exist for a moment,

2434
01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.010
is very ecologically based.

2435
01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:11.910
So we don't find them in the middle of wheat fields of Kansas or,

2436
01:08:11.911 --> 01:08:12.301
or,

2437
01:08:12.301 --> 01:08:12.500
uh,

2438
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:12.751
you know,

2439
01:08:12.751 --> 01:08:13.710
West Texas.

2440
01:08:13.711 --> 01:08:18.530
We find them where sufficient rainfall to support coniferous forests and

2441
01:08:18.531 --> 01:08:22.430
understory that that's productive enough to support large omnivore.

2442
01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:24.170
So if you looked at a few,

2443
01:08:24.171 --> 01:08:27.590
got a guide to mammals and flipped open to American black bear,

2444
01:08:27.591 --> 01:08:28.140
for example,

2445
01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:29.180
looked at the distribution,

2446
01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.160
or better yet,

2447
01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.860
flip open to my field guide,

2448
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.510
Sasquatch field guy.

2449
01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.040
I have a Sasquatch guild guide,

2450
01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.270
isn't it?

2451
01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:38.781
It's yet.

2452
01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:39.614
So,

2453
01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:40.923
um,

2454
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.080
but there is a,

2455
01:08:42.081 --> 01:08:42.914
um,

2456
01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:43.910
if I can find it here,

2457
01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:47.810
there is a distribution map of a hypothetical distribution.

2458
01:08:48.230 --> 01:08:49.520
Where can I get one of those?

2459
01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.090
Um,

2460
01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:54.910
well I can give you a address to send a check to and get one dairy.

2461
01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:56.510
He just got money out of you.

2462
01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.310
How much this is a,

2463
01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.330
well with the,

2464
01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:00.950
with postage it would be 1150.

2465
01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.590
I'll take it in the United States for you.

2466
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.670
Merry Christmas buddy.

2467
01:09:04.690 --> 01:09:05.523
Anyway,

2468
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.320
but uh,

2469
01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:09.590
there there's a distribution map and what's interesting is it's very similar to

2470
01:09:09.591 --> 01:09:13.640
the distribution Matt for American black bears because there's another omnivore

2471
01:09:13.641 --> 01:09:14.850
that needs a certain amount of,

2472
01:09:14.851 --> 01:09:15.051
uh,

2473
01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:17.810
of productive habitat and a,

2474
01:09:17.811 --> 01:09:18.081
you know,

2475
01:09:18.081 --> 01:09:21.110
there's lots of space on that map where there's no,

2476
01:09:21.111 --> 01:09:21.500
uh,

2477
01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.810
there's no evidence of any of any Sasquatch existing you.

2478
01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:25.700
So your,

2479
01:09:25.701 --> 01:09:26.181
your,

2480
01:09:26.181 --> 01:09:27.014
um,

2481
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:31.700
your belief is that you're dealing with the Pacific northwest primarily and then

2482
01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:34.460
possibly a few other spots like Connecticut Shit.

2483
01:09:34.461 --> 01:09:34.820
Well,

2484
01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:34.961
the,

2485
01:09:34.961 --> 01:09:36.060
the backside of the apple is,

2486
01:09:36.061 --> 01:09:38.210
so if you go across the boreal forest to Canada,

2487
01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:41.410
right down the backside of the Appalachian in New England states,

2488
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:43.400
Connecticut,

2489
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:48.430
well it could be that's really densely populated state kind of hard,

2490
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.180
but down the backside of the appellation,

2491
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:54.710
even eastern Ohio,

2492
01:09:54.711 --> 01:09:55.090
it's PR.

2493
01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:56.900
It's surprising if you've ever been there.

2494
01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:57.420
Yeah.

2495
01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.940
There's some support for,

2496
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.290
so you believe Ohio,

2497
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:00.591
maybe?

2498
01:10:00.591 --> 01:10:02.050
Possibly Pennsylvania.

2499
01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:02.860
Uh,

2500
01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:03.080
yeah.

2501
01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.040
Western Pennsylvania,

2502
01:10:04.041 --> 01:10:04.730
Florida,

2503
01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:05.550
Florida.

2504
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:06.220
Sure.

2505
01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.550
Really some of that.

2506
01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:08.570
So now there's a lot of,

2507
01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.370
my experience has been,

2508
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:11.301
uh,

2509
01:10:11.301 --> 01:10:13.610
and for a long time I simply used the,

2510
01:10:13.611 --> 01:10:13.881
you know,

2511
01:10:13.881 --> 01:10:18.470
the easy caveat that I didn't have the time or resources to consider all the

2512
01:10:18.471 --> 01:10:19.880
evidence east of the Mississippi,

2513
01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:25.190
but my experience has been that the data that has come from those areas that

2514
01:10:25.191 --> 01:10:29.270
might corroborate such sidings is pretty scant.

2515
01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:32.480
And there's a lot of things that are just not credible.

2516
01:10:32.481 --> 01:10:32.690
What,

2517
01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:34.100
like math,

2518
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:35.660
like Meth,

2519
01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:36.571
a lot of math and,

2520
01:10:36.571 --> 01:10:38.840
but I think if you're seeing,

2521
01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:44.840
can you talk a little bit about the way that at big foot smells?

2522
01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.101
Well,

2523
01:10:46.101 --> 01:10:46.500
yeah.

2524
01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.350
Oftentimes in the [inaudible],

2525
01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:48.591
you know,

2526
01:10:48.591 --> 01:10:49.790
as a moniker that,

2527
01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:50.170
uh,

2528
01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:52.100
the derives from that suppose that stench.

2529
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:52.431
But,

2530
01:10:52.431 --> 01:10:53.120
uh,

2531
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.380
it's interesting when you look at this,

2532
01:10:54.381 --> 01:10:58.690
statistics collated from lots and lots of sightings.

2533
01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:02.440
A stench is only reported in about 10% of the,

2534
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:04.010
of the circle of the signings.

2535
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:09.550
That suggests to me that they don't continually smell badly to our,

2536
01:11:09.831 --> 01:11:10.521
to our nose,

2537
01:11:10.521 --> 01:11:12.680
but that they're capable of exuding the smell.

2538
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:16.560
A great apes like bike chimps and gorillas have very well developed axillary.

2539
01:11:16.561 --> 01:11:17.140
Oregon's,

2540
01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:17.490
um,

2541
01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:17.851
the,

2542
01:11:17.851 --> 01:11:18.630
uh,

2543
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.931
the,

2544
01:11:18.931 --> 01:11:19.320
uh,

2545
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.030
apple cringe sweat glands.

2546
01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:22.890
The things that when we sweat,

2547
01:11:22.891 --> 01:11:27.030
when we're nervous as opposed to the watery sweat that is used in evaporative

2548
01:11:27.031 --> 01:11:28.830
cooling and,

2549
01:11:28.831 --> 01:11:29.250
um,

2550
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:31.650
when animals are wind like gorillas,

2551
01:11:31.710 --> 01:11:32.510
Djing,

2552
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:33.360
Dian Fossey rather,

2553
01:11:33.361 --> 01:11:34.194
excuse me.

2554
01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:36.780
She describes the first time up silver back,

2555
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:37.890
bluff charged her,

2556
01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:39.420
came barreling down at her.

2557
01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:40.530
She hunkered down,

2558
01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:40.681
you know,

2559
01:11:40.681 --> 01:11:41.750
an averted her gaze and,

2560
01:11:41.751 --> 01:11:43.530
and it stopped just a foot short of her,

2561
01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:48.780
but she said she was nearly bowled over by this locker room sent that it was

2562
01:11:48.781 --> 01:11:49.614
emitting.

2563
01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:50.521
And,

2564
01:11:50.521 --> 01:11:50.910
uh,

2565
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:52.740
and she was probably a meeting one to by that point,

2566
01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.510
I imagine

2567
01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:55.820
<v 0>horrifying.</v>

2568
01:11:55.821 --> 01:11:56.481
That would be,

2569
01:11:56.481 --> 01:11:56.910
yeah,

2570
01:11:56.910 --> 01:12:00.270
you got a giant silver back charging you exactly.

2571
01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:01.011
So close.

2572
01:12:01.011 --> 01:12:02.600
You can smell it stank.

2573
01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:03.210
<v 2>So,</v>

2574
01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:06.260
so whether it's fear or um,

2575
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.650
uh,

2576
01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:09.100
tension or intimidation,

2577
01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:10.010
uh,

2578
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:12.980
they're probably capable of exuding that kind of smell under those

2579
01:12:12.981 --> 01:12:13.730
circumstances.

2580
01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:14.570
Just like a skunk,

2581
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.943
just like skunk

2582
01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:17.071
<v 0>yard.</v>

2583
01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:18.160
The other night and a,

2584
01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:21.470
I had explained to my daughter that you can't get too close to the Scott.

2585
01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.100
There was a skunk wandering in the backyard.

2586
01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:25.650
We have chickens and the skunk is found out we had chickens,

2587
01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:26.161
by the way,

2588
01:12:26.161 --> 01:12:27.300
skunks are murderers.

2589
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:27.871
Okay.

2590
01:12:27.871 --> 01:12:29.070
They're very carnivorous.

2591
01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:32.100
They're predators and they were looking to kill my chickens and they actually

2592
01:12:32.101 --> 01:12:32.940
drink their blood.

2593
01:12:32.941 --> 01:12:36.120
That's how they get ganged their neck and drink their blood.

2594
01:12:36.121 --> 01:12:37.020
So cute little skunks,

2595
01:12:37.021 --> 01:12:37.854
pepe Le Pew,

2596
01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:40.110
and not so much the little monsters,

2597
01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:40.891
but you know,

2598
01:12:40.891 --> 01:12:42.840
I had explained to where like I go,

2599
01:12:42.841 --> 01:12:44.280
if it gets you,

2600
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:47.400
the smell is unbelievably bad and you know,

2601
01:12:47.401 --> 01:12:47.921
she's five.

2602
01:12:47.921 --> 01:12:48.151
She's like,

2603
01:12:48.151 --> 01:12:49.050
I don't even know what you're talking about.

2604
01:12:49.051 --> 01:12:49.884
It doesn't smell at all.

2605
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:50.661
I'm like,

2606
01:12:50.661 --> 01:12:53.250
it can smell it's smells on purpose.

2607
01:12:53.251 --> 01:12:53.730
Sure.

2608
01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:54.451
That's a weird thing.

2609
01:12:54.451 --> 01:12:57.730
The ability to spray that stuff on purpose and they can only do it.

2610
01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.610
I heard they can only do it 10 times a year.

2611
01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.180
Skunks.

2612
01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.013
Yeah.

2613
01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:01.650
They can't,

2614
01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:03.630
they only have a certain amount that they could spray.

2615
01:13:03.631 --> 01:13:04.980
So whenever they spray,

2616
01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:06.930
they have to mean that rate of production.

2617
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:09.240
What's fascinating is that smell that,

2618
01:13:09.241 --> 01:13:09.630
um,

2619
01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:12.960
that we can recognize in just a small parts per million.

2620
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:14.670
That's how dogs smell loss.

2621
01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:16.020
Oh yeah.

2622
01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:16.741
Men Not so bad,

2623
01:13:16.741 --> 01:13:17.280
I'm sure.

2624
01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:21.540
But they can smell the availability to recognize us the way we could recognize

2625
01:13:21.541 --> 01:13:22.200
skunks,

2626
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:22.531
which is,

2627
01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:25.200
it really puts it in perspective because he's very few smells that are like

2628
01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:25.411
that,

2629
01:13:25.411 --> 01:13:30.180
that are squirted out by a small animal that can spread for blocks and blocks.

2630
01:13:30.181 --> 01:13:31.770
You know that when you're driving,

2631
01:13:31.771 --> 01:13:32.281
you're in your car,

2632
01:13:32.281 --> 01:13:33.480
you smell it through your events.

2633
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:34.160
Right.

2634
01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.090
It's super powerful.

2635
01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:41.330
So I'm mostly Pacific northwest or anywhere where there's large desk for us.

2636
01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:45.540
Who's the most credible I witnessed that you've ever talked to?

2637
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.511
<v 2>Oh,</v>

2638
01:13:47.511 --> 01:13:48.350
there'd been several.

2639
01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:48.980
One that,

2640
01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:52.010
that always comes to mind when I'm asked that though is,

2641
01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:52.360
uh,

2642
01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:52.890
uh,

2643
01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:57.890
a lady by the name of the Julie Davis who had a remarkable encounter in the

2644
01:13:59.150 --> 01:13:59.350
South San Juan's of,

2645
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.770
uh,

2646
01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:00.830
of Colorado.

2647
01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:06.250
She's a very avid goat packer and she's hiked the entire continental divide

2648
01:14:06.801 --> 01:14:08.210
trail through Colorado.

2649
01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:09.291
And,

2650
01:14:09.291 --> 01:14:09.530
uh,

2651
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:10.390
her story was,

2652
01:14:10.391 --> 01:14:10.700
uh,

2653
01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:14.140
was in the Denver post 'em in a big feature article,

2654
01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:14.981
but,

2655
01:14:14.981 --> 01:14:15.370
and I've,

2656
01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:17.500
I've spent over a month,

2657
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:17.801
uh,

2658
01:14:17.801 --> 01:14:18.370
in the,

2659
01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:21.760
in the back country with her and a couple other researchers and got to know her

2660
01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:24.010
very well and been in her home,

2661
01:14:24.011 --> 01:14:24.610
heard her,

2662
01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:25.620
recount her,

2663
01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:26.031
her,

2664
01:14:26.031 --> 01:14:26.470
uh,

2665
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:28.240
recollections over a campfire and,

2666
01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:29.381
and,

2667
01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:29.950
um,

2668
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:30.251
you know,

2669
01:14:30.251 --> 01:14:30.460
when,

2670
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:33.410
when someone has a shares that kind of experience or,

2671
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.671
well,

2672
01:14:33.671 --> 01:14:35.200
hers is worth retelling very quickly.

2673
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.030
She was off trail,

2674
01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:37.360
uh,

2675
01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:38.920
with her goats and a couple of dogs.

2676
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.330
The dogs were acting up.

2677
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.080
She suspected maybe that she was being stalked by a bear.

2678
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:44.331
And,

2679
01:14:44.331 --> 01:14:46.990
and there still are grizzlies in the supposedly still are grizzlies.

2680
01:14:46.991 --> 01:14:47.860
This is the area of the,

2681
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:50.110
the so called Ghost Grizzlies where they,

2682
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:51.820
they think they're extinct.

2683
01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:55.090
And then a hunter shoots one and it's a female and she's awfully obviously

2684
01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:56.560
suckled the cubs.

2685
01:14:56.561 --> 01:14:58.570
So there still are some grizzlies out there perhaps.

2686
01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.400
And what part of the south?

2687
01:15:00.401 --> 01:15:02.080
The Colorado Rockies.

2688
01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:02.660
Uh,

2689
01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:03.131
the Wyman.

2690
01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:04.750
Which country in the South San Juan's.

2691
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:06.250
But uh,

2692
01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.900
at one point she,

2693
01:15:07.901 --> 01:15:08.230
um,

2694
01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:09.910
her dogs were again acting up.

2695
01:15:09.911 --> 01:15:10.611
She was kind of on,

2696
01:15:10.611 --> 01:15:11.500
on the lookout.

2697
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:13.870
She didn't want her dogs to tangle with the bear,

2698
01:15:13.871 --> 01:15:17.170
so she was taking the dogs towards the tent and stepped into the tent and got

2699
01:15:17.171 --> 01:15:18.220
her pepper spray.

2700
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.180
And suddenly the goats approached the tent.

2701
01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:23.290
They weren't looking at her though.

2702
01:15:23.291 --> 01:15:25.210
They were looking up above the tent.

2703
01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:29.320
And so she stepped out thinking she was going to confront a bear and have to

2704
01:15:29.321 --> 01:15:30.154
spray it.

2705
01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:32.920
And they're standing right behind her tent.

2706
01:15:32.921 --> 01:15:34.840
So about from me to you,

2707
01:15:34.841 --> 01:15:39.820
I'm just a small dome tent is this eight foot tall hairy figure locking eyes

2708
01:15:39.821 --> 01:15:40.654
with her.

2709
01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.090
And this is in the middle of the afternoon in broad daylight.

2710
01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:45.010
And I have close quarters.

2711
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.811
She said,

2712
01:15:45.811 --> 01:15:46.240
um,

2713
01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.470
she looked at her,

2714
01:15:47.471 --> 01:15:48.490
it looked at the goats,

2715
01:15:48.491 --> 01:15:49.271
it looked back at her.

2716
01:15:49.271 --> 01:15:49.481
I mean,

2717
01:15:49.481 --> 01:15:52.600
this was apparently fascinated by these funny looking animals it hadn't

2718
01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:54.310
encountered before perhaps.

2719
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.870
And uh,

2720
01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:58.720
she said she had a sort of a subliminal,

2721
01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:00.370
a impression suddenly that,

2722
01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.310
that I won't bother you if you won't bother me.

2723
01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.150
And uh,

2724
01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:05.020
she said that,

2725
01:16:05.021 --> 01:16:05.290
uh,

2726
01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:06.520
when she had that wreck,

2727
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:10.870
that that sense it's demeanor kind of softened the edge,

2728
01:16:10.871 --> 01:16:11.550
sort of went off.

2729
01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:14.950
And at that point a second one that was standing right behind it,

2730
01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:16.150
a slightly smaller one,

2731
01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:20.770
peered out from around the bigger one and they sat and kind of stared at each

2732
01:16:20.771 --> 01:16:21.420
other for,

2733
01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:21.730
you know,

2734
01:16:21.730 --> 01:16:23.350
probably what seemed like an eternity.

2735
01:16:23.351 --> 01:16:26.650
It was just a few seconds and then they'd both turned and they headed off

2736
01:16:26.651 --> 01:16:28.130
towards the tree line and disappear.

2737
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:29.223
We going,

2738
01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:29.860
yeah,

2739
01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:30.693
exactly.

2740
01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.840
Have have a goat.

2741
01:16:34.841 --> 01:16:35.420
She didn't,

2742
01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:35.711
uh,

2743
01:16:35.711 --> 01:16:40.290
she didn't dare tell anyone for years about it because of the fear of the stigma

2744
01:16:40.291 --> 01:16:41.170
and God,

2745
01:16:41.171 --> 01:16:43.200
I would give enough.

2746
01:16:43.210 --> 01:16:43.780
That's true.

2747
01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:44.110
Yeah,

2748
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:44.630
exactly.

2749
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:46.120
Not even to it myself,

2750
01:16:46.121 --> 01:16:47.560
just to know that she was telling the truth.

2751
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.831
Well,

2752
01:16:47.831 --> 01:16:48.581
and as I said,

2753
01:16:48.581 --> 01:16:50.020
it's one thing to,

2754
01:16:50.050 --> 01:16:50.231
you know,

2755
01:16:50.231 --> 01:16:51.790
in your position to sit and,

2756
01:16:51.791 --> 01:16:52.181
well,

2757
01:16:52.181 --> 01:16:52.601
yeah,

2758
01:16:52.601 --> 01:16:52.871
you know,

2759
01:16:52.871 --> 01:16:53.351
it could be,

2760
01:16:53.351 --> 01:16:53.771
it could be,

2761
01:16:53.771 --> 01:16:54.870
it couldn't be right,

2762
01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:55.900
but when,

2763
01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:56.470
when you,

2764
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:59.800
when it's someone that you have come to know and you count as a friend,

2765
01:16:59.801 --> 01:17:01.210
as a close acquaintance,

2766
01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:02.553
then you know,

2767
01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:02.891
oh,

2768
01:17:02.891 --> 01:17:04.280
well you were mistaken.

2769
01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:04.511
You know,

2770
01:17:04.511 --> 01:17:06.970
it was just a bear standing upright from 10 feet away.

2771
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.231
You A,

2772
01:17:08.231 --> 01:17:08.471
you know,

2773
01:17:08.471 --> 01:17:10.880
you just imagined it or you've misinterpreted it.

2774
01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.790
Rain blew a fuse or you're lying to me,

2775
01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:14.270
you know,

2776
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:15.840
you're just making this up for attention.

2777
01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:16.040
There.

2778
01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.580
We spoke to one woman who had Barbara who had an incredibly compelling story.

2779
01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:20.190
Yup.

2780
01:17:20.190 --> 01:17:20.510
Hmm.

2781
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:21.111
So we,

2782
01:17:21.111 --> 01:17:21.501
yeah,

2783
01:17:21.501 --> 01:17:21.711
I've,

2784
01:17:21.711 --> 01:17:23.840
I've talked to people that have stories and make you just go,

2785
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:24.910
whoa boy.

2786
01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.270
Which I knew well,

2787
01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:26.421
yeah,

2788
01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:27.860
people are having experiences.

2789
01:17:27.861 --> 01:17:28.160
Again,

2790
01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.710
it comes back to this issue of,

2791
01:17:30.090 --> 01:17:32.030
of how do you interpret those experiences?

2792
01:17:32.031 --> 01:17:33.320
How credible are they?

2793
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:36.950
That's really going to be where the madness is because you can't discount unique

2794
01:17:36.951 --> 01:17:37.784
experiences.

2795
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:38.840
You really can't.

2796
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:39.411
You can't.

2797
01:17:39.411 --> 01:17:39.900
And,

2798
01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:43.580
but I always kind of push for the corroboration.

2799
01:17:43.581 --> 01:17:43.790
You know,

2800
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:45.890
I want to see an associated footprint.

2801
01:17:45.891 --> 01:17:47.950
I want to see a strand of hair that,

2802
01:17:47.951 --> 01:17:51.620
that matches that sort of a standard or that,

2803
01:17:51.621 --> 01:17:51.801
uh,

2804
01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:52.191
that,

2805
01:17:52.191 --> 01:17:52.700
um,

2806
01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:53.481
arc type of,

2807
01:17:53.481 --> 01:17:55.750
of the hair of Sasquatch that that's kind of the,

2808
01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:56.480
the,

2809
01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.710
the gold standard you'd see,

2810
01:17:57.711 --> 01:17:58.544
I guess.

2811
01:17:58.710 --> 01:17:59.543
Um,

2812
01:17:59.570 --> 01:18:00.403
because then,

2813
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:04.160
then there's another dimension to it that takes some of the subjectivity out of

2814
01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.250
the evaluation of the experience for me anyway.

2815
01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.990
Is this your full time job?

2816
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:10.280
No,

2817
01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:10.550
no,

2818
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.761
no.

2819
01:18:10.761 --> 01:18:11.031
I mean,

2820
01:18:11.031 --> 01:18:11.270
I'm,

2821
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:12.050
I teach,

2822
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:13.220
I do research.

2823
01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:18.080
I publish on a hominid evolution and bipedalism.

2824
01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:18.940
Um,

2825
01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:19.310
it,

2826
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:21.230
it takes a significant amount,

2827
01:18:21.231 --> 01:18:24.020
but I see it as one facet,

2828
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:26.150
a very complimentary facet to my,

2829
01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:27.171
my other research,

2830
01:18:27.171 --> 01:18:30.950
some of the insights that I've gained from studying carefully.

2831
01:18:30.951 --> 01:18:32.780
The Sasquatch footprints have actually,

2832
01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:33.920
uh,

2833
01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:38.920
fueled new interpretations of some of the Hominid footprint evidence that have,

2834
01:18:38.991 --> 01:18:39.381
uh,

2835
01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:40.010
that have,

2836
01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:40.760
uh,

2837
01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:44.330
caused me to advocate some different alternate interpretations of some of that

2838
01:18:44.331 --> 01:18:47.120
early evidence besides big foot.

2839
01:18:47.121 --> 01:18:51.440
What are the other big foot like creatures that you believe possibly exist?

2840
01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.333
Right.

2841
01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:53.550
Well there that,

2842
01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:53.751
you know,

2843
01:18:53.751 --> 01:18:54.910
there's the reports of all,

2844
01:18:54.911 --> 01:18:56.420
all around the globe of,

2845
01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:57.830
of different sorts of things,

2846
01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:58.910
not all related.

2847
01:18:58.911 --> 01:18:59.210
Now,

2848
01:18:59.210 --> 01:18:59.751
interestingly,

2849
01:18:59.751 --> 01:19:02.420
there's reports of very Sasquatch,

2850
01:19:02.421 --> 01:19:07.421
like creatures in eastern Russia and China and even down in Southeast Asia.

2851
01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:08.870
Uh,

2852
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:09.261
in fact,

2853
01:19:09.261 --> 01:19:10.760
you could go up from Southeast Asia,

2854
01:19:10.761 --> 01:19:11.450
Cross Mine,

2855
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:12.110
Amar,

2856
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:13.220
northeast India,

2857
01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:16.670
along the foothills of the Himalayas up around the premiere.

2858
01:19:16.671 --> 01:19:18.980
And Altai ranges on the border in Mongolia.

2859
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.870
Even as far a west is the caucuses between the Caspian and black seas.

2860
01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:29.260
There are these gigantic reports and evidence of gigantic footprints left by

2861
01:19:30.021 --> 01:19:31.820
large bipedal creatures.

2862
01:19:31.821 --> 01:19:32.990
Very similar to Sasquatch.

2863
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:35.270
Mid tarsal braked in the footprints.

2864
01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.350
Well,

2865
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:39.890
we have a much scanter fossil record.

2866
01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:41.210
They resemble,

2867
01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:41.661
I mean,

2868
01:19:41.661 --> 01:19:43.950
one of the tracks from the Caucasus that a research effect.

2869
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:45.980
I'm going to the caucuses this August,

2870
01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:46.791
uh,

2871
01:19:46.791 --> 01:19:50.170
to work with this researcher who came back with a footprint that was cast by a

2872
01:19:50.171 --> 01:19:51.004
villager,

2873
01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:51.441
uh,

2874
01:19:51.441 --> 01:19:52.800
from a long line of tracks that,

2875
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:57.850
that most of the village witnessed of a big hairy creature that walked to walk

2876
01:19:57.861 --> 01:19:58.431
through this,

2877
01:19:58.431 --> 01:19:58.760
um,

2878
01:19:58.760 --> 01:19:59.170
this,

2879
01:19:59.170 --> 01:19:59.300
uh,

2880
01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:00.230
fallow field.

2881
01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:01.573
Um,

2882
01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:02.030
they,

2883
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:05.030
they resemble remarkably the Sasquatch footprint.

2884
01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:05.720
Uh,

2885
01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:10.720
so this might be the former range of gigantic pithiness or giant per anthropics

2886
01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:13.050
or some other hominid.

2887
01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:14.160
Um,

2888
01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:14.491
then there's,

2889
01:20:14.491 --> 01:20:16.710
there's the Himalayan Yeti and a,

2890
01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:20.070
there is unfortunately scant evidence for it.

2891
01:20:20.071 --> 01:20:24.590
I've gone through as systematically as possible and evaluated all the footprint

2892
01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.900
evidence attributed Yeti.

2893
01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:28.170
Much of it's just unintelligible.

2894
01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:29.063
The snow,

2895
01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:29.250
you know,

2896
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:31.260
the prince of melted out or sublimated,

2897
01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:31.730
you know,

2898
01:20:31.730 --> 01:20:33.690
where the snow evaporates at the high altitude.

2899
01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:34.800
Uh,

2900
01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:38.220
another significant fraction or bears absolutely bears.

2901
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:41.820
And it boils down to probably two specimens,

2902
01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:42.683
the famous,

2903
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:43.201
uh,

2904
01:20:43.201 --> 01:20:47.010
shipped and photo from the mainland glacier back in the fifties.

2905
01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:47.910
What's the name of that?

2906
01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:48.210
Uh,

2907
01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:49.080
Eric Shipton.

2908
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:51.430
S.

2909
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.430
H.

2910
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.430
I.

2911
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.430
P.

2912
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.430
T.

2913
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.430
O.

2914
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.430
N.

2915
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.580
Yup.

2916
01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:52.413
[inaudible].

2917
01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.000
And another one that's,

2918
01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:58.830
I find even much more compelling is the McNeely Kronen footprint,

2919
01:20:58.890 --> 01:21:00.060
the money McNeely Cron,

2920
01:21:00.061 --> 01:21:03.430
an expedition to the Aaron Valley in,

2921
01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:04.080
um,

2922
01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:04.980
in the Himalayas.

2923
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:06.630
Um,

2924
01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:11.310
those suggested a creature that's actually probably much more akin to this

2925
01:21:11.311 --> 01:21:12.144
individual.

2926
01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:16.470
They exhibit a opposable or a divergent big toe.

2927
01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.261
In fact,

2928
01:21:17.261 --> 01:21:21.660
the McNeely Kronen particularly look just like an oversized chimpanzee with

2929
01:21:21.661 --> 01:21:23.040
short stout digits.

2930
01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:27.293
Hold this up.

2931
01:21:28.710 --> 01:21:30.030
So you feel like the Yeti,

2932
01:21:30.031 --> 01:21:31.680
my possibly if it's real,

2933
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.220
my possibly would be a different animal rather different undisclosed,

2934
01:21:35.221 --> 01:21:35.550
right.

2935
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:39.120
Probably probably one that's still our boreal that lives not up in the

2936
01:21:39.150 --> 01:21:40.890
snowfields but down in the,

2937
01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:41.730
uh,

2938
01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:44.580
sub tropical temperate valleys of the high,

2939
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:46.170
mid Himalayas,

2940
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.390
I guess you'd say like the Aaron Valley.

2941
01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:49.750
I mean,

2942
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:50.400
McNeely,

2943
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.260
Jeff McNeely and had had chron and we're,

2944
01:21:52.290 --> 01:21:52.651
we're,

2945
01:21:52.651 --> 01:21:53.100
um,

2946
01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:53.700
uh,

2947
01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:58.080
biologists who were conducting a two year biological survey,

2948
01:21:58.081 --> 01:21:59.490
the wildlife in that area,

2949
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:01.230
wildlife and the flora.

2950
01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:02.850
And so when they,

2951
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:06.540
when they woke up one morning and found the line of tracks that came up a very

2952
01:22:06.541 --> 01:22:09.360
steep slope through three feet of snow by Peterlee,

2953
01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:10.410
uh,

2954
01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:14.370
on a ridge leading to pass that they were just about to go over themselves,

2955
01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:15.690
made a detour,

2956
01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:18.540
meandered in amongst the brightly colored tents,

2957
01:22:18.541 --> 01:22:22.260
and then continued on over the past and they lost the trail in a Rhododendron

2958
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.070
ticket.

2959
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:25.200
But here were these chimpanzee,

2960
01:22:25.201 --> 01:22:27.450
like very large chimpanzee like footprints.

2961
01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:28.490
Do you,

2962
01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:29.190
um,

2963
01:22:29.190 --> 01:22:29.700
do you,

2964
01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:29.971
what,

2965
01:22:29.971 --> 01:22:33.090
what's your take on aliens or extra terrestrials?

2966
01:22:33.091 --> 01:22:34.170
Do you believe in Ufos?

2967
01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:34.740
Well,

2968
01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:35.130
uh,

2969
01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:35.341
you know,

2970
01:22:35.341 --> 01:22:36.720
and I always just chew that,

2971
01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.381
that term,

2972
01:22:37.381 --> 01:22:39.630
believe it doesn't matter if I believe or not,

2973
01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:40.530
but uh,

2974
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:40.821
I,

2975
01:22:40.821 --> 01:22:43.530
I've not busied myself with the evidence.

2976
01:22:43.531 --> 01:22:43.980
I mean,

2977
01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:47.580
I saw a Ufo and unidentified flying object myself one time.

2978
01:22:47.581 --> 01:22:49.230
We are out looking at stars with,

2979
01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:49.550
you know,

2980
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:50.383
a date.

2981
01:22:50.610 --> 01:22:52.630
Do you think big foot positive he was in that unit?

2982
01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:52.780
No,

2983
01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:53.613
I don't think so.

2984
01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:54.891
I don't think so.

2985
01:22:54.891 --> 01:22:56.000
I never know until you're doing that,

2986
01:22:56.010 --> 01:23:00.240
you can imagine that what a mind fuck I would be then puts from another planet

2987
01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:01.380
and it just lands in,

2988
01:23:01.381 --> 01:23:03.360
likes to go for walks through the woods just like everybody else.

2989
01:23:03.810 --> 01:23:05.620
All I saw was it was a point of light,

2990
01:23:05.621 --> 01:23:05.771
you know,

2991
01:23:05.771 --> 01:23:05.921
when,

2992
01:23:05.921 --> 01:23:06.120
when,

2993
01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:06.701
when we were kids,

2994
01:23:06.701 --> 01:23:10.450
we would sleep out on the sun deck and we'd count the satellites as they went

2995
01:23:10.451 --> 01:23:13.090
over and then a very particular kind of oblique orbits.

2996
01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.380
This thing was going north to south and which would have been fine except that

2997
01:23:17.381 --> 01:23:18.810
it executed to RightAngle.

2998
01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:19.990
Turns in succession.

2999
01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:20.290
I mean,

3000
01:23:20.290 --> 01:23:21.450
absolutely right.

3001
01:23:21.451 --> 01:23:22.091
Angle turns.

3002
01:23:22.091 --> 01:23:24.940
Just as sharp as if you put a square up there in the sky and,

3003
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:26.531
and so I,

3004
01:23:26.531 --> 01:23:27.050
you know,

3005
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:28.990
both our jaws dropped and did you see that?

3006
01:23:28.991 --> 01:23:29.280
Yeah.

3007
01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:33.150
<v 0>Maybe there's the government because it's trying to throw you off this big foot</v>

3008
01:23:33.151 --> 01:23:34.380
thing by making you look good

3009
01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:35.403
<v 2>this more.</v>

3010
01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:36.720
This was way before that.

3011
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:37.780
This was back in college.

3012
01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:41.070
Maybe they have a time machine and they knew that you were going to be one of

3013
01:23:41.071 --> 01:23:42.020
the most prime it.

3014
01:23:43.230 --> 01:23:45.780
Well that's the thing about a big for research,

3015
01:23:46.190 --> 01:23:47.520
all these conspiracy theories.

3016
01:23:47.521 --> 01:23:48.960
If there's men in black out there,

3017
01:23:48.961 --> 01:23:49.350
you know,

3018
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:51.720
harassing and intimidating these,

3019
01:23:51.721 --> 01:23:52.800
a big fit investigators,

3020
01:23:53.130 --> 01:23:54.210
either I'm a good,

3021
01:23:54.211 --> 01:23:56.940
a disseminator of disinformation or something.

3022
01:23:56.941 --> 01:23:58.590
Cause no one's ever shown up at my lab.

3023
01:23:58.620 --> 01:23:59.490
They don't bother you at all.

3024
01:23:59.550 --> 01:24:00.470
They haven't ever bothered me.

3025
01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.150
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3026
01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:04.060
So the idea is you probably work for the CIA.

3027
01:24:04.090 --> 01:24:04.660
That's right.

3028
01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:08.230
You trained underground as hypnotic soothing voice.

3029
01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.030
You get around the stoners,

3030
01:24:10.031 --> 01:24:11.680
convinced them big foot exists,

3031
01:24:11.710 --> 01:24:12.970
leave little bread crumb trails,

3032
01:24:12.971 --> 01:24:13.510
you know,

3033
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:15.430
you're the one with that bag of hairs.

3034
01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:16.363
<v 2>I knew,</v>

3035
01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:17.270
I know.

3036
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:18.103
You're right.

3037
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.950
That's it.

3038
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:20.300
You're already a government agent.

3039
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:21.140
<v 0>Um,</v>

3040
01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:21.591
the,

3041
01:24:21.591 --> 01:24:22.400
uh,

3042
01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:22.641
the,

3043
01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:27.641
the possibility that Sasquatch predated humans in North America,

3044
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.880
uh,

3045
01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:29.900
you brought that up.

3046
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:34.070
What about the possibility that there some sort of a hybrid between humans and

3047
01:24:34.071 --> 01:24:34.904
Sasquatch?

3048
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.510
Is that,

3049
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:36.140
<v 2>yeah,</v>

3050
01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:37.430
I think it's very unlikely.

3051
01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:38.150
I mean,

3052
01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:42.200
I actually am aware of a couple of interesting stories from native American

3053
01:24:42.201 --> 01:24:44.390
sources that suggests that,

3054
01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:45.021
that,

3055
01:24:45.021 --> 01:24:45.290
uh,

3056
01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:47.330
that there was the possibility of,

3057
01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.140
of,

3058
01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:48.560
uh,

3059
01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.120
interview.

3060
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:49.730
So

3061
01:24:49.730 --> 01:24:51.350
<v 0>you feel like there's a Yeti,</v>

3062
01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:53.240
which may or may not exist,

3063
01:24:53.241 --> 01:24:53.931
but if it does,

3064
01:24:53.931 --> 01:24:55.310
is it completely different species?

3065
01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.020
And then there's a Sasquatch.

3066
01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:02.380
There has been some talk about hybrids and including the Melba Catchum DNA

3067
01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:03.741
results,

3068
01:25:03.741 --> 01:25:08.741
which she reports to indicate some sort of a human and a primate unknown,

3069
01:25:10.161 --> 01:25:11.060
primate hybrid.

3070
01:25:11.061 --> 01:25:11.301
What do you,

3071
01:25:11.301 --> 01:25:12.830
how do you feel about the results of those?

3072
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.391
<v 2>Uh,</v>

3073
01:25:13.391 --> 01:25:14.530
I don't hold those in,

3074
01:25:14.531 --> 01:25:14.861
in,

3075
01:25:14.861 --> 01:25:15.280
uh,

3076
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.460
in very high regard.

3077
01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.200
I don't think that her results are that credible,

3078
01:25:20.201 --> 01:25:20.801
reliable,

3079
01:25:20.801 --> 01:25:24.760
and certainly her interpretation of the data is highly questionable.

3080
01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.840
<v 4>Important to note that when you say a human Sasquatch hybrid,</v>

3081
01:25:28.841 --> 01:25:32.680
what you're saying is that someone wasn't just lucky enough to discover a big

3082
01:25:32.681 --> 01:25:33.190
foot,

3083
01:25:33.190 --> 01:25:35.490
but they were also able to make love with the big,

3084
01:25:35.491 --> 01:25:35.730
yeah,

3085
01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:39.930
<v 0>well we're talking about a long time ago and most likely they didn't even make</v>

3086
01:25:39.931 --> 01:25:40.681
love with a big foot.

3087
01:25:40.681 --> 01:25:43.020
They made love with another thing and created big foot.

3088
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.811
<v 2>That's the idea.</v>

3089
01:25:43.811 --> 01:25:44.171
That's,

3090
01:25:44.171 --> 01:25:44.691
that's her,

3091
01:25:44.691 --> 01:25:45.700
her thesis.

3092
01:25:45.710 --> 01:25:46.543
Yeah.

3093
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:50.650
It's not being looked at with a rose colored glasses.

3094
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:52.300
I mean even setting the,

3095
01:25:52.301 --> 01:25:54.370
in any suppose a data aside for a moment,

3096
01:25:54.371 --> 01:25:55.890
just to think about the,

3097
01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:56.701
the,

3098
01:25:56.701 --> 01:25:59.290
the feasibility of that scenario.

3099
01:25:59.291 --> 01:26:02.530
You have to have two populations that are at least close enough that they're

3100
01:26:02.531 --> 01:26:05.990
going to produce a viable and a fertile offspring.

3101
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:11.090
And yet they're different enough that that offspring isn't subsumed into one or

3102
01:26:11.091 --> 01:26:13.230
the other of the parental population and,

3103
01:26:13.231 --> 01:26:13.731
and just,

3104
01:26:13.731 --> 01:26:14.150
you know,

3105
01:26:14.150 --> 01:26:16.070
diluted back into the gene pool.

3106
01:26:16.230 --> 01:26:20.000
They remain distinct and then the cross has have to be frequent enough.

3107
01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:20.601
The,

3108
01:26:20.601 --> 01:26:20.901
the,

3109
01:26:20.901 --> 01:26:21.141
you know,

3110
01:26:21.141 --> 01:26:21.974
the,

3111
01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.780
the hook hooking up.

3112
01:26:23.781 --> 01:26:24.011
But,

3113
01:26:24.011 --> 01:26:24.201
uh,

3114
01:26:24.201 --> 01:26:25.034
yeah,

3115
01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:27.043
that there's,

3116
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:32.440
that there's a substantial population than that that accrues and,

3117
01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:37.280
and that becomes Sasquatch and somehow gets from Europe to North America and

3118
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:42.310
other parts of Asia and relinquishes all material culture and,

3119
01:26:42.801 --> 01:26:44.840
and other accoutrements of humanity.

3120
01:26:44.841 --> 01:26:45.710
And I mean,

3121
01:26:45.711 --> 01:26:46.010
it just,

3122
01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:46.910
it kind of a,

3123
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:48.163
<v 0>not only that,</v>

3124
01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:49.580
how big must that thing have been?

3125
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:53.090
People are our size and then there's Sasquatch,

3126
01:26:53.091 --> 01:26:53.924
which is even bigger.

3127
01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:57.020
This thing had to be even bigger than Sasquatch and had sex with a person made

3128
01:26:57.021 --> 01:26:57.591
something in the middle.

3129
01:26:57.591 --> 01:26:57.801
Right.

3130
01:26:57.801 --> 01:26:58.460
Does it work that way?

3131
01:26:58.460 --> 01:26:58.671
No,

3132
01:26:58.671 --> 01:26:59.091
it doesn't.

3133
01:26:59.091 --> 01:26:59.330
Yeah.

3134
01:26:59.330 --> 01:27:00.500
Science has not worked that way.

3135
01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:01.880
Do you know why it doesn't north that way?

3136
01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.073
Laggers.

3137
01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:05.890
Laggers are way bigger than tigers or lions,

3138
01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:06.170
Huh?

3139
01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:06.640
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

3140
01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:07.010
Cool.

3141
01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:07.310
Yeah.

3142
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.760
I mean,

3143
01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.330
there,

3144
01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:08.810
there are,

3145
01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:08.961
yeah,

3146
01:27:08.961 --> 01:27:10.670
you can point to examples,

3147
01:27:10.671 --> 01:27:10.781
uh,

3148
01:27:10.781 --> 01:27:11.614
that they do.

3149
01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:16.190
Lions and tigers really aren't good biological species because they do,

3150
01:27:16.191 --> 01:27:16.491
when the,

3151
01:27:16.491 --> 01:27:17.600
when the opportunity presents,

3152
01:27:17.601 --> 01:27:19.910
they do cross and produce viable offspring,

3153
01:27:19.930 --> 01:27:22.370
but the viable offsprings are sterile or they not.

3154
01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:22.971
No.

3155
01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:26.700
Ligers my understanding is that laggers are not sterile real debt.

3156
01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:26.980
Yeah.

3157
01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:27.650
That you can,

3158
01:27:27.650 --> 01:27:28.610
you could breed,

3159
01:27:28.611 --> 01:27:29.650
you can in fact,

3160
01:27:29.651 --> 01:27:29.840
uh,

3161
01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:30.590
one of,

3162
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:32.780
not Pocatello's but eastern Idaho,

3163
01:27:32.781 --> 01:27:34.850
his claim to fame was lagger town,

3164
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:39.000
a couple of unscrupulous individuals that were,

3165
01:27:39.001 --> 01:27:39.980
were breeding and,

3166
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:41.390
but not taking good care of them.

3167
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:43.220
And all heck broke,

3168
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:46.490
broke loose when they showed up outside of a school playground.

3169
01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:51.760
The laggers and oh well they found well beaten paths where they were getting out

3170
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:55.250
on a regular basis before they were finally discovered.

3171
01:27:55.251 --> 01:27:55.880
And yeah,

3172
01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.270
it was,

3173
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.870
it was pretty easy.

3174
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:57.231
But that,

3175
01:27:57.231 --> 01:27:58.250
but that's an interesting,

3176
01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.870
interesting possible scenario.

3177
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.980
Now I,

3178
01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:03.440
I started to mention that there's a couple of native American,

3179
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.771
uh,

3180
01:28:03.771 --> 01:28:05.360
accounts that suggest,

3181
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:05.751
you know,

3182
01:28:05.751 --> 01:28:07.700
there's always been this theme of abduction,

3183
01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:08.630
of,

3184
01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:09.261
of the,

3185
01:28:09.261 --> 01:28:09.500
uh,

3186
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:09.710
you know,

3187
01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:09.951
the,

3188
01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:13.760
the Sasquatch abducting a human females.

3189
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:18.140
But the only two that I'm aware of upon which I can base any,

3190
01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:18.590
you know,

3191
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:23.210
any evaluation reported that there was a pregnancy,

3192
01:28:23.211 --> 01:28:24.170
there was a birth,

3193
01:28:24.171 --> 01:28:26.690
but the individual grew very rapidly,

3194
01:28:26.691 --> 01:28:31.691
very sickly and died and was stunted mentally and died before the,

3195
01:28:32.361 --> 01:28:32.631
you know,

3196
01:28:32.631 --> 01:28:37.250
reaching teen years suggesting it wasn't viable and probably wouldn't have been

3197
01:28:37.251 --> 01:28:37.880
fertile.

3198
01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:39.050
And this is an abduction.

3199
01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:40.213
Yeah.

3200
01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.330
Big Foot abducted.

3201
01:28:41.331 --> 01:28:46.331
A native American woman soldier brought her back and she had a baby that died.

3202
01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:49.220
Why did he bring her back?

3203
01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.080
Or She got away or whatever.

3204
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:52.240
<v 0>I knew she was annoying.</v>

3205
01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:53.253
Yeah,

3206
01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:55.260
pretty big foot.

3207
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:56.380
Thought it'd be really cool.

3208
01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.070
You know,

3209
01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:58.270
it's like a lot of hookups.

3210
01:28:58.720 --> 01:28:59.950
You build it up in your mind,

3211
01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:00.701
you know,

3212
01:29:00.701 --> 01:29:02.730
and then get together with her and the reality sets in.

3213
01:29:02.731 --> 01:29:03.480
Yeah.

3214
01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.490
Maybe she's anonymous stack with big foot.

3215
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.540
<v 2>I mean,</v>

3216
01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.600
they sound like just so stories.

3217
01:29:08.601 --> 01:29:08.991
But you know,

3218
01:29:08.991 --> 01:29:13.490
we have some precedent Barouti gal because the Orangutan Lady,

3219
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:15.050
a researcher,

3220
01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:18.630
she and her book reflections of Eden recounts a,

3221
01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:19.100
uh,

3222
01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:21.260
an instance where at a provisioning station,

3223
01:29:21.261 --> 01:29:22.520
her native,

3224
01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:23.510
um,

3225
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:27.050
assistant was accosted by a young male,

3226
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:27.980
uh,

3227
01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:30.410
orangutan who completed the deed.

3228
01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:31.700
And uh,

3229
01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:32.690
but he had been,

3230
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:33.650
he was a hurry,

3231
01:29:33.651 --> 01:29:35.780
habituated or a repatriated,

3232
01:29:35.781 --> 01:29:37.880
I guess you'd say rehabilitate.

3233
01:29:37.881 --> 01:29:41.750
I'm not sure what the proper term is there one that had been confiscated and

3234
01:29:41.751 --> 01:29:44.480
then raised in and trained to return to the woods.

3235
01:29:44.481 --> 01:29:47.750
So it had some contact with humans previously,

3236
01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:48.500
but the,

3237
01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:52.490
but the point simply being is that that scenario is not completely out of the

3238
01:29:52.491 --> 01:29:53.324
question.

3239
01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:58.340
The question is what's the probability of there being a successful impregnation

3240
01:29:58.550 --> 01:30:00.800
between two different species now

3241
01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:02.200
<v 0>I have never stopped.</v>

3242
01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:03.323
Yeah.

3243
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:09.390
It seems like if an orangutan had made love to a woman that I would have heard

3244
01:30:09.791 --> 01:30:10.750
of that by now.

3245
01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:11.710
And you would have to,

3246
01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:12.633
I don't think so.

3247
01:30:12.730 --> 01:30:14.020
There's that lady in Connecticut,

3248
01:30:14.021 --> 01:30:14.854
there was almost,

3249
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:16.630
almost definitely sleeping with her chimp.

3250
01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.540
She was given it wine and Xanax and slept in the bed with her.

3251
01:30:19.541 --> 01:30:20.770
It was very jealous of her.

3252
01:30:21.730 --> 01:30:23.110
She's probably having sex with that thing.

3253
01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:26.500
But this is different from being on an expedition and having it rang a tank

3254
01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:28.780
barrel out of the forest and fuck you.

3255
01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.171
Yeah.

3256
01:30:29.171 --> 01:30:31.840
But I think it's probably pretty standard for rang tanks.

3257
01:30:31.870 --> 01:30:32.411
They're bigger,

3258
01:30:32.411 --> 01:30:32.951
were smaller.

3259
01:30:32.951 --> 01:30:34.480
They fucked us standard.

3260
01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:35.800
I think that's what they do when they're horny.

3261
01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:37.360
I don't think they really think about it.

3262
01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:39.520
There would be a blog dedicated to it.

3263
01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:40.190
Uh,

3264
01:30:40.190 --> 01:30:43.120
just not enough contact with people with cell phones that live.

3265
01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.180
This was a Pandora's box,

3266
01:30:46.181 --> 01:30:46.870
wasn't it?

3267
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:48.460
Solo show is a Pandora's box.

3268
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.480
Sorry,

3269
01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:50.350
I apologize for that.

3270
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:51.131
The,

3271
01:30:51.131 --> 01:30:51.820
um,

3272
01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:53.770
the Jane Goodall quote,

3273
01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:54.191
boy,

3274
01:30:54.191 --> 01:30:58.720
when Jane Goodall came out and said that she believes 100%,

3275
01:30:58.930 --> 01:31:00.370
that Sasquatch is a real animal.

3276
01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:01.263
Did you go,

3277
01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:03.940
you must've been so pumped.

3278
01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:04.491
<v 2>Well,</v>

3279
01:31:04.491 --> 01:31:05.360
I followed up and,

3280
01:31:05.361 --> 01:31:05.650
uh,

3281
01:31:05.650 --> 01:31:06.310
and uh,

3282
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:11.310
and saw and tried to see if she would read my book manuscript and possibly

3283
01:31:11.361 --> 01:31:11.781
endorse it,

3284
01:31:11.781 --> 01:31:12.381
which she did.

3285
01:31:12.381 --> 01:31:15.440
So the cover of my book boasts and endorsement from,

3286
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:16.360
from Dr Goodall.

3287
01:31:16.361 --> 01:31:17.960
So have you spoken with her?

3288
01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:19.640
I have a couple of times.

3289
01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:23.180
What's her number one thing that she locks onto as far as both,

3290
01:31:23.210 --> 01:31:25.670
one of the things that really impressed her was the,

3291
01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:26.000
uh,

3292
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:26.361
the,

3293
01:31:26.361 --> 01:31:26.781
the,

3294
01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:26.931
uh,

3295
01:31:26.931 --> 01:31:31.430
accounts by native Americans that she's come to become acquainted with.

3296
01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:33.350
And the fact that they,

3297
01:31:33.550 --> 01:31:35.570
that they've had these encounters and that they,

3298
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.470
uh,

3299
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:39.980
that their oral traditions are so deep rooted about interactions and,

3300
01:31:39.981 --> 01:31:40.250
you know,

3301
01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:41.850
encounters with these creatures that they are,

3302
01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:42.713
they're part of the,

3303
01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:45.560
of the real landscape as well as,

3304
01:31:45.561 --> 01:31:45.980
you know,

3305
01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:47.270
as with so many animals,

3306
01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:50.330
the native American stories often have,

3307
01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:50.511
are,

3308
01:31:50.511 --> 01:31:50.690
are,

3309
01:31:50.690 --> 01:31:51.650
are very metaphorical,

3310
01:31:51.651 --> 01:31:53.690
very like Aesop's fables,

3311
01:31:53.691 --> 01:31:53.881
a,

3312
01:31:53.881 --> 01:31:54.050
you know,

3313
01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:54.883
convey,

3314
01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:56.750
convey morals and so forth.

3315
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:57.440
And so they are,

3316
01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:02.440
oftentimes the animals are anthropomorphic characteristics and or supernatural

3317
01:32:02.951 --> 01:32:04.030
characteristics.

3318
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:05.410
But that doesn't change the fact that,

3319
01:32:05.411 --> 01:32:05.720
you know,

3320
01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:06.553
the clever,

3321
01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:07.410
um,

3322
01:32:07.410 --> 01:32:07.700
and,

3323
01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:11.350
and trickster coyote is based on a real species of animal.

3324
01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.690
So the wild man of the woods is probably the same.

3325
01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:15.820
What does Jane Goodall think of this footage?

3326
01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:16.691
You know what,

3327
01:32:16.691 --> 01:32:17.051
I haven't,

3328
01:32:17.051 --> 01:32:17.350
uh,

3329
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:19.240
I haven't had that opportunity.

3330
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.490
Our,

3331
01:32:19.490 --> 01:32:21.490
our conversations have always been very brief.

3332
01:32:21.491 --> 01:32:22.090
Unfortunately,

3333
01:32:22.090 --> 01:32:24.490
we haven't had the opportunity to sit down and speak at any great length,

3334
01:32:24.491 --> 01:32:25.120
but,

3335
01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:25.660
uh,

3336
01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:27.580
so I don't know what she would say about the,

3337
01:32:27.581 --> 01:32:28.331
about the footage.

3338
01:32:28.331 --> 01:32:31.960
What was your background before you became intoxicated with the bigfoot legend?

3339
01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:32.980
Right.

3340
01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:33.161
Well,

3341
01:32:33.161 --> 01:32:33.580
my,

3342
01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:37.810
my training is in anatomical sciences with an emphasis in physical anthropology.

3343
01:32:37.811 --> 01:32:39.220
So much of my day is spent,

3344
01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:39.460
uh,

3345
01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:41.080
teaching human gross anatomy,

3346
01:32:41.081 --> 01:32:45.370
full body dissection lab course to a health professions programs.

3347
01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:46.301
So,

3348
01:32:46.301 --> 01:32:46.601
you know,

3349
01:32:46.601 --> 01:32:50.590
I've been involved with the dissection of hundreds and hundreds of human bodies

3350
01:32:50.591 --> 01:32:53.130
know that machinery inside out.

3351
01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:53.950
Uh,

3352
01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:57.820
my research revolves around the evolution of human adaptations,

3353
01:32:57.821 --> 01:33:01.090
particularly those for walking on two legs and,

3354
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:03.300
and more specifically the interpretation of,

3355
01:33:03.301 --> 01:33:03.791
of foot,

3356
01:33:03.791 --> 01:33:05.490
form and function as it relates to,

3357
01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:06.850
to bipedalism,

3358
01:33:06.851 --> 01:33:11.851
an Arborio quality and other other primates like the great apes and monkeys.

3359
01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:14.770
You're living in Washington state,

3360
01:33:14.771 --> 01:33:15.390
is that where you live?

3361
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:16.150
Idaho,

3362
01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:16.983
state of Idaho,

3363
01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.360
Idaho State University and Woodsy out there,

3364
01:33:19.361 --> 01:33:19.870
right?

3365
01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:20.320
Well,

3366
01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:24.430
Pocatello is kind of a plunk there on the edge of the sagebrush step.

3367
01:33:24.450 --> 01:33:26.230
So we have to go a little ways to get to the Woodsy,

3368
01:33:26.231 --> 01:33:28.450
but there's lots of wild country.

3369
01:33:28.451 --> 01:33:31.510
We're just two hours away from the Tetons in Yellowstone national park.

3370
01:33:31.511 --> 01:33:32.070
And,

3371
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.440
uh,

3372
01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.850
you went to his or just south of us.

3373
01:33:33.851 --> 01:33:34.361
So there's,

3374
01:33:34.361 --> 01:33:37.510
there's some root prime territory so you can go squatch and pretty close to your

3375
01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:37.870
house.

3376
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:38.470
Sure.

3377
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:39.303
Can you do,

3378
01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:40.173
do you do that?

3379
01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:40.590
I,

3380
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:41.020
I've,

3381
01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:41.831
I've gone,

3382
01:33:41.831 --> 01:33:41.980
uh,

3383
01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:43.110
I go out with a,

3384
01:33:43.111 --> 01:33:43.960
a colleague,

3385
01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:48.790
John Mine Zinsky is a wildlife consultant and ethnobotanist and we've done a lot

3386
01:33:48.791 --> 01:33:51.220
of work in western Wyoming together.

3387
01:33:51.250 --> 01:33:52.030
And uh,

3388
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:56.830
for a number of years we've spent at least a month at a time in the field

3389
01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:59.710
looking for trace evidence and trying to get DNA,

3390
01:34:00.370 --> 01:34:00.791
uh,

3391
01:34:00.791 --> 01:34:01.481
with various,

3392
01:34:01.481 --> 01:34:02.560
by various means.

3393
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:03.010
Uh,

3394
01:34:03.010 --> 01:34:05.560
what'd you say that you spend more time dissecting?

3395
01:34:05.561 --> 01:34:07.230
Human bodies are hunting for big foot,

3396
01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:08.020
uh,

3397
01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:09.910
probably disecting human bodies.

3398
01:34:09.911 --> 01:34:10.420
Yeah.

3399
01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:10.931
But big foot,

3400
01:34:10.931 --> 01:34:13.730
it's really fun and certain bodies get boring after a while.

3401
01:34:13.731 --> 01:34:14.380
Right.

3402
01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:15.430
I never lose that.

3403
01:34:15.431 --> 01:34:15.760
Uh,

3404
01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:16.900
it has a certain,

3405
01:34:16.901 --> 01:34:18.720
a novelty to it every,

3406
01:34:18.730 --> 01:34:19.660
each and every year.

3407
01:34:19.661 --> 01:34:20.050
I mean,

3408
01:34:20.050 --> 01:34:21.430
everybody's a little different.

3409
01:34:21.431 --> 01:34:21.631
And,

3410
01:34:21.631 --> 01:34:23.380
and sharing that experience,

3411
01:34:23.381 --> 01:34:23.501
you know,

3412
01:34:23.501 --> 01:34:27.400
this is a real unique opportunity for students to have that very intimate

3413
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:31.090
experience of dismantling that marvelous machine.

3414
01:34:31.091 --> 01:34:31.924
That's the human.

3415
01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:33.090
<v 5>So it never,</v>

3416
01:34:33.090 --> 01:34:35.130
it never really gets old for the record.

3417
01:34:35.131 --> 01:34:36.000
Just so for the show,

3418
01:34:36.001 --> 01:34:40.830
would you look at me and tell me exactly who you are and what your credentials

3419
01:34:40.831 --> 01:34:40.980
are?

3420
01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:41.813
Yeah.

3421
01:34:42.090 --> 01:34:43.260
My name is Jeff Meldrum.

3422
01:34:43.261 --> 01:34:47.220
I'm a professor of anatomy and anthropology at Idaho State University.

3423
01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:48.150
Uh,

3424
01:34:48.150 --> 01:34:50.820
I teach primarily anatomy and research,

3425
01:34:50.821 --> 01:34:51.240
uh,

3426
01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:52.830
the evolution of human bipedalism.

3427
01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:55.650
I hope you're right.

3428
01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:57.260
Aye.

3429
01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.190
I'm seriously

3430
01:34:58.190 --> 01:34:58.940
<v 6>rooting for you.</v>

3431
01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:02.630
There's not a lot of subjects that I really hope are true,

3432
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:04.490
but big flip mad for me.

3433
01:35:04.491 --> 01:35:08.870
It has always been the one you FO's I'm pretty sure there's life out there.

3434
01:35:08.871 --> 01:35:09.790
Whether or not it's video,

3435
01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:11.170
excuse me,

3436
01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:12.730
whether or not it's visited us to him.

3437
01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:13.180
Well,

3438
01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:13.311
I'm,

3439
01:35:13.311 --> 01:35:15.320
I'm sort of iffy on that,

3440
01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:16.371
but big foot,

3441
01:35:16.371 --> 01:35:17.540
I'm open for man.

3442
01:35:17.541 --> 01:35:18.500
I'm God.

3443
01:35:18.501 --> 01:35:19.334
I want it to be,

3444
01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:20.340
<v 2>well,</v>

3445
01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:20.731
it's interesting.

3446
01:35:20.731 --> 01:35:22.200
There was a recently,

3447
01:35:22.201 --> 01:35:22.381
uh,

3448
01:35:22.381 --> 01:35:22.551
the,

3449
01:35:22.551 --> 01:35:27.551
the cover story of New Scientist magazine this year was a of one issue was what

3450
01:35:29.581 --> 01:35:34.170
are the top 10 questions that face human evolution that students of researchers

3451
01:35:34.171 --> 01:35:39.030
of human evolution today and number nine was our other hominins alive today.

3452
01:35:39.390 --> 01:35:40.860
So it's gaining some traction.

3453
01:35:40.861 --> 01:35:41.041
This,

3454
01:35:41.041 --> 01:35:42.960
this notion of relic hominids.

3455
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:46.140
I've actually launched an online scholarly journal,

3456
01:35:46.170 --> 01:35:50.340
peer reviewed journal called the relic hominoid inquiry to provide a venue for

3457
01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.370
discussion and publication of,

3458
01:35:52.371 --> 01:35:53.204
of uh,

3459
01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:54.690
research on this topic.

3460
01:35:54.691 --> 01:35:55.524
And so it's,

3461
01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:59.310
it's making inroads a homo floresiensis that you're so interested that that was

3462
01:35:59.311 --> 01:36:01.310
really an interesting because yeah,

3463
01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:02.153
because here these,

3464
01:36:02.250 --> 01:36:05.430
these discovers kind of scratch their heads and admit to the report as well.

3465
01:36:05.431 --> 01:36:05.671
Yeah.

3466
01:36:05.671 --> 01:36:09.120
Actually the local people have been describing these little three foot tall,

3467
01:36:09.121 --> 01:36:11.250
hairy people that live up in the mountains and,

3468
01:36:11.670 --> 01:36:12.390
and uh,

3469
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:16.800
even some of the European colonists of described encounters with them all along.

3470
01:36:17.130 --> 01:36:20.700
<v 6>And that had been folklore for the longest time,</v>

3471
01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:24.840
thought to be nothing but just stories until they found these belts.

3472
01:36:24.841 --> 01:36:26.640
What is it like 2006 or something like that?

3473
01:36:26.641 --> 01:36:26.791
Yeah.

3474
01:36:26.791 --> 01:36:27.690
It's just been a few,

3475
01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:28.351
a few years.

3476
01:36:28.351 --> 01:36:28.981
Crazy,

3477
01:36:28.981 --> 01:36:29.580
isn't it?

3478
01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:30.301
Little tiny.

3479
01:36:30.301 --> 01:36:33.150
Three foot tall nonhuman people.

3480
01:36:33.151 --> 01:36:33.984
Right.

3481
01:36:34.150 --> 01:36:35.040
I can levitate,

3482
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:37.441
fly there,

3483
01:36:37.441 --> 01:36:38.070
just fly.

3484
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:39.930
They don't levitate like Superman.

3485
01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:41.460
No.

3486
01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:42.031
Superman.

3487
01:36:42.031 --> 01:36:42.301
Love it.

3488
01:36:42.301 --> 01:36:43.340
They walk through the trees,

3489
01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:45.780
the RUC way through the tree.

3490
01:36:45.810 --> 01:36:47.090
They become one with the tree from,

3491
01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:47.911
from what I read.

3492
01:36:47.911 --> 01:36:49.020
The little people can fly.

3493
01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:50.330
Where are the little people suppose?

3494
01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.970
I mean there's also the Orang Pendek right,

3495
01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:53.400
right.

3496
01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:54.600
Whereas the thing supposed to live

3497
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:56.460
<v 2>comes from Malaysia.</v>

3498
01:36:56.461 --> 01:36:57.150
So,

3499
01:36:57.150 --> 01:36:57.600
uh,

3500
01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:00.000
Flores is a little island of Indonesia,

3501
01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:05.060
but there are reports of these small hominids all throughout Southeast Asia.

3502
01:37:05.770 --> 01:37:06.870
Recent reports,

3503
01:37:06.871 --> 01:37:07.320
right?

3504
01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:07.801
Oh yes.

3505
01:37:07.801 --> 01:37:08.790
Contemporary reports.

3506
01:37:08.791 --> 01:37:09.271
Absolutely.

3507
01:37:09.271 --> 01:37:10.130
As well as the native trees.

3508
01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:11.310
<v 6>There's still alive.</v>

3509
01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:11.940
Yeah.

3510
01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:12.840
Little tiny signs.

3511
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:16.080
A very smart apparently well from people and very smart.

3512
01:37:16.081 --> 01:37:16.530
Yeah.

3513
01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:17.290
Fascinating stuff.

3514
01:37:17.290 --> 01:37:17.770
Nothing.

3515
01:37:17.770 --> 01:37:18.603
Dr Male Gym.

3516
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.441
Seriously,

3517
01:37:19.441 --> 01:37:23.010
thank you so much and thank you for all this work because if it wasn't for a guy

3518
01:37:23.011 --> 01:37:23.461
like you,

3519
01:37:23.461 --> 01:37:28.140
an actual intellectual smart dude who is obsessed with big foot as well,

3520
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:31.980
it would be so sketchy because you're getting this information from all these

3521
01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:33.870
various sources.

3522
01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:36.210
Some of them highly doped up.

3523
01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:37.313
You know,

3524
01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:37.750
it's,

3525
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:38.340
it's hard.

3526
01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:40.020
It's hard to celebrate the wheat from the shaft.

3527
01:37:40.050 --> 01:37:40.150
No,

3528
01:37:40.150 --> 01:37:41.170
he's saying the wheat from the chaff,

3529
01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:42.143
from the chat.

3530
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:43.050
It's hard.

3531
01:37:43.050 --> 01:37:44.100
I don't think it's shaft.

3532
01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:48.260
It's,

3533
01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:49.080
it's hard.

3534
01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:49.321
You know,

3535
01:37:49.321 --> 01:37:53.130
when you're a person like myself who is not an educated in anthropology to

3536
01:37:53.131 --> 01:37:54.120
dissect this stuff.

3537
01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:54.780
And,

3538
01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:55.000
uh,

3539
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.430
if it wasn't for people like you out there,

3540
01:37:56.431 --> 01:37:59.180
I think the overall picture would be far muddier.

3541
01:37:59.190 --> 01:37:59.671
So thank you,

3542
01:37:59.671 --> 01:37:59.851
sir.

3543
01:37:59.851 --> 01:38:00.211
I really,

3544
01:38:00.211 --> 01:38:01.010
really appreciate it.

3545
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:02.790
A pleasure and an honor having you on.

3546
01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:03.653
Really appreciate that.

3547
01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:04.300
<v 1>Sure.</v>
