<v Speaker 1>We're just talking about kind of being </v>

8
00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>outside of the bubble of the big cities </v>
<v Speaker 1>and living in a nice calm place.</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the move because you could visit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can visit this crazy fucked up </v>

13
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.340
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why when you,</v>

15
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you asked me to do this,</v>

16
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

17
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to visit La and then I'll go</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to like,</v>

18
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother and my family and a mountain </v>

19
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.610
<v Speaker 1>in a lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>That's the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could do it that way,</v>

21
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>that's the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's some real benefits to </v>

23
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.611
<v Speaker 1>living in a city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also some real benefits to </v>

24
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:52.611
<v Speaker 1>being outside of it.</v>

25
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I think that figuring out some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>50 slash 50 thing,</v>

26
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>like you're doing like visit and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>bolt,</v>

27
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:00.320
<v Speaker 1>It's also kind of altruistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 3000 people.</v>

29
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>I go back and forth between here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and I'm like,</v>

30
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>if someone dies like everyone chips in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they can't afford it,</v>

31
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works so well in small groups.</v>

32
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

33
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>and then the bigger the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more it gets a little dicey.</v>

34
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different way of living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like living in a small group is,</v>

35
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's a good group,</v>

36
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.430
<v Speaker 1>you get stuck with a bad group and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real issue to some crazy meth </v>

37
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:29.601
<v Speaker 1>heads that lived down the street and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd like to shoot things up in the </v>

38
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.271
<v Speaker 1>middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's part of your little small </v>

39
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:32.271
<v Speaker 1>group and I delivered papers to those </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys when I was a kid.</v>

40
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>They just do the car thing or the bike </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

41
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.250
<v Speaker 1>bike and walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

42
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>someone stole my bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went back to walking.</v>

43
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>You haven't been developed some serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking core muscles carrying around all</v>

44
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:50.181
<v Speaker 1>those newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a wagon or just do the bag </v>

45
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:50.181
<v Speaker 1>thing now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the bag thing.</v>

46
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I used to carry my dog in it wrong dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for real.</v>

47
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:58.971
<v Speaker 1>If you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people put sandbags on or a weight </v>

48
00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:02.331
<v Speaker 1>vests on rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they do all kinds of exercises and </v>

49
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 1>it's like 40 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if you're like an adult,</v>

50
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.910
<v Speaker 1>40 pounds is like a good amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight to do chin ups and pushups and </v>

51
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.760
<v Speaker 1>stuff with a weight vest on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a little kid.</v>

52
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>How old were you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nine to 13.</v>

53
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of how weak you are when you're </v>

54
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 1>nine and someone's strapping down </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers on you.</v>

71
00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.901
<v Speaker 1>collect from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time that I had started </v>

72
00:02:59.901 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>delivering newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they figured out how to do like these,</v>

73
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawals from people's accounts,</v>

74
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:03.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>they would do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay for it in advance,</v>

76
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>somehow know they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it like a bank account withdrawal or</v>

77
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

78
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to build them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't my point.</v>

79
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>But a couple people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have these little envelopes.</v>

80
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.030
<v Speaker 1>You have to leave the Tan novel and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the money in the envelope.</v>

81
00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>It was so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was also outdated.</v>

82
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

83
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>it was like 19th century newspaper </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery and also like,</v>

84
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone said they left it and,</v>

85
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.430
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they didn't like someone else took </v>

86
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.430
<v Speaker 1>it and then they put it on a nine year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

87
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.750
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was intense to have to argue them </v>

88
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.750
<v Speaker 1>down and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

89
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you do have to pay me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have overhead,</v>

90
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got my own girl and there's,</v>

91
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.000
<v Speaker 1>here's a little tip for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

92
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be that Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if someone asks,</v>

93
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.500
<v Speaker 1>if you put the the newspaper inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>their door,</v>

94
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to do it.</v>

95
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>You got to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real drag if you're driving,</v>

96
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.060
<v Speaker 1>because if you're driving when you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do is you want to just chuck that </v>

97
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.791
<v Speaker 1>sucker down the either the pathway or in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the driveway and keep moving.</v>

98
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot of newspaper,</v>

99
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep moving,</v>

100
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a volume business,</v>

101
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 1>a volume business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>and they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

103
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>we'll take care of you on Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

104
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way it can be worth it.</v>

105
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like way more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cold out.</v>

106
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get out of the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to carry it.</v>

107
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:19.520
<v Speaker 1>I got to go all the way up your walkway </v>
<v Speaker 1>opening door.</v>

108
00:04:19.521 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>That shit takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had to do that with every house.</v>

109
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>It'd be impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Impossible.</v>

110
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 1>And also because the winters and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have plastic,</v>

111
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a very outdated system.</v>

112
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 1>You didn't have plastic for the bags </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

113
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

114
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even make sense now was it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a badly run newspaper.</v>

115
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>We had plastic sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes we just have rubber bands.</v>

116
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like depending on the weather,</v>

117
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.360

00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:28.151
<v Speaker 1>It's the biggest dinosaur that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever discovered and I feel like they </v>

157
00:06:28.151 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 1>discovered it within the last decade </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the size of this motherfucker.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Rather to ever walk the earth.</v>

162
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.410
<v Speaker 1>The titanosaur fossil was discovered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina in 2013.</v>

163
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Am I saying it right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Titanosaur.</v>

164
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Scientists use try dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconstruction to measure the mass.</v>

165
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the size of that fucking thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The thing could still be around.</v>

168
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.520
<v Speaker 1>It would win every fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This they did.</v>

169
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.740
<v Speaker 1>This is heavy as 12 elephants or a full </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boeing 7:37.</v>

170

172
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 1>The skeleton at the American Museum of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Natural History in New York is so large.</v>

173
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:19.760

<v Speaker 1>It's just too big of a dick.</v>

176
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you think duck ticks back then were </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like 20 feet long?</v>

177
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Ducts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably had like,</v>

178
00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:39.071
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean duct Dick's today can be like </v>

179
00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:39.110
<v Speaker 1>nine inches long for like a little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>duck.</v>

180
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the deal?</v>

181
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Like Andrea's Antonopoulos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

182
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:47.921
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought for some reason it was like </v>

183
00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:47.921
<v Speaker 1>three feet long and he had me really </v>
<v Speaker 1>super psyched.</v>

184
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.650
<v Speaker 1>It's still pretty big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite three feet long,</v>

185
00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 1>but what a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little scenario.</v>

186
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:58.901
<v Speaker 1>The ducks have had to like duck dick per</v>
<v Speaker 1>body ounce must be like massive,</v>

187
00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 1>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a thigh.</v>

188
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had an,</v>

189
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 1>a literally had another thigh </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] like the female duck has to </v>

190
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Vaginas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>party pussy.</v>

191
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Well they use the dig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig and decide to let you in at every </v>

192
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.710
<v Speaker 1>turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:17.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a labyrinth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

194
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:23.020
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why the duck dick is like </v>

195
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.971
<v Speaker 1>this weird curly q apparatus type thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the length because it's like the </v>

196
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Speaker 1>little tiny factors will affect the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

197
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:31.950
<v Speaker 1>So like one duck had like a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer windy or winter that could manage</v>

198
00:08:31.951 --> 00:08:36.951
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was this like really weird </v>

199
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:39.611
<v Speaker 1>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this really weird scientific discussion </v>

200
00:08:39.611 --> 00:08:41.180
<v Speaker 1>about ducks and whether all ducks sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>was rape.</v>

201
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.580
<v Speaker 1>And I'm trying to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in on that one,</v>

202
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 1>but they were trying to determine but </v>
<v Speaker 1>like coming from someone like me who has</v>

203
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:52.301
<v Speaker 1>chickens and I'd get to see these </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals behavior and other birds that </v>

204
00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:57.131
<v Speaker 1>I've watched in my neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I posted a picture on instagram </v>

205
00:08:57.131 --> 00:08:57.131
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hawk.</v>

206
00:08:57.131 --> 00:08:57.131
<v Speaker 1>There's a</v>

207
00:08:57.131 --> 00:09:00.980
<v Speaker 2>hawk war going on in my neighborhood and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow hawks are killing hawks and they </v>

208
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 2>kill them and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cut their heads off and then they,</v>

209
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:09.051
<v Speaker 2>they eat parts of their body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it's hawks doing it </v>

210
00:09:09.051 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 2>because one of my neighbors saw a hawk </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating another hawk,</v>

211
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:14.250
<v Speaker 2>like a baby hawk in nest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

212
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they think that somehow another these</v>

213
00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:21.411
<v Speaker 2>hawks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's young juvenile hawks are fighting </v>

214
00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:23.280
<v Speaker 2>to try to take over this area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like gang stuff,</v>

215
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.420
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is gang stuff.</v>

216
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:29.421
<v Speaker 2>One of them came swooping into my </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken coop the other day who has </v>

217
00:09:29.421 --> 00:09:29.421
<v Speaker 2>slammed into the cage outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken coop,</v>

218
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:34.550
<v Speaker 2>like the door was shut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it slammed into it like it was </v>

<v Speaker 2>got.</v>

234
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 2>I got pretty pissed too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they did.</v>

235
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what man?</v>

236
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
<v Speaker 2>I am thinking in my neighborhood that </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone used some sort of a rodent </v>

237
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:26.361
<v Speaker 2>pesticide interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think that happened because I </v>

238
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:30.351
<v Speaker 2>was reading about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that some owls wind up dying because in </v>

239
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:35.451
<v Speaker 2>coyotes as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they'll eat rodents that were </v>

240
00:10:35.451 --> 00:10:38.200
<v Speaker 2>infected by this road and this road in </v>
<v Speaker 2>pesticide is poison.</v>

241
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 2>They give for rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just rat poison and animals eat the rats</v>

242
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:47.181
<v Speaker 2>and then they get it and die off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were talking about our goals and </v>

243
00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:50.421
<v Speaker 2>specific were really important for </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking control of a population of </v>

244
00:10:50.421 --> 00:10:51.420
<v Speaker 2>rodents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Suite next to.</v>

245
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.890
<v Speaker 2>We still think of what they are mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are flying murderers.</v>

246
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.000
<v Speaker 2>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

247
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.190
<v Speaker 2>we made them something cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

248
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Know like when you live in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your confirmed with that </v>

249
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.341
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a raccoon sketch like raccoons can </v>

250
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:12.350
<v Speaker 2>in their intelligence level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my brother had to kill them with a </v>

251
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:13.260
<v Speaker 2>pitchfork recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

252
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

253
00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to kill chickens.</v>

254
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'll,</v>

255
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.840
<v Speaker 2>they'll open like locks and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they have like fingers enhance did.</v>

256
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.900
<v Speaker 2>There was one in my neighborhood and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was coming towards the chicken coop at </v>

257
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:26.900
<v Speaker 2>night and the chickens were going crazy.</v>

258
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.720
<v Speaker 2>It was late at night and I show him the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flashlight on him and he started walking</v>

259
00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:32.160
<v Speaker 2>towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

260
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.690
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>

261
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out of here man.</v>

262
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:38.490
<v Speaker 2>And there's sound or scream is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck that.</v>

263
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:41.490
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear a raccoon screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw guardians of the galaxy.</v>

264
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.730
<v Speaker 2>That little dude was the scariest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

265
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.690
<v Speaker 2>a little raccoon with the guns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>

266
00:11:45.691 --> 00:11:47.300
<v Speaker 2>He was smart as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see two.</v>

267
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Haven't seen two yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

268
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.250
<v Speaker 2>I cried on the plane watching it sweetie</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

269
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.010
<v Speaker 2>But like I don't really cry much in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

270
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>but every now and then</v>

271
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.010
<v Speaker 1>like some big archetypal movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just grab me.</v>

272
00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 1>They can get you to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially once you're a parent,</v>

273
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're much more vulnerable.</v>

274
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:07.170
<v Speaker 1>What does that a duck dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at a duck duck right </v>

275
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:07.170
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that even real?</v>

276
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.360
<v Speaker 1>They had here on the forced copulations </v>
<v Speaker 1>male ducks are notorious for attempting </v>

277
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.370
<v Speaker 1>force copulation with females,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so females seem to have involved vaginas</v>

278
00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:20.371
<v Speaker 1>to make it hard for a male duck to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually inseminate them if they don't </v>

279
00:12:20.371 --> 00:12:22.000
<v Speaker 1>want to by forcing it towards the dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends.</v>

280
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have dead ends.</v>

281
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 1>They have like trap doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

282
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.880
<v Speaker 1>male ducks haven't taken this lying </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

283
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 1>The more forced copulation a duck </v>
<v Speaker 1>engages in,</v>

284
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:35.320
<v Speaker 1>the longer the male's penis is tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be according to a 2010 study.</v>

285
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their dicks get longer.</v>

286
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:42.511
<v Speaker 1>The more they rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if the female duck like laughs </v>

287
00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:43.280
<v Speaker 1>a letter like when the rapey ducks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>mad and she's like man,</v>

288
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.890
<v Speaker 1>because she like sent them the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

289
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she's going to be pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just keep spelling calories.</v>

290
00:12:50.201 --> 00:12:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this quote.</v>

291
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:55.690
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>male ducks grow a new penis every year,</v>

292
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:01.620
<v Speaker 1>which means they can vary the length </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on that year's competition.</v>

293
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've mentioned if you.</v>

294
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Dick fell off every year like elk </v>
<v Speaker 1>antlers and every year it grew back like</v>

295
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:14.130
<v Speaker 1>for like months nobody had sex and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was cool with each other and </v>

296
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:14.130
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

297
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.401
<v Speaker 1>can we just be like this all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like imagine if there was just like we </v>

298
00:13:17.401 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 1>had a season half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's our problem.</v>

299
00:13:18.551 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 1>We're such gluttons we should have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>breeding season.</v>

300
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 1>We should have a season where literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>our Dick Falls off.</v>

301
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Such an egg grows back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It grows back.</v>

302
00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:31.771
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could reengineer people to have </v>

303
00:13:31.771 --> 00:13:34.921
<v Speaker 1>like a three month period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a participants have off seasons </v>

304
00:13:34.921 --> 00:13:37.120
<v Speaker 1>level off season where this no gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no male,</v>

305
00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:38.500
<v Speaker 1>there's no female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no nothing.</v>

306
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick falls off and everybody just chills</v>

307
00:13:40.301 --> 00:13:43.930
<v Speaker 1>out for a little bit and doesn't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about anything but just life existential</v>

308
00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:45.090
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.060
<v Speaker 1>get some rental property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about like going to the beach more</v>

310
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.460
<v Speaker 1>like why don't I go to the beach more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always enjoy it.</v>

311
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Feels good when I'm there and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick size and shape will tell you what </v>

312
00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.821
<v Speaker 1>the year is to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a 15 inch or we got some serious </v>

313
00:13:59.821 --> 00:14:00.160
<v Speaker 1>war ahead of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got problems.</v>

314
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like um,</v>

315
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:07.730
<v Speaker 1>chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimp ball size is directly </v>

316
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:08.590
<v Speaker 1>proportionate to the amount of slots </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are near them.</v>

317
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing with primates.</v>

318
00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:16.051
<v Speaker 1>For some reason there was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation between promiscuous females </v>

319
00:14:16.051 --> 00:14:19.660
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like women having sex with more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than one in a derogatory term.</v>

320
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Just scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were saying that women who are </v>

321
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:24.690
<v Speaker 1>having sex with more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more males,</v>

322
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.660
<v Speaker 1>those males grew bigger dicks and bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>balls.</v>

323
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Sperm competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

324
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:35.370
<v Speaker 1>like literally a balls got bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was like provable and want </v>

325
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.630
<v Speaker 1>to know if the Deq was provable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People feel weird about studying dicks.</v>

326
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.990
<v Speaker 1>They do and there's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many great stories if you </v>

327
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.320
<v Speaker 1>study a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a dick dr people like,</v>

328
00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:49.321
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why that fall into that box for years.</v>

329
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what I prefer to call them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the correct nomenclature.</v>

330
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone wants to say penis,</v>

331
00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:58.600
<v Speaker 1>but my daddy was a cock doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His daddy was a cocktail doctor.</v>

332
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.700
<v Speaker 1>We've always been studying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed so important that everyone is </v>

333
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.570
<v Speaker 1>so ashamed of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You read sperm wars.</v>

334
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

335
00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I did not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's been disproven.</v>

336
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.800
<v Speaker 1>There was a study that they did where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could not recreate the idea that </v>

337
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:18.440
<v Speaker 1>some sperm actually attack sperm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed them.</v>

338
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:19.370
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't.</v>

339
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.300
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't show that there was a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiation in cells.</v>

340
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Like there were cells that have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to go out and kill other sperm.</v>

341
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.870
<v Speaker 1>They were saying that that was more </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical than anything in the guy who</v>

342
00:15:29.871 --> 00:15:32.360
<v Speaker 1>originally wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might've like leap to a conclusion.</v>

343
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.160
<v Speaker 1>I can see that obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know shit,</v>

344
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:39.490
<v Speaker 1>but this is just what I had read was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like scientifically it doesn't </v>

345
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:40.880
<v Speaker 1>really Jive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what does jive is with,</v>

346
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:45.560
<v Speaker 1>with primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that the more females around,</v>

347
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 1>the more you grow more balls and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow bigger loads.</v>

348
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:51.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that definitely about load </v>
<v Speaker 1>size.</v>

349
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they measure load size </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

350
00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:56.120
<v Speaker 1>How are they going to hold on chimp </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you come?</v>

351
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Come over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little fella.</v>

352
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of pull out and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And come on this trip over here.</v>

353
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you be able to tell?</v>

354
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.770
<v Speaker 1>How would you be able to study chimp?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Load size?</v>

355
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Probably just surrounded with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>squatty champs and then one brave dude </v>

356
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.840
<v Speaker 1>just has to check them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

357
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:15.590
<v Speaker 1>ones that brave champs will just rip </v>
<v Speaker 1>your face off.</v>

358
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Plus they know that a hand job is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best thing we can do better than </v>

359
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:20.670
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

360
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Especially with a big old scientist man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hand start socking or you're not going </v>

361
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.190
<v Speaker 1>to get a sample.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

362
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.200
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a lady scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't let a lady scientist go in </v>

363
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.920
<v Speaker 1>there jerk-off a chimp because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like some sort of prostitution almost,</v>

364
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.510
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it'd have to be a dude.</v>

365
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chimps gonna fuck you up if he wants</v>

366
00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:41.150
<v Speaker 1>to beat the shit out of you while you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>jerking him off.</v>

367
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would just be such a weird beating </v>

368
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:46.940
<v Speaker 1>black eyes jerking off a champion.</v>

369
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.310
<v Speaker 1>He freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He feels vulnerable at all.</v>

370
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like I get vulnerable with </v>

371
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:54.560
<v Speaker 1>handjobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

372
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if you like hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>

373
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

374
00:16:56.781 --> 00:16:58.880
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you guys are communicating</v>
<v Speaker 1>in English or anything,</v>

375
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:03.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just jerking him off and you look </v>

376
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:03.920
<v Speaker 1>down and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey buddy,</v>

377
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:03.920
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to.</v>

378
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.320
<v Speaker 1>You're going to come so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like maybe you fucked up.</v>

379
00:17:06.321 --> 00:17:07.840
<v Speaker 1>You like maybe he likes it rough and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill them.</v>

380
00:17:07.841 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 1>A couple of hard shakes and he just beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to a pulp.</v>

381
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you keep hitting these balls and</v>

382
00:17:12.351 --> 00:17:17.351
<v Speaker 1>you don't realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just grabbing his dick in a way that </v>

383
00:17:17.351 --> 00:17:17.570
<v Speaker 1>he's uncomfortable with anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't trust you anymore,</v>

384
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.900
<v Speaker 1>so before you movements were soft and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensual and they seem like controlled </v>

385
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.060
<v Speaker 1>now you can't get on my dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like now you've got an agenda about</v>

386
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:27.470
<v Speaker 1>this hand job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

387
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:32.530
<v Speaker 1>and I think to a chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any kind of violent display like </v>

388
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.441
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like some sort of dominance </v>

389
00:17:35.441 --> 00:17:37.361
<v Speaker 1>display.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a chimp takes a stick and starts </v>

390
00:17:37.361 --> 00:17:40.001
<v Speaker 1>banging it on another stick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their balls get big and they just start </v>

391
00:17:40.001 --> 00:17:40.320
<v Speaker 1>punching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's how it happens to</v>

392
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.740
<v Speaker 1>balls get big with violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

393
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:48.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a real good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's a correlation </v>

394
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 1>between violence and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much intercourse they have</v>

395
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:54.180
<v Speaker 2>because like I'm the Bonobos have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most sex.</v>

396
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Would they have the least violence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

397
00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.180
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's just because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just who they are because they're weird.</v>

398
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:00.760
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

399
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.570
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

400
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.170
<v Speaker 2>they don't do a lot of the shit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular chimps do now.</v>

401
00:18:04.171 --> 00:18:05.950
<v Speaker 2>And the females will just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

402
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really funny nature channel.</v>

403
00:18:07.861 --> 00:18:08.970
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

404
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:11.170
<v Speaker 2>we have a male being angry and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

405
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:15.450
<v Speaker 2>And then like five checks of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just start fucking him and now he's</v>

406
00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:19.910
<v Speaker 2>asleep in the banana leaves role has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been averted for thousands of years.</v>

407
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Have they figured it out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just have a big old fuck party everyday.</v>

408
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Just drained balls and pussies as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just keep everybody calm.</v>

409
00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Everybody fucks everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's fucking.</v>

410
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:34.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then you think it might be your </v>

411
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.201
<v Speaker 2>kid too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to like protect all the </v>

412
00:18:36.201 --> 00:18:36.201
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

413
00:18:36.201 --> 00:18:38.390
<v Speaker 2>They have rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only rule is a mother will not have </v>

414
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 2>sex with a son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a solid rule.</v>

415
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.100
<v Speaker 2>This is the only one though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

416
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Fuck their daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

417
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.570
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is,</v>

418
00:18:45.571 --> 00:18:46.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

419
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.590
<v Speaker 2>they have a strange system in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard.</v>

420
00:18:49.591 --> 00:18:54.591
<v Speaker 2>Like this is the one taboo at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly promiscuous culture,</v>

421
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.330
<v Speaker 2>or I guess you'd call them a culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>species has.</v>

422
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.810
<v Speaker 2>They're fascinating man because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much like regular champs,</v>

423
00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:02.610
<v Speaker 2>but they're not violent at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hardly.</v>

424
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.460
<v Speaker 2>They'd like make some noise and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't do much yet.</v>

425
00:19:05.461 --> 00:19:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Almost perfectly splits our psyches as </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans to low.</v>

426
00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.330
<v Speaker 2>We all have champion been oboe and us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

427
00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Just knowing that that's possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

428
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.000
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What what we are is just sort of like,</v>

429
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even like what we are as a culture,</v>

430
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.200
<v Speaker 2>it's just sorta Kinda like worked into </v>
<v Speaker 2>this spot and that's what it is.</v>

431
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:26.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

432
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.700
<v Speaker 2>what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't have to work out this way.</v>

433
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:34.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could have worked out some other </v>

434
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.291
<v Speaker 2>really weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all life forms that you see around </v>

435
00:19:36.291 --> 00:19:36.570
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can be dolphins,</v>

436
00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:41.571
<v Speaker 2>they think dolphins are as smart as us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think it's entirely possible that </v>

437
00:19:41.571 --> 00:19:43.800
<v Speaker 2>without the context of our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like our ability to display intelligence</v>

438
00:19:43.801 --> 00:19:48.801
<v Speaker 2>through tests and math and can building </v>
<v Speaker 2>things engineering to without any </v>

439
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:54.170
<v Speaker 2>ability to display that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't really know how smart they </v>

440
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:57.141
<v Speaker 2>actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just assume that the social </v>

441
00:19:57.141 --> 00:19:58.130
<v Speaker 2>intelligence they have is not as </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable as that.</v>

442
00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.330
<v Speaker 2>The intelligence is evolving and </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating things,</v>

443
00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:05.280
<v Speaker 2>but they have a cerebral cortex is 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent larger than a person's pets.</v>

444
00:20:05.281 --> 00:20:06.900
<v Speaker 2>Intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's intense.</v>

445
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:11.930
<v Speaker 2>There's all our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All our tests are based on what we </v>

446
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.930
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

447
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.930
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

448
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:12.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we appreciate.</v>

449
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's some other tests that </v>

450
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.341
<v Speaker 2>they do and they know that some really </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex language that they have that </v>

451
00:20:19.341 --> 00:20:19.890
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't decipher,</v>

452
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.070
<v Speaker 2>they still haven't figured out what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck they're saying.</v>

453
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.550
<v Speaker 2>They know that there's dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know there's dialects and they know</v>

454
00:20:26.551 --> 00:20:29.160
<v Speaker 2>that dolphins can understand a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that we tell them.</v>

455
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.430
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

456
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.610
<v Speaker 2>they don't exactly know what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying.</v>

457
00:20:32.611 --> 00:20:34.260
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've never broken it down,</v>

458
00:20:34.261 --> 00:20:36.060
<v Speaker 2>like to remembering the close </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounters.</v>

459
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Do they broke it down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

460
00:20:38.701 --> 00:20:40.250
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole language here will see,</v>

461
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they tried to figure out what the </v>

462
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.151
<v Speaker 2>language was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been studying dolphin language </v>

463
00:20:47.151 --> 00:20:47.151
<v Speaker 2>forever and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what the fuck?</v>

464
00:20:47.151 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 2>They're saying two dolphins</v>

465
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.680
<v Speaker 1>blowing my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

466
00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:54.681
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they also do some fucked up shit </v>

467
00:20:54.681 --> 00:20:55.540
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do a lot of infanticide.</v>

468
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Sex Slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

469
00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:02.310
<v Speaker 1>They kill babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real common thing like it is in </v>

470
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 1>all of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

471
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.980
<v Speaker 1>males killed the babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have A,</v>

472
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's not his kids,</v>

473
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.540
<v Speaker 1>find a woman who killed her babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy that that's,</v>

474
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.870
<v Speaker 1>that's the code of somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was the way to do it,</v>

475
00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.920
<v Speaker 1>like Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like somehow or another of all the years</v>

476
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:25.900
<v Speaker 1>of these things trying to improve to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the position they're at now,</v>

477
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:28.840
<v Speaker 1>to be the most sturdy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most viable,</v>

478
00:21:28.841 --> 00:21:30.340
<v Speaker 1>the most complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>

479
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.790
<v Speaker 1>the most able to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive have to all that.</v>

480
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:38.791
<v Speaker 1>One of the options for one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>smartest things on the planet is eat </v>

481
00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:41.590
<v Speaker 1>babies get eat the babies of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes.</v>

482
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a race to the bottom and </v>

483
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:46.650
<v Speaker 1>morality for efficiency on Allen because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's.</v>

484
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.030
<v Speaker 1>You can see how quickly that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know your genes go,</v>

485
00:21:49.031 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 1>there's don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like so disturbing.</v>

486
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that there's a massive.</v>

487
00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:02.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's got to be a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive advantage in being able to </v>

488
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:06.271
<v Speaker 1>physically record things that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have learned and to be able to recreate </v>

489
00:22:06.371 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Speaker 1>them in the way that only we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as much as we can say that dolphins</v>

490
00:22:09.971 --> 00:22:12.470
<v Speaker 1>are intelligent and I'm sure they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they might,</v>

491
00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.200
<v Speaker 1>their brains might work better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>ours.</v>

492
00:22:14.201 --> 00:22:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our brains,</v>

493
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:22.020
<v Speaker 1>we have this weird ability to manipulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>things on dry land and that means we </v>

494
00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:27.151
<v Speaker 1>figured out electricity and that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>we figured out electronics that we've </v>

495
00:22:27.151 --> 00:22:28.030
<v Speaker 1>figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Electronic storage and shit like this,</v>

496
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.410
<v Speaker 1>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

497
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:34.650
<v Speaker 1>instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneous access to information </v>

498
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:34.650
<v Speaker 1>about stuff.</v>

499
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Like that's just changing everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

500
00:22:37.391 --> 00:22:42.391
<v Speaker 1>Because most like a life form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unreal because we can act out </v>

501
00:22:42.391 --> 00:22:45.751
<v Speaker 1>things in the abstract and not actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do them and then create </v>

502
00:22:45.751 --> 00:22:45.751
<v Speaker 1>something bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

503
00:22:45.751 --> 00:22:49.990
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not sure we're smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think collectively we are,</v>

504
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:55.650
<v Speaker 1>but like as individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dolphin literally might be like a </v>

505
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.120
<v Speaker 1>more potent mind than ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

506
00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Well pigeons or have incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>abilities that we don't have really?</v>

507
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can go like five,</v>

508
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:08.910
<v Speaker 1>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles to the same spot without a map or </v>

509
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:09.220
<v Speaker 1>rightly those homing pigeons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

510
00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.060
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they using?</v>

511
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Like magnetic fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they using now?</v>

512
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean that to me is so intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

513
00:23:18.041 --> 00:23:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Nicola Tesla was in love with a pigeon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

514
00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:22.870
<v Speaker 1>I heard that on this show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually talking about that.</v>

515
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.630
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was deep.</v>

516
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could make money on any of his own </v>

517
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.090
<v Speaker 1>shit that all he could do is just love </v>
<v Speaker 1>that pigeon.</v>

518
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just so super duper off the </v>

519
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:36.460
<v Speaker 1>charts smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

520
00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:41.490
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he had a tremendous difficulty </v>

521
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:41.980
<v Speaker 1>in interacting with regular people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:44.860
<v Speaker 1>and this guy just wasn't the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>businessman in the world.</v>

523
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:49.850
<v Speaker 1>He was just a super genius inventor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he was crazy though.</v>

524
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Massively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massively.</v>

525
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>

526
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.110
<v Speaker 1>what would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word eccentric?</v>

527
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a level of intelligence </v>

528
00:23:59.650 --> 00:23:59.650
<v Speaker 1>where you start almost becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive.</v>

529
00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:04.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that funny bought on south </v>

530
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:04.380
<v Speaker 1>South Park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember I was like,</v>

531
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:08.050
<v Speaker 1>the greatest joke in the world is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill everyone and say awkward where like</v>

532
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.870
<v Speaker 1>if you do the math of stakes of jokes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then like the,</v>

533
00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:15.230
<v Speaker 1>like all the math of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could get real dark.</v>

534
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people are so smart.</v>

535
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:19.460
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't I love a pigeon?</v>

536
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:21.290
<v Speaker 1>It can go 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles,</v>

537
00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

538
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.490
<v Speaker 1>they don't have that thing that tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>them just weird.</v>

539
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he didn't care anymore.</v>

540
00:24:27.381 --> 00:24:32.381
<v Speaker 1>I think he loved the pigeon more than he</v>
<v Speaker 1>loved people and it might not have been </v>

541
00:24:32.381 --> 00:24:35.141
<v Speaker 1>like a romantic love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might've been like some spiritual thing </v>

542
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:36.560
<v Speaker 1>he ever seen that there's one photo of </v>
<v Speaker 1>him that's so iconic.</v>

543
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:41.830
<v Speaker 1>It's Nikola Tesla sitting in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pair of Tesla coils and he's got his </v>

544
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:44.630
<v Speaker 1>legs crossed and he looks like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>master of the universe.</v>

545
00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:47.780
<v Speaker 1>He literally looks like a character in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>marvel comic book.</v>

546
00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.540
<v Speaker 1>That guy was a wizard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lid.</v>

547
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Literal Wizard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

548
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

549
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.210
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

550
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Look at this guy look at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

551
00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.580
<v Speaker 1>He's sitting there reading shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

552
00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:05.620
<v Speaker 1>he's sitting there with his legs crossed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this crazy electrical thing is going </v>

553
00:25:06.681 --> 00:25:10.240
<v Speaker 1>on behind them and that's the guy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would fall in love with pigeon.</v>

554
00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.520
<v Speaker 1>That was like in his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

555
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:18.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just make all these crazy sparks </v>

556
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:18.850
<v Speaker 1>with my brain and read a book and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

557
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pigeon.</v>

558
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine what it must be like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a guy as smart as that like clearly </v>

559
00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.450
<v Speaker 1>like a next level intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's like us,</v>

560
00:25:26.451 --> 00:25:31.451
<v Speaker 1>there's normal folks and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>these like super genius like you know,</v>

561
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.630
<v Speaker 1>like a Lebron James of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

562
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.520
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's he doing that?</v>

563
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:41.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's what that guy was imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being that guy and just seeing all these</v>

564
00:25:41.691 --> 00:25:43.250
<v Speaker 1>things that haven't been figured out </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

565
00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:48.460
<v Speaker 1>How come you guys have done this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must be so frustrating about doing </v>

566
00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.281
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about you have electricity just sit </v>

567
00:25:51.281 --> 00:25:52.840
<v Speaker 1>in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wanted to fucking pump electricity </v>

568
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:52.840
<v Speaker 1>in the air where you would get it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

569
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:57.790
<v Speaker 1>Like the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must be like being around drunk </v>

570
00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.551
<v Speaker 1>people all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like being that smart around normal </v>

571
00:26:00.551 --> 00:26:03.431
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like being sober at a bar and I've </v>

572
00:26:03.431 --> 00:26:04.700
<v Speaker 1>ever been to like on my penis and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

573
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:05.810
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with you?</v>

574
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably Tesla with like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

575
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:10.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just make the sparks.</v>

576
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good way of describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good way of describing it.</v>

577
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 1>That's probably exactly what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to a bunch of like really,</v>

578
00:26:18.981 --> 00:26:23.981
<v Speaker 1>really smart people and at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this podcast and then off </v>

579
00:26:23.981 --> 00:26:28.181
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite examples is John </v>

580
00:26:28.181 --> 00:26:28.181
<v Speaker 1>Carmack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who he is?</v>

581
00:26:28.181 --> 00:26:33.160
<v Speaker 1>He's like this super genius coder who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote the Three d engine for id </v>

582
00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:35.420
<v Speaker 1>software.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he'd be like,</v>

583
00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.530
<v Speaker 1>be like the lead programmer or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it software.</v>

584
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.050
<v Speaker 1>One of the founders like quake and doom </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all those three d games.</v>

585
00:26:42.051 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Like he invented those things sunrail </v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

586
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.910
<v Speaker 3>every time I talked to him I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm barely your species.</v>

587
00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.260
<v Speaker 3>Fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same species.</v>

588
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.890
<v Speaker 3>His brain is firing so hard and so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

589
00:26:52.891 --> 00:26:54.420
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm such an ape.</v>

590
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Or you can see that on twitter with Sam </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harris sometimes and sometimes he'll do </v>

591
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.560
<v Speaker 3>a comeback and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to read like nine books.</v>

592
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:03.750
<v Speaker 3>Even get that Sam stupid smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like crazy smart.</v>

593
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.910
<v Speaker 3>He's very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very smart.</v>

594
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.380
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people like thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

595
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.820
<v Speaker 3>and they'll uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll give you a real reality check if</v>

596
00:27:11.821 --> 00:27:14.070
<v Speaker 3>you think you're smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think you're an exceptional mind.</v>

597
00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:20.090
<v Speaker 3>My wife has her masters in structural </v>
<v Speaker 3>engineering and a lot of my buddies are </v>

598
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 3>super conspiracy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nine slash 11 truther no,</v>

599
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.810
<v Speaker 3>that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened.</v>

600
00:27:24.811 --> 00:27:29.811
<v Speaker 3>One of my biases do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They proved that a building can't fall </v>

601
00:27:29.811 --> 00:27:30.720
<v Speaker 3>that way and my wife just called me just</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

602
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.520
<v Speaker 3>but I'm they.</v>

603
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

604
00:27:34.951 --> 00:27:39.951
<v Speaker 3>I know how the structure of buildings </v>
<v Speaker 3>work and she wasn't saying it </v>

605
00:27:39.951 --> 00:27:39.951
<v Speaker 3>maliciously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like trying to be like,</v>

606
00:27:39.951 --> 00:27:42.350
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm write silly.</v>

607
00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.700
<v Speaker 3>There's still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

608
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.500
<v Speaker 3>it could still be a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it isn't true.</v>

609
00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:51.501
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that like she was saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is possible for a building to fall </v>

610
00:27:51.501 --> 00:27:52.050
<v Speaker 3>directly on top of itself is all she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

611
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:57.320
<v Speaker 3>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole tower seven thing so </v>

612
00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.771
<v Speaker 3>fascinating because that's the one thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>where everybody points to when it comes </v>

613
00:28:00.771 --> 00:28:05.271
<v Speaker 3>to nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what a lot of people don't know is </v>

614
00:28:05.271 --> 00:28:07.620
<v Speaker 3>that there's a longer video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you watch the thing collapse,</v>

615
00:28:07.621 --> 00:28:09.960
<v Speaker 3>it absolutely looks like a controlled </v>
<v Speaker 3>demolition.</v>

616
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:15.620
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with that is if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not an actual engineer and you don't </v>

617
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.800
<v Speaker 3>really know how they built that </v>
<v Speaker 3>building,</v>

618
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:20.670
<v Speaker 3>it was unusual if you don't really know </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough about it.</v>

619
00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.640
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of things that I kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of know about,</v>

620
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.470
<v Speaker 3>but I don't really like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone had,</v>

621
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:30.880
<v Speaker 3>if I had to explain a double clutch </v>
<v Speaker 3>transmission and like a,</v>

622
00:28:30.881 --> 00:28:34.260
<v Speaker 3>a bmw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I could half asset.</v>

623
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.690
<v Speaker 3>But if there was someone right next to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me that knew,</v>

624
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.570
<v Speaker 3>that really knew about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would go with the fuck.</v>

625
00:28:39.571 --> 00:28:41.190
<v Speaker 3>Are you talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

626
00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the half truth confidence can be </v>

627
00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:46.240
<v Speaker 3>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

628
00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:46.890
<v Speaker 3>We gotta be real careful with that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

629
00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:51.891
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read buzzfeed know you have this </v>

630
00:28:51.891 --> 00:28:55.260
<v Speaker 3>like this knowledge balls without.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what's a getting a little</v>

631
00:28:55.261 --> 00:28:57.900
<v Speaker 3>infuriating with me now is a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things being debated.</v>

632
00:28:57.901 --> 00:29:00.210
<v Speaker 3>I actually know a ton about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

633
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:01.920
<v Speaker 3>like I was a world war two history </v>
<v Speaker 3>major.</v>

634
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:07.280
<v Speaker 3>Like who lived in the Czech Republic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>studying authoritarian governments and </v>

635
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:07.280
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

636
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.520
<v Speaker 3>And like so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not like an expert expert.</v>

637
00:29:09.521 --> 00:29:14.521
<v Speaker 3>Like you sometimes you have people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the show actually read books about tons </v>

638
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:18.290
<v Speaker 3>we're about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they get the most basic things </v>

639
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:18.290
<v Speaker 3>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's a Nazi,</v>

640
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:22.740
<v Speaker 3>this is and then you because then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't point out the actual Nazis and you</v>

641
00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:24.780
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just how it and everyone thinks that</v>

642
00:29:24.781 --> 00:29:28.170
<v Speaker 3>it's left wing right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really not like,</v>

643
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.630
<v Speaker 3>like right wing dystopia would be like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mad Max.</v>

644
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no government at all and </v>
<v Speaker 3>left his communist or socialist fascism.</v>

645
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.850
<v Speaker 3>It's just like the government is </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

646
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You what man?</v>

647
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:47.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt the need for everything to be </v>

648
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:52.640
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy is a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real problem for a lot of people </v>

649
00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.040
<v Speaker 2>that need to know that they're right </v>
<v Speaker 2>about things is a real problem.</v>

650
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:54.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

651
00:29:55.150 --> 00:30:00.150
<v Speaker 2>the not admitting that you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>know part is a problem because until </v>

652
00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:06.481
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Until I'm absolutely certain that what </v>

653
00:30:06.481 --> 00:30:07.900
<v Speaker 2>you're saying like I have to know when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to you,</v>

654
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.170
<v Speaker 2>if you say I'm absolutely 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>

655
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.280
<v Speaker 2>that if I liked this paper on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll burn 100 percent.</v>

656
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.650
<v Speaker 2>If this is regular paper and I have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular fire,</v>

657
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100 percent positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to.</v>

658
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:25.440
<v Speaker 2>If I have to hear you say if I have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that that's how you really are </v>

659
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.361
<v Speaker 2>operating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're telling me it's 100 </v>

660
00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:30.640
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kennedys driver shot him.</v>

661
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 100 percent.</v>

662
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.160
<v Speaker 2>You watched the video.</v>

663
00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.300
<v Speaker 2>It's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy's drivers shot him or any,</v>

664
00:30:35.301 --> 00:30:40.301
<v Speaker 2>any kind of crazy conspiracy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you say you know for sure </v>

665
00:30:40.301 --> 00:30:41.660
<v Speaker 2>it's like God damn man to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

666
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.900
<v Speaker 2>for sure that it wasn't a plane hit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pentagon,</v>

667
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

668
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.510
<v Speaker 2>How do you know for sure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

669
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.660
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't know for sure and if everyone </v>

670
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.591
<v Speaker 2>agrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I always get freaked out when like </v>

671
00:30:55.591 --> 00:30:55.591
<v Speaker 2>everybody agrees on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm in a cult.</v>

672
00:30:55.591 --> 00:30:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets,</v>

673
00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.370
<v Speaker 2>it gets super culting bolt on both sides</v>
<v Speaker 2>as being a skeptical person.</v>

674
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptics that they'll look at things </v>

675
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:05.670
<v Speaker 2>even like operation northwoods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be like,</v>

676
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:06.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just.</v>

677
00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.600
<v Speaker 2>It didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No big deal.</v>

678
00:31:07.601 --> 00:31:10.090
<v Speaker 2>If they were planning on killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>

679
00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.780
<v Speaker 2>they were going to rm Cuban friendlies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and have them attack one bay.</v>

680
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:18.990
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to get us to go to war </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Cuba and they were going to </v>

681
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.631
<v Speaker 2>manipulate us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were going to blow up a drone </v>

682
00:31:21.631 --> 00:31:22.420
<v Speaker 2>jetliner and blaming on Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'd be outraged.</v>

683
00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:24.880
<v Speaker 2>We want to go over and kick Cuba's ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>would cost.</v>

684
00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:30.270
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Countless thousands of American lives </v>

685
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:33.270
<v Speaker 2>for sure because you know you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 1961 or two or whatever it was </v>

686
00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:38.101
<v Speaker 2>when they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Kennedy vetoed this shit signed by </v>

687
00:31:38.101 --> 00:31:38.290
<v Speaker 2>the Joint Chiefs of staff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were really going to do this.</v>

688
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.080
<v Speaker 2>Like anybody who doesn't look at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get disturbed.</v>

689
00:31:41.081 --> 00:31:42.640
<v Speaker 2>This is from the freedom of Information </v>
<v Speaker 2>Act.</v>

690
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.760
<v Speaker 2>That's not a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with the really wacky </v>

691
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.910
<v Speaker 2>conspiracies like Kennedy's drivers shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>him or you know the,</v>

692
00:31:49.911 --> 00:31:51.550
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the goes deep as you want.</v>

693
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The really wacky ones distract from the </v>

694
00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:56.670
<v Speaker 2>real ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They mask it.</v>

695
00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:57.530
<v Speaker 2>It makes it so nothing means anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

696
00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones was st something fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy today.</v>

697
00:32:01.081 --> 00:32:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Like there was Jewish actors pretending </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be Nazis in Charlottesville.</v>

698
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Like these guys had tattoos of swastikas</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their chest.</v>

699
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:15.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not Jewish person because you're </v>

700
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:15.960
<v Speaker 2>not supposed to get tattooed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

701
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.910
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fucking actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you tattoo a swastika on your chest</v>

702
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.740
<v Speaker 2>that you're not acting anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

703
00:32:20.741 --> 00:32:22.480
<v Speaker 2>You've committed to a team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

704
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:28.070
<v Speaker 2>That's like one of the biggest steps I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can possibly think of as a human being </v>

705
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:31.210
<v Speaker 2>is to go to a tattoo parlor and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me the fucking craziest one.</v>

706
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:36.360
<v Speaker 2>I saw this a gay flag Nazi thing to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take the swastika back.</v>

707
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 2>That's like a bid that I had</v>

708
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:45.130
<v Speaker 3>in 2014 about Cammo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about those duck dynasty </v>

709
00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:45.950
<v Speaker 3>guys are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kept talking shit about gay people.</v>

710
00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:46.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

711
00:32:46.941 --> 00:32:49.310
<v Speaker 3>they're going to take over cammo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll fuck with you.</v>

712
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:50.930
<v Speaker 3>And they'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll just.</v>

713
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.200
<v Speaker 3>Every gay porno from now on takes place </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Cammo.</v>

714
00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:00.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like trucker hats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lead from like truckers being </v>

715
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:00.320
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're fucking great.</v>

716
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.810
<v Speaker 3>And then a minute later they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not Justin Bieber.</v>

717
00:33:02.811 --> 00:33:04.270
<v Speaker 3>I just like Miller lite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

718
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.510
<v Speaker 3>The idea was that every porno film ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>made would be made in a duck blind.</v>

719
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 3>The average Jane Porno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro,</v>

720
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:12.080
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking genius,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and every.</v>

721
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.340
<v Speaker 3>They would all start out with this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

722
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Gai is black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could ever find going some about </v>

723
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:19.770
<v Speaker 3>duck hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make me hold.</v>

724
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:27.680
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking genius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>White dude comes in on chains and drops </v>

725
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.280
<v Speaker 3>to his knees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start sucking.</v>

726
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.200
<v Speaker 3>That's they're all in Cammo because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

727
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:36.250
<v Speaker 3>Because then they can't just do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>without like having to apologize to </v>

728
00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:36.250
<v Speaker 3>people and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

729
00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:37.510
<v Speaker 3>we're not into all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My point was like,</v>

730
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.350
<v Speaker 3>it started like they took over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rainbow.</v>

731
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.480
<v Speaker 3>They could take over that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can take over Cammo.</v>

732
00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:44.330
<v Speaker 3>They can take over everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Connected visual light.</v>

733
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:46.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Light sticks,</v>

734
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.930
<v Speaker 3>yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>green,</v>

735
00:33:47.931 --> 00:33:48.470
<v Speaker 3>blue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>indigo.</v>

736
00:33:48.471 --> 00:33:49.370
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

737
00:33:49.371 --> 00:33:50.720
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people just have.</v>

738
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:51.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

739
00:33:51.171 --> 00:33:52.190
<v Speaker 3>we're the environmental.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

740
00:33:52.191 --> 00:33:53.120
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get green.</v>

741
00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:58.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're saying we want all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking cars to get it like a southern </v>

742
00:33:58.941 --> 00:34:02.570
<v Speaker 3>accent immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think the gay brainbow thing</v>

743
00:34:02.571 --> 00:34:05.440
<v Speaker 3>has done to the Leprechaun industry?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably tripled it.</v>

744
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Crippled it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they think they got gold,</v>

745
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.160
<v Speaker 3>they find a gay bar in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ireland.</v>

746
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:15.940
<v Speaker 3>Thousands of it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was about finding a pot of gold of </v>

747
00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:21.080
<v Speaker 3>the rainbow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's about what happened,</v>

748
00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:27.330
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck did they do because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>culturally appropriate and it from the </v>

749
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:31.091
<v Speaker 3>leprechaun culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriately or from the leprechauns </v>

750
00:34:31.091 --> 00:34:31.880
<v Speaker 3>and fucking owned it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Owned it.</v>

751
00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:34.220
<v Speaker 3>Like shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tip owns cotton swabs.</v>

752
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.340
<v Speaker 3>Owned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>owned it in a period of like what?</v>

753
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.660
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years.</v>

754
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:41.420
<v Speaker 3>All colors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They own the rainbow,</v>

755
00:34:41.421 --> 00:34:44.420
<v Speaker 3>the whole Rainbow Reiki.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think about when,</v>

756
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.960
<v Speaker 3>when the fuck was the rainbow first </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered long time ago,</v>

757
00:34:50.331 --> 00:34:53.210
<v Speaker 3>long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when was the first Leprechaun story,</v>

758
00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:58.240
<v Speaker 3>the pot of gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably hundreds of years of </v>

759
00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.330
<v Speaker 3>leprechauns being associated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>rainbows.</v>

760
00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:01.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now it's just dude and dudes.</v>

761
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Just one day it just became,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just turned and that's a hard turn to</v>

762
00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:07.070
<v Speaker 3>from like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

763
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:09.050
<v Speaker 3>it's sunny and rainy at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

764
00:35:09.051 --> 00:35:14.000
<v Speaker 3>now it's gay and it's just also taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the colors.</v>

765
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.840
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

766
00:35:14.841 --> 00:35:18.170
<v Speaker 3>gun control was the orange color and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like they get all of them.</v>

767
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:23.530
<v Speaker 3>You know what's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's when you think about like men and </v>

768
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.750
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in a straight culture like straight</v>

769
00:35:26.751 --> 00:35:31.751
<v Speaker 3>men and straight women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if there's more violence with </v>

770
00:35:31.751 --> 00:35:36.251
<v Speaker 3>straight men and straight women than </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are with gay men like gay </v>

771
00:35:36.251 --> 00:35:39.341
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wonder if it's like poor capita of </v>

772
00:35:39.341 --> 00:35:40.980
<v Speaker 3>the gay communities have less violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll be really fascinating to me.</v>

773
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:46.280
<v Speaker 3>There was more males together and less </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence versus males and females </v>

774
00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:51.741
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's two effects </v>

775
00:35:51.741 --> 00:35:51.741
<v Speaker 3>happening simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it,</v>

776
00:35:51.741 --> 00:35:56.290
<v Speaker 3>it could make it go down or up because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're always drained balls </v>

777
00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:59.601
<v Speaker 3>because gay dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay dudes are constantly going around </v>

778
00:35:59.601 --> 00:36:00.600
<v Speaker 3>and say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blow job,</v>

779
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:05.690
<v Speaker 3>car ride had know and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the flip side is you're </v>

780
00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:09.441
<v Speaker 3>doubling the amount of testosterone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy and like if you get into a fight </v>

781
00:36:09.441 --> 00:36:13.050
<v Speaker 3>with your partner and there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying like,</v>

782
00:36:13.051 --> 00:36:15.110
<v Speaker 3>but you can't hit women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

783
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:16.200
<v Speaker 3>beat the fuck out of each other.</v>

784
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:17.760
<v Speaker 3>It's real bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

785
00:36:17.761 --> 00:36:22.761
<v Speaker 3>Dudes in a backyard brawl after they </v>
<v Speaker 3>butt fucked and then start fucking </v>

786
00:36:22.761 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 3>during the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just get hot.</v>

787
00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh you bitch.</v>

788
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.700
<v Speaker 3>And luckily he gave me a plaque.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pitch do.</v>

789
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.780
<v Speaker 3>I bet lesbians don't fight much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

790
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.350
<v Speaker 3>That's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems like a sexist thing to say.</v>

791
00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:35.160
<v Speaker 3>Owen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Benjamin.</v>

792
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:37.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't wait to call you out.</v>

793
00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:42.960
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you and go that route because </v>

794
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.871
<v Speaker 3>that it's so quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so sexist and then you've made a </v>

795
00:36:44.871 --> 00:36:46.350
<v Speaker 3>good point and you're clearly not </v>
<v Speaker 3>hateful and then they're just like.</v>

796
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.540
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we do now?</v>

797
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:51.360
<v Speaker 3>It's like the kid stay mad when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

798
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:56.750
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you double men and then you're going to </v>

799
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.750
<v Speaker 3>get dudes who love working out and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

800
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.770
<v Speaker 3>real estate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's the case though.</v>

801
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:03.240
<v Speaker 3>I wonder because I just guessed about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the statistics.</v>

802
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.280
<v Speaker 3>What do you think they would be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's look them up,</v>

803
00:37:05.281 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 3>but before we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think it would be?</v>

804
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there'd be less violence in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gay community?</v>

805
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:14.630
<v Speaker 3>I think there would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my guess as far as domestic </v>

806
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.200
<v Speaker 3>violence partner violence in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Violence committed to it.</v>

807
00:37:16.201 --> 00:37:21.201
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say less violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna say less violence,</v>

808
00:37:21.491 --> 00:37:22.170
<v Speaker 3>less violence.</v>

809
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.620
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if we got.</v>

810
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All I've found so far,</v>

811
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:30.120
<v Speaker 4>most of it was about hate crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so digging.</v>

812
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:35.600
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem because they get </v>
<v Speaker 4>victimized by people outside of their </v>

813
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.960
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found one that says is there's a study</v>

814
00:37:36.961 --> 00:37:41.961
<v Speaker 4>that suggests that same sex </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships suffer higher levels of </v>

815
00:37:41.961 --> 00:37:42.760
<v Speaker 4>domestic violence and heterosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

816
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:47.610
<v Speaker 4>That's just like a study.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So was it by like Christian workshops on</v>

817
00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:50.190
<v Speaker 4>the BBC reporting it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I couldn't.</v>

818
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:55.210
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll just violence more common in </v>

819
00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:55.210
<v Speaker 4>same sex relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

820
00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:56.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what does,</v>

821
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't say how much violence.</v>

822
00:37:59.220 --> 00:37:59.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

823
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.250
<v Speaker 3>I feel like they have more in common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like less arguing.</v>

824
00:38:02.251 --> 00:38:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like maybe not though.</v>

825
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.560
<v Speaker 3>Domestic violence is a weird word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

826
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.630
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's extra creepy violence </v>
<v Speaker 3>because violence against someone.</v>

827
00:38:09.631 --> 00:38:14.631
<v Speaker 3>You care about your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your near them and you lose your temper </v>

828
00:38:14.631 --> 00:38:16.740
<v Speaker 3>to the point where you're enacting </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence on someone,</v>

829
00:38:16.741 --> 00:38:20.490
<v Speaker 3>at least at one point your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You probably loved right now.</v>

830
00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.470
<v Speaker 3>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to get violent with them,</v>

831
00:38:22.471 --> 00:38:24.660
<v Speaker 3>like physically violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So dangerous.</v>

832
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:27.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually being a cop walking into </v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit.</v>

833
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:32.300
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you can arrest the guy </v>

834
00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:32.300
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

835
00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.980
<v Speaker 3>this chick's gonna die eventually got </v>
<v Speaker 3>some heavy,</v>

836
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:36.760
<v Speaker 3>heavy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck</v>

837
00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:39.040
<v Speaker 1>cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another reason why I think it's so like,</v>

838
00:38:39.041 --> 00:38:40.660
<v Speaker 1>it's such worse violence because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>

839
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:43.180
<v Speaker 1>In my head I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a dude beating a woman,</v>

840
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.500
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

841
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Even though the other way does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just don't really.</v>

842
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

843
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

844
00:38:50.151 --> 00:38:52.550
<v Speaker 1>It's all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like just the,</v>

845
00:38:52.551 --> 00:38:55.700
<v Speaker 1>the fact that people can fall apart so </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

846
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:59.870
<v Speaker 1>They get to the point where at one point</v>
<v Speaker 1>in time they love this person.</v>

847
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:02.210
<v Speaker 1>This person was probably like super </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to them.</v>

848
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you want to kill them.</v>

849
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.160
<v Speaker 1>You want to stab them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to beat them up.</v>

850
00:39:07.161 --> 00:39:08.810
<v Speaker 1>You want to hit them in the head with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

851
00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:10.850
<v Speaker 1>woof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woof,</v>

852
00:39:10.851 --> 00:39:12.070
<v Speaker 1>you're off the tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

853
00:39:12.071 --> 00:39:15.240
<v Speaker 1>because kind comes from the word can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're supposed to love your can.</v>

854
00:39:15.241 --> 00:39:16.850
<v Speaker 1>You know that word comes from kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

855

<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

857
00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.470
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

858
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.020
<v Speaker 1>You treat kinfolk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinfolk.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

862
00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Like that was one of the sure fire ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you didn't want to get high with </v>

863
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.880
<v Speaker 1>somebody if they offered you some kind </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's not even the same,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everybody denies that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

884
00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.630
<v Speaker 1>From the moment I started smoking weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been space.</v>

885
00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:36.960
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to start def death experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have with Joey Diaz.</v>

886
00:40:36.961 --> 00:40:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Was it about that that that felt like </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>

887
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.870
<v Speaker 1>like it felt closer to mushrooms and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>did weed in my mind.</v>

888
00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I explained it in the poly short </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

889
00:40:44.611 --> 00:40:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I explained too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll explain it one more time.</v>

890
00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:52.250
<v Speaker 1>When he eat marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's processed by your liver and it </v>

891
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:54.891
<v Speaker 1>produces something called 11 hydroxy </v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolite and it's way more like four </v>

892
00:40:54.891 --> 00:40:57.600
<v Speaker 1>to five times more psychoactive than thc</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it does.</v>

893
00:40:57.601 --> 00:41:00.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different feel like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>feels like a cycle,</v>

894
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:01.230
<v Speaker 1>like a psychedelic drug.</v>

895
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a really potent one to like.</v>

896
00:41:03.331 --> 00:41:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you go super deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets really weird,</v>

897
00:41:06.991 --> 00:41:08.850
<v Speaker 1>especially when you lie down with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes closed.</v>

898
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:11.190
<v Speaker 1>If you get like that and you're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking out,</v>

899
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:16.430
<v Speaker 1>one thing that can kind of bring you out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it that you can see if you can enjoy </v>

900
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:19.431
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go somewhere dark and close your eyes </v>

901
00:41:19.431 --> 00:41:20.160
<v Speaker 1>and like if you're really freaking out </v>
<v Speaker 1>on weed,</v>

902
00:41:20.161 --> 00:41:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I bet there is a light show for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

903
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Like it'll be like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I remember like </v>

904
00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.570
<v Speaker 1>consistently I would see neon cartoons </v>
<v Speaker 1>having sex like neon old school,</v>

905
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.360
<v Speaker 2>goofy old school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mickey mouse cartoons with.</v>

906
00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:42.361
<v Speaker 2>They're moving weird but there were made</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of neon and they were having sex </v>

907
00:41:42.361 --> 00:41:42.800
<v Speaker 2>with each other and creating more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

908
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:46.040
<v Speaker 2>like a like branching off like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a fractal.</v>

909
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:51.400
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neon sex fractal has to be the name of </v>

910
00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.540
<v Speaker 2>your next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was psyched.</v>

911
00:41:52.541 --> 00:41:54.660
<v Speaker 2>I was seeing it all in front of me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>three d too,</v>

912
00:41:54.661 --> 00:41:57.780
<v Speaker 2>like I was on some Disney ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was happening all around me was.</v>

913
00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

914
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:04.601
<v Speaker 2>This is just a weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's crazy when you make the jump </v>

915
00:42:04.601 --> 00:42:05.600
<v Speaker 2>where you realize someone's showing you </v>
<v Speaker 2>something versus you imagining something</v>

916
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:07.070
<v Speaker 2>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

917
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:11.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm just watching something else versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>like picture a helicopter.</v>

918
00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:12.950
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just like,</v>

919
00:42:12.951 --> 00:42:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is something I've never seen before</v>

920
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:16.430
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know who's showing it to me.</v>

921
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something going on and to deny </v>

922
00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.290
<v Speaker 2>it is really interesting because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's another one of those things</v>

923
00:42:24.291 --> 00:42:26.120
<v Speaker 2>much like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people want to talk about.</v>

924
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:28.190
<v Speaker 2>I know for a fact something was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy.</v>

925
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:33.490
<v Speaker 2>They also want to say I know for a fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is a hallucination and that's </v>

926
00:42:34.131 --> 00:42:39.131
<v Speaker 2>all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know for a fact that this is just </v>

927
00:42:39.131 --> 00:42:41.450
<v Speaker 2>chemicals interacting with your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your whole life is chemicals.</v>

928
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:47.020
<v Speaker 2>You mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mind is like constantly processing </v>

929
00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.571
<v Speaker 2>different chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's adrenaline or whatever it </v>

930
00:42:49.571 --> 00:42:52.541
<v Speaker 2>is with different emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of different things going </v>

931
00:42:52.541 --> 00:42:55.001
<v Speaker 2>on chemically in your body all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the big one which is </v>

932
00:42:55.001 --> 00:42:59.111
<v Speaker 2>when your eyes shut and you go to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you imagine a bunch of shit </v>

933
00:42:59.111 --> 00:43:00.620
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really happening.</v>

934
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whole civilizations have been built</v>

935
00:43:02.721 --> 00:43:04.610
<v Speaker 2>on like the reverence for what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

936
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:08.570
<v Speaker 2>so it's not like there's definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>something going on there easily.</v>

937
00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Could be something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There could be different frequencies </v>

938
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.050
<v Speaker 2>than our normal biology is tuned into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very specific frequency and when </v>

939
00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:21.671
<v Speaker 2>something's off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be that they're not picking it </v>

940
00:43:21.671 --> 00:43:24.791
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe that's one of the things </v>

941
00:43:24.791 --> 00:43:24.791
<v Speaker 2>about schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

942
00:43:24.791 --> 00:43:24.791
<v Speaker 2>They have these issues with their brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemistry.</v>

943
00:43:24.791 --> 00:43:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're tuning into a totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>different world at us.</v>

944
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Maybe their world is like the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>dark city.</v>

945
00:43:29.241 --> 00:43:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Remember that movie with Kiefer </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sutherland upside down?</v>

946
00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is fucking hell.</v>

947
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's got like four foot long </v>
<v Speaker 2>fingers and they fucking creeping around</v>

948
00:43:36.591 --> 00:43:41.591
<v Speaker 2>corners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe in their world everything's </v>

949
00:43:41.591 --> 00:43:41.640
<v Speaker 2>completely fucked because they're tuned </v>
<v Speaker 2>in with their,</v>

950
00:43:41.641 --> 00:43:46.641
<v Speaker 2>their own brain chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally they're interacting with the </v>

951
00:43:46.641 --> 00:43:49.571
<v Speaker 2>universe around them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a different way that like </v>

952
00:43:49.571 --> 00:43:51.620
<v Speaker 2>their world is dark and scary and ugly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and twisted.</v>

953
00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like a filter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I learned about dark matter,</v>

954
00:43:55.100 --> 00:44:00.100
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost all Hubris that I know anything </v>

955
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:00.100
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventy percent of the universe.</v>

956
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:05.100
<v Speaker 2>It is this thing that we can't see or </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel or measure anywhere and we have no </v>

957
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.680
<v Speaker 2>idea what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

958
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.920
<v Speaker 2>y'all don't fucking know about tower </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven men.</v>

959
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:13.100
<v Speaker 2>That too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good way to describe it.</v>

960
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 2>There was something really recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>about dark matter where they were saying</v>

961
00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:20.960
<v Speaker 2>that they think that dark matter is </v>
<v Speaker 2>stored inside black holes.</v>

962
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.790
<v Speaker 2>Saving even find that so what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a black hole to even get that?</v>

963
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:28.130
<v Speaker 2>That one's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one's a mind bender.</v>

964
00:44:28.131 --> 00:44:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's happening out there?</v>

965
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 2>There's some infinitely</v>

966
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:36.090
<v Speaker 3>dense point and everything is getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>sucked into it and it's eating it,</v>

967
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.290
<v Speaker 3>but it's eating planets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

968
00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.070
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck did you just say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's instant,</v>

969
00:44:41.071 --> 00:44:43.170
<v Speaker 3>but to the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's aternity.</v>

970
00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute,</v>

971
00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:50.100
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's something out there that's </v>

972
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:50.100
<v Speaker 3>eating planets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does dark matter,</v>

973
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.200
<v Speaker 3>is dark matter less lumpy than </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicted?</v>

974
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounds racial.</v>

975
00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:58.950
<v Speaker 3>It could be racial or at least gender </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific.</v>

976
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:03.840
<v Speaker 3>That's not gender specific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If dark matter was a person,</v>

977
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:08.670
<v Speaker 3>what Pronoun would it use?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A man that's an intense one.</v>

978
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:09.810
<v Speaker 3>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero.</v>

979
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

980
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:12.590
<v Speaker 3>say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can say zero to.</v>

981
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.250
<v Speaker 3>You can say whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just made up.</v>

982
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:16.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's going to be a rule around</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to say it,</v>

983
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:20.070
<v Speaker 3>but see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

984
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.740
<v Speaker 3>It's like when it comes to gender stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that's when I stopped.</v>

985
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.050
<v Speaker 3>That's when I have a little bit of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion where I'm like,</v>

986
00:45:25.051 --> 00:45:26.400
<v Speaker 3>there are men and there are women.</v>

987
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:28.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also a spectrum,</v>

988
00:45:28.051 --> 00:45:33.051
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's women that want to fight </v>

989
00:45:33.051 --> 00:45:34.521
<v Speaker 3>in MMA and they want to race cars and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's men who want to be </v>

990
00:45:35.071 --> 00:45:36.140
<v Speaker 3>florists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

991
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.640
<v Speaker 3>But I feel like that's gender role </v>
<v Speaker 3>spectrum.</v>

992
00:45:38.641 --> 00:45:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Like my dad is like a really flamboyant </v>
<v Speaker 3>opera singing,</v>

993
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:47.420
<v Speaker 3>like he's real fruity and my mom is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>six foot loves sports,</v>

994
00:45:47.821 --> 00:45:49.710
<v Speaker 3>sweatpants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crushes.</v>

995
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:55.220
<v Speaker 3>And it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my mom is such a great woman and my </v>

996
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:55.220
<v Speaker 3>dad's such a great dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why sometimes,</v>

997
00:45:55.220 --> 00:46:00.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at my piano teacher got a sex change </v>

998
00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:00.200
<v Speaker 3>when I was 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

999
00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:04.040
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about this stuff for </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite some time where I got to see the </v>

1000
00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.610
<v Speaker 3>same person on different hormones as my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1001
00:46:05.611 --> 00:46:08.220
<v Speaker 3>and I'm a classical piano player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the most important people</v>

1002
00:46:08.221 --> 00:46:12.120
<v Speaker 3>in my life I'm still friends with and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like to see like it,</v>

1003
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>transition.</v>

1004
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.690
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh dudes are way different.</v>

1005
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.290
<v Speaker 3>Just the way the behavior change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1006
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.940
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to like,</v>

1007
00:46:20.941 --> 00:46:24.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>

1008
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.350
<v Speaker 3>what you're focusing on your level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>patience when he transitioned to a.</v>

1009
00:46:28.351 --> 00:46:28.980
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

1010
00:46:28.981 --> 00:46:33.981
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know on Halloween and I was like </v>

1011
00:46:33.981 --> 00:46:37.600
<v Speaker 3>trying to work on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Halloween while I was trying to work </v>

1012
00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.861
<v Speaker 3>out a bit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the best time to like make </v>

1013
00:46:39.861 --> 00:46:42.231
<v Speaker 3>that hard turn because people think it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a costume and then by Thanksgiving </v>

1014
00:46:42.231 --> 00:46:43.380
<v Speaker 3>everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh this is real.</v>

1015
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1016
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:48.690
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone like Steve O did it </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1017
00:46:48.691 --> 00:46:49.530
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1018
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:51.150
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're doing.</v>

1019
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:53.580
<v Speaker 3>You're not getting me with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a scam.</v>

1020
00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.950
<v Speaker 3>It would take forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would not be accepted.</v>

1021
00:46:55.951 --> 00:46:58.980
<v Speaker 3>It would take like months before people </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew it wasn't just a gag.</v>

1022
00:46:59.100 --> 00:46:59.850
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1023
00:46:59.851 --> 00:47:02.190
<v Speaker 3>it's a five year gag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Tom Green.</v>

1024
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:06.510
<v Speaker 3>That seems like something Tom Green </v>
<v Speaker 3>could almost get away with people like,</v>

1025
00:47:06.511 --> 00:47:07.220
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

1026
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:10.070
<v Speaker 3>We're seeing the Tom Green show 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

1027
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a bucket with the boys with </v>

1028
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:15.170
<v Speaker 3>the impractical jokers and I'm always </v>
<v Speaker 3>wondering like if,</v>

1029
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:17.780
<v Speaker 3>if one of them like really needs help </v>
<v Speaker 3>and public like,</v>

1030
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.680
<v Speaker 3>is everyone going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sal.</v>

1031
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:22.000
<v Speaker 3>It's a good point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1032
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.990
<v Speaker 3>because people will assume you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>a joke and you're like,</v>

1033
00:47:24.991 --> 00:47:26.370
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not joking.</v>

1034

<v Speaker 1>a big film man.</v>

1041
00:47:44.231 --> 00:47:49.231
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's going to change the </v>

1042
00:47:49.231 --> 00:47:50.990
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Practical joker goes out and has a life </v>

1043
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:55.111
<v Speaker 1>threatening illness and then doesn't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>rescued because that realizes that </v>

1044
00:47:55.301 --> 00:47:59.050
<v Speaker 1>practical jokes are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the moral Mazarra yeah.</v>

1045
00:47:59.051 --> 00:48:01.900
<v Speaker 1>What else is there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Ashton Kutcher.</v>

1046
00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:03.550
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have the cool black </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>

1047

1049
00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:10.150

<v Speaker 1>She should have a gay neighbor or no,</v>

1050
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:15.320
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone has to be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something has to happen right now.</v>

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:19.210

1149
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:07.180
<v Speaker 2>ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Screaming white lives matter.</v>

1150
00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1151
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.480
<v Speaker 2>you know who said it best?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

1152
00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I have a great quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sturgill Simpson sent me this.</v>

1153
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because uh,</v>

1154
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:21.400
<v Speaker 2>he had an email exchange with Dr Rick </v>
<v Speaker 2>Strassman,</v>

1155
00:52:21.401 --> 00:52:26.040
<v Speaker 2>who's the guy that wrote a dmt the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit molecule and uh,</v>

1156
00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:27.490
<v Speaker 2>they had an email exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1157
00:52:27.491 --> 00:52:32.491
<v Speaker 2>for starters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say this is Rick strassman </v>

1158
00:52:32.491 --> 00:52:35.431
<v Speaker 2>saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what we're seeing is a failure of </v>

1159
00:52:35.431 --> 00:52:37.801
<v Speaker 2>the educational system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is due to faults within the system </v>

1160
00:52:37.801 --> 00:52:41.470
<v Speaker 2>itself as well as attacks on the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That system from outside,</v>

1161
00:52:41.471 --> 00:52:46.471
<v Speaker 2>by forces and institutions that gained </v>
<v Speaker 2>to benefit from ignorance and addiction.</v>

1162
00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Both religious faith and the love of </v>
<v Speaker 2>community have degenerated into crude </v>

1163
00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:58.980
<v Speaker 2>parodies of what they're capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being regarding where this is all </v>

1164
00:52:58.980 --> 00:52:58.980
<v Speaker 2>heading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1165
00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:01.330
<v Speaker 2>my zen teacher used to say that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>force of good,</v>

1166
00:53:01.331 --> 00:53:03.190
<v Speaker 2>this is what we thought was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

1167
00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:06.310
<v Speaker 2>The forces of good relative to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces of evil,</v>

1168
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:11.400
<v Speaker 2>evil are always around 50 point one </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent versus 49 point nine percent.</v>

1169
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:18.120
<v Speaker 2>There's a similar notion in Judaism </v>
<v Speaker 2>along these lines that the future of the</v>

1170
00:53:18.611 --> 00:53:23.611
<v Speaker 2>world depends upon single individual's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions and I think it says something </v>

1171
00:53:23.611 --> 00:53:28.531
<v Speaker 2>like paradoxical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we are a speck of dust and the fate</v>

1172
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.400
<v Speaker 2>of the universe hinges on us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1173
00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:37.380
<v Speaker 2>That that quote right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are a speck of dust and in in quotes,</v>

1174
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:43.260
<v Speaker 2>the fate of the universe hinges on us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That when I read that today,</v>

1175
00:53:43.261 --> 00:53:44.490
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1176
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Like that's so true.</v>

1177
00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you see this right now,</v>

1178
00:53:47.761 --> 00:53:50.580
<v Speaker 2>like what's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlottesville and what's going on with</v>

1179
00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:56.180
<v Speaker 2>the way trump is reacting to it all and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way people reacted to it all and </v>

1180
00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:00.801
<v Speaker 2>people are digging in their heels and </v>
<v Speaker 2>form and signs and this is any group,</v>

1181
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:06.470
<v Speaker 2>any group that wouldn't think that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is completely insane and totally out of </v>

1182
00:54:07.651 --> 00:54:12.651
<v Speaker 2>control in any group of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't think that someone driving a </v>

1183
00:54:12.651 --> 00:54:16.260
<v Speaker 2>car into a group of protest or just </v>
<v Speaker 2>randomly running over a girl.</v>

1184
00:54:16.261 --> 00:54:21.261
<v Speaker 2>Any group that wouldn't denounce that </v>
<v Speaker 2>instantaneously as one of those heinous </v>

1185
00:54:21.261 --> 00:54:24.150
<v Speaker 2>things ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is exactly what we're terrified of,</v>

1186
00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:27.030
<v Speaker 2>what we see happening in Paris and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>other parts of the world.</v>

1187
00:54:27.031 --> 00:54:32.031
<v Speaker 2>And here we have an American doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And our differentiation is not even </v>

1188
00:54:32.221 --> 00:54:32.770
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1189
00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:37.810
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're being attacked the way we're </v>

1190
00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:40.521
<v Speaker 2>looking at it in terms of its white </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and white nationalists versus </v>

1191
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.270
<v Speaker 2>empty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1192
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.760
<v Speaker 2>We're not even looking at it like we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all Americans.</v>

1193
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:46.950
<v Speaker 2>We're not even looking at it like we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all on the same team.</v>

1194
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.730
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1195
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:48.600
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1196
00:54:48.601 --> 00:54:53.601
<v Speaker 2>we're literally homegrown terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a homegrown terrorist activity.</v>

1197
00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:54.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent,</v>

1198
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:55.760
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1199
00:54:55.761 --> 00:54:58.170
<v Speaker 2>so you worried about al Qaeda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're worried about isis,</v>

1200
00:54:58.171 --> 00:55:03.171
<v Speaker 2>you're worried about the Taliban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got something right here that is </v>

1201
00:55:03.171 --> 00:55:07.011
<v Speaker 2>willing to drive a car into a random </v>
<v Speaker 2>group of people that look just like him,</v>

1202
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:10.290
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1203
00:55:10.291 --> 00:55:13.260
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is completely fucking insane.</v>

1204
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:18.440
<v Speaker 2>And the craziest part is they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it to overthrow like the yolk of </v>

1205
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:18.440
<v Speaker 2>empire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

1206
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:18.710
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1207
00:55:18.711 --> 00:55:19.340
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1208
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Ireland back in the seventies with </v>
<v Speaker 2>British control,</v>

1209
00:55:22.171 --> 00:55:23.730
<v Speaker 2>like at least you can kind of be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1210
00:55:23.731 --> 00:55:28.731
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to be controlled by the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these people are literally living in </v>

1211
00:55:28.731 --> 00:55:28.731
<v Speaker 2>the most free country.</v>

1212
00:55:28.731 --> 00:55:33.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're prosperous to the point of </v>

1213
00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.051
<v Speaker 2>almost boredom where they start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think Antifa realizes how </v>

1214
00:55:36.051 --> 00:55:38.910
<v Speaker 2>much similarity they have to the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>they claim to be fighting against.</v>

1215
00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:43.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a natural progression to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely violent protests like these </v>

1216
00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:45.090
<v Speaker 2>people happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody ramps it up,</v>

1217
00:55:45.091 --> 00:55:47.090
<v Speaker 2>they ramp it up in the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ramp it up in the right,</v>

1218
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:50.340
<v Speaker 2>everybody gets angry in this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole drives into a bunch of people.</v>

1219
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking awful.</v>

1220
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:55.500
<v Speaker 2>And then trump said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

1221
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:58.500
<v Speaker 2>All this happened because we were taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>down the statue of Robert e Dot Lee,</v>

1222
00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.770
<v Speaker 2>who's the leader of the confederates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1223
00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Trump literally say said today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's next?</v>

1224
00:56:04.321 --> 00:56:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to take down a statue of </v>
<v Speaker 2>George Washington?</v>

1225
00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:09.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1226
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:12.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit of a false equivalency of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1227
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:16.430
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck can you even say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That this is.</v>

1228
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:22.040
<v Speaker 2>He's got some weird thing going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were asked to dance around his support </v>

1229
00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 2>for white supremacists or white </v>
<v Speaker 2>nationalist.</v>

1230
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:29.220
<v Speaker 3>He has to dance around it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is weird because they're not that </v>

1231
00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:32.290
<v Speaker 3>big of a group like it's not like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they're on your side,</v>

1232
00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:35.650
<v Speaker 3>they're all on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>

1233
00:56:35.651 --> 00:56:38.260
<v Speaker 3>people and it might be a lot more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think.</v>

1234
00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:41.170
<v Speaker 3>Man might be a lot of closet racists out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1235
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:45.120
<v Speaker 3>I see so much similarities between like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1236
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:48.580
<v Speaker 3>white racist and then like the social </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice racists or it's like it's just,</v>

1237
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:53.640
<v Speaker 3>it's usually like the white Nazis or </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the losers trying to get something </v>

1238
00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:54.320
<v Speaker 3>out of their skin and then social </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice worries.</v>

1239
00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:56.230
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times they're trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>something out of an oppressed,</v>

1240
00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.170
<v Speaker 3>being an unoppressed status in both of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those groups.</v>

1241
00:56:59.171 --> 00:57:01.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're both trying to avoid merit,</v>

1242
00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:03.760
<v Speaker 3>merit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're just trying to get something</v>

1243
00:57:03.761 --> 00:57:08.761
<v Speaker 3>from your stupid group because he never </v>
<v Speaker 3>see like a Nazi is like good looking,</v>

1244
00:57:09.131 --> 00:57:10.030
<v Speaker 3>are successful.</v>

1245
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:12.580
<v Speaker 3>They're always just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I deserve some shit because I'm white.</v>

1246
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:15.370
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that means you're weak as fuck.</v>

1247
00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:18.940
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's just a massive failure</v>

1248
00:57:18.941 --> 00:57:23.941
<v Speaker 3>from the beginning to now of thinking a </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar thing that makes sense to me.</v>

1249
00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just like the agenda,</v>

1250
00:57:26.711 --> 00:57:31.711
<v Speaker 3>thank where it's like you start ignoring</v>
<v Speaker 3>basic reality to get clicks or you know,</v>

1251
00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:35.650
<v Speaker 3>outrage culture as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the.</v>

1252
00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:39.250
<v Speaker 3>It's just not the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did see matt just joined up with all</v>

1253
00:57:39.251 --> 00:57:41.410
<v Speaker 3>white people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just insane.</v>

1254
00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:45.610
<v Speaker 3>It's completely insane and even the </v>
<v Speaker 3>concept of white is a new concept,</v>

1255
00:57:45.611 --> 00:57:46.600
<v Speaker 3>but growing up it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1256
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:51.601
<v Speaker 3>you're Irish or Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or it's like one of this fucking </v>

1257
00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:51.601
<v Speaker 3>federation kickoff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1258
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.220
<v Speaker 3>we've been forced in this position by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing called white privilege.</v>

1259
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:57.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I checked it on my way on check yourself</v>

1260
00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.420
<v Speaker 3>before you wreck yourself.</v>

00:58:24.761 --> 00:58:28.690
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to suck as much of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vitamin d out of the sky as they can.</v>

1280
00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:56.260
<v Speaker 3>separating and it really has nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do with who we are as people.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depending on where you are in history.</v>

1306
00:59:59.150 --> 01:00:02.240

<v Speaker 3>their pants sagging,</v>

1307
01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.110

1313
01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:19.680
<v Speaker 3>like a giant percentage of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>underwear.</v>

1314
01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just not even that.</v>

1316
01:00:24.561 --> 01:00:27.290
<v Speaker 3>It's just they're just making stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions with their life.</v>

1317
01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My brother judges people based on if </v>

1318
01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:32.780
<v Speaker 3>they back into their spot or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1322
01:00:39.291 --> 01:00:41.450
<v Speaker 3>so are then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if someone needs them,</v>

1323
01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:43.970
<v Speaker 3>I just back in in case of emergencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1324
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:45.410
<v Speaker 3>that is a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

1325
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:47.660
<v Speaker 3>He's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like it's just intensity,</v>

1326
01:00:47.661 --> 01:00:49.460
<v Speaker 3>like judge people on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1327
01:00:49.461 --> 01:00:51.920
<v Speaker 3>But like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting out.</v>

1328
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:55.210
<v Speaker 3>If I can back out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'll still get it.</v>

1329
01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Like how much of an advantage I'd like </v>
<v Speaker 3>to see,</v>

1330
01:00:57.201 --> 01:01:02.201
<v Speaker 3>like a test that shows how much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of an advantage you have in a </v>

1331
01:01:02.201 --> 01:01:03.130
<v Speaker 3>dangerous situation and a half second.</v>

1332
01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:05.010
<v Speaker 3>Like was he being attacked by like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pterodactyl look at?</v>

1333
01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Probably a whole second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me think back.</v>

1334
01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:11.270
<v Speaker 3>And then you take off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd probably have like a good solid two</v>

1335
01:01:11.271 --> 01:01:13.100
<v Speaker 3>or three seconds probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1336
01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:14.810
<v Speaker 3>that could save is.</v>

1337
01:01:14.811 --> 01:01:17.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why you might be able to make a light or</v>

1338
01:01:17.721 --> 01:01:18.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1341
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:26.150

1342
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a dangerous situation,</v>

1343
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.250
<v Speaker 3>then the real question is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how dangerous are we talking?</v>

1344
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:36.430
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to decide like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to be one of those people </v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with my friends and family,</v>

1353
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:59.711
<v Speaker 3>I didn't read that book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I watched a little bit of the movie </v>

1354
01:01:59.711 --> 01:02:01.751
<v Speaker 3>up until he was teaching.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It just seems like you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannibalize.</v>

1361
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:13.250
<v Speaker 3>You just don't stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really don't.</v>

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.780
<v Speaker 3>You just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

1363

1365
01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Like right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you're constantly under </v>

1366
01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:25.970
<v Speaker 1>threat of someone's stealing everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have.</v>

1367
01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constant.</v>

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Check cocked and ready to rock looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the window.</v>

1370
01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Always worried about invaders that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat you.</v>

1371
01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I lost a bunch of chickens to raccoon </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a Fox recently and it dawned on me </v>

1372
01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>that stakes of life where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I needed those eggs,</v>

1373
01:02:44.521 --> 01:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>like I'm fucking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You killed nine of them in one night.</v>

1374
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1375
01:02:48.451 --> 01:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>one mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one hole in the thing,</v>

1376
01:02:50.821 --> 01:02:52.380
<v Speaker 1>and they drink the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1377
01:02:52.381 --> 01:02:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The raccoons,</v>

1378
01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.260
<v Speaker 1>they bite their neck and drink their </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>

1379
01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>I think so they took the bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

1380
01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I think there's a fox </v>

1381
01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:02.360
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

1382
01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1383
01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.300
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole party going on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken.</v>

1384
01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:08.490
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we stayed up the next night with air </v>

1385
01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:08.940
<v Speaker 1>rifles and shot a raccoon and a Fox </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they came back.</v>

1386
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did?</v>

1387
01:03:10.321 --> 01:03:12.290
<v Speaker 1>It was like a Disney movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn.</v>

1388
01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>air rifle.</v>

1389
01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilcon.</v>

1390
01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want you to get it like ace </v>

1391
01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:22.490
<v Speaker 1>hardware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Store one.</v>

1392
01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did it kill them or just hurt?</v>

1393
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to set a tone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wasn't looking to take them out.</v>

1394
01:03:26.851 --> 01:03:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I was looking to do like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1395
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.610
<v Speaker 1>don't kill the girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1396
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I can't legally shoot a gun in </v>

1397
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:37.140
<v Speaker 1>my area even though I'm in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time to go walking dead style son.</v>

1398
01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Get yourself across both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1399
01:03:39.121 --> 01:03:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not accurate yet.</v>

1400
01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>

1401
01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.580
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time to learn how to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate with a boat.</v>

1402
01:03:44.581 --> 01:03:49.581
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend a crossbow and nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest with a crossbow is basically a </v>

1403
01:03:49.581 --> 01:03:49.581
<v Speaker 1>shitty gun.</v>

1404
01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:52.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a gun that shoots bolts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just doesn't.</v>

1405
01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>

1406
01:03:55.081 --> 01:04:00.081
<v Speaker 1>You're going to trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is squeeze that </v>

1407
01:04:00.081 --> 01:04:02.991
<v Speaker 1>sucker off and put the crosshairs on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they fly really flat and really </v>

1408
01:04:02.991 --> 01:04:07.311
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can fuck up a Fox with one of those </v>

1409
01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:07.920
<v Speaker 1>if you were so inclined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am inclined.</v>

1410
01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelly,</v>

1411
01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:14.160
<v Speaker 1>your chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should definitely try to scare it </v>

1412
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:14.160
<v Speaker 1>off and there's other options too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can.</v>

1413
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.801
<v Speaker 1>You can take a urine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll sell like mountain lion urine </v>

1414
01:04:17.801 --> 01:04:21.861
<v Speaker 1>and even wolf urine testing on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work like vitamins and.</v>

1415
01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he eats bananas big.</v>

1416
01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.810
<v Speaker 1>He's been drunk for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's.</v>

1417
01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.890
<v Speaker 1>He's so dehydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not gonna do anything.</v>

1418
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have like a different kinds of </v>

1419
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:37.440
<v Speaker 1>animals that get scared off by different</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of sense.</v>

1420
01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get a cent.</v>

1421
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>We man get some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both pis,</v>

1422
01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>they sell the shit they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really sell it,</v>

1423
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>they sell all kinds of different animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>pis to ward off other animals.</v>

1424
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:52.020
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clock Piss.</v>

1425
01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that works.</v>

1426
01:04:54.271 --> 01:04:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it works with raptors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's more of a mammal thing.</v>

1427
01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Raptors piss on stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be interesting if they did.</v>

1428
01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I know mammals do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dogs and cats piss on shit.</v>

1429
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Mark their ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1430
01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:11.111
<v Speaker 1>Because it's like birds are like raptors</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use that word just changed my whole </v>

1431
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>opinion out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking gangster there.</v>

1432
01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>So there are so predatory there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ruthless to.</v>

1433
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to work at a dock and I'd feed </v>

1434
01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:23.830
<v Speaker 3>ducks a brad and just watched them </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking destroyed job.</v>

1435
01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:25.900
<v Speaker 3>Bite each others stealing bread from </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1436
01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:28.990
<v Speaker 3>That's why when a girl does a duck face </v>
<v Speaker 3>instinctively granted.</v>

1437
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:33.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1438
01:05:33.511 --> 01:05:38.511
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's come back to that Google memo </v>

1439
01:05:38.511 --> 01:05:38.511
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1440
01:05:38.511 --> 01:05:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Because this is one of the weird lines </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sand that got cross with this is </v>

1441
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:42.000
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

1442
01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody established a line in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sand I should say.</v>

1443
01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:50.120
<v Speaker 2>And it was like you thought that memo </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the worst thing you've ever read </v>

1444
01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:54.501
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that guy's a massage and a piece of </v>

1445
01:05:54.501 --> 01:05:54.501
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or he said,</v>

1446
01:05:54.501 --> 01:05:54.501
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1447
01:05:54.501 --> 01:05:56.530
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary psychology sort of tries to</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain why,</v>

1448
01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:59.970
<v Speaker 2>why people choose certain things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what factors,</v>

1449
01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:03.590
<v Speaker 2>what factors or environmental factors or</v>
<v Speaker 2>hormonal would,</v>

1450
01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:05.720
<v Speaker 2>what factors have to do with being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>male when have,</v>

1451
01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:07.320
<v Speaker 2>what factors have to do with being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>female.</v>

1452
01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:12.530
<v Speaker 2>And there's like a lot of studies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy cited a lot of studies and he </v>

1453
01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.780
<v Speaker 2>talked like he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a really interesting thing.</v>

1454
01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:20.810
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that I think people could</v>
<v Speaker 2>find derogatory maybe is that he said </v>

1455
01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:23.910
<v Speaker 2>the women are more neurotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neurotic is sort of a derogatory term,</v>

1456
01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:28.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually a derogatory term.</v>

1457
01:06:28.411 --> 01:06:33.411
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not neurotic is saying that you're </v>

1458
01:06:33.411 --> 01:06:33.411
<v Speaker 2>not handling something good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1459
01:06:33.411 --> 01:06:34.790
<v Speaker 2>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not handling whatever</v>

1460
01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:36.270
<v Speaker 3>pressures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1461
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.950
<v Speaker 3>There's a neurotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1462
01:06:37.951 --> 01:06:40.870
<v Speaker 3>I would be calm because it's implying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>

1463
01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.260
<v Speaker 3>the another person handling that same </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

1464
01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.440
<v Speaker 3>perhaps even mail that'd be more calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1465
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Like the like very aware would be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice way of saying it because I like,</v>

1466
01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:53.250
<v Speaker 3>my wife has a lot of anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once we had a baby I was like,</v>

1467
01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:58.280
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why because you're responsible </v>

1468
01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:58.280
<v Speaker 3>for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like little alien,</v>

1469
01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:58.280
<v Speaker 3>it can die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally make sense.</v>

1470
01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.340
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that guy said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the car,</v>

1471
01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:06.530
<v Speaker 3>like when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people would argue with me about </v>

1472
01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:06.530
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

1473
01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:06.530
<v Speaker 3>so do you think men and women are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same?</v>

1474
01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.500
<v Speaker 3>And from there I don't care if they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>an expert,</v>

1475
01:07:10.501 --> 01:07:12.600
<v Speaker 3>if they say there is no difference at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1476
01:07:12.601 --> 01:07:17.601
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom had her phd and quit to raise us </v>

1477
01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:20.970
<v Speaker 3>as soon as she had her baby and my wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>stays home with our son was an engineer.</v>

1478
01:07:20.971 --> 01:07:25.971
<v Speaker 3>It's like that isn't saying that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't rockstar female engineers that </v>

1479
01:07:25.971 --> 01:07:28.740
<v Speaker 3>have no interest in having a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All it does is affect the,</v>

1480
01:07:28.741 --> 01:07:30.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the percentage.</v>

1481
01:07:30.810 --> 01:07:35.810
<v Speaker 3>And that's always saying is equality of </v>
<v Speaker 3>outcome versus a opportunity is really </v>

1482
01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:36.990
<v Speaker 3>the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm very against equality of outcome</v>

1483
01:07:36.991 --> 01:07:39.390
<v Speaker 3>because the legal precedent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is insane.</v>

1484
01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:42.600
<v Speaker 2>A real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to find out,</v>

1485
01:07:42.601 --> 01:07:44.370
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the actual suppression?</v>

1486
01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:48.110
<v Speaker 2>What is stopping people from getting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this position that happened?</v>

1487
01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Be Female?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it because they're being suppressed </v>

1488
01:07:53.130 --> 01:07:53.490
<v Speaker 2>along the way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it because the way they interact with</v>

1489
01:07:53.491 --> 01:07:56.970
<v Speaker 2>each other is different than the way men</v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with each other and so when men</v>

1490
01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:00.960
<v Speaker 2>interact with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get upset by it.</v>

1491
01:08:00.961 --> 01:08:05.961
<v Speaker 2>There's different rules that have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>established in these working </v>

1492
01:08:05.961 --> 01:08:08.541
<v Speaker 2>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it that they don't want to have </v>

1493
01:08:08.541 --> 01:08:11.841
<v Speaker 2>anything to do with that and they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather not compete in one of those </v>

1494
01:08:11.841 --> 01:08:14.781
<v Speaker 2>hostile male driven environments?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that why they choose not to get </v>

1495
01:08:14.781 --> 01:08:16.310
<v Speaker 2>involved or are they someone stopping </v>
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>

1496
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:17.390
<v Speaker 2>If someone's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1497
01:08:17.391 --> 01:08:19.340
<v Speaker 2>we gotta keep chicks out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like checks.</v>

1498
01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Like it would completely depend on </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's actually happening if the ladders</v>

1499
01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.730
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you got a real issue.</v>

1500
01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if the former like the very </v>

1501
01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:31.070
<v Speaker 2>beginning one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they choose different stuff,</v>

1502
01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:36.220
<v Speaker 2>ironically it hurts women the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the very qualified ones with the </v>

1503
01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:36.310
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People start looking at him.</v>

1504
01:08:36.311 --> 01:08:41.311
<v Speaker 2>I go because they're women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though like programming itself was </v>

1505
01:08:41.311 --> 01:08:41.930
<v Speaker 2>founded by a chick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1506
01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:45.050
<v Speaker 2>but like I don't think that she vented </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cobol,</v>

1507
01:08:45.051 --> 01:08:46.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1508
01:08:46.810 --> 01:08:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Like some of my buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was going on that one.</v>

1509
01:08:49.101 --> 01:08:54.050
<v Speaker 2>It's called cobol the lovelace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1510
01:08:54.051 --> 01:08:59.051
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not discluding and it's not saying </v>

1511
01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:02.291
<v Speaker 2>that women can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course less women are interested in </v>

1512
01:09:02.291 --> 01:09:02.291
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1513
01:09:02.291 --> 01:09:06.860
<v Speaker 2>So if you have an equal number of men </v>
<v Speaker 2>and women,</v>

1514
01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:10.820
<v Speaker 2>then you probably go like artificially </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflated the number of women.</v>

1515
01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

1516
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Unless for some reason women gravitate </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards that thing and just as higher </v>

1517
01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.690
<v Speaker 2>percentages men do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really odd because not a lot of</v>

1518
01:09:20.691 --> 01:09:25.250
<v Speaker 2>things where women gravitate towards it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the same percentage of people.</v>

1519
01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:26.330
<v Speaker 2>It's the same like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1520
01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:31.360
<v Speaker 2>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's a lot of fields of </v>

1521
01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.461
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know particularly nursing and I think </v>

1522
01:09:33.461 --> 01:09:35.591
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the social studies that women </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravitate tape towards in higher </v>

1523
01:09:35.591 --> 01:09:35.591
<v Speaker 2>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1524
01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nursing,</v>

1525
01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:40.170
<v Speaker 2>healthcare even I think he teaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>children's,</v>

1526
01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:43.580
<v Speaker 2>I think there's more female physicians </v>
<v Speaker 2>means that's bullshit.</v>

1527
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I read that from some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like teaching children gravitate </v>

1528
01:09:48.610 --> 01:09:51.920
<v Speaker 2>more to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be a ton of different </v>

1529
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.560
<v Speaker 2>jobs that females like gravitate towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>in higher percentages.</v>

1530
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:59.750
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we absolutely shouldn't insist that </v>

1531
01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:01.340
<v Speaker 2>there's an equal representation of men </v>
<v Speaker 2>in florists.</v>

1532
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>

1533
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.260
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in interior design.</v>

1534
01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:06.470
<v Speaker 2>My brother's a lumberjack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We worked,</v>

1535
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:11.950
<v Speaker 2>we worked with one woman worked with us </v>
<v Speaker 2>one time and she was from Yale and like </v>

1536
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:13.560
<v Speaker 2>probably doing a whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1537
01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:16.230
<v Speaker 2>like he couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I dunno,</v>

1538
01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.310
<v Speaker 2>but couldn't climb a tree and like some </v>
<v Speaker 2>women for sure could,</v>

1539
01:10:19.311 --> 01:10:24.270
<v Speaker 2>but if you're going like these dudes go </v>
<v Speaker 2>up 200 foot trees and,</v>

1540
01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:27.110
<v Speaker 2>and spend all day like chopping them </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1541
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:32.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't going to drop 50 percent </v>

1542
01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:32.710
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

1543
01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:35.500
<v Speaker 2>It just isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's the most hilarious thing </v>

1544
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.781
<v Speaker 2>about the google memo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It upset so many women that they had to </v>

1545
01:10:37.781 --> 01:10:41.150
<v Speaker 2>take time off proving the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy.</v>

1546
01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:45.770
<v Speaker 2>They wanted time off so bad that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>went for it.</v>

1547
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:50.950
<v Speaker 2>They want to play the victim so hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they went for it and not even </v>

1548
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:54.671
<v Speaker 2>understanding that it proves the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the most skeptical people,</v>

1549
01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.860
<v Speaker 2>the most skeptical people on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1550
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:59.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if these chicks are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to pull their own weight,</v>

1551
01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:05.230
<v Speaker 2>these chicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then immediately they encounter any </v>

1552
01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:05.330
<v Speaker 2>adversity like we need time off from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>memo.</v>

1553
01:11:05.331 --> 01:11:10.331
<v Speaker 2>Handle this from a nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody talked about evolutionary </v>

1554
01:11:10.331 --> 01:11:12.920
<v Speaker 2>psychology and I just can't handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need time away from work.</v>

1555
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm being attacked</v>

1556
01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.510
<v Speaker 3>because they said it was time for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>female James Bond.</v>

1557
01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I called him.</v>

1558
01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:25.050
<v Speaker 3>I called her double o seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven cents on the dollar and one of the</v>

1559
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:26.430
<v Speaker 3>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jane Bond,</v>

1560
01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:30.450
<v Speaker 3>she's open to hyphenation and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether lies is in need of a big Asian.</v>

1561
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.540
<v Speaker 3>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you take James,</v>

1562
01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.170
<v Speaker 3>you can have a female spy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just going to be different tactics.</v>

1563
01:11:37.171 --> 01:11:40.410
<v Speaker 3>You can't have a male wonder woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1564
01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.790
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can have a female James Bond.</v>

1565
01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Make your own fucking detective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be James Bond.</v>

1566
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:52.740
<v Speaker 3>He's a guy and I'm cool with Black </v>
<v Speaker 3>Santa.</v>

1567
01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:58.160
<v Speaker 3>I am too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's because that's I think </v>

1568
01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:58.160
<v Speaker 3>Megan Kelly was out of line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do too.</v>

1569
01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:03.090
<v Speaker 3>She was out a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but theoretically why the fuck would he </v>

1570
01:12:03.301 --> 01:12:04.990
<v Speaker 3>be black?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was living up in the North Pole?</v>

1571
01:12:04.991 --> 01:12:06.780
<v Speaker 3>It'd be white as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole point.</v>

1572
01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:09.450
<v Speaker 3>The Irish magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no god damn sign up there.</v>

1573
01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:11.140
<v Speaker 3>It's freezing cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1574
01:12:11.170 --> 01:12:16.170
<v Speaker 3>Black gets outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There could be black Santa but he would </v>

1575
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:16.170
<v Speaker 3>die of rickets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1576
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:18.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that would be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he would,</v>

1577
01:12:18.591 --> 01:12:23.591
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would have a real issue getting some </v>

1578
01:12:23.591 --> 01:12:23.591
<v Speaker 3>vitamin D.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would,</v>

1579
01:12:23.591 --> 01:12:23.930
<v Speaker 3>he'd have to go get it somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe some supplements.</v>

<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

1617

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1618
01:14:19.181 --> 01:14:20.680
<v Speaker 2>I love Lucy,</v>

1619
01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:21.910
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that pitch like?</v>

1620
01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Let's ask the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What year do you think Hogan's heroes </v>

1621
01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:30.331
<v Speaker 2>came out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it was in the seventies </v>

1622
01:14:30.331 --> 01:14:31.330
<v Speaker 2>and the war ended in 47.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1623
01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.030
<v Speaker 2>When was Hogan's heroes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty five.</v>

1624
01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

1625
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:40.830
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's less than 20 years after the war </v>

1626
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:41.140
<v Speaker 2>was over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a goddamn comedy about the war.</v>

1627
01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's gallows humor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it affected so many people that </v>

1628
01:14:46.170 --> 01:14:46.210
<v Speaker 2>they had this impulse to market?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1629
01:14:46.211 --> 01:14:48.640
<v Speaker 2>I think people were tougher back then </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1630
01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:53.670
<v Speaker 2>They could joke around about shit more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hence Archie bunker to be literally </v>

1631
01:14:53.670 --> 01:14:58.591
<v Speaker 2>impossible to have today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of outrage if someone tried </v>

1632
01:14:58.591 --> 01:14:59.710
<v Speaker 2>to make an art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a character like archie bunker.</v>

1633
01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1634
01:15:01.670 --> 01:15:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

1635
01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.490
<v Speaker 2>He was wearing a fucking.</v>

1636
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Remember he had to pretend to be a Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>at one point in time snuck in.</v>

1637
01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:10.330
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much hard today,</v>

1638
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:14.710
<v Speaker 2>so much anger at even racist characters </v>
<v Speaker 2>in fiction.</v>

1639
01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.440
<v Speaker 2>If you have a racist character in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiction,</v>

1640
01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:22.570
<v Speaker 2>people are angry you like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of young,</v>

1641
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:27.420
<v Speaker 2>what's young fiction like young heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a um,</v>

1642
01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:32.670
<v Speaker 2>there's a category that they use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's this very popular book and </v>

1643
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:38.790
<v Speaker 2>it's being attacked by all these social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice warriors because of this one </v>

1644
01:15:38.831 --> 01:15:41.740
<v Speaker 2>character that's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so someone took the,</v>

1645
01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:45.790
<v Speaker 2>the racist quotes at this character set </v>
<v Speaker 2>and took him completely out of context,</v>

1646
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:50.950
<v Speaker 2>out of the context of the book and </v>
<v Speaker 2>published it in a blog and was saying </v>

1647
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:55.051
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this racist bullshit that's in </v>

1648
01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:58.171
<v Speaker 2>this book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people are getting really mad </v>

1649
01:15:58.171 --> 01:15:58.180
<v Speaker 2>at the course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never read the book,</v>

1650
01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.760
<v Speaker 2>read the blog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what people do.</v>

1651
01:16:01.150 --> 01:16:04.840
<v Speaker 2>And so they got super fucking mad and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1652
01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.380
<v Speaker 2>it just became this huge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1653
01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:11.460
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying you can't have a monster </v>

1654
01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:11.460
<v Speaker 2>in a book and you have a guy who's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>murderer?</v>

1655
01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Because if we can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to know where the fucking line </v>

1656
01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:15.840
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man Can.</v>

1657
01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:19.501

<v Speaker 2>I can't make a book about a serial </v>

1658
01:16:19.501 --> 01:16:19.501
<v Speaker 2>killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1659
01:16:19.501 --> 01:16:19.501
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1660
01:16:19.501 --> 01:16:20.160
<v Speaker 2>But it can't be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1661
01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got it.</v>

1662
01:16:20.951 --> 01:16:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I make a book about a guy who brings</v>

1663
01:16:23.531 --> 01:16:27.610
<v Speaker 2>people back from the dead and they kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people and can I do that?</v>

1664
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1665
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:33.870
<v Speaker 2>But he can't be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't discriminate against Chinese </v>

1666
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:33.870
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't discriminate.</v>

1667
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:33.880
<v Speaker 2>I've used the wrong pronoun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

1668
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:37.060
<v Speaker 2>Imagine how fucking stupid you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be that it would just be clock,</v>

<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

1675
01:16:46.991 --> 01:16:49.900
<v Speaker 2>they took Edward Jim out of huckleberry </v>
<v Speaker 2>Finn.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did get that word out.</v>

1677
01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:55.300
<v Speaker 2>You can't know at time unless you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>the characters from that time,</v>

1678
01:16:55.301 --> 01:16:57.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's giving people a real disservice</v>

1679
01:16:57.641 --> 01:17:02.560
<v Speaker 2>to just like emasculate and neuter our </v>
<v Speaker 2>history so that everybody can't see what</v>

1680
01:17:02.561 --> 01:17:07.561
<v Speaker 2>real dangers are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what just happened in </v>

1681
01:17:07.561 --> 01:17:09.421
<v Speaker 2>Charlottesville,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all the people that called Dave </v>

<v Speaker 2>for these people right now it has no </v>

1683
01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:13.760
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1686
01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:21.210
<v Speaker 2>it's really important to not overreact </v>
<v Speaker 2>to people that don't have the exact same</v>

1687
01:17:22.191 --> 01:17:25.580
<v Speaker 2>opinion as you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when something like this happens,</v>

1688
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:26.510
<v Speaker 2>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1689
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:29.090
<v Speaker 2>that's what you should react to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1690
01:17:29.091 --> 01:17:30.530
<v Speaker 2>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is real.</v>

1691
01:17:30.531 --> 01:17:35.531
<v Speaker 2>You got a bunch of Douche bags with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking with torches from home depot or </v>

1692
01:17:35.531 --> 01:17:36.500
<v Speaker 2>wherever the fuck they got this.</v>

1693
01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Those are those Citronella court people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been like the suburbs.</v>

1694
01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:45.700
<v Speaker 2>They have like a Tiki party by some and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now I can't come on because literally </v>

1695
01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:50.321
<v Speaker 2>kind of like I liked those torches for </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing mosquitoes and I was thinking </v>

1696
01:17:50.321 --> 01:17:50.321
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1697
01:17:50.321 --> 01:17:53.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to buy those now because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Charlottesville and all these guys.</v>

1698
01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:53.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1699
01:17:53.781 --> 01:17:56.660
<v Speaker 2>if any of those people that are into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are listening,</v>

1700
01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:02.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even upset at you as a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get trapped into patterns of </v>

1701
01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:06.350
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm upset at that pattern.</v>

1702
01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm upset that this is a repeated </v>
<v Speaker 2>repeating pattern that's happened </v>

1703
01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:16.331
<v Speaker 2>through human history where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide that there's specific groups that</v>

1704
01:18:16.431 --> 01:18:21.431
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another deserved preferential</v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment or are better or or or or </v>

1705
01:18:22.851 --> 01:18:25.910
<v Speaker 2>superior or should dominate over other </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>

1706
01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:31.060
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid and it's bad for business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad for the business of being human</v>

1707
01:18:31.761 --> 01:18:32.240
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

1708
01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.480
<v Speaker 2>It gets in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>

1709
01:18:33.481 --> 01:18:38.481
<v Speaker 2>You're judging people and nonsense and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to all be in the group just </v>

1710
01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:40.250
<v Speaker 2>because you have similar skin color </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking stupid.</v>

1711
01:18:40.650 --> 01:18:44.430
<v Speaker 2>You're allowing a bunch of losers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your group then because you're.</v>

1712
01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.060
<v Speaker 2>The only differentiation is that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be white.</v>

1713
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:50.500
<v Speaker 2>That is insanely stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so stupid,</v>

1714
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:55.510
<v Speaker 2>so don't miss out on all the cool black </v>
<v Speaker 2>people you're going to miss out on all </v>

1715
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.820
<v Speaker 2>the cool Cubans and all the cool Puerto </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rican.</v>

1716
01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:57.570
<v Speaker 2>You're going gonna miss out on them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna.</v>

1717
01:18:57.590 --> 01:19:02.590
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think that you have some family in this </v>

1718
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:03.440
<v Speaker 2>idea that you all have nordic routes or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1719
01:19:03.441 --> 01:19:05.930
<v Speaker 2>It's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1720
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:11.110
<v Speaker 2>I understand if you run into people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are black and they're racist against </v>

1721
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:13.820
<v Speaker 2>white people and you feel like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white people have to protect themselves.</v>

1722
01:19:13.821 --> 01:19:17.090
<v Speaker 2>If you get one of those situations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those situations are real,</v>

1723
01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.110
<v Speaker 2>they can happen.</v>

1724
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Racism can occur on both sides and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>another disingenuous thing that the left</v>

1725
01:19:21.921 --> 01:19:26.870
<v Speaker 2>is doing is accepting this idea that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can only be racist if you're white.</v>

1726
01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.810
<v Speaker 2>It's just a racist statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so racist.</v>

1727
01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:32.030
<v Speaker 2>It's over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is something that people were.</v>

1728
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:35.180
<v Speaker 2>I think they've kind of let it go for </v>
<v Speaker 2>for most recently,</v>

1729
01:19:35.181 --> 01:19:40.181
<v Speaker 2>like out there in the twitter sphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for a good long time it was a </v>

1730
01:19:40.181 --> 01:19:44.180
<v Speaker 2>defensible argument that a black person </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be racist because racism is all</v>

1731
01:19:44.181 --> 01:19:47.180
<v Speaker 2>about power and black people don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>power over white people.</v>

1732
01:19:47.181 --> 01:19:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Like what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

1733
01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:53.460
<v Speaker 2>you're changing the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're changing the fucking word and </v>

1734
01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:54.710
<v Speaker 2>you're going to empower actual racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>course and it's like no one,</v>

1735
01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:59.770
<v Speaker 2>you don't know Nazis till you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>treaty of Versailles and you don't know </v>

1736
01:19:59.770 --> 01:19:59.960
<v Speaker 2>this until like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1737
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:02.990
<v Speaker 2>just over shaming always has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>springboard effect.</v>

1738
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:05.930
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll wait like after world war one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same with like,</v>

1739
01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:09.250
<v Speaker 2>you know that shamed gay guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that hates gay people,</v>

1740
01:20:09.251 --> 01:20:14.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's like shame is a horrible </v>

1741
01:20:14.251 --> 01:20:15.570
<v Speaker 2>thing and people and so world war one </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood on our hands,</v>

1742
01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:20.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was started and executed for very </v>

1743
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:21.360
<v Speaker 2>bizarre reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They blamed Germany for all of it to the</v>

1744
01:20:21.361 --> 01:20:25.230
<v Speaker 2>point where they destroyed Germany and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they were looking for a voice.</v>

1745
01:20:25.231 --> 01:20:27.780
<v Speaker 2>It gave them hope and that voice is </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

1746
01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:30.900
<v Speaker 2>And so that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That happened in this where it's like,</v>

1747
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:36.110
<v Speaker 2>dear white people being white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should just say sorry all the </v>

1748
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.110
<v Speaker 2>fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though your people came in 19.</v>

1749
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1750
01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:41.420
<v Speaker 2>well you can see it today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the people that never criticized </v>

1751
01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:44.351
<v Speaker 2>trump and have like exclamation points </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the right Magda after all their </v>

<v Speaker 2>it's always amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Really thinking you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is not a normal way to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 2>super important issues.</v>

1762
01:21:04.710 --> 01:21:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Just wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump said today that like,</v>

1763
01:21:08.881 --> 01:21:10.680
<v Speaker 2>what's next?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to take down the statue of</v>

1764
01:21:10.681 --> 01:21:15.681
<v Speaker 2>George Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like they took down a statue of </v>

1765
01:21:15.681 --> 01:21:15.681
<v Speaker 2>Robert e Dot Lee and every freaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's next?</v>

1766
01:21:15.681 --> 01:21:15.900
<v Speaker 2>We're going to take down the statue of </v>
<v Speaker 2>George Washington.</v>

1767
01:21:15.901 --> 01:21:16.590
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1768
01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like when the word normalizing </v>

1769
01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:21.710
<v Speaker 2>actually fits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1770
01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:25.371
<v Speaker 2>like all these things that have been so </v>
<v Speaker 2>flooded that is normalizing something </v>

1771
01:21:25.371 --> 01:21:29.781
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like so crazy competitive and </v>

1772
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:31.920
<v Speaker 2>with Robert e Dot Lee is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

1773
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:37.160
<v Speaker 2>but the left is like over pointed out </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems to the point where knowing like</v>

1774
01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:39.690
<v Speaker 2>you can't have your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't trust your instincts right now</v>

1775
01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:41.280
<v Speaker 2>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I say this,</v>

1776
01:21:41.281 --> 01:21:42.300
<v Speaker 2>does this make me racist?</v>

1777
01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:44.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it's 80 degrees outside.</v>

1778
01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.240
<v Speaker 2>How is that linked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1779
01:21:46.241 --> 01:21:51.241
<v Speaker 2>And also I think anybody coming in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>deciding to do something is a problem.</v>

1780
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:56.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people coming in and started </v>

1781
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:59.220
<v Speaker 2>deciding to take down a statue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Statues assembled to a lot of people and</v>

1782
01:21:59.221 --> 01:22:01.050
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people step in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1783
01:22:01.051 --> 01:22:06.051
<v Speaker 2>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there should be some sort of </v>

1784
01:22:06.051 --> 01:22:08.520
<v Speaker 2>real prolonged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent conversation about what that</v>

1785
01:22:08.521 --> 01:22:12.320
<v Speaker 2>statute means and have it in a way we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people can,</v>

1786
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:17.390
<v Speaker 2>can see it and have it represented on </v>
<v Speaker 2>both sides have been represented by the </v>

1787
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:22.161
<v Speaker 2>side of people that think it's a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea to keep it up and have it </v>

1788
01:22:22.161 --> 01:22:24.801
<v Speaker 2>represented on the side of someone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks it's a good idea to move on and </v>

1789
01:22:24.801 --> 01:22:28.311
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should take this thing and put </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in some sort of a war museum and not </v>

1790
01:22:28.311 --> 01:22:31.821
<v Speaker 2>having it represent the goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>confederate soldiers in the middle of </v>

1791
01:22:31.821 --> 01:22:33.150
<v Speaker 2>this town that's not confederate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1792
01:22:33.151 --> 01:22:35.070
<v Speaker 2>We.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The war's gone because you're.</v>

1793
01:22:35.071 --> 01:22:40.071
<v Speaker 2>You're holding on to this idea that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>team lost a battle and that there's an </v>

1794
01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.840
<v Speaker 2>invading army that sitting with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1795
01:22:42.841 --> 01:22:43.950
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all Americans.</v>

1796
01:22:43.951 --> 01:22:44.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is old,</v>

1797
01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:45.900
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old shit.</v>

1798
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:47.790
<v Speaker 2>18 60 shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1799
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:53.030
<v Speaker 2>let it go stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take this down and let's put up a </v>

1800
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:56.400
<v Speaker 2>goddamn glorious kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rock Tattoo Style Eagle with a fucking </v>

1801
01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.060
<v Speaker 2>flag behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come out.</v>

1802
01:22:58.410 --> 01:23:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Really Love America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take down the Robert e Dot Lee and</v>

1803
01:23:01.111 --> 01:23:06.111
<v Speaker 2>put up hulking American Eagle with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking flag in the wind.</v>

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:11.400
<v Speaker 3>Just cash and then underneath it have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic plaque of everybody that lost </v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1807
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.580

<v Speaker 3>represented to.</v>

1808
01:23:18.581 --> 01:23:22.540
<v Speaker 3>Is it like a glorious statue or is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a relic of history?</v>

1809
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:26.080
<v Speaker 3>Because I think the debate is a seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Who killed like a fit,</v>

1827
01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:03.790
<v Speaker 3>like five percent of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1828
01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:06.280
<v Speaker 3>something even crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he killed like 10 percent of the</v>

1829
01:24:06.281 --> 01:24:08.290
<v Speaker 3>world's population while he was alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1830
01:24:08.291 --> 01:24:11.770
<v Speaker 3>This is a tough one because this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that is a rebel army we lost.</v>

1831
01:24:11.771 --> 01:24:14.560
<v Speaker 3>So that should be taken down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time it's like,</v>

1832
01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.980
<v Speaker 3>but what do you do with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then to the natives,</v>

1833
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:19.290
<v Speaker 3>Americans tell people to take down in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington,</v>

1834
01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:20.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you start,</v>

1835
01:24:20.350 --> 01:24:22.210
<v Speaker 3>then you start getting in a battle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1836
01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.000
<v Speaker 3>well this person wronged my people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well this person.</v>

1837
01:24:25.001 --> 01:24:26.320
<v Speaker 3>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1838
01:24:26.321 --> 01:24:30.520
<v Speaker 3>like I see people with Che shirts from </v>
<v Speaker 3>urban outfitters and I'm like,</v>

1839
01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:33.700
<v Speaker 3>that dude committed genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do a lot of people,</v>

1840
01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:34.870
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1841
01:24:34.871 --> 01:24:38.110
<v Speaker 3>at what point is it with this one?</v>

1842
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:42.250
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's a valid argument to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take it down because it was a rebel army</v>

1843
01:24:42.251 --> 01:24:46.510
<v Speaker 3>and well I'm just a rebel army in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country that it's still in,</v>

1844
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:50.980
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time it's like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>slippery slope of a racing.</v>

1845
01:24:51.210 --> 01:24:52.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1846
01:24:52.570 --> 01:24:53.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should have it in your</v>

1847
01:24:53.921 --> 01:24:55.570
<v Speaker 3>state capital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever the fuck that.</v>

1848
01:24:55.571 --> 01:24:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>State Capitol building.</v>

1849
01:24:57.370 --> 01:24:58.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a no brainer.</v>

1850
01:24:58.511 --> 01:25:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Represents that state what it is,</v>

1851
01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:06.810
<v Speaker 3>but see if he could pull it up again </v>
<v Speaker 3>just so we know what the fuck we're </v>

1852
01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:06.810
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was kind of like.</v>

1853
01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:08.050
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like a state building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1854
01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:13.090
<v Speaker 3>it was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I felt about confederate </v>

1855
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:13.090
<v Speaker 3>flag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1856
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:15.421
<v Speaker 3>obviously take it off state buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Justice is still a part of a few </v>

1857
01:25:15.421 --> 01:25:16.270
<v Speaker 3>different flags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1858
01:25:16.330 --> 01:25:19.180
<v Speaker 3>That's that to me crosses that line </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're like,</v>

1859
01:25:19.210 --> 01:25:24.210
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well now you're incorporating it into </v>

1860
01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:25.180
<v Speaker 3>the government that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>associate with like valid social issues.</v>

1861
01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:26.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this day,</v>

1862
01:25:26.681 --> 01:25:29.740
<v Speaker 3>I think it's on Mississippi's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very intense.</v>

1863
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Emancipation park in front of their </v>

1864
01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:35.230
<v Speaker 3>courthouse in front of the courthouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1865
01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:36.190
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1866
01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.540
<v Speaker 3>that's a bit of a tone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

1867
01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:41.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to get that guy out of there.</v>

1868
01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:43.870
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for sure we should keep it.</v>

1869
01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they should destroy it.</v>

1870
01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they should destroy,</v>

1871
01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:50.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a statue of mouse somewhere,</v>

1872
01:25:50.291 --> 01:25:52.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they should destroy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we should.</v>

1873
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:57.390
<v Speaker 3>We should look at it and hold onto it so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that future generations can look back </v>

1874
01:25:57.390 --> 01:25:57.390
<v Speaker 3>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1875
01:25:57.390 --> 01:26:00.640
<v Speaker 3>that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Berlin Wall it a little pieces to be</v>

1876
01:26:00.641 --> 01:26:01.410
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1877
01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.850
<v Speaker 3>that people fucking the world into at </v>
<v Speaker 3>one point.</v>

1878
01:26:04.851 --> 01:26:08.210
<v Speaker 3>And if we forget that we started doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this live action role play until someone</v>

1879
01:26:08.211 --> 01:26:09.620
<v Speaker 3>gets hit by a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1880
01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:10.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we</v>

1881
01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:11.700
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1882
01:26:11.701 --> 01:26:13.370
<v Speaker 2>So we want better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we pretend that better.</v>

1883
01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:18.380
<v Speaker 2>We're already exists or is possible if </v>
<v Speaker 2>we force people to behave the way we </v>

1884
01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:19.110
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1885
01:26:19.290 --> 01:26:24.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of different ways where </v>

1886
01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:24.290
<v Speaker 2>people try to achieve better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1887
01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:28.300
<v Speaker 2>and they're not all smart because a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them are based on how you feel right </v>

1888
01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:29.760
<v Speaker 2>now and what you want to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you try to be forceful,</v>

1889
01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:32.340
<v Speaker 2>but like the bounce back thing we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

1890
01:26:32.341 --> 01:26:34.530
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really work like that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1891
01:26:34.531 --> 01:26:37.260
<v Speaker 2>when you push too hard at people and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't respect them,</v>

1892
01:26:37.810 --> 01:26:42.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if there is ridiculous as a white </v>

1893
01:26:42.810 --> 01:26:42.930
<v Speaker 2>nationalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you push push at them.</v>

1894
01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.960
<v Speaker 2>And why do I say it's ridiculous if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're asking because it's all </v>

1895
01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.481
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think being a black nationalist is </v>

1896
01:26:50.481 --> 01:26:50.481
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all ridiculous.</v>

1897
01:26:50.481 --> 01:26:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I think you should be a human being and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it just because you enjoy black culture,</v>

1898
01:26:53.941 --> 01:26:55.140
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean you have to be racist.</v>

1899
01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:57.840
<v Speaker 2>You can enjoy Chinese people just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

1900
01:26:57.841 --> 01:27:02.841
<v Speaker 2>We can all just be cool with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this idea that there's like one </v>

1901
01:27:02.841 --> 01:27:06.051
<v Speaker 2>superior race is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are all interconnected in some very </v>

1902
01:27:06.631 --> 01:27:09.930
<v Speaker 2>bizarre way and we help each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what culture is.</v>

1903
01:27:10.110 --> 01:27:15.110
<v Speaker 2>That's what civilization is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why it all works so well is </v>

1904
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.450
<v Speaker 2>that we're all intertwined with each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

1905
01:27:15.451 --> 01:27:20.451
<v Speaker 2>learning from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out how to navigate </v>

1906
01:27:20.451 --> 01:27:20.451
<v Speaker 2>this thing together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>competing with each other,</v>

1907
01:27:20.451 --> 01:27:25.350
<v Speaker 2>improving upon a whatever the fuck it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're working on because of the </v>

1908
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:27.060
<v Speaker 2>competition from all sorts of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of the world,</v>

1909
01:27:27.061 --> 01:27:30.690
<v Speaker 2>different cultures and behavior patterns</v>
<v Speaker 2>and levels of aggression,</v>

1910
01:27:30.691 --> 01:27:35.691
<v Speaker 2>levels of intellect and all of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>combined and some sort of a swarming </v>

1911
01:27:35.691 --> 01:27:39.711
<v Speaker 2>soup of innovation and ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication and trying to figure this </v>

1912
01:27:39.711 --> 01:27:42.390
<v Speaker 2>thing out together and as soon as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just lump it all up to white people only</v>

1913
01:27:42.391 --> 01:27:45.540
<v Speaker 2>like get the fuck Outta here with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>old stupid idea.</v>

1914
01:27:45.810 --> 01:27:47.100
<v Speaker 2>That's a stupid idea.</v>

1915
01:27:47.490 --> 01:27:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why I'm so anti pc and </v>

1916
01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:53.070
<v Speaker 3>cultural appropriation stuff because </v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the mechanisms to share.</v>

1917
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:54.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the.</v>

1918
01:27:55.080 --> 01:28:00.080
<v Speaker 3>It's not because I'm white and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want people to get credit for whatever </v>

1919
01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:00.960
<v Speaker 3>they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's saying,</v>

1920
01:28:00.961 --> 01:28:03.480
<v Speaker 3>how do we know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no quote that when goods,</v>

1921
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:07.440
<v Speaker 3>when good stop going across borders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>armies go across borders where it's like</v>

1922
01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:12.980
<v Speaker 3>if see cultures coming together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sharing and developing and everything </v>

1923
01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:14.160
<v Speaker 3>you just said is necessary for </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiculturalism,</v>

1924
01:28:14.161 --> 01:28:19.161
<v Speaker 3>and so if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't wear some bro because I'm a </v>

1925
01:28:19.161 --> 01:28:19.161
<v Speaker 3>white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's no good.</v>

1926
01:28:19.161 --> 01:28:19.590
<v Speaker 3>Even though I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1927
01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:24.800
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're not being an asshole </v>

1928
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.571
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have fun and what's the big </v>

1929
01:28:26.571 --> 01:28:26.930
<v Speaker 3>deal and who needs that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brim white guys pedals.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And we have a nice dark complexion.</v>

1931

<v Speaker 3>They can handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Jews have no brim dude.</v>

1932
01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:33.540

<v Speaker 3>with some of the Super Orthodox ones,</v>

1937
01:28:43.141 --> 01:28:44.190

<v Speaker 3>That's a different kind of hat they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>

1939
01:28:45.691 --> 01:28:46.940
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1940
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:51.950
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like part of West Hollywood has a </v>

1941
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.950
<v Speaker 3>bunch of those hats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1942
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.950
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1943
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you drive,</v>

1944
01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:57.791
<v Speaker 2>there's certain neighborhoods you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to the all orthodox Jews or at </v>

1945
01:28:57.791 --> 01:29:01.211
<v Speaker 2>least a high volume of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see them with their strings that </v>

1946
01:29:01.211 --> 01:29:01.950
<v Speaker 2>hang down from their belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

1947
01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Fear used to rock those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

1948
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the whole whole garb.</v>

1949
01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.010
<v Speaker 1>But that's so intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those dudes are.</v>

1950
01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:13.040
<v Speaker 1>There's the hat she's had with that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>some ancient shit that that culture is </v>

1951
01:29:13.351 --> 01:29:17.400
<v Speaker 1>clinging to his bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When do they say no?</v>

1952
01:29:17.401 --> 01:29:19.860
<v Speaker 1>More like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what year they like,</v>

1953
01:29:19.861 --> 01:29:20.730
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're 18.</v>

1954
01:29:20.731 --> 01:29:23.610
<v Speaker 1>15 guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well as long as you can keep together.</v>

1955
01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a nice representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about.</v>

1956
01:29:26.971 --> 01:29:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Non Integration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1957
01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:33.830
<v Speaker 1>if you keep together in your own little </v>
<v Speaker 1>community and only cohabitate with your </v>

1958
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:36.240
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep this thing going as long as you</v>

1959
01:29:36.241 --> 01:29:37.680
<v Speaker 1>can and that's what they're doing right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1960
01:29:37.710 --> 01:29:39.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the irony of lack of oppression </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

1961
01:29:39.811 --> 01:29:44.811
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to these gay dudes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Houston recently and there are like </v>

1962
01:29:44.811 --> 01:29:48.740
<v Speaker 1>almost bummed that there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyone loves gay people so much </v>

1963
01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:49.170
<v Speaker 1>because they don't feel as unified.</v>

1964
01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Like we used to have a bar and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can still have the bar man.</v>

1965
01:29:53.791 --> 01:29:55.940
<v Speaker 1>He's just now have the bravo channel to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1966
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:58.200
<v Speaker 1>but guys go in the bar now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like straight guys.</v>

1967
01:29:58.201 --> 01:30:01.920
<v Speaker 1>We're going to gay bars and girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girls fucking love gay bars.</v>

1968
01:30:02.110 --> 01:30:04.860
<v Speaker 1>You go to gay bars and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight guys go there sometimes because</v>

1969
01:30:04.861 --> 01:30:09.861
<v Speaker 1>girls together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just for gas bar straight guys like </v>

1970
01:30:09.861 --> 01:30:11.400
<v Speaker 1>they fucking weasel in on gay girls are </v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk,</v>

1971
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.120
<v Speaker 1>drunk straight girls rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it.</v>

1972
01:30:13.121 --> 01:30:14.790
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even matter if you touch it.</v>

1973
01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't even feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel shit.</v>

1974
01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Even when I'm coming I don't feel it.</v>

1975
01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Or it also shows that they're so open </v>
<v Speaker 1>minded.</v>

1976
01:30:24.481 --> 01:30:26.030
<v Speaker 1>He goes to the gay bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

1977
01:30:26.031 --> 01:30:27.420
<v Speaker 1>He's so confident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1978
01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And women will go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're vulnerable sometimes,</v>

1979
01:30:30.450 --> 01:30:35.450
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I've just gotTa have a </v>

1980
01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:35.460
<v Speaker 1>relationship and I want to just talk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be hit on because I'm so vulnerable.</v>

1981
01:30:35.461 --> 01:30:38.040
<v Speaker 1>And then some dudes like it woke up my </v>
<v Speaker 1>fanny pack.</v>

1982
01:30:38.041 --> 01:30:41.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a duke in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also have any bags by the way.</v>

1983
01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:45.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like that a Mickey Rourke game that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did in a diner.</v>

1984
01:30:45.150 --> 01:30:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Remember the movie diner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put his Dick through the hole in the </v>

1985
01:30:50.150 --> 01:30:50.150
<v Speaker 1>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the bucket of popcorn.</v>

1986
01:30:50.150 --> 01:30:54.830
<v Speaker 1>See bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his friend that you'd grab his dick and </v>

1987
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:54.900
<v Speaker 1>he's like no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

1988
01:30:54.901 --> 01:30:59.901
<v Speaker 1>so he put his dick through the popcorn </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then like as soon as she reached in </v>

1989
01:30:59.901 --> 01:30:59.970
<v Speaker 1>and grabbed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1990
01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:03.420
<v Speaker 1>But what if she didn't realize it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>his dick and just pulled up,</v>

1991
01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:06.440
<v Speaker 1>was yanked it and broke it off like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1992
01:31:06.490 --> 01:31:08.820
<v Speaker 1>like when you were hanging off that </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee.</v>

1993
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:13.880
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a scene that's back when we can </v>

1994
01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:13.880
<v Speaker 1>work as a beautiful man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine that scene now?</v>

1995
01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those skills just kind of say it's rape.</v>

1996
01:31:16.150 --> 01:31:18.300
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1997
01:31:18.301 --> 01:31:19.710
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

1998
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:23.910
<v Speaker 1>you can't force someone to be intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you and trick them if you're,</v>

1999
01:31:23.911 --> 01:31:26.130
<v Speaker 1>if someone's intimate with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even play that on this show.</v>

2000
01:31:26.131 --> 01:31:27.690
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is rape culture.</v>

2001
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:29.130
<v Speaker 1>He's shut that off right now.</v>

2002
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Too Hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2003
01:31:32.311 --> 01:31:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so different that I have to train</v>

2004
01:31:34.981 --> 01:31:38.310
<v Speaker 1>myself to not be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should see how crazy chicken get.</v>

2005
01:31:38.350 --> 01:31:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there used to be dudes just </v>

2006
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.350
<v Speaker 1>whacking off in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like weird.</v>

2007
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:45.420
<v Speaker 1>They really started dudes walking off in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the street.</v>

2008
01:31:45.421 --> 01:31:50.421
<v Speaker 1>Well there was one dude in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>school woods would just chase everyone </v>

2009
01:31:50.421 --> 01:31:51.150
<v Speaker 1>wagon off and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell your parents,</v>

2010
01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:53.610
<v Speaker 1>like you tell your parents and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents were like,</v>

2011
01:31:53.611 --> 01:31:54.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can brush that one off.</v>

2012
01:31:54.871 --> 01:31:56.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're crushed that one off.</v>

2013
01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:00.220
<v Speaker 1>That was actual wiener right there.</v>

2014
01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:04.900
<v Speaker 2>And yet there's a lot of drama in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

2015
01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:09.960
<v Speaker 2>It's a slow burn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People wouldn't even have time for that </v>

2016
01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.691
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are so twitter fied everybody's </v>

2017
01:32:12.691 --> 01:32:12.691
<v Speaker 2>child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There she goes,</v>

2018
01:32:12.691 --> 01:32:13.510
<v Speaker 2>she grabbed it and she's mad and she got</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to leave.</v>

2019
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's outraged.</v>

2020
01:32:17.201 --> 01:32:20.140
<v Speaker 2>But then when you pull the wean out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the popcorn is falls in your lap.</v>

2021
01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be.</v>

2022
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it goes.</v>

2023
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:28.590
<v Speaker 2>She's going to grab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was really subtly good.</v>

2024
01:32:28.781 --> 01:32:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Acting like he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2025
01:32:31.041 --> 01:32:32.050
<v Speaker 2>It terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2026
01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:36.520
<v Speaker 2>I really liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The editing was bad,</v>

2027
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:38.530
<v Speaker 2>just obviously to texts to two </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

2028
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:41.020
<v Speaker 2>That'd get a lot of coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2029
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:43.130
<v Speaker 2>this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this happened before this app.</v>

2030
01:32:43.131 --> 01:32:43.840
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you showing that?</v>

2031
01:32:43.841 --> 01:32:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>

2032
01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:46.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like we got to get plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>coverage.</v>

2033
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:49.300
<v Speaker 2>I almost had a replay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a half a second replay.</v>

2034
01:32:50.170 --> 01:32:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2035
01:32:50.921 --> 01:32:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that anymore.</v>

2036
01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't have that in the movie now </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably for good.</v>

2037
01:32:55.150 --> 01:32:57.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know I'm wrestling with that too.</v>

2038
01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:59.260
<v Speaker 2>If it's fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2039
01:32:59.261 --> 01:33:00.910
<v Speaker 2>There are people like that that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>

2040
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:06.030
<v Speaker 2>Like we were talking about murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you allowed to have monsters and </v>

2041
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:08.851
<v Speaker 2>murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you allowed to show movies about </v>

2042
01:33:08.851 --> 01:33:08.851
<v Speaker 2>war?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2043
01:33:08.851 --> 01:33:08.851
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are,</v>

2044
01:33:08.851 --> 01:33:12.340
<v Speaker 2>how come you can have a rapist in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie but you obviously can we use it in</v>

2045
01:33:12.341 --> 01:33:17.341
<v Speaker 2>good taste?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it something people want to see </v>

2046
01:33:17.341 --> 01:33:17.341
<v Speaker 2>whole?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Won't the market dictate that?</v>

2047
01:33:17.341 --> 01:33:17.341
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2048
01:33:17.341 --> 01:33:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you should be able to </v>

2049
01:33:21.690 --> 01:33:21.940
<v Speaker 2>say that we're allowed to have murders </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a movie,</v>

2050
01:33:21.941 --> 01:33:23.560
<v Speaker 2>but we're not allowed to have rapists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2051
01:33:23.561 --> 01:33:24.990
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2052
01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:27.760
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I don't want to see people </v>
<v Speaker 2>get raped,</v>

2053
01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:32.790
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know that you should be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell someone they can't do that or </v>

2054
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.890
<v Speaker 2>they can't write it out.</v>

2055
01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Then it always ends bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the draw socialism.</v>

2056
01:33:35.771 --> 01:33:38.710
<v Speaker 2>It's narcissism where someone goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had control,</v>

2057
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:42.400
<v Speaker 2>everyone would be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then even if that guy's awesome,</v>

2058
01:33:42.401 --> 01:33:44.710
<v Speaker 2>the next guy styling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2059
01:33:44.711 --> 01:33:49.711
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing is like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kind of like we're talking about </v>

2060
01:33:49.711 --> 01:33:49.711
<v Speaker 2>the statute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a long conversation.</v>

2061
01:33:49.711 --> 01:33:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to have conversations </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this kind of shit.</v>

2062
01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Like should you want to read about rape?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2063
01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:59.910
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But should you be able to put whatever </v>

2064
01:33:59.910 --> 01:34:00.820
<v Speaker 2>the fuck you want into whatever it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's your,</v>

2065
01:34:01.090 --> 01:34:02.170
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2066
01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:03.910
<v Speaker 2>your creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2067
01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:09.120
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting there and you're writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a story that you're manipulating </v>

2068
01:34:09.821 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 2>with your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're putting it all together.</v>

2069
01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:15.490
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to have horrific </v>
<v Speaker 2>characters that everyone is terrified of</v>

2070
01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:19.210
<v Speaker 2>that people trying to get away from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that includes rapists or murderers or</v>

2071
01:34:19.211 --> 01:34:19.990
<v Speaker 2>whoever the fuck it is.</v>

2072
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:22.930
<v Speaker 2>If you're trying to tell a terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>tale and a book,</v>

2073
01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:25.330
<v Speaker 2>you can't be hindered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be stopped.</v>

2074
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Like we have to be really careful about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2075
01:34:28.210 --> 01:34:29.650
<v Speaker 2>what we're saying here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2076
01:34:29.651 --> 01:34:32.680
<v Speaker 2>we're submitting will to someone that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have our best interests.</v>

2077
01:34:32.681 --> 01:34:33.850
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't.</v>

2078
01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:37.600
<v Speaker 2>No one really cares that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they care,</v>

2079
01:34:37.601 --> 01:34:39.970
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more of a,</v>

2080
01:34:39.971 --> 01:34:44.971
<v Speaker 2>not thinking about this like it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because someone has a book about </v>

2081
01:34:44.971 --> 01:34:46.990
<v Speaker 2>rapist doesn't mean people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rape more because like if there's a book</v>

2082
01:34:46.991 --> 01:34:47.980
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2083
01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:51.130
<v Speaker 2>people that are murderers and I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go out and murder more,</v>

2084
01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:52.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

2085
01:34:52.290 --> 01:34:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that that's valid.</v>

2086
01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:57.790
<v Speaker 2>I think when you talking about fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2087
01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

2088
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.020
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to read about it,</v>

2089
01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:05.200
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want you to be able to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that they can't write about </v>

2090
01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:06.680
<v Speaker 3>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems to me like way over the line,</v>

2091
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:08.600
<v Speaker 3>like way over the line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2092
01:35:08.601 --> 01:35:10.880
<v Speaker 3>Because then you can't do critical </v>
<v Speaker 3>government stuff.</v>

2093
01:35:10.881 --> 01:35:15.881
<v Speaker 3>It's the legal precedent that set that </v>
<v Speaker 3>then makes the craziest shit possible </v>

2094
01:35:15.881 --> 01:35:16.010
<v Speaker 3>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2095
01:35:16.011 --> 01:35:18.620
<v Speaker 3>this is a words are violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These words are violence.</v>

2096
01:35:18.621 --> 01:35:20.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm raped now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one can say like,</v>

2097
01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:23.570
<v Speaker 3>our new president is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2098
01:35:23.571 --> 01:35:28.571
<v Speaker 3>like now you can't even show descent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all just a way to tighten the </v>

2099
01:35:28.571 --> 01:35:32.111
<v Speaker 3>screws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think that people in the left </v>

2100
01:35:32.111 --> 01:35:33.080
<v Speaker 3>or show showing dissent more than like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>violent descent towards the president,</v>

2101
01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.750
<v Speaker 3>like really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>angry,</v>

2102
01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:40.780
<v Speaker 3>like in a way that I can't remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody doing towards Obama now to the </v>

2103
01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:40.970
<v Speaker 3>point where it freaks me out.</v>

2104
01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Like they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

2105
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

2106
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:46.760
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't obviously traveling in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right circles.</v>

2107
01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Look for people that really angry at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama,</v>

2108
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:51.280
<v Speaker 3>but even the people that I saw online </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are angry and um,</v>

2109
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:53.210
<v Speaker 3>they were calling them and competent or </v>
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>

2110
01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:56.000
<v Speaker 3>We're spending all of our money and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this different accusations,</v>

2111
01:35:56.180 --> 01:36:01.180
<v Speaker 3>but not like what I'm seeing with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm seeing just like flat out </v>

2112
01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:03.510
<v Speaker 3>insults from famous people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2113
01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.520
<v Speaker 3>And the media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get why people totally trust </v>

2114
01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:11.441
<v Speaker 3>immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you'll see them misrepresent </v>

2115
01:36:11.441 --> 01:36:13.970
<v Speaker 3>something in such an egregious way and </v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad is a rhetoric professor,</v>

2116
01:36:13.971 --> 01:36:16.430
<v Speaker 3>so it's like he teaches a class in </v>
<v Speaker 3>propaganda.</v>

2117
01:36:16.431 --> 01:36:18.410
<v Speaker 3>This is like my whole childhood is </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning about the shit.</v>

2118
01:36:19.150 --> 01:36:20.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2119
01:36:20.601 --> 01:36:25.601
<v Speaker 3>you motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know exactly like you can </v>

2120
01:36:25.601 --> 01:36:26.030
<v Speaker 3>misrepresent things so egregiously that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2121
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:29.090
<v Speaker 3>of course no one's going to trust you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a real problem.</v>

2122
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not that you.</v>

2123
01:36:30.730 --> 01:36:33.440
<v Speaker 3>You don't wish that they were correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2124
01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:38.740
<v Speaker 3>It's that in them lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're on their side more than </v>

2125
01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:42.710
<v Speaker 3>you're on the Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 3>CNN lies even a little.</v>

2126
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:48.430
<v Speaker 3>Then it's fuel for the other side and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>vastly diminishes the impact that you </v>

2127
01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:51.260
<v Speaker 3>can have because you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not trustworthy anymore.</v>

2128
01:36:51.630 --> 01:36:56.630
<v Speaker 3>That's all you have in news now is </v>
<v Speaker 3>trustworthiness because everyone can </v>

2129
01:36:56.630 --> 01:36:56.630
<v Speaker 3>manipulate and photoshop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that,</v>

2130
01:36:56.630 --> 01:36:58.430
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Audio Photoshop,</v>

2131
01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:01.220
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have to just trust people.</v>

2132
01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.280
<v Speaker 3>I can't trust anybody though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real issue and an issue with an </v>

2133
01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:08.780
<v Speaker 3>issue with the left being so hyperbolic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when trump was first elected,</v>

2134
01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:09.320
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2135
01:37:09.321 --> 01:37:10.880
<v Speaker 3>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump's crazy,</v>

2136
01:37:11.150 --> 01:37:15.290
<v Speaker 3>and then I saw their reaction and almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>like triaged it and I was like,</v>

2137
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:16.430
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's crazier?</v>

2138
01:37:16.431 --> 01:37:19.880
<v Speaker 3>The guy that may like texted dictator is</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick,</v>

2139
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:24.500
<v Speaker 3>or like people like saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy is bad and I'm like,</v>

2140
01:37:24.501 --> 01:37:26.330
<v Speaker 3>this is a weird battle.</v>

2141
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly not the result that </v>

2142
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.510
<v Speaker 3>people wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2143
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:32.120
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so having him there,</v>

2144
01:37:32.121 --> 01:37:35.390
<v Speaker 3>they're super frustrated and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that they see happening,</v>

2145
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:38.540
<v Speaker 3>people are super frustrated and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what to do.</v>

2146
01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:39.780
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2147
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:44.910
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the feeling is that you should somehow </v>

2148
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:47.421
<v Speaker 3>under the protest and riot and like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that got in front of trump tower </v>

2149
01:37:47.421 --> 01:37:47.780
<v Speaker 3>because of his reaction to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlottesville,</v>

2150
01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:50.180
<v Speaker 3>people are super upset at his reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

2151
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:52.900
<v Speaker 3>I think that was a big one when he said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2152
01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:57.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that something about despicable acts of </v>

2153
01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:57.920
<v Speaker 3>violence on</v>

2154
01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:57.920
<v Speaker 2>all sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2155
01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.340
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was crazy that he did that.</v>

2156
01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:01.750
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2157
01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:06.980
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have people that are fighting and </v>

2158
01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:09.920
<v Speaker 2>whoever side you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're the side that wants to </v>

2159
01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:12.581
<v Speaker 2>keep statue up and you want white people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get the respect or whether you're on </v>

2160
01:38:12.581 --> 01:38:16.281
<v Speaker 2>the side of the things that you guys are</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of racists and call yourself </v>

2161
01:38:16.281 --> 01:38:16.830
<v Speaker 2>white nationals all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a bunch of Nazis.</v>

2162
01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:18.000
<v Speaker 2>W,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whichever side it is,</v>

2163
01:38:18.001 --> 01:38:23.001
<v Speaker 2>I don't know which side you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as someone Joe's driving a </v>

2164
01:38:23.001 --> 01:38:26.301
<v Speaker 2>fucking car into all those people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you find out that guy is a Nazi or that </v>

2165
01:38:27.091 --> 01:38:30.540
<v Speaker 2>guy's a Nazi sympathizer or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is a white nationalist,</v>

2166
01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:34.950
<v Speaker 2>you've got to go look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thinking is shit brained Shit brand</v>

2167
01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:37.710
<v Speaker 2>that you think you could just drive a </v>
<v Speaker 2>car into a group of people,</v>

2168
01:38:38.010 --> 01:38:38.970
<v Speaker 2>including a girl.</v>

2169
01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:41.520
<v Speaker 2>You killed a girl with a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2170
01:38:41.521 --> 01:38:44.790
<v Speaker 2>it's who crosses the line into violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actual violence,</v>

2171
01:38:44.791 --> 01:38:47.380
<v Speaker 2>random violence and terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jurors.</v>

2172
01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:48.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2173
01:38:48.061 --> 01:38:53.061
<v Speaker 2>Look in the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no interaction with them stomping on a </v>

2174
01:38:53.061 --> 01:38:56.780
<v Speaker 2>gas of a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most cowardly acts you </v>

2175
01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:58.950
<v Speaker 2>could ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a horrifically terrorist activity.</v>

2176
01:38:59.070 --> 01:39:04.070
<v Speaker 2>It's horrifically terrorist in the in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that it's like sheer terror that</v>

2177
01:39:04.231 --> 01:39:07.860
<v Speaker 2>this could ever happen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone could just gun a car into a</v>

2178
01:39:07.861 --> 01:39:12.861
<v Speaker 2>random group of people and slam into </v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever didn't get out of the way and </v>

2179
01:39:12.861 --> 01:39:16.590
<v Speaker 2>they think that think that that would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing to do against your people from</v>

2180
01:39:16.591 --> 01:39:20.490
<v Speaker 2>your own country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just over ideology and and I.</v>

2181
01:39:20.530 --> 01:39:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's unbelievable.</v>

2182
01:39:21.781 --> 01:39:26.781
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not you should take down a </v>
<v Speaker 2>statue of a guy who was the commanding </v>

2183
01:39:26.851 --> 01:39:31.851
<v Speaker 2>general in the losing army of a civil </v>
<v Speaker 2>war and you've got that in front of a </v>

2184
01:39:31.851 --> 01:39:31.851
<v Speaker 2>courthouse.</v>

2185
01:39:31.851 --> 01:39:33.000
<v Speaker 2>This is a little weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2186
01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:38.300
<v Speaker 2>We should have this discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should at least have this problem is </v>

2187
01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.150
<v Speaker 2>people aren't allowing discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get labeled racist,</v>

2188
01:39:39.151 --> 01:39:40.100
<v Speaker 2>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homophobic,</v>

2189
01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:43.380
<v Speaker 2>immediately or the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get labeled a Nazi.</v>

2190
01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:45.750
<v Speaker 2>If you even think like from a historical</v>
<v Speaker 2>point of view like,</v>

2191
01:39:45.751 --> 01:39:50.751
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should respect that this statue is a </v>

2192
01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:53.931
<v Speaker 2>part of our culture and our history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't embrace the ideals of the </v>

2193
01:39:53.931 --> 01:39:55.530
<v Speaker 2>confederate army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not trying to bring back slavery.</v>

2194
01:39:55.560 --> 01:40:00.560
<v Speaker 2>We're not racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just think that there's a unique and </v>

2195
01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:02.910
<v Speaker 2>interesting history of the south is as </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunate as it is.</v>

2196
01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:05.130
<v Speaker 2>It's all connected to slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2197
01:40:05.131 --> 01:40:10.131
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not entirely with this guy </v>

2198
01:40:10.131 --> 01:40:12.501
<v Speaker 2>represents to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if that's the argument you're </v>

2199
01:40:12.501 --> 01:40:12.501
<v Speaker 2>making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2200
01:40:12.501 --> 01:40:14.310
<v Speaker 2>well then we should probably have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a confederate army museum.</v>

2201
01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:19.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people can go and just observe </v>

2202
01:40:19.670 --> 01:40:22.010
<v Speaker 2>like the strangeness of it all because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is strange whether or not you are on </v>

2203
01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:22.010
<v Speaker 2>the north and south.</v>

2204
01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:26.300
<v Speaker 2>It's strange that in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>65 people were shooting each other and </v>

2205
01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:31.041
<v Speaker 2>the only difference was like they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>cross align the Mason Dixon brothers </v>

2206
01:40:31.041 --> 01:40:33.810
<v Speaker 2>shooting your other crazy and that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

2207
01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a couple of hundred years ago.</v>

2208
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we lost 800,000</v>

2209
01:40:37.171 --> 01:40:40.890
<v Speaker 2>people and only three percent of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>on slaves in the south.</v>

2210
01:40:40.891 --> 01:40:44.250
<v Speaker 2>So think about how many casualties were </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck.</v>

2211
01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:48.090
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is in the immigrants in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the north just right off the boat.</v>

2212
01:40:48.091 --> 01:40:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ireland,</v>

2213
01:40:48.841 --> 01:40:52.950
<v Speaker 2>just grab a gun and go die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

2214
01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Just stop and think about how insane </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is and there should be some way </v>

2215
01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:02.500
<v Speaker 2>that we addressed this in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these areas.</v>

2216
01:41:02.501 --> 01:41:07.501
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a statue of Robert e </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot Lee in front of some important </v>

2217
01:41:07.501 --> 01:41:11.760
<v Speaker 2>federal building or state building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you should take all that stuff </v>

2218
01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:14.530
<v Speaker 2>and bring it someplace where you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a museum or a,</v>

2219
01:41:14.531 --> 01:41:15.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an area where you have,</v>

2220
01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:20.490
<v Speaker 2>where people can go and you have experts</v>
<v Speaker 2>that give tours this unexplained.</v>

2221
01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Put it all in context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explain who this guy was.</v>

2222
01:41:23.711 --> 01:41:25.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have like a tour that people do.</v>

2223
01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:29.140
<v Speaker 2>That's an allison idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massively educational and it doesn't,</v>

2224
01:41:29.141 --> 01:41:30.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2225
01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:33.250
<v Speaker 2>nobody today was a part of the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>confederate army.</v>

2226
01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

2227
01:41:34.601 --> 01:41:37.600
<v Speaker 2>if you're a 30 year old guy today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are not a part of that.</v>

2228
01:41:37.690 --> 01:41:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a human being that lives in </v>

2229
01:41:42.690 --> 01:41:44.881
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not responsible for the sins of </v>

2230
01:41:44.881 --> 01:41:47.431
<v Speaker 2>your ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor are you obligated to continue the </v>

2231
01:41:47.431 --> 01:41:50.191
<v Speaker 2>same ridiculous ideas that maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were raised with or other people were </v>

2232
01:41:50.191 --> 01:41:50.191
<v Speaker 2>raised with two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2233
01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:55.260
<v Speaker 2>it's not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're supposed to be all in this </v>

2234
01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:57.451
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we all got attacked by whether it's </v>

2235
01:41:57.451 --> 01:41:59.020
<v Speaker 2>some invading army or fucking aliens </v>
<v Speaker 2>from outer space,</v>

2236
01:41:59.021 --> 01:42:04.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was like a famous Ronald </v>
<v Speaker 2>Reagan quote about how quickly we would </v>

2237
01:42:04.690 --> 01:42:09.690
<v Speaker 2>forget about our differences between us </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Russia if we were attacked by an </v>

2238
01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:09.940
<v Speaker 2>alien force from outside of this planet.</v>

2239
01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:11.080
<v Speaker 2>So true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So true.</v>

2240
01:42:11.081 --> 01:42:14.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's not even just the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reminiscing is new.</v>

2241
01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:19.261
<v Speaker 2>Like I do a song a summer of 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>69 just to put in perspective how good </v>

2242
01:42:20.261 --> 01:42:23.710
<v Speaker 2>we have it now and we should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrating every day.</v>

2243
01:42:23.711 --> 01:42:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Like Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go into any drugstore.</v>

2244
01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:27.670
<v Speaker 2>This could've killed kings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a dollar.</v>

2245
01:42:28.150 --> 01:42:31.600
<v Speaker 2>But like we just myself included,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

2246
01:42:31.601 --> 01:42:34.210
<v Speaker 2>I just think relatively to what I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen in my life.</v>

2247
01:42:34.690 --> 01:42:37.630
<v Speaker 2>But like if you think about the summer </v>
<v Speaker 2>of 18,</v>

2248
01:42:37.631 --> 01:42:42.631
<v Speaker 2>69,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people are dying of like Spanish </v>

2249
01:42:42.631 --> 01:42:44.410
<v Speaker 2>flu and shit like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 100 mile ride to get butter.</v>

2250
01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean and that's like modern times,</v>

2251
01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:50.080
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about back when.</v>

2252
01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:55.140
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why we're here is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people had to breed from the </v>

2253
01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:57.670
<v Speaker 2>time we weren't people that had to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the time we were,</v>

2254
01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:02.700
<v Speaker 2>some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's if you believe in all that </v>

2255
01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:03.070
<v Speaker 2>liberal bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but evolution,</v>

2256
01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:06.550
<v Speaker 2>which is mostly just a plot concocted by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jew.</v>

2257
01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you,</v>

2258
01:43:08.170 --> 01:43:13.170
<v Speaker 2>if you do pay attention to evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we came from some sort of a lower </v>

2259
01:43:13.170 --> 01:43:16.801
<v Speaker 2>hominid and we evolved over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kept improving natural selection and </v>

2260
01:43:16.981 --> 01:43:20.350
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of different factors and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mutations.</v>

2261
01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:23.380
<v Speaker 2>We improved and became what we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2262
01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means we had,</v>

2263
01:43:24.611 --> 01:43:24.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>

2264
01:43:24.971 --> 01:43:25.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2265
01:43:25.530 --> 01:43:28.510
<v Speaker 2>we bred back when we were almost like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish people,</v>

2266
01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:30.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kept going through this whole thing,</v>

2267
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:36.310
<v Speaker 2>what we are today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why anybody ever got </v>

2268
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:40.351
<v Speaker 2>better than those people that had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk 10 miles for butter because they </v>

2269
01:43:40.351 --> 01:43:40.420
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck walking 10 miles for butter.</v>

2270
01:43:40.570 --> 01:43:43.210
<v Speaker 2>We've got to figure this out better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so no one's ever happy.</v>

2271
01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:45.550
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever happy with the current </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of affairs because like,</v>

2272
01:43:45.551 --> 01:43:47.800
<v Speaker 2>why am I still walking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's my fucking flying car?</v>

2273
01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Where's my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tele porter?</v>

2274
01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>What I can't go to Mars right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go to Mars right</v>

2275
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.700
<v Speaker 1>now and that's the gene that passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

2276
01:43:53.710 --> 01:43:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to explain to some buddies </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the UK because I do stamp their lot.</v>

2277
01:43:57.101 --> 01:44:02.101
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans are a little fucking crazy </v>

2278
01:44:02.101 --> 01:44:02.101
<v Speaker 1>because we were the dudes who agreed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come here,</v>

2279
01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:07.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're going to do it genetic </v>

2280
01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:07.300
<v Speaker 1>just cut and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2281
01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:08.660
<v Speaker 1>you're probably going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's golden pussy.</v>

2282
01:44:08.710 --> 01:44:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Well it's like one out of 200 people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2283
01:44:11.061 --> 01:44:13.190
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they settled in America.</v>

2284
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Those guys need a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're insane.</v>

2285
01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:20.320
<v Speaker 1>And then that that's settled America and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's why some of us are just so </v>

2286
01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:21.020
<v Speaker 1>wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people weren't even drinking water.</v>

2287
01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:26.700
<v Speaker 1>They're just hammered all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make big decisions about </v>

2288
01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:28.550
<v Speaker 1>slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just sounds terrible,</v>

2289
01:44:28.551 --> 01:44:29.390
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hard.</v>

2290
01:44:29.650 --> 01:44:31.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's the other thing when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like racism.</v>

2291
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Racism is horrible.</v>

2292
01:44:33.170 --> 01:44:34.460
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2293
01:44:35.210 --> 01:44:40.210
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's better than it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a post by killer Mike or thinks </v>

2294
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:42.200
<v Speaker 1>very cool dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to have him on eventually.</v>

2295
01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I liked that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like he's fun and he,</v>

2296
01:44:44.491 --> 01:44:49.491
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a post on his instagram about </v>

2297
01:44:49.491 --> 01:44:51.941
<v Speaker 1>saying America is exactly the same and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was essentially saying you should be </v>

2298
01:44:51.941 --> 01:44:54.881
<v Speaker 1>armed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was saying anybody tells you you </v>

2299
01:44:54.881 --> 01:44:57.520
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be armed and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be trained in how to use a firearm </v>

2300
01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:59.600
<v Speaker 1>is a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of an agent of the state.</v>

2301
01:44:59.601 --> 01:45:00.200
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2302
01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:01.550
<v Speaker 1>killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike's going deep,</v>

2303
01:45:02.150 --> 01:45:03.800
<v Speaker 1>but I'm onboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2304
01:45:03.890 --> 01:45:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it is different.</v>

2305
01:45:06.730 --> 01:45:09.860
<v Speaker 1>I do think it is different from 1963.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

2306
01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:12.620
<v Speaker 1>I really think it's a lot better than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in the sixties.</v>

2307
01:45:12.621 --> 01:45:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it still sucks in some spots </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2308
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:17.690
<v Speaker 1>And I think emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like events like this,</v>

2309
01:45:17.691 --> 01:45:22.691
<v Speaker 1>as horrific as they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're good for a lot of people that </v>

2310
01:45:22.691 --> 01:45:23.750
<v Speaker 1>live in places outside of their.</v>

2311
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know,</v>

2312
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:30.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get caught in the pattern of </v>

2313
01:45:30.010 --> 01:45:31.520
<v Speaker 1>whatever your environment is and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in an environment of stagnant,</v>

2314
01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:36.580
<v Speaker 1>ancient racism that goes back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>slave days and goes back to pre civil </v>

2315
01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:41.441
<v Speaker 1>war and then it's like the same area at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new ideas are slowly making their </v>

2316
01:45:41.441 --> 01:45:46.331
<v Speaker 1>way in because it's not like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>influx of new people moving into these </v>

2317
01:45:46.331 --> 01:45:46.530
<v Speaker 1>places either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2318
01:45:46.531 --> 01:45:51.531
<v Speaker 1>As people having kids and the kids may </v>
<v Speaker 1>be learning a little bit at school and </v>

2319
01:45:51.531 --> 01:45:54.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a slow process of getting out the </v>

2320
01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:57.731
<v Speaker 1>shitty ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a bit about the Middle </v>

2321
01:45:57.731 --> 01:45:57.731
<v Speaker 1>East or the townies of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so true.</v>

2322
01:45:57.731 --> 01:45:59.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like just the people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>weave and then.</v>

2323
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Well it's Iraq and specific because Iraq</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Sumir,</v>

2324
01:46:02.691 --> 01:46:07.691
<v Speaker 1>which is where the oldest known </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization is what's so fucked over </v>

2325
01:46:07.691 --> 01:46:08.740
<v Speaker 1>there that they really are like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>townies of the world and,</v>

2326
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:09.920
<v Speaker 1>and like tribalism.</v>

2327
01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Like you go to UK and it's Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Protestant and they don't give a shit </v>

2328
01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:14.920
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2329
01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:16.700
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the same history as us </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

2330
01:46:16.730 --> 01:46:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I heard a great Irish joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

2331
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:21.260
<v Speaker 1>are you Catholic or Protestant guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm atheist,</v>

2332
01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:23.840
<v Speaker 1>and the other guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one don't you believe in?</v>

2333
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Where it's like are you answered them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like you can just split it up based </v>

2334
01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:32.180
<v Speaker 1>on counties in England and here it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin and yeah dude,</v>

2335
01:46:32.181 --> 01:46:34.910
<v Speaker 1>when I was in Ireland in Northern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland as well,</v>

2336
01:46:34.911 --> 01:46:39.911
<v Speaker 1>I went to Belfast once and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people that were there that </v>

2337
01:46:39.911 --> 01:46:40.840
<v Speaker 1>were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2338
01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:42.770
<v Speaker 1>the guy guys were in their late forties </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fifties.</v>

2339
01:46:43.650 --> 01:46:48.650
<v Speaker 1>They were telling me about back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day with the bombings with the IRA and </v>

2340
01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:53.370
<v Speaker 1>they were explaining to me some horrific</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that were done to people there.</v>

2341
01:46:53.370 --> 01:46:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are Irish people going after other</v>

2342
01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Irish people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2343
01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:02.720
<v Speaker 1>And the cop cars there are fully armored</v>
<v Speaker 1>like war vehicles.</v>

2344
01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Like I've never seen anything like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the places that have been.</v>

2345
01:47:06.091 --> 01:47:11.091
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything like it where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cop cars are covered with steel </v>

2346
01:47:11.091 --> 01:47:15.291
<v Speaker 1>plates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Steel Mesh on the front steel </v>

2347
01:47:15.291 --> 01:47:15.291
<v Speaker 1>plates and battering rams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2348
01:47:15.291 --> 01:47:16.050
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

2349
01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:18.150
<v Speaker 1>That God's bomb proof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2350
01:47:18.151 --> 01:47:19.830
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can get a lot worse,</v>

2351
01:47:19.831 --> 01:47:20.670
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

2352
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.690
<v Speaker 1>This is Northern Ireland and I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about shit.</v>

2353
01:47:24.691 --> 01:47:27.270
<v Speaker 1>I want to say like 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2354
01:47:27.330 --> 01:47:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I was there and I was like,</v>

2355
01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're Dan Carlin was talking about </v>

2356
01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:36.540
<v Speaker 1>1968.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like 40,000</v>

2357
01:47:36.541 --> 01:47:39.090
<v Speaker 1>bombings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like something that I had to look up.</v>

2358
01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:44.180
<v Speaker 1>I probably got that wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like the weatherman man and </v>

2359
01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:45.990
<v Speaker 1>all these like homegrown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like chicken get jad.</v>

2360
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:47.790
<v Speaker 1>There used to be a machine guns on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>White House.</v>

2361
01:47:47.791 --> 01:47:52.791
<v Speaker 1>Tooth Shit can get bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only been really good for like a </v>

2362
01:47:52.791 --> 01:47:56.190
<v Speaker 1>short amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I value it so much.</v>

2363
01:47:56.570 --> 01:48:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard for us to have a </v>

2364
01:48:01.570 --> 01:48:01.570
<v Speaker 1>perspective of how bad it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2365
01:48:01.570 --> 01:48:04.980
<v Speaker 1>if you ever seen that section of France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's France,</v>

2366
01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:08.250
<v Speaker 1>that's how you know Moroccan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in France if I said fronts,</v>

2367
01:48:08.251 --> 01:48:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I'd be an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

2368
01:48:09.681 --> 01:48:12.610
<v Speaker 1>So a tricky little fucking road to </v>
<v Speaker 1>navigate,</v>

2369
01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:16.250
<v Speaker 1>but Lido is the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that area where it's a.</v>

2370
01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:21.560
<v Speaker 1>it's like essentially no man's land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't go into it because there's so </v>

2371
01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:26.541
<v Speaker 1>much unexploded ordinance that literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much toxic shit from these </v>

2372
01:48:26.671 --> 01:48:31.671
<v Speaker 1>bombs that is an area the size of Paris </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't go to.</v>

2373
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:35.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a monumental like fucking fenced </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

2374
01:48:35.131 --> 01:48:40.131
<v Speaker 1>You can't go in there and they keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling shit out of there and they're </v>

2375
01:48:40.131 --> 01:48:40.131
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people collect them,</v>

2376
01:48:40.131 --> 01:48:42.060
<v Speaker 1>you know they have like a rescue them.</v>

2377
01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean Chai and fucking bullets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>missiles and shit.</v>

2378
01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:48.450
<v Speaker 1>That was recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same with the eastern front and Russia,</v>

2379
01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:51.180
<v Speaker 1>like the ghost of the Asta Front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hardcore history series,</v>

2380
01:48:51.570 --> 01:48:54.720
<v Speaker 1>like just the bone fields where you like</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2381
01:48:54.721 --> 01:48:57.330
<v Speaker 1>It's right out of a pink floyd video </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're like,</v>

2382
01:48:57.870 --> 01:49:00.630
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have a problem with pronouns,</v>

2383
01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:05.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's like I'll fucking fight to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>death for this.</v>

2384
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:14.030
<v Speaker 1>If you were a really smooth transition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transgender persons,</v>

2385
01:49:15.150 --> 01:49:17.160
<v Speaker 1>absolutely no issue because no one can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

2386
01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Feel like Thai people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You slide right in.</v>

2387
01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gives a shit slip in comes an </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue when it's not obvious.</v>

2388
01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the valley,</v>

2389
01:49:30.150 --> 01:49:32.400
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] valley with robot faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2390
01:49:32.401 --> 01:49:34.800
<v Speaker 1>What is that called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uncanny valley.</v>

2391
01:49:34.801 --> 01:49:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Where if it's like close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a little off.</v>

2392
01:49:36.650 --> 01:49:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little like something's wrong here.</v>

2393
01:49:39.110 --> 01:49:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2394
01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:40.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ashes.</v>

2395
01:49:41.610 --> 01:49:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Ashes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simulation.</v>

2396
01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Like when my piano teacher got a sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

2397
01:49:45.871 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 1>like no one really cared as long as he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>still</v>

2398
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:49.600
<v Speaker 2>matched that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the demo,</v>

2399
01:49:49.601 --> 01:49:51.400
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the bills and shit like that,</v>

2400
01:49:51.970 --> 01:49:52.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a shit.</v>

2401
01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:55.590
<v Speaker 2>No one cares.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So highly publicized case.</v>

2402
01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Well the thing is why should you care?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do whatever you want to do,</v>

2403
01:49:58.721 --> 01:50:01.480
<v Speaker 2>but also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2404
01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:04.510
<v Speaker 2>like don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't swing too hard the other direction</v>

2405
01:50:04.511 --> 01:50:05.590
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2406
01:50:05.650 --> 01:50:07.330
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be in the middle.</v>

2407
01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:10.010
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be a,</v>

2408
01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:13.900
<v Speaker 2>you don't get special treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last.</v>

2409
01:50:14.190 --> 01:50:15.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it sounded like that.</v>

2410
01:50:15.521 --> 01:50:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't pull up.</v>

2411
01:50:17.230 --> 01:50:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Pretend you're amazing and beautiful and</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible and a hero and you know,</v>

2412
01:50:21.521 --> 01:50:23.770
<v Speaker 2>such a hero and so brave like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2413
01:50:24.010 --> 01:50:29.010
<v Speaker 2>we should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should respect your choice and we </v>

2414
01:50:29.010 --> 01:50:32.221
<v Speaker 2>should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should live in a world where you </v>

2415
01:50:32.221 --> 01:50:32.221
<v Speaker 2>don't have to worry about people getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset.</v>

2416
01:50:32.221 --> 01:50:33.760
<v Speaker 2>That's the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is not that.</v>

2417
01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:38.760
<v Speaker 2>It's this amazing thing to do the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem as it should be able to be a 100</v>

2418
01:50:39.191 --> 01:50:44.191
<v Speaker 2>percent free choice that no one cares </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and no one should fuck with you </v>

2419
01:50:44.191 --> 01:50:46.060
<v Speaker 2>because you do it like no one should </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate you because of your choice.</v>

2420
01:50:46.061 --> 01:50:51.061
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is that people hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>them because their choice and then </v>

2421
01:50:51.061 --> 01:50:51.061
<v Speaker 2>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to say,</v>

2422
01:50:51.061 --> 01:50:53.560
<v Speaker 2>I am not like those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're the most special unicorns</v>

2423
01:50:53.561 --> 01:50:56.830
<v Speaker 2>ever existed in the world and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing and you're my hero.</v>

2424
01:50:57.220 --> 01:51:00.000
<v Speaker 2>My hero is near that house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2425
01:51:00.100 --> 01:51:05.100
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's just 10 people are operating </v>

2426
01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:07.471
<v Speaker 2>from fear to where it's like they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to say like a six year old can </v>

2427
01:51:07.471 --> 01:51:11.131
<v Speaker 2>choose their gender and then and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>have hormones that don't go through </v>

2428
01:51:11.131 --> 01:51:13.921
<v Speaker 2>puberty and that's when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when I think back to all </v>

2429
01:51:13.921 --> 01:51:17.731
<v Speaker 2>those idiots that I would always </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with where it's like stay away </v>

2430
01:51:17.731 --> 01:51:17.731
<v Speaker 2>from my kids.</v>

2431
01:51:17.731 --> 01:51:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Gay Guy Might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good guys,</v>

2432
01:51:18.131 --> 01:51:20.000
<v Speaker 2>don't give a fuck about your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when,</v>

2433
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:21.370
<v Speaker 2>when you think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2434
01:51:21.371 --> 01:51:25.090
<v Speaker 2>the state could enforce my six year old </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sex change.</v>

2435
01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:27.700
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't do that.</v>

2436
01:51:27.930 --> 01:51:29.320
<v Speaker 2>It has to be the parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2437
01:51:29.530 --> 01:51:31.390
<v Speaker 2>The parents have to bring the kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>

2438
01:51:31.391 --> 01:51:33.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's the question is when is it old </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough?</v>

2439
01:51:33.730 --> 01:51:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Like is it okay when you're 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2440
01:51:35.981 --> 01:51:40.981
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I the fucking frontal cortex doesn't </v>

2441
01:51:40.981 --> 01:51:41.080
<v Speaker 2>even get fully formed until you're 25.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2442
01:51:41.110 --> 01:51:42.790
<v Speaker 2>So like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Making big choices?</v>

2443
01:51:42.791 --> 01:51:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Like if I had to go back and think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some super important choices that I</v>

2444
01:51:47.141 --> 01:51:49.600
<v Speaker 2>could have made when I was 18 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not I've been rational,</v>

2445
01:51:50.230 --> 01:51:53.440
<v Speaker 2>I was essentially a monkey with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

2446
01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Like I thought like a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I act like a monkey.</v>

2447
01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:59.050
<v Speaker 2>There's no way I should have been ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>respond.</v>

2448
01:51:59.051 --> 01:52:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Especially something that could affect </v>
<v Speaker 2>you for the rest of your life.</v>

2449
01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea of when you're 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get a tattoo like Jesus Christ.</v>

2450
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:09.670
<v Speaker 2>This is like sterilizing and also like </v>
<v Speaker 2>an industry can pop up.</v>

2451
01:52:09.671 --> 01:52:12.720
<v Speaker 2>Like my parents felt that way about </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumcision I imagine like,</v>

2452
01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:13.870
<v Speaker 2>like they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2453
01:52:13.871 --> 01:52:17.050
<v Speaker 2>you guys can be circumcised and you turn</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 so you can decide on your own.</v>

2454
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:18.360
<v Speaker 2>That's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2455
01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:19.810
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't even be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2456
01:52:19.811 --> 01:52:24.811
<v Speaker 2>like you should be able to do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to do when you can decide that </v>

2457
01:52:24.811 --> 01:52:26.290
<v Speaker 2>cutting off your wayne part of your rain</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you lose a lot of Dick's this way.</v>

2458
01:52:26.291 --> 01:52:27.150
<v Speaker 2>Folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2459
01:52:27.190 --> 01:52:29.050
<v Speaker 2>People don't wanna admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of infections.</v>

2460
01:52:29.051 --> 01:52:32.410
<v Speaker 2>People lose their dicks every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Babies lose their dicks because of this.</v>

2461
01:52:32.411 --> 01:52:37.411
<v Speaker 2>This is a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a lot in terms of the actual </v>

2462
01:52:37.411 --> 01:52:37.411
<v Speaker 2>numbers of people that are getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumcised,</v>

2463
01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:40.720
<v Speaker 2>but it's a handful like you want to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>that chance.</v>

2464
01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Risk reward on that fuck all the time </v>

2465
01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:45.760
<v Speaker 2>about propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saying that like,</v>

2466
01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 2>you know you're always going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>infections</v>

2467
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:51.100
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just trying to get an extra </v>

2468
01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:52.391
<v Speaker 1>500 bucks a clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many babies do you think lose their </v>

2469
01:52:52.391 --> 01:52:54.340
<v Speaker 1>penis every year from infection due to </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances?</v>

2470
01:52:54.410 --> 01:52:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I say five in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say five.</v>

2471
01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.510
<v Speaker 1>What'd he say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lose their Dick.</v>

2472
01:52:59.511 --> 01:53:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Because Dick had infected from clipping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2473
01:53:01.810 --> 01:53:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say 11.</v>

2474
01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:05.390
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>

2475
01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Full digital.</v>

2476
01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Jim's going to pull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2477
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:10.670
<v Speaker 1>any parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even partial loss.</v>

2478
01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Cut off the tip of your Dick that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that's just as fucked.</v>

2479
01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Going to reconstruct the tip of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

2480
01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like my winter is like,</v>

2481
01:53:17.901 --> 01:53:22.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got like a arm to take your nose and </v>

2482
01:53:22.901 --> 01:53:24.710
<v Speaker 1>they put it on the tip of your Dick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you a when you.</v>

2483
01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I my notes,</v>

2484
01:53:28.970 --> 01:53:31.790
<v Speaker 1>my Dick is sniffling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kid can't even make a fucking choice</v>

2485
01:53:31.791 --> 01:53:36.791
<v Speaker 1>for himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's happened before and one kid </v>

2486
01:53:36.791 --> 01:53:36.830
<v Speaker 1>lost his penis in a circumcision </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident and so they tried to transition</v>

2487
01:53:36.831 --> 01:53:41.831
<v Speaker 1>him to be in a woman and then he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicidal and they turned it back into a </v>

2488
01:53:41.831 --> 01:53:42.560
<v Speaker 1>man that he wound up killing himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that's not all societal.</v>

2489
01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:44.180
<v Speaker 1>It was a famous case is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2490
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I forget the name of the boy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2491

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2492
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:51.710

<v Speaker 1>which book was that?</v>

2493
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a kid named Gary or one and </v>

<v Speaker 1>200.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2498
01:54:10.570 --> 01:54:12.250
<v Speaker 1>But how many of them lose their dicks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2499
01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Didn't do studies on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a study once that said that more </v>

2500
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:20.330
<v Speaker 1>teenagers than ever are engaging in anal</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

2591
01:58:02.150 --> 01:58:02.150
<v Speaker 1>firelight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a paper boy,</v>

2592
01:58:02.150 --> 01:58:02.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

01:58:02.150 --> 01:58:02.880
<v Speaker 1>I was getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saving money,</v>

2594
01:58:02.881 --> 01:58:06.120
<v Speaker 1>buying stocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snowing today.</v>

<v Speaker 1>These kids just swipe right and fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>that said there is no stage show up </v>

2596
01:58:11.180 --> 01:58:14.241
<v Speaker 1>places man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this cure for almost every disease </v>

2597
01:58:14.241 --> 01:58:14.241
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also an issue,</v>

2598
01:58:14.241 --> 01:58:18.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even have to worry about warts </v>

01:58:18.250 --> 01:58:18.250
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get shot up.</v>

2602
01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:27.640
<v Speaker 1>the vaccine really,</v>

2603
01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:27.920

<v Speaker 1>It's like 100 to 100.</v>

2604
01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Probably a similar number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's perfect man.</v>

01:58:55.511 --> 01:58:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Not Big Batman Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't back down.</v>

2617
01:58:57.880 --> 01:59:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Ben Affleck became Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never watched that one.</v>

2618
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I've always hated that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't hate the guy.</v>

2619
01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strong word,</v>

2620
01:59:04.751 --> 01:59:07.900
<v Speaker 1>but I've always instinctively not liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2621
01:59:07.901 --> 01:59:12.901
<v Speaker 1>He seems like the type of guy that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out and then like pretend you </v>

2622
01:59:12.901 --> 01:59:13.450
<v Speaker 1>worked out harder than he did and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

2623
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that guy and that guy,</v>

2624
01:59:15.171 --> 01:59:18.700
<v Speaker 1>like we worked out fucking hard today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like did you really?</v>

2625
01:59:19.330 --> 01:59:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Is that guy did 10 shrugs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a farmer's walk or twenties.</v>

2626
01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:24.280
<v Speaker 1>No disrespect to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great actor.</v>

2627
01:59:24.281 --> 01:59:25.870
<v Speaker 1>He's been awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of movies.</v>

2628
01:59:25.930 --> 01:59:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I liked the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as Batman and like you just had </v>

2629
01:59:30.930 --> 01:59:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Christian Bale who looked like a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>batman comes jacked.</v>

2630
01:59:32.590 --> 01:59:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believed him.</v>

2631
01:59:34.930 --> 01:59:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was out there fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime,</v>

2632
01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:38.920
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think good will hunting was so good.</v>

2633
01:59:38.921 --> 01:59:41.410
<v Speaker 1>It made me not like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2634
01:59:41.411 --> 01:59:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I can't explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was something about me I don't like.</v>

2635
01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:49.140
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be something about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He established that he was really good </v>

2636
01:59:49.140 --> 01:59:49.300
<v Speaker 1>in that recent movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

2637
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Recently the girl?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>not that one.</v>

2639
01:59:52.210 --> 01:59:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Where the girl was a murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fucks are called gone girl gone</v>

2640
01:59:58.290 --> 01:59:59.040
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>

2641
01:59:59.050 --> 02:00:01.000
<v Speaker 1>He was good and that it's a great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>

2642
02:00:01.110 --> 02:00:01.400
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>

2643
02:00:03.390 --> 02:00:06.160
<v Speaker 4>What'd you find out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did a nap in Batman.</v>

2644
02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:11.220
<v Speaker 4>I brought this up to you as it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>joke or as he's showing his abs in the </v>

2645
02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:12.100
<v Speaker 4>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's directing your CGI abs.</v>

2646
02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:15.200
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that didn't work out.</v>

2647
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.500
<v Speaker 4>How can you tell?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that?</v>

2648
02:00:17.501 --> 02:00:19.390
<v Speaker 4>You can see the lines here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't see them here.</v>

2649
02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:21.940
<v Speaker 4>These are side by side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See anything in the right hand side.</v>

2650
02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:23.980
<v Speaker 4>Not Try it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get it in motion here.</v>

2651
02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:25.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2652
02:00:25.271 --> 02:00:29.330
<v Speaker 4>side by side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got it.</v>

2653
02:00:29.370 --> 02:00:31.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see over a six bag here.</v>

2654
02:00:31.351 --> 02:00:33.080
<v Speaker 4>This show them again at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2655
02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:36.870
<v Speaker 4>here's Ben Affleck without CGI abs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>

2656
02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:40.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2657
02:00:40.511 --> 02:00:41.420
<v Speaker 4>you just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a quick.</v>

2658
02:00:41.421 --> 02:00:44.800
<v Speaker 4>It's a really quick cut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>

2659
02:00:44.910 --> 02:00:45.940
<v Speaker 4>it's a defined six pack.</v>

2660
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:50.590
<v Speaker 1>This seems like Hayton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what the problem with this is.</v>

2661
02:00:51.310 --> 02:00:55.300
<v Speaker 1>In one view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to have abs because the</v>

2662
02:00:55.301 --> 02:00:58.030
<v Speaker 1>guy's core wasn't engaged in the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>

2663
02:00:58.031 --> 02:01:00.100
<v Speaker 1>The guy's doing a chin up and its core </v>
<v Speaker 1>is engaged.</v>

2664
02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:03.520
<v Speaker 1>You fucking nerds don't even know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>apps are,</v>

2665
02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:07.730
<v Speaker 1>so shut out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're willing to earn those abs,</v>

2666
02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>engage the core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more sugar.</v>

2667
02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I he looked thin enough and fit enough </v>

2668
02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>that I could imagine him having that six</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack.</v>

2669
02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's CGI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but good for him.</v>

2670
02:01:16.031 --> 02:01:18.810
<v Speaker 1>If it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people love to be hating it.</v>

2671
02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Heda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2672
02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>it's ever since 300 men ever been since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like Joe that Gerard guys,</v>

2673
02:01:24.551 --> 02:01:25.660
<v Speaker 1>fucking Jack.</v>

2674
02:01:28.090 --> 02:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>He was the most Jack Guy that ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived.</v>

2675
02:01:29.591 --> 02:01:31.450
<v Speaker 1>He's like a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like Frank Zane,</v>

2676
02:01:31.630 --> 02:01:34.430
<v Speaker 1>when he was competing in the Arnold </v>
<v Speaker 1>Classic Right Walker,</v>

2677
02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:37.780
<v Speaker 1>like fight club member fight club like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was really ripped.</v>

2678
02:01:38.130 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Well that was Brad Pitt was super ripped</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>

2679
02:01:40.011 --> 02:01:41.990
<v Speaker 1>but that was 100 percent real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he wasn't.</v>

2680
02:01:41.991 --> 02:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>There was no cgi and back then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't that shit.</v>

2681
02:01:45.050 --> 02:01:46.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they could do that back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

2682
02:01:46.311 --> 02:01:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Could they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long ago was fight club?</v>

2683
02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:51.760
<v Speaker 1>90 nine ish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2684
02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't really do see John bodies </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

2685
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Butler was CGI apps?</v>

2686
02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting brush to a little bit like.</v>

2687
02:02:00.501 --> 02:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just painted them.</v>

2688
02:02:02.210 --> 02:02:04.280
<v Speaker 1>They basically painted the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their whole body.</v>

2689
02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I'd go with that though if given the </v>
<v Speaker 1>option,</v>

2690
02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:08.180
<v Speaker 1>if someone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a pink guy.</v>

2691
02:02:08.210 --> 02:02:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2692
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:13.990
<v Speaker 1>the movie though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean kind of demanded it because the </v>

2693
02:02:13.990 --> 02:02:17.801
<v Speaker 1>movie was just fantastic visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>masterpiece where I don't think you </v>

2694
02:02:17.801 --> 02:02:20.120
<v Speaker 1>would have been thrown off of people at </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular bodies,</v>

2695
02:02:20.150 --> 02:02:25.150
<v Speaker 1>like I 100 percent support it in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie because like xerxes was like 10 </v>

2696
02:02:25.150 --> 02:02:30.131
<v Speaker 1>feet tall member like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Persian king and then all the other </v>

2697
02:02:30.131 --> 02:02:32.720
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyone was totally jacked.</v>

2698
02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:36.680
<v Speaker 1>It was perfect because it was like very </v>
<v Speaker 1>much like one of those um,</v>

2699
02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:42.230
<v Speaker 1>illustrated books like a comic strip or </v>
<v Speaker 1>high end graphic novel come to life.</v>

2700
02:02:42.231 --> 02:02:43.580
<v Speaker 1>It was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was great.</v>

2701
02:02:43.581 --> 02:02:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if everyone looked normal,</v>

2702
02:02:44.871 --> 02:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>it would just be like sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 guys dying.</v>

2703
02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Even if they were in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they looked like real people that are</v>

2704
02:02:50.691 --> 02:02:51.440
<v Speaker 1>in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2705
02:02:51.441 --> 02:02:54.710
<v Speaker 1>some people have different body types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people you don't see them.</v>

2706
02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Even if they're like fader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see him with abs even though </v>

2707
02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:00.080
<v Speaker 1>he's like a big power guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2708
02:03:00.130 --> 02:03:02.060
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the reality of humans.</v>

2709
02:03:02.061 --> 02:03:04.100
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>body types triggered.</v>

2710
02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:09.540
<v Speaker 1>There was like archetypal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to make these like comic </v>

2711
02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:09.540
<v Speaker 1>beautifully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect man.</v>

2712
02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>They nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did not make these movies the shit </v>

2713
02:03:13.420 --> 02:03:14.310
<v Speaker 1>he never saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second one maybe there once Gerard's</v>

2714

<v Speaker 1>The rise of the.</v>

2716
02:03:16.630 --> 02:03:17.280

<v Speaker 1>killed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2723
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:33.560
<v Speaker 1>You had a child that just fighting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cat and the fucking cave.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The end.</v>

2730
02:03:46.450 --> 02:03:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going past that.</v>

2731
02:03:47.721 --> 02:03:50.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just justin bieber stars in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 20 years old.</v>

2732
02:03:50.271 --> 02:03:52.520
<v Speaker 1>He can get in there to give them some </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking fake abs.</v>

2733
02:03:52.530 --> 02:03:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Get the demo in there and how much pussy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin bieber would get if they did </v>

2734
02:03:57.530 --> 02:03:57.530
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it would be unmanageable.</v>

2735
02:03:57.530 --> 02:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>He already is probably limited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas this Jimmy simulation of what </v>

2736
02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:04.310
<v Speaker 1>that would looked like with the 300 guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus $20,000.</v>

2737
02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:06.320
<v Speaker 1>So this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this really did happen.</v>

2738
02:04:06.321 --> 02:04:11.321
<v Speaker 1>There really was 300 guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of hate crimes happening right </v>

2739
02:04:11.321 --> 02:04:11.900
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 guys.</v>

2740
02:04:11.901 --> 02:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>And how many thousand version?</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,000.</v>

2741
02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:15.620
<v Speaker 1>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>Persians holders.</v>

2742
02:04:15.621 --> 02:04:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look right.</v>

2743
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:20.650
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't move guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2744
02:04:20.651 --> 02:04:22.460
<v Speaker 1>It's so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they called him at mortals.</v>

2745
02:04:22.461 --> 02:04:27.461
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they just kept coming back </v>

2746
02:04:27.461 --> 02:04:27.461
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many of them.</v>

2747
02:04:27.461 --> 02:04:27.980
<v Speaker 1>You would have to be so good to beat all</v>
<v Speaker 1>their asses.</v>

2748
02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:30.080
<v Speaker 1>They're probably beating their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>assets,</v>

2749
02:04:30.110 --> 02:04:31.700
<v Speaker 1>waiting to get in on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

2750
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:34.950
<v Speaker 1>This is blowing my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is stable.</v>

2751
02:04:35.590 --> 02:04:36.920
<v Speaker 1>That's a phish concert.</v>

2752
02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Smells just as bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it kind.</v>

2753
02:04:41.431 --> 02:04:45.420
<v Speaker 1>But over there I didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2754
02:04:46.770 --> 02:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So insane.</v>

2755
02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Carlin did a good job with that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The king of kings series.</v>

2756
02:04:53.490 --> 02:04:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Carlin does a great job with </v>

2757
02:04:58.490 --> 02:05:00.241
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is really is insane that this </v>

2758
02:05:00.241 --> 02:05:02.040
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they really did try to hold off all</v>

2759
02:05:02.041 --> 02:05:03.630
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck.</v>

2760
02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:07.770
<v Speaker 1>What a sea of humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not fair because they're fresh.</v>

2761
02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:09.360
<v Speaker 1>By the time they get to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

2762
02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:12.420
<v Speaker 1>You're already beat down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fought killed seven dudes already,</v>

2763
02:05:12.450 --> 02:05:13.250
<v Speaker 1>but now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2764
02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Now you have high ground just with </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies.</v>

2765
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit about this in your life.</v>

2766
02:05:19.950 --> 02:05:21.380
<v Speaker 1>This is just computer simulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2767
02:05:21.390 --> 02:05:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has an idea.</v>

2768
02:05:23.070 --> 02:05:24.170
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how naive I am.</v>

2769
02:05:24.171 --> 02:05:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally just buying it like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2770
02:05:25.621 --> 02:05:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly it.</v>

2771
02:05:28.770 --> 02:05:30.170
<v Speaker 1>I had this super stoner</v>

2772
02:05:30.310 --> 02:05:35.310
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once that one day they would come out </v>

2773
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:39.660
<v Speaker 2>with a computer that is so powerful that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it calculates the position.</v>

2774
02:05:39.911 --> 02:05:44.911
<v Speaker 2>This would have to be dependent upon a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of other technologies that are </v>

2775
02:05:44.911 --> 02:05:46.450
<v Speaker 2>new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like specifically the ability to monitor</v>

2776
02:05:46.451 --> 02:05:51.451
<v Speaker 2>every single thing on earth in high </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition and then put all that </v>

2777
02:05:51.451 --> 02:05:55.831
<v Speaker 2>information to some crazy supercomputer </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you look at every object that is in </v>

2778
02:05:55.831 --> 02:05:59.370
<v Speaker 2>every position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever it is and somehow or another </v>

2779
02:05:59.370 --> 02:06:03.061
<v Speaker 2>they could figure out how everything got</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and through some super powerful ai</v>

2780
02:06:04.121 --> 02:06:07.990
<v Speaker 2>that's hasn't even been invented yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would literally be able to recreate</v>

2781
02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:12.220
<v Speaker 2>every single moment that happened that </v>
<v Speaker 2>led to that happening right there.</v>

2782
02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Like you get the math and just go </v>
<v Speaker 2>backwards.</v>

2783
02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We realized at one point,</v>

2784
02:06:16.151 --> 02:06:18.190
<v Speaker 2>this is a super stoner idea that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think is real.</v>

2785
02:06:18.191 --> 02:06:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're so fucking stupid.</v>

2786
02:06:20.231 --> 02:06:21.370
<v Speaker 2>You understand how time works.</v>

2787
02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:23.090
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my.</v>

2788
02:06:23.110 --> 02:06:26.260
<v Speaker 2>This is my super stoner idea was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would figure it out.</v>

2789
02:06:26.261 --> 02:06:31.261
<v Speaker 2>Computers that are so impossibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful and they can calculate and </v>

2790
02:06:31.261 --> 02:06:35.251
<v Speaker 2>extrapolate and do this crazy sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of algorithm that figures out </v>

2791
02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:43.700
<v Speaker 2>exactly how everything got to wherever </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is and that you could recreate in </v>

2792
02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:46.080
<v Speaker 2>some sort of visual form everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ever happened ever.</v>

2793
02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:48.450
<v Speaker 2>I think that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Theoretically,</v>

2794
02:06:48.510 --> 02:06:53.510
<v Speaker 2>we're both so high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't be talking about this </v>

2795
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:54.450
<v Speaker 2>publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We totally possible,</v>

2796
02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:57.450
<v Speaker 2>but we'll never get there if we keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>hiring 50 slash 50 gender.</v>

2797
02:06:58.210 --> 02:07:00.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2798
02:07:00.211 --> 02:07:02.790
<v Speaker 2>You're a misogynist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm only kidding.</v>

2799
02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:06.180
<v Speaker 2>I saw a lot of people that said that guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a misogynist.</v>

2800
02:07:07.370 --> 02:07:09.660
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like calling everybody in Nazi.</v>

2801
02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:15.080
<v Speaker 2>He can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be careful because then </v>

2802
02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:16.350
<v Speaker 2>you see a real Nazi and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different thing.</v>

2803
02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:17.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2804
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:20.550
<v Speaker 2>the issue that I have with 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine rounds in mma sometimes at 10,</v>

2805
02:07:20.551 --> 02:07:25.551
<v Speaker 2>nine round dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck beat out of them and other </v>

2806
02:07:25.551 --> 02:07:25.551
<v Speaker 2>times a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine round and it could be either one,</v>

2807
02:07:25.551 --> 02:07:27.060
<v Speaker 2>I can't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same thing.</v>

2808
02:07:27.061 --> 02:07:30.660
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you gotTa have a new name for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and that's sort of how I feel.</v>

2809
02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Terrible explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible comparison rather.</v>

2810
02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:38.480
<v Speaker 2>But that's what I think about people </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling someone a massage and it's like </v>

2811
02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:38.480
<v Speaker 2>a massage just to someone who hates </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

2812
02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:42.640
<v Speaker 2>If someone writes a page and a half of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ideas of how you can encourage</v>

2813
02:07:43.841 --> 02:07:47.470
<v Speaker 2>women to get into tech and so they will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be more represented that you know,</v>

2814
02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:51.100
<v Speaker 2>like make it more interesting for them </v>
<v Speaker 2>or ways to get them in.</v>

2815
02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:53.640
<v Speaker 2>That's not a misogynist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the opposite of a misogynist.</v>

2816
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:58.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because someone doesn't tow the </v>

2817
02:07:58.750 --> 02:08:01.890
<v Speaker 2>current lefty liberal line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean that you're a </v>

2818
02:08:01.890 --> 02:08:01.890
<v Speaker 2>misogynist.</v>

2819
02:08:01.890 --> 02:08:02.080
<v Speaker 2>You gotta think about what this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

2820
02:08:02.410 --> 02:08:04.270
<v Speaker 2>No one's saying women can't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2821
02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:06.400
<v Speaker 2>No one's saying women are less </v>
<v Speaker 2>qualified.</v>

2822
02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:10.360
<v Speaker 2>What he's saying is that women are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>inclined to choose different things.</v>

2823
02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:15.480
<v Speaker 2>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is supported by science and it </v>

2824
02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:17.150
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean you hate women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think that the reason why there's</v>

2825
02:08:17.170 --> 02:08:22.170
<v Speaker 2>whatever the percentage is 10 percent or</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 percent or 20 percent of women in </v>

2826
02:08:22.170 --> 02:08:22.170
<v Speaker 2>tech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's,</v>

2827
02:08:22.170 --> 02:08:24.670
<v Speaker 2>if that's that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because 20 percent of the women who</v>

2828
02:08:24.671 --> 02:08:28.150
<v Speaker 2>decide to go into college and decided to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pursue a career are interested in it.</v>

2829
02:08:28.410 --> 02:08:33.410
<v Speaker 2>If that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's any other reason we need to </v>

2830
02:08:33.410 --> 02:08:33.410
<v Speaker 2>examine it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it's that reason,</v>

2831
02:08:33.410 --> 02:08:35.260
<v Speaker 2>then we should just kind of accept it </v>
<v Speaker 2>for what it is and try to make it easier</v>

2832
02:08:35.261 --> 02:08:37.630
<v Speaker 2>for those women that worked there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the fuck to do that.</v>

2833
02:08:37.630 --> 02:08:42.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't work in an office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would imagine there's got to be </v>

2834
02:08:42.630 --> 02:08:42.630
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2835
02:08:42.630 --> 02:08:44.890
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine just treat people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>respect,</v>

2836
02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:49.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out a way to make that a </v>

2837
02:08:49.980 --> 02:08:53.101
<v Speaker 2>priority in your office or a part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your business or the culture of your </v>

2838
02:08:53.101 --> 02:08:53.101
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2839
02:08:53.101 --> 02:08:54.040
<v Speaker 2>Just focus on the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the group.</v>

2840
02:08:54.100 --> 02:08:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

2841
02:08:54.851 --> 02:08:59.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All girls and all boys that those </v>

2842
02:08:59.851 --> 02:08:59.851

2843
02:08:59.851 --> 02:09:01.180
<v Speaker 2>That does not end well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't end well.</v>

2844
02:09:01.181 --> 02:09:03.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good way to differentiate </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you like someone to.</v>

2845
02:09:03.461 --> 02:09:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Not if it's all girl or all boy or all </v>
<v Speaker 2>white or all black or all anything.</v>

2846
02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:12.190
<v Speaker 2>You got to be open to possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're not saying like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>discriminatory.</v>

02:09:21.250 --> 02:09:22.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like you've got very specific </v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to go to Australia.</v>

2859
02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Have you read a sports gene by </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstained?</v>

2860
02:09:36.420 --> 02:09:37.150
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Habit.</v>

2861
02:09:37.330 --> 02:09:38.260
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haven't read that.</v>

2862
02:09:38.290 --> 02:09:40.180
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like when it comes to sports,</v>

2863
02:09:40.181 --> 02:09:41.710
<v Speaker 2>it's so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2864
02:09:41.860 --> 02:09:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Where it's like there's one area of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenya where like all the winners of </v>

2865
02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:49.270
<v Speaker 2>every marathon come from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the individual basis,</v>

2866
02:09:49.271 --> 02:09:51.310
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2867
02:09:51.311 --> 02:09:54.850
<v Speaker 2>like Cameron hanes would beat 99 point </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

2868
02:09:54.851 --> 02:09:55.290
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

2869
02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:57.730
<v Speaker 2>nine percent of black people in long </v>
<v Speaker 2>distance running,</v>

2870
02:09:57.731 --> 02:09:59.680
<v Speaker 2>but the that you'd have to get really </v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

2871
02:09:59.950 --> 02:10:04.330
<v Speaker 2>You can see those little skinny African </v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes that when marathons.</v>

2872
02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are beasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot fuck with those guys when it </v>

2873
02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:12.571
<v Speaker 2>comes to running a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those skinny dudes like that is the </v>

2874
02:10:12.571 --> 02:10:13.930
<v Speaker 2>build for marathons and Cam's never </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to beat those guys,</v>

2875
02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:18.640
<v Speaker 2>but you put them on a mountain where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they got to go up like 9,000</v>

2876
02:10:18.641 --> 02:10:20.920
<v Speaker 2>feet of elevation and it's a three day </v>
<v Speaker 2>run.</v>

2877
02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:24.190
<v Speaker 2>He leaves all those motherfuckers in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dirt because it's a different built.</v>

2878
02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Like his build is a muscle build to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>keys.</v>

2879
02:10:26.701 --> 02:10:31.701
<v Speaker 2>A built guy who does endurance sports </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's like a lot of the mountain </v>

2880
02:10:31.701 --> 02:10:35.551
<v Speaker 2>runners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of the people that do those </v>

2881
02:10:35.551 --> 02:10:35.551
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the bigfoot 200.</v>

2882
02:10:35.551 --> 02:10:38.330
<v Speaker 2>There's a massive amount of travel and </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevation up and down.</v>

2883
02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:44.020
<v Speaker 2>You have to be strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's not just flat ground </v>

2884
02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:44.510
<v Speaker 2>and if you're like a really good flat </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground runner,</v>

2885
02:10:44.511 --> 02:10:47.570
<v Speaker 2>it's a totally different build.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their real skinny and it's for them it's</v>

2886
02:10:47.571 --> 02:10:50.510
<v Speaker 2>just about efficiency in motion and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad cardio.</v>

2887
02:10:50.610 --> 02:10:52.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also like a oxygen consumption.</v>

2888
02:10:52.891 --> 02:10:57.891
<v Speaker 3>Like that's why warm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wet air wide nostrils you crush,</v>

2889
02:10:58.860 --> 02:11:02.880
<v Speaker 3>but like if you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know where he's racing with dry cold</v>

2890
02:11:02.881 --> 02:11:04.290
<v Speaker 3>air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need a lot more surface area.</v>

2891
02:11:04.291 --> 02:11:07.080
<v Speaker 3>That's how you have these tight noses </v>
<v Speaker 3>and saying something like that.</v>

2892
02:11:07.081 --> 02:11:07.590
<v Speaker 3>Someone say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2895
02:11:11.070 --> 02:11:16.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it racist to the black guys have big </v>

2896
02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:19.010
<v Speaker 2>dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be racist if it's good.</v>

2897
02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that the question?</v>

2898
02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:26.120
<v Speaker 2>That has been a question that has been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a racial stereotype?</v>

2899
02:11:26.170 --> 02:11:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's triggering to guys who have </v>

<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

2941
02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:16.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of it has to do with whether </v>

2942
02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:18.111
<v Speaker 3>or not you heard it animals or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or had a farm and that's the size of </v>

2943
02:13:18.111 --> 02:13:21.201
<v Speaker 3>government you want or it's like it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same with like certain Chinese </v>

2944
02:13:21.201 --> 02:13:24.070
<v Speaker 3>people can count so well and they're so </v>
<v Speaker 3>good at math because they just,</v>

2945
02:13:24.170 --> 02:13:24.910
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2946
02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:25.500
<v Speaker 3>it's one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

2947
02:13:25.501 --> 02:13:25.860
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

2948
02:13:25.861 --> 02:13:26.700
<v Speaker 3>five and then 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

2949
02:13:26.701 --> 02:13:27.030
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

2950
02:13:27.031 --> 02:13:27.510
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

2951
02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:29.160

02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:36.270
<v Speaker 2>starts snowballing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same with like rice farming.</v>

2954
02:13:36.570 --> 02:13:41.570
<v Speaker 2>It's all about efficiency because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>year round and you have like a little </v>

2955
02:13:41.570 --> 02:13:44.601
<v Speaker 2>amount of land and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that makes you a little more </v>

2956
02:13:44.601 --> 02:13:45.030
<v Speaker 2>efficient as a culture and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>racial.</v>

2957
02:13:45.031 --> 02:13:47.520
<v Speaker 2>It just means like you guys value </v>
<v Speaker 2>different shit.</v>

2958
02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:52.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you gotta wonder how much of what</v>

2959
02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:57.080
<v Speaker 2>a person is in 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of it has to do with all sorts </v>

2960
02:13:58.171 --> 02:14:02.070
<v Speaker 2>of factors and influences that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely out of your control and if,</v>

2961
02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:03.440
<v Speaker 2>if a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2962
02:14:03.441 --> 02:14:08.441
<v Speaker 2>I'm inclined to believe it's most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all of it has to do with things </v>

2963
02:14:08.441 --> 02:14:12.171
<v Speaker 2>that are out of your control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would you think that we'd be a </v>

2964
02:14:12.171 --> 02:14:16.371
<v Speaker 2>good idea to be aligned with a group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>one people that have one thing in </v>

2965
02:14:17.371 --> 02:14:22.371
<v Speaker 2>common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're white or you're black or </v>

2966
02:14:22.371 --> 02:14:22.371
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck you are.</v>

2967
02:14:22.371 --> 02:14:23.910
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't.</v>

2968
02:14:24.090 --> 02:14:29.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a holdover from ancient times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we were tribal and we were worried </v>

2969
02:14:29.090 --> 02:14:31.320
<v Speaker 2>about being invaded and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

2970
02:14:31.321 --> 02:14:32.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there they are.</v>

2971
02:14:32.071 --> 02:14:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Invading the art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taken away our culture,</v>

2972
02:14:34.650 --> 02:14:35.910
<v Speaker 2>taken away our history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2973
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:39.060
<v Speaker 2>just fucking relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

2974
02:14:39.061 --> 02:14:40.380
<v Speaker 2>No one's taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

2975
02:14:40.650 --> 02:14:42.510
<v Speaker 2>you can't take away history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2976
02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:45.000
<v Speaker 2>it's not like people are going to forget</v>
<v Speaker 2>and second of all,</v>

2977
02:14:45.150 --> 02:14:47.790
<v Speaker 2>like you're not here for very long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2978
02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:53.240
<v Speaker 2>This is a short time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're wasting your time thinking about </v>

2979
02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:54.960
<v Speaker 2>some stupid shit you if you are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>super lucky.</v>

2980
02:14:54.961 --> 02:14:58.170
<v Speaker 2>You got a hundred years on this rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100.</v>

2981
02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:00.840
<v Speaker 2>And we're also externalizing pride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2982
02:15:00.930 --> 02:15:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2983
02:15:02.341 --> 02:15:05.850
<v Speaker 2>I need trump to say this or I feel shame</v>
<v Speaker 2>or pride.</v>

2984
02:15:05.851 --> 02:15:08.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like it should stem from your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplishments and yourself,</v>

2985
02:15:08.970 --> 02:15:10.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like pride,</v>

2986
02:15:11.010 --> 02:15:13.140
<v Speaker 2>like what do you have pride in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2987

<v Speaker 2>Happy.</v>

2988
02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:16.260
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably where it ends.</v>

2989
02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:18.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd be happy that you're a good person</v>

2990
02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:19.420
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2991
02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:20.920
<v Speaker 2>you should be happy that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2992
02:15:20.930 --> 02:15:25.930
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of friends and that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy each other's company and you can </v>

<v Speaker 2>make them happy and they can make you </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy and that you enjoy seeing them.</v>

2994
02:15:27.901 --> 02:15:30.500
<v Speaker 2>You should be happy about </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplishments and you know,</v>

2995
02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:34.380
<v Speaker 2>good interactions that you successfully </v>
<v Speaker 2>navigated through with people that maybe</v>

2996
02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:36.030
<v Speaker 2>could have gone badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2997
02:15:36.031 --> 02:15:38.880
<v Speaker 2>those are always great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always good feelings when clear the</v>

2998
02:15:38.881 --> 02:15:43.881
<v Speaker 2>air with somebody and you give a big hug</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of it and everybody feels </v>

2999
02:15:43.881 --> 02:15:43.881
<v Speaker 2>better because those are things to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy about.</v>

3000
02:15:44.130 --> 02:15:49.130
<v Speaker 2>But people are happy about stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're happy about what you both like </v>

3001
02:15:49.130 --> 02:15:49.130
<v Speaker 2>swastikas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as fuck.</v>

3002
02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:51.690
<v Speaker 2>How about those dudes showed up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>

3003
02:15:51.870 --> 02:15:56.870
<v Speaker 2>They showed up with guns like full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full on open carry walking the street </v>

3004
02:15:56.870 --> 02:16:00.450
<v Speaker 2>with military outfits on flak jackets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine guns showing up.</v>

3005
02:16:00.451 --> 02:16:02.430
<v Speaker 2>What while they're taking down this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking statue?</v>

3006
02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3007
02:16:03.351 --> 02:16:05.280
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a form of mental illness</v>

3008
02:16:05.310 --> 02:16:10.310
<v Speaker 2>where it's like you're living out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trauma that it doesn't really apply to </v>

3009
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.310
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3010
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:11.280
<v Speaker 2>there's no real war for these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

3011
02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:13.980
<v Speaker 2>This in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in at least where they're standing.</v>

3012
02:16:14.430 --> 02:16:16.030
<v Speaker 2>So because there's no real war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3013
02:16:16.050 --> 02:16:18.300
<v Speaker 2>they're bringing guns and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>turning something.</v>

3014
02:16:18.330 --> 02:16:21.570
<v Speaker 2>The ramping up all the power and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure of this moment.</v>

3015
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:25.320
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened on the side of the left,</v>

3016
02:16:25.321 --> 02:16:27.960
<v Speaker 2>but I heard that they were doing some </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible shit to people too.</v>

3017
02:16:28.150 --> 02:16:33.150
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there a lot of punching and people are </v>

3018
02:16:33.150 --> 02:16:35.611
<v Speaker 2>fucking beaten the shit out of each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and there's piles on top of each </v>

3019
02:16:35.611 --> 02:16:35.611
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

3020
02:16:35.611 --> 02:16:37.840
<v Speaker 2>The violence has escalated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea who started it,</v>

3021
02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:39.100
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3022
02:16:39.130 --> 02:16:44.130
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea if the police were at </v>

3023
02:16:44.130 --> 02:16:46.261
<v Speaker 2>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that believe </v>

3024
02:16:46.261 --> 02:16:46.261
<v Speaker 2>that the police should have separated </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and they did not.</v>

3025
02:16:46.270 --> 02:16:51.270
<v Speaker 2>They didn't do anything about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they allowed it to escalate and they </v>

3026
02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:52.180
<v Speaker 2>just stood back while it escalated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they didn't have the power,</v>

3027
02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:56.320
<v Speaker 2>the manpower to go in and enforce some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of civility.</v>

3028
02:16:56.470 --> 02:16:58.000
<v Speaker 2>It's tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible,</v>

3029
02:16:58.001 --> 02:16:58.390
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3030
02:16:58.391 --> 02:16:59.740
<v Speaker 2>they might not have been prepared for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3031
02:16:59.741 --> 02:17:01.210
<v Speaker 2>They might not have had the resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3032
02:17:01.211 --> 02:17:03.010
<v Speaker 2>how many fucking people are working </v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

3033
02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:05.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's how many thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people showed up with torches.</v>

3034
02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like the opposite of woodstock </v>

3035
02:17:11.250 --> 02:17:12.070
<v Speaker 2>where it's like the worst possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too many people.</v>

3036
02:17:12.370 --> 02:17:14.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of times people need a</v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>

3037
02:17:14.590 --> 02:17:16.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm friends with a lot of vets,</v>

3038
02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:21.640

<v Speaker 2>and like they have ptsd and all this </v>

3039
02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:25.381
<v Speaker 2>stuff and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of them just want to purpose </v>

3040
02:17:25.381 --> 02:17:28.470
<v Speaker 2>because like idle time makes them crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of people right </v>

3041
02:17:28.470 --> 02:17:31.930
<v Speaker 2>now that don't feel any purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're like listening to chat rooms,</v>

3042

<v Speaker 2>possessions.</v>

3044
02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:41.380
<v Speaker 2>And then that's when things become </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrifying.</v>

3045
02:17:41.770 --> 02:17:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're talking about this.</v>

3048
02:17:46.481 --> 02:17:51.481
<v Speaker 2>People on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a group of people and you </v>

3049
02:17:51.481 --> 02:17:52.900

<v Speaker 2>They last forever.</v>

3064
02:18:26.650 --> 02:18:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck do you need fire?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you pretend like some intimidation </v>

<v Speaker 2>and you had to walk down the street with</v>

3067
02:18:37.781 --> 02:18:40.060
<v Speaker 2>a torch because they're almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentionally being like,</v>

3068
02:18:40.061 --> 02:18:43.320
<v Speaker 2>we're backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is exactly like that.</v>

3069

<v Speaker 2>You had a bad pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not a bad person.</v>

3074
02:19:00.581 --> 02:19:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Don't get stuck in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't let this define you.</v>

3075
02:19:04.030 --> 02:19:07.990
<v Speaker 2>You're just a person in any one of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have got stuck in a shift pattern.</v>

3076
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:10.600
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what being a racist is.</v>

3077
02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:12.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not being a realist.</v>

<v Speaker 2>navigate away from the Douche bags and </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's the worst thing to do to your body </v>

3087
02:19:41.150 --> 02:19:44.960
<v Speaker 1>to show that you're a part of one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>worst group ever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jews and wants to kill them and throw </v>

<v Speaker 1>Let the swastika go.</v>

3095
02:19:58.230 --> 02:20:00.230
<v Speaker 1>You can get by without a swastika </v>
<v Speaker 1>tattoo.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that what you're trying to do is try and</v>

3125
02:21:20.270 --> 02:21:25.270
<v Speaker 1>focus on something and get better at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get figured out what it is that </v>

<v Speaker 1>makes this thing good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3127
02:21:25.780 --> 02:21:27.830
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's an extra.</v>

3128
02:21:27.860 --> 02:21:29.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously they're not the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity,</v>

3129
02:21:29.421 --> 02:21:31.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a focus.</v>

3130
02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:36.700
<v Speaker 1>It's an avenue for your mind.</v>

<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like when you get involved in </v>

3132
02:21:40.361 --> 02:21:40.361
<v Speaker 1>hobbies and you really get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you manage them healthily,</v>

3133
02:21:40.361 --> 02:21:41.300
<v Speaker 1>we don't let them take over your life.</v>

3134
02:21:42.050 --> 02:21:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Getting better at a thing like chess or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu or whatever it is,</v>

3135
02:21:46.490 --> 02:21:49.340
<v Speaker 1>gets you better at the entirety of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

3136
02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:54.460
<v Speaker 1>As long as you look at the entirety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life in balance and you don't let </v>

3137
02:21:54.460 --> 02:21:56.690
<v Speaker 1>it run away from you because I've let it</v>
<v Speaker 1>run away from me for a bunch of times.</v>

3138
02:21:56.691 --> 02:21:59.390
<v Speaker 1>I think we all have to stand up too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3139
02:21:59.540 --> 02:22:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Like I like just learning Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to teach myself Spanish.</v>

3140
02:22:02.241 --> 02:22:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I have a whole new 10 minutes on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender of nouns like that.</v>

3141
02:22:05.751 --> 02:22:08.360
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have even thought of if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>only spoke English my whole life.</v>

3142
02:22:08.420 --> 02:22:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good point.</v>

3143
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:10.670
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3144
02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's another totally different </v>
<v Speaker 1>take on things.</v>

3145
02:22:12.801 --> 02:22:17.801
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at it from the point of view of </v>

3146
02:22:17.801 --> 02:22:19.901
<v Speaker 1>like any sort of Latin art or Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin language and Luna was down a </v>

3147
02:22:19.901 --> 02:22:19.970
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

3148
02:22:19.970 --> 02:22:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Then you go through the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like our language doesn't have any </v>

3149
02:22:24.970 --> 02:22:28.421
<v Speaker 1>gender assignment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all I'm nouns and then for them it's </v>

3150
02:22:28.421 --> 02:22:31.641
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to remember like what </v>

3151
02:22:31.641 --> 02:22:31.641
<v Speaker 1>everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it has a dick or a pussy,</v>

3152
02:22:31.641 --> 02:22:33.810
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they're triggered all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day,</v>

3153
02:22:33.870 --> 02:22:38.870
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody's like super settled as </v>

3154
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:41.060
<v Speaker 1>gender classification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about non binary folks in Latin </v>

3155
02:22:41.060 --> 02:22:42.720
<v Speaker 1>countries?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just must be spiraling.</v>

3156
02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:44.670
<v Speaker 1>What about gender fluid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Julio,</v>

3157
02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:48.660
<v Speaker 1>you El Senor or a loss senorita.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are you to?</v>

3158
02:22:48.770 --> 02:22:53.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like zero President Taser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't buy that shit over there now </v>

3159
02:22:54.660 --> 02:22:59.660
<v Speaker 1>and they don't even think about it's fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it in Pasadena and shit because </v>

3160
02:22:59.660 --> 02:22:59.660
<v Speaker 1>it's like a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3161
02:22:59.660 --> 02:23:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans haven't even thought about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3162
02:23:01.591 --> 02:23:04.950
<v Speaker 1>It's just so second nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like having someone describe</v>

3163
02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:06.930
<v Speaker 1>our culture to us and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

3164
02:23:06.931 --> 02:23:09.240
<v Speaker 1>we put silicone and chicks fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>boobs,</v>

3165
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:10.860
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3166
02:23:10.861 --> 02:23:15.861
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things more disturbing me for some </v>

3167
02:23:15.861 --> 02:23:15.861
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3168
02:23:15.861 --> 02:23:19.460
<v Speaker 1>The new trend and fake butts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a girl just two days ago at the </v>

3169
02:23:19.460 --> 02:23:20.310
<v Speaker 1>hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like she had a diaper on.</v>

3170
02:23:20.690 --> 02:23:23.100
<v Speaker 1>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was walking around by the pool.</v>

3171
02:23:23.101 --> 02:23:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the craziest fucking.</v>

3172
02:23:25.261 --> 02:23:29.550
<v Speaker 1>She had some dress on and some so </v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterously proportion to talks.</v>

3173
02:23:30.090 --> 02:23:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3174
02:23:31.021 --> 02:23:32.400
<v Speaker 1>you can't just do that.</v>

3175
02:23:34.730 --> 02:23:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Can just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3176
02:23:36.121 --> 02:23:38.400
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

3177
02:23:38.410 --> 02:23:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it floats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely has to.</v>

3178
02:23:40.741 --> 02:23:42.930
<v Speaker 1>If it's all fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are doing it now,</v>

3179
02:23:42.931 --> 02:23:47.931
<v Speaker 1>apparently what they do is fat grafting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same word I use when I </v>

3180

<v Speaker 1>could play it on the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

3276
02:27:26.681 --> 02:27:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds wicked horrifying.</v>

3277
02:27:28.270 --> 02:27:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Watch she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she gets it up in the air and then she </v>

3278
02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:34.410
<v Speaker 1>loses control of it and drops it down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

3279
02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:35.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she's doing.</v>

3280
02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says crossfit.</v>

3281
02:27:36.910 --> 02:27:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch she gets up.</v>

3282
02:27:38.930 --> 02:27:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>

3283
02:27:42.610 --> 02:27:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good.</v>

3284
02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

3285
02:27:46.370 --> 02:27:49.150
<v Speaker 1>That girl could have died for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

3286
02:27:49.151 --> 02:27:50.860
<v Speaker 1>She could have been paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's okay.</v>

3287
02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Apparently I'm luckily because the bar </v>
<v Speaker 1>is larger than her,</v>

3288
02:27:55.660 --> 02:27:58.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plates are larger than her body,</v>

3289
02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:03.360
<v Speaker 1>so as it falls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plates hit the ground and the thing </v>

3290
02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:03.360
<v Speaker 1>probably bounced off the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably rubber.</v>

3291
02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:05.340
<v Speaker 1>So she was all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but food,</v>

3292
02:28:05.350 --> 02:28:06.530
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3293
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:07.270
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

3294
02:28:07.770 --> 02:28:12.770
<v Speaker 1>that's the issue that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have with know people getting really </v>

3295
02:28:12.770 --> 02:28:14.440
<v Speaker 1>crazy with those kinds of Olympic lifts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and things along those lines.</v>

3296
02:28:14.580 --> 02:28:16.030
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be real careful with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

3297
02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:17.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

3298
02:28:18.190 --> 02:28:19.420
<v Speaker 1>it can go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3299
02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:22.150
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>love about kettle bells,</v>

3300
02:28:22.220 --> 02:28:23.210
<v Speaker 1>like I've never had.</v>

3301
02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:25.130
<v Speaker 1>That kind of shit happened to me with </v>
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells.</v>

3302
02:28:25.220 --> 02:28:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Never lost one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd lift pretty heavy with them,</v>

3303
02:28:28.491 --> 02:28:31.490
<v Speaker 1>but I've built up to it over the years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I never go to failure.</v>

3304
02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Like when I'm doing is like it's hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>and makes you stronger,</v>

3305
02:28:34.761 --> 02:28:39.761
<v Speaker 1>but this like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to make you that kind of </v>

3306
02:28:39.761 --> 02:28:43.301
<v Speaker 1>strong like that kind of clean press </v>
<v Speaker 1>squat strong lesson that's a fucking </v>

3307
02:28:43.301 --> 02:28:47.350
<v Speaker 1>high level strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But boy that's so strength Pacific and </v>

3308
02:28:47.350 --> 02:28:47.550
<v Speaker 1>it's super dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3309
02:28:47.570 --> 02:28:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And kettle bells more applicable to your</v>

3310
02:28:49.161 --> 02:28:50.060
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now,</v>

3311
02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:55.120
<v Speaker 1>like I literally am swinging my baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a Kettlebell and I'm like oh </v>

3312
02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:58.931
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gym work really made me a better </v>

3313
02:28:58.931 --> 02:28:58.931
<v Speaker 1>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do Turkish getups with my kids.</v>

3314
02:28:58.931 --> 02:29:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Which ones at Turkish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getups you lied on your back.</v>

3315
02:29:01.430 --> 02:29:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to press them and I sit up </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice and I'll get up and I hold them up </v>

3316
02:29:06.430 --> 02:29:06.620
<v Speaker 1>in the air and then slowly let them </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

3317
02:29:06.770 --> 02:29:08.780
<v Speaker 1>It was way easier when they're babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

3318
02:29:09.590 --> 02:29:10.690
<v Speaker 1>It's hard now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3319
02:29:10.691 --> 02:29:11.470
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3320
02:29:11.480 --> 02:29:13.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like we're adding weight to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

3321
02:29:13.490 --> 02:29:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I carry my kids around all the time too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing I do.</v>

3322
02:29:16.131 --> 02:29:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I go hiking and I'll throw my kids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my shoulders.</v>

3323
02:29:18.350 --> 02:29:20.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's like my nine year old's like 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds,</v>

3324
02:29:20.661 --> 02:29:22.430
<v Speaker 1>53 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I carry her up hills.</v>

3325
02:29:22.490 --> 02:29:23.590
<v Speaker 1>That's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

3326
02:29:23.591 --> 02:29:28.591
<v Speaker 1>It's a good workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I kind of have like a little </v>

3327
02:29:28.591 --> 02:29:28.591
<v Speaker 1>slightly wide hips which kind of like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

3328
02:29:28.591 --> 02:29:31.100
<v Speaker 1>so like halfway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you went the other way,</v>

3329
02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:32.750
<v Speaker 1>it'd be quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick transition,</v>

3330
02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:35.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's still be six slash seven and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like just not good at basketball.</v>

3331
02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Big Sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big sexy woman hippie.</v>

3332
02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:41.150
<v Speaker 1>But like with the baby though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3333
02:29:41.151 --> 02:29:46.151
<v Speaker 1>oh I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why women have these put 'em on </v>

3334
02:29:46.151 --> 02:29:49.091
<v Speaker 1>the hips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why they have them and </v>

3335
02:29:49.091 --> 02:29:49.091
<v Speaker 1>have them check her out.</v>

3336
02:29:49.091 --> 02:29:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not to carry them around.</v>

3337
02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:54.780
<v Speaker 1>If they had a pouch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a kangaroo or in the hip and he </v>

3338
02:29:54.780 --> 02:29:56.270
<v Speaker 1>grew up right when they got pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tucked a little kid right there.</v>

3339
02:29:56.450 --> 02:29:57.430
<v Speaker 1>That'd be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3340
02:29:57.440 --> 02:30:01.070
<v Speaker 1>They just walk a little sideways limp </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids sitting right there.</v>

3341
02:30:01.250 --> 02:30:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like my wife's like chiseled now</v>

3342
02:30:03.051 --> 02:30:04.430
<v Speaker 1>from just holding the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3343
02:30:04.431 --> 02:30:07.250
<v Speaker 1>You get jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carrying around a weight all day.</v>

3344
02:30:07.340 --> 02:30:12.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're doing stuff like boxers</v>
<v Speaker 1>use hand weights and they're only like </v>

3345
02:30:12.340 --> 02:30:12.340
<v Speaker 1>two pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3346
02:30:13.010 --> 02:30:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Remember those ankle ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never use those.</v>

3347
02:30:15.140 --> 02:30:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3348
02:30:15.861 --> 02:30:20.861
<v Speaker 1>I used to use those for kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to use those and people were </v>

3349
02:30:20.861 --> 02:30:20.861
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3350
02:30:20.861 --> 02:30:21.040
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna fuck your knees up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3351
02:30:21.060 --> 02:30:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Because if you kick hard with ankle </v>
<v Speaker 1>weights on your fucking knees up,</v>

3352
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:26.120
<v Speaker 1>so we always have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now that I'm older,</v>

3353
02:30:26.121 --> 02:30:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

3354
02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:28.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't just do it right?</v>

3355
02:30:28.960 --> 02:30:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely make you stronger.</v>

3356
02:30:31.620 --> 02:30:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Callen one showed me you kicking a bag </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was unbelievable to watch.</v>

3357
02:30:36.450 --> 02:30:38.210
<v Speaker 1>We're like onset of Sullivan and son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3358
02:30:38.220 --> 02:30:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

3359
02:30:39.741 --> 02:30:41.390
<v Speaker 1>And he was just wham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wham.</v>

3360
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:43.940
<v Speaker 1>And I remember just being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

3361
02:30:43.941 --> 02:30:46.610
<v Speaker 1>that's a skill I'll never have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoy watching that.</v>

3362
02:30:46.730 --> 02:30:48.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a skill that I don't even believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

3363
02:30:49.130 --> 02:30:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's crazy.</v>

3364
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:54.020
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things where whenever </v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to workout I'm like,</v>

3365
02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I really know how to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't seem like I should.</v>

3366
02:30:57.200 --> 02:30:58.990
<v Speaker 1>And it was like a machine gun was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>

3367
02:30:59.070 --> 02:30:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

3368
02:30:59.720 --> 02:31:01.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a 30 clip right there.</v>

3369
02:31:02.030 --> 02:31:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just do it all the time,</v>

3370
02:31:03.471 --> 02:31:05.780
<v Speaker 1>but even even to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I still.</v>

3371
02:31:05.810 --> 02:31:08.640
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because I grew up doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like.</v>

3372
02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:12.740
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of barely remember learning it</v>
<v Speaker 1>until we have a piano.</v>

3373
02:31:12.840 --> 02:31:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm playing Bach and I'm like,</v>

3374
02:31:15.260 --> 02:31:17.670
<v Speaker 1>so your fingers just find the keys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3375
02:31:17.671 --> 02:31:18.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

3376
02:31:18.350 --> 02:31:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm like retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3377
02:31:19.690 --> 02:31:20.120
<v Speaker 1>and I'm playing</v>

3378
02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:25.120
<v Speaker 2>like the craziest songs ever written.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We made this video because Eddie Bravo </v>

3379
02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:29.690
<v Speaker 2>had always seen me do this and he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell people and they would go shut the </v>

3380
02:31:29.690 --> 02:31:29.690
<v Speaker 2>fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3381
02:31:29.690 --> 02:31:31.260
<v Speaker 2>because everybody always thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's,</v>

3382
02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:34.170
<v Speaker 2>everybody's always exaggerating about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their friend who does something,</v>

3383
02:31:34.171 --> 02:31:35.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

3384
02:31:37.410 --> 02:31:39.600
<v Speaker 2>And so he was always like talking to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

3385
02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:44.190
<v Speaker 2>about a martial arts kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3386
02:31:44.191 --> 02:31:49.191
<v Speaker 2>well there's a lot of like problems with</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the ways some people kick and I </v>

3387
02:31:49.191 --> 02:31:51.030
<v Speaker 2>would explain it to him and then I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>show them on a bag and he'd be like,</v>

3388
02:31:51.031 --> 02:31:56.031
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how long have you been able to do </v>

3389
02:31:56.031 --> 02:31:56.031
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3390
02:31:56.031 --> 02:31:56.110
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing this my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you know how to like,</v>

3391
02:31:56.130 --> 02:32:01.130
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you can do that because </v>

3392
02:32:01.130 --> 02:32:01.130
<v Speaker 2>muscle memory.</v>

3393
02:32:01.130 --> 02:32:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Well I grew up doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3394
02:32:01.130 --> 02:32:03.750
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a part of how my body moves.</v>

3395
02:32:04.110 --> 02:32:07.260
<v Speaker 2>But because I don't really remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning it,</v>

3396
02:32:07.650 --> 02:32:09.210
<v Speaker 2>it does feel weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels,</v>

3397
02:32:09.570 --> 02:32:13.080
<v Speaker 2>it feels like I'm not sure I really can </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it until I do it.</v>

3398
02:32:13.350 --> 02:32:14.870
<v Speaker 2>And then every time I do it I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

3399
02:32:15.490 --> 02:32:17.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like the shock and awe of a kick.</v>

3400
02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible.</v>

3401
02:32:18.451 --> 02:32:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Like even if there's someone that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more my speed,</v>

3402
02:32:22.530 --> 02:32:24.780
<v Speaker 2>if they just bust out a big kick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3403
02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:26.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all right.</v>

3404
02:32:26.730 --> 02:32:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife,</v>

3405
02:32:27.790 --> 02:32:30.120
<v Speaker 2>she is a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially leg kicks man,</v>

3406
02:32:30.510 --> 02:32:32.940
<v Speaker 2>if you like see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a really good,</v>

3407
02:32:32.970 --> 02:32:36.570
<v Speaker 2>like tie fighter and you watch someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicked someone's legs.</v>

3408
02:32:36.810 --> 02:32:40.570
<v Speaker 2>It's so horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the sound it makes and the power it</v>

3409
02:32:40.571 --> 02:32:42.060
<v Speaker 2>has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see that in the UFC all the time.</v>

3410
02:32:42.061 --> 02:32:45.120
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the hardest because I'm like,</v>

3411
02:32:45.170 --> 02:32:45.660
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

3412
02:32:45.690 --> 02:32:48.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people are appreciating </v>
<v Speaker 2>how hard that is.</v>

3413
02:32:48.290 --> 02:32:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like that other guy's in pain </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

3414
02:32:51.190 --> 02:32:56.190
<v Speaker 2>It's just kinda awesome poker face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he just got ate up with that kick </v>

3415
02:32:56.190 --> 02:32:56.670
<v Speaker 2>and then by the time a guy does start to</v>
<v Speaker 2>show it,</v>

3416
02:32:56.671 --> 02:32:57.150
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

3417
02:32:57.151 --> 02:32:59.190
<v Speaker 2>he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His legs are gone.</v>

3418
02:32:59.220 --> 02:33:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I've always wondered that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they just don't show it right </v>

3419
02:33:04.220 --> 02:33:04.220
<v Speaker 2>because that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3420
02:33:04.220 --> 02:33:04.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The toughest man in the world.</v>

3421
02:33:04.220 --> 02:33:04.620
<v Speaker 2>If in women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3422
02:33:04.621 --> 02:33:09.621
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody who was not trained got </v>

3423
02:33:09.621 --> 02:33:10.500
<v Speaker 2>kicked like that and like I want to feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it feels like in like,</v>

3424
02:33:10.501 --> 02:33:13.560
<v Speaker 2>you let someone like Tyron Woodley or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that UFC welterweight champion</v>

3425
02:33:13.561 --> 02:33:16.120
<v Speaker 2>let him lead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kick you like,</v>

3426
02:33:16.260 --> 02:33:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how do you think can be a real lift </v>

3427
02:33:21.260 --> 02:33:21.260
<v Speaker 2>your leg up and you check it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3428
02:33:21.260 --> 02:33:21.870
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3429
02:33:22.110 --> 02:33:23.540
<v Speaker 2>you would try it like they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit them,</v>

3430
02:33:23.541 --> 02:33:24.370
<v Speaker 2>meet their blood.</v>

3431
02:33:24.370 --> 02:33:29.370
<v Speaker 2>They could be trying to hit low too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a more recently I'm a </v>

3432
02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:34.600
<v Speaker 2>much more used tactic is the low leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>kick where they're attacking like </v>

3433
02:33:34.600 --> 02:33:34.600
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right above the ankle.</v>

3434
02:33:34.600 --> 02:33:37.110
<v Speaker 2>That's nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they clip right above the ankle with</v>

3435
02:33:37.111 --> 02:33:39.290
<v Speaker 2>your Shin and it just swells up real bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

3436
02:33:39.310 --> 02:33:40.710
<v Speaker 2>on a lot of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

3437
02:33:40.711 --> 02:33:43.830
<v Speaker 2>you don't really condition that area </v>
<v Speaker 2>like over low by the ankle,</v>

3438
02:33:44.130 --> 02:33:49.130
<v Speaker 2>but the thigh you can condition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take a few shots and then the </v>

3439
02:33:49.130 --> 02:33:49.130
<v Speaker 2>other thing you do is as the shots </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in,</v>

3440
02:33:49.130 --> 02:33:54.000
<v Speaker 2>you lift your leg up a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of turn your foot out and so the </v>

3441
02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:57.021
<v Speaker 2>idea is that your Shin and your thigh </v>
<v Speaker 2>take the brunt of the hit instead of </v>

3442
02:33:57.021 --> 02:33:58.920
<v Speaker 2>just the meat of the thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you help bone density or is that.</v>

3443
02:33:58.921 --> 02:33:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3444
02:33:59.180 --> 02:34:00.600
<v Speaker 2>it helps bone density.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually.</v>

3445
02:34:00.601 --> 02:34:04.800
<v Speaker 2>What it is is as you keep having impacts</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again,</v>

3446
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:10.190
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is there's a bunch of little </v>

3447
02:34:10.190 --> 02:34:10.190
<v Speaker 2>microfractures that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heel up and it gets harder.</v>

3448
02:34:10.190 --> 02:34:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a calcification that happens </v>

3449
02:34:14.690 --> 02:34:16.641
<v Speaker 2>because there's a lot of bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of those guys like if you </v>

3450
02:34:16.641 --> 02:34:16.680
<v Speaker 2>feel their shins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like Jesus Christ,</v>

3451
02:34:16.681 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a rock man,</v>

3452
02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:18.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3453
02:34:18.970 --> 02:34:23.970
<v Speaker 1>is a student pet is a bunch of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes that are fighting in more time </v>

3454
02:34:24.371 --> 02:34:29.020
<v Speaker 1>that can kick through baseball bats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super common,</v>

3455
02:34:29.021 --> 02:34:32.800
<v Speaker 1>like all those high level guys can most </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely kicked through a baseball bat.</v>

3456
02:34:32.801 --> 02:34:34.210
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious when you watch them do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

3457
02:34:34.211 --> 02:34:39.211
<v Speaker 1>because it looks so terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has just kicked critiquing another </v>

3458
02:34:39.211 --> 02:34:39.290
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like that's a dumb.</v>

3459
02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've made their shins so fucking hard</v>

3460
02:34:42.011 --> 02:34:47.011
<v Speaker 1>and they kicked so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can just smash right through </v>

3461
02:34:47.011 --> 02:34:49.291
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if a guy like that is kicking your </v>

3462
02:34:49.291 --> 02:34:49.291
<v Speaker 1>leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a nightmare.</v>

3463
02:34:49.291 --> 02:34:49.291
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3464
02:34:49.291 --> 02:34:51.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrible place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3465
02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I played football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when you talk about brain </v>

3466
02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:56.520
<v Speaker 1>injury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'm like,</v>

3467
02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:56.520
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I going to end up crazy?</v>

3468
02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Because I used to take so many hits to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the head.</v>

3469
02:34:57.400 --> 02:34:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

3470
02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I forget this gentleman's name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why I watched him do this.</v>

3471
02:35:02.690 --> 02:35:04.500
<v Speaker 1>He's warming up right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here it comes.</v>

3472
02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just snapped that baseball bat path.</v>

3473
02:35:11.210 --> 02:35:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Fuck all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget that guy's name.</v>

3474
02:35:14.811 --> 02:35:16.190
<v Speaker 1>He's a famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3475
02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:18.740
<v Speaker 1>see if he could get his name because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a famous.</v>

3476
02:35:18.741 --> 02:35:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3477
02:35:19.770 --> 02:35:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Melcher milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you say his name?</v>

3478
02:35:21.741 --> 02:35:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Melcher men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor I hope I'm saying his name right,</v>

3479
02:35:25.341 --> 02:35:30.341
<v Speaker 1>but he's a Moitai coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the seasons of the ultimate </v>

3480
02:35:30.341 --> 02:35:30.341
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early days,</v>

3481
02:35:30.341 --> 02:35:32.390
<v Speaker 1>but real respected a tie fighter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>coach.</v>

3482
02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:34.250
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of guys who could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3483
02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:37.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a real common move actually with </v>
<v Speaker 1>more tie fighters.</v>

3484
02:35:37.011 --> 02:35:38.990
<v Speaker 1>They kicked through baseball bats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another one.</v>

3485
02:35:38.991 --> 02:35:42.170
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a broken shinbone not for him,</v>

3486
02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:43.190
<v Speaker 1>for you and me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3487
02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:49.780
<v Speaker 1>This guy's going to kick through it </v>
<v Speaker 1>while he's got like a cord attached to </v>

3488
02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:49.780
<v Speaker 1>his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did a sports science.</v>

3489
02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got like,</v>

3490
02:35:50.690 --> 02:35:55.690
<v Speaker 1>look at this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why in the fuck dude?</v>

3491
02:35:56.490 --> 02:35:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Who was that same guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3492
02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:02.510
<v Speaker 1>so he doesn't all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's probably busted 100 bats.</v>

3493
02:36:03.170 --> 02:36:05.870
<v Speaker 1>If that guy kicks you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would hurt so bad.</v>

3494
02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

3495
02:36:07.450 --> 02:36:12.450
<v Speaker 1>It would have been one of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that's ever happened to you and </v>

3496
02:36:13.101 --> 02:36:15.530
<v Speaker 1>then everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like your basement flooding.</v>

3497
02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:20.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can you do when you don't have a </v>

3498
02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:20.560
<v Speaker 1>foot to stand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3499
02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:23.530
<v Speaker 1>you can't punch either you like your </v>
<v Speaker 1>punches or they become like these </v>

3500
02:36:23.530 --> 02:36:25.040
<v Speaker 1>windmill punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't pivot off your foot.</v>

3501
02:36:25.100 --> 02:36:27.350
<v Speaker 1>You know you can't place weight on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in agony.</v>

3502
02:36:27.380 --> 02:36:29.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like ready to give out and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't show it.</v>

3503
02:36:30.310 --> 02:36:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well a lot of them don't.</v>

3504
02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them have an awesome poker </v>

3505
02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:36.340
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it takes a while.</v>

3506
02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the hardest.</v>

3507
02:36:36.890 --> 02:36:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Probably the hardest sport to ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete in.</v>

3508
02:36:38.900 --> 02:36:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

3509
02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:41.800
<v Speaker 1>if it's not the hardest sport to compete</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3510
02:36:41.870 --> 02:36:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to know what is it's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of them because strengthened </v>

3511
02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:48.290
<v Speaker 1>durrance mental ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3512
02:36:48.291 --> 02:36:53.291
<v Speaker 1>you're basically a quarterback and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>running back and linebacker at the same </v>

3513
02:36:53.291 --> 02:36:57.011
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that I would think might </v>

3514
02:36:57.011 --> 02:36:59.090
<v Speaker 1>be harder to do is those ultra marathons</v>
<v Speaker 1>when those dudes are running,</v>

3515
02:36:59.091 --> 02:37:01.310
<v Speaker 1>like they were talking about the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot 200.</v>

3516
02:37:01.570 --> 02:37:04.250
<v Speaker 1>When those dudes are running 200 miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>over mountains,</v>

3517
02:37:04.850 --> 02:37:07.250
<v Speaker 1>that might be harder to do than an mma </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

3518
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Like if you thought of the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that could fight an MMA fight </v>

3519
02:37:12.670 --> 02:37:16.720
<v Speaker 1>versus the amount of people that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>run for eight hours in a row run 200,</v>

3520
02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:17.990
<v Speaker 1>five miles.</v>

3521
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.830
<v Speaker 1>How many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

3522
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's close.</v>

3523
02:37:21.470 --> 02:37:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Real close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are different things obviously </v>

3524
02:37:26.470 --> 02:37:26.470
<v Speaker 1>because one of them is dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting your ass kicked,</v>

3525
02:37:26.470 --> 02:37:29.120
<v Speaker 1>but the other one is dealing with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own demons,</v>

3526
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:33.420
<v Speaker 1>like your demons that wanting to quit </v>
<v Speaker 1>demon and the the.</v>

3527
02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:36.050
<v Speaker 1>How much did you prepare?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you prepare properly?</v>

3528
02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:38.030
<v Speaker 1>What about the discipline demon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3529
02:37:38.450 --> 02:37:43.450
<v Speaker 1>fuck off demon that tripped up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline demon and you didn't get in </v>

3530
02:37:43.450 --> 02:37:46.490
<v Speaker 1>good enough shape to really run 205 </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles and 78 hours,</v>

3531
02:37:46.610 --> 02:37:49.730
<v Speaker 1>which is just insane man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Versus self versus man versus man.</v>

3532
02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

3533
02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:53.060
<v Speaker 1>The white whale versus a war movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3534
02:37:53.110 --> 02:37:55.370
<v Speaker 1>it's like your golf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always say he played.</v>

3535
02:37:55.730 --> 02:37:57.260
<v Speaker 1>I've never played golf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like they say,</v>

3536
02:37:57.261 --> 02:37:59.480
<v Speaker 1>you play yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about.</v>

3537
02:37:59.530 --> 02:38:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

3538
02:38:00.231 --> 02:38:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3539
02:38:00.891 --> 02:38:01.760
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3540
02:38:01.761 --> 02:38:02.800
<v Speaker 1>you always get the shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3541
02:38:02.810 --> 02:38:04.920
<v Speaker 1>You get your own shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you set it up on the tee,</v>

3542
02:38:04.921 --> 02:38:06.320
<v Speaker 1>you get to whack it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move it around.</v>

3543
02:38:06.321 --> 02:38:07.970
<v Speaker 1>No one's knocking it out of the way for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3544
02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:10.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not like pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not like hiding the ball on you.</v>

3545
02:38:10.700 --> 02:38:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just uverse self 78 hours.</v>

3546
02:38:14.241 --> 02:38:16.820
<v Speaker 1>I can't fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be harder.</v>

3547
02:38:16.940 --> 02:38:19.600
<v Speaker 1>It might be harder than an MMA fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

3548
02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're resilient.</v>

3549
02:38:20.601 --> 02:38:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I just can't even picture being awake </v>
<v Speaker 1>that long.</v>

3550
02:38:22.460 --> 02:38:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Like I've been up for 40 hours and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to you definitely </v>

3551
02:38:27.460 --> 02:38:27.460
<v Speaker 1>hallucinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People hallucinate when they run,</v>

3552
02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:29.360
<v Speaker 1>when they run those races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3553
02:38:29.361 --> 02:38:34.361
<v Speaker 1>I was hearing that guy on your shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the one about the baby and </v>

3554
02:38:34.361 --> 02:38:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Everest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3555
02:38:34.371 --> 02:38:35.910
<v Speaker 1>That was my friend Ben O'brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3556
02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:40.040
<v Speaker 1>That was altitude sickness and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>altitude sickness and some sort of a,</v>

3557
02:38:40.041 --> 02:38:45.041
<v Speaker 1>a probably a stomach bug and the two of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them together and he was just tripping </v>

3558
02:38:45.591 --> 02:38:46.130
<v Speaker 1>balls.</v>

3559
02:38:46.190 --> 02:38:49.940
<v Speaker 1>He saw baby saw wolf that didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist like he was out of it.</v>

3560
02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:54.050
<v Speaker 1>I feel like like if people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>reacting to a giant baby that you see,</v>

3561
02:38:54.740 --> 02:38:59.740
<v Speaker 1>that would be the like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you guys don't see this giant </v>

3562
02:38:59.740 --> 02:39:00.200
<v Speaker 1>baby who'd feel like such a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot.</v>

3563
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:01.330
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

02:39:03.260 --> 02:39:08.260
<v Speaker 1>what do I do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that hits so many levels of primal </v>

<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like take care of the baby,</v>

<v Speaker 1>If you take.</v>

3572
02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to sit with the baby and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hello?</v>

3573
02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Anybody messing the baby's right here,</v>

<v Speaker 1>next to a baby with no memory.</v>

3586
02:40:04.290 --> 02:40:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not a good argument.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

3593
02:40:18.181 --> 02:40:23.181
<v Speaker 2>that's normal natural thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we get so freaked out when </v>

3594
02:40:23.181 --> 02:40:23.181
<v Speaker 2>someone leaves their kid in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

3595

3598
02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Like if I do like child abuse stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm like.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like probably got code.</v>

3607

3616
02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:20.700
<v Speaker 2>protects weakness where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't protect themselves.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If you have bare feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll go for your toes.</v>

3623
02:41:35.420 --> 02:41:37.030

<v Speaker 2>My brother Fed it chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a fucked up.</v>

3625

<v Speaker 2>fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got attacked by an ostrich.</v>

3629
02:41:52.340 --> 02:41:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was like an exaggerator I would say</v>

3630
02:41:54.301 --> 02:41:56.460
<v Speaker 2>to attack me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but definitely took a swing at me.</v>

3631
02:41:56.490 --> 02:41:57.990
<v Speaker 2>If you were a buzzfeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were attacked by.</v>

3632
02:41:57.991 --> 02:41:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Grabbed his neck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it came close enough where I had to do </v>

3635
02:42:06.100 --> 02:42:07.911
<v Speaker 2>listen and then push it away from me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get away from the fence and they try to </v>

<v Speaker 2>They're not a small animal.</v>

3640
02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:19.020
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting is they have red </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>

02:42:19.530 --> 02:42:24.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3642
02:42:24.530 --> 02:42:25.590
<v Speaker 2>at fuddruckers and they're quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>delicious and they're actually very high</v>

3643
02:42:25.591 --> 02:42:27.900
<v Speaker 2>in protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like much higher in protein I think than</v>

3644
02:42:27.901 --> 02:42:32.901
<v Speaker 2>beef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're up there with like wild </v>

3645
02:42:32.901 --> 02:42:32.901
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the neighborhood,</v>

3646
02:42:32.901 --> 02:42:32.901
<v Speaker 2>like maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

3647
02:42:32.901 --> 02:42:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like wild Mousse or something like that.</v>

3648
02:42:35.851 --> 02:42:40.851
<v Speaker 2>But in the neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like getting closer to that than it is </v>

3649
02:42:40.851 --> 02:42:43.191
<v Speaker 2>to like beef and it's a real lean but </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because it's like </v>

3650
02:42:43.191 --> 02:42:43.530
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3651
02:42:43.531 --> 02:42:46.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking dinosaur looking at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet and you think like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is gonna be like chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3653
02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:50.700
<v Speaker 2>it's not only chicken dogs red to red </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>

3654
02:42:51.430 --> 02:42:53.610
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy old raptor.</v>

3655
02:42:56.360 --> 02:42:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you think real ostrich Kent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A kangaroo.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The kangaroo.</v>

3658
02:43:02.821 --> 02:43:04.290

<v Speaker 2>because they'll choke you.</v>

3659
02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:10.160
<v Speaker 2>Kangaroos will choke you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus they sit back on their tail and </v>

<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3661
02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:12.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think an ostrich can fuck</v>

3662
02:43:12.190 --> 02:43:17.190
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ostrich is going to try to kick the </v>

<v Speaker 1>That kangaroo got all the fucking leaves</v>

3709
02:45:18.530 --> 02:45:23.530

<v Speaker 1>Birds need to step the fuck back and </v>

3710
02:45:23.530 --> 02:45:24.850
<v Speaker 1>respect the superiority of the mammal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on team Malmo.</v>

3711
02:45:24.851 --> 02:45:29.851
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people should all be lumped in </v>

3712
02:45:29.851 --> 02:45:30.370
<v Speaker 1>together as one unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's US versus them.</v>

3713
02:45:30.371 --> 02:45:32.690
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to mammals have </v>
<v Speaker 1>breastfeeding big.</v>

3714
02:45:33.900 --> 02:45:35.900
<v Speaker 1>The mammary gland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3715
02:45:35.950 --> 02:45:40.950
<v Speaker 1>If you have an egg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kid comes out of an egg the fuck </v>

3716
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:40.950
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get out of here.</v>

3717
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:40.950
<v Speaker 1>You're not part of the conversation.</v>

3718
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:44.140
<v Speaker 1>That's so old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like driving around and some sort</v>

3719
02:45:44.141 --> 02:45:49.141
<v Speaker 1>of a horse buggy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So literally they're hipsters.</v>

3720
02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife gave birth to an egg.</v>

3721
02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I sit on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

3722
02:45:56.080 --> 02:45:58.510
<v Speaker 1>just sit there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep that egg warm.</v>

3723
02:45:59.080 --> 02:46:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

3724
02:46:02.020 --> 02:46:07.020
<v Speaker 1>But if it was like the Pangolin yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penguins are like almost like throwing </v>

3725
02:46:07.020 --> 02:46:07.770
<v Speaker 1>the frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the Inbetween Bucher.</v>

3726
02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:12.800
<v Speaker 1>They fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to keep the baby on their </v>

3727
02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:12.800
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that they.</v>

3728
02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:14.370
<v Speaker 1>They put the baby up high on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

3729
02:46:14.390 --> 02:46:16.600
<v Speaker 1>it'll freeze if it touches the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3730
02:46:16.810 --> 02:46:19.280
<v Speaker 1>the environments that they're like smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

3731
02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:20.870
<v Speaker 1>that's like nature.</v>

<v Speaker 1>your contributions are really non </v>

3733
02:46:25.900 --> 02:46:25.900
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3734
02:46:25.900 --> 02:46:29.120
<v Speaker 1>We're barely accepting this model still </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

3735
02:46:29.150 --> 02:46:34.150
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for the Tuxedo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are out there essentially </v>

3736
02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:36.140

<v Speaker 1>their food for leopard seals.</v>

3737
02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:38.570
<v Speaker 1>That's their position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just keep.</v>

3738
02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Keep making those babies and keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding onto those eggs.</v>

3739
02:46:41.661 --> 02:46:42.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a niche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the dude has to take the egg and sit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>on his feet.</v>

3746
02:46:56.570 --> 02:46:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's got to protect it from the snow</v>

3747
02:46:58.371 --> 02:47:00.500
<v Speaker 1>on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The blizzard conditions.</v>

3748
02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:02.480

<v Speaker 1>See that's a male holding on to the egg </v>

3750
02:47:07.481 --> 02:47:08.360
<v Speaker 1>and then the babies are about to be born</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

3751
02:47:08.361 --> 02:47:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

3752
02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually what that is,</v>

3753
02:47:12.161 --> 02:47:13.940
<v Speaker 1>or modern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very modern birds.</v>

3754
02:47:14.030 --> 02:47:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Cute little fuckers too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because I'm a man doesn't mean I </v>

3755
02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:19.030
<v Speaker 1>can't sit on my fucking leg.</v>

3756
02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:22.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird because they're almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>defenseless is like nature saying no,</v>

3757
02:47:23.060 --> 02:47:24.410
<v Speaker 1>you can't even fly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

3758
02:47:24.470 --> 02:47:25.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to let you can.</v>

3759
02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3760
02:47:26.271 --> 02:47:28.010
<v Speaker 1>when you're on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't move fast.</v>

3761
02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:30.470
<v Speaker 1>We want you like lumbering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barely.</v>

3762
02:47:30.650 --> 02:47:35.650
<v Speaker 1>You have to give birth on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only time you can get away from </v>

3763
02:47:35.650 --> 02:47:36.530
<v Speaker 1>anything is when you're in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're rarely in the water,</v>

3764
02:47:36.531 --> 02:47:40.010
<v Speaker 1>so stay on the ground and be vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a walk.</v>

3765
02:47:40.011 --> 02:47:41.790
<v Speaker 1>It's so absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you played like a Tuba,</v>

3766
02:47:41.820 --> 02:47:43.060
<v Speaker 1>it's like a comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3767
02:47:43.070 --> 02:47:45.210
<v Speaker 1>This is not a penguin alive that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't beat in a race.</v>

3768
02:47:45.530 --> 02:47:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I can be drunk and I'll beat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3769
02:47:47.841 --> 02:47:49.430
<v Speaker 1>C'mon Pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ready?</v>

3770
02:47:49.460 --> 02:47:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

3771
02:47:50.241 --> 02:47:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're absurd animals because they have</v>

3772
02:47:53.661 --> 02:47:55.250
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do have predators though.</v>

3773
02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:57.500
<v Speaker 1>How come it's not just like they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiped out.</v>

3774
02:47:57.560 --> 02:47:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Leopard seals are.</v>

3775
02:47:59.650 --> 02:48:01.880
<v Speaker 1>They Jack them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can only eat so many.</v>

3776
02:48:02.270 --> 02:48:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Leopard seals are fucking huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3777
02:48:04.470 --> 02:48:07.310
<v Speaker 1>There's a leopard seal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed a photographer a few years back.</v>

3778
02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:13.120
<v Speaker 1>It was the first time ever is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is weird because they're </v>

3779
02:48:13.340 --> 02:48:14.900
<v Speaker 1>apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very intelligent too,</v>

3780
02:48:14.901 --> 02:48:19.901
<v Speaker 1>and they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've actually brought photographers </v>

3781
02:48:19.901 --> 02:48:19.901
<v Speaker 1>and divers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought them up,</v>

3782
02:48:19.901 --> 02:48:21.260
<v Speaker 1>seals till a sealer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a penguin,</v>

3783
02:48:21.890 --> 02:48:22.910
<v Speaker 1>not a seal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a penguin.</v>

3784
02:48:22.911 --> 02:48:27.911
<v Speaker 1>They'll kill a penguin and bring it over</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a photographer and try to like the </v>

3785
02:48:27.911 --> 02:48:27.911
<v Speaker 1>photographer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eat,</v>

3786
02:48:27.911 --> 02:48:27.911
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

3787
02:48:27.911 --> 02:48:32.760
<v Speaker 1>He was hungry and if like tried to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they've hung out with them for </v>

3788
02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:34.340
<v Speaker 1>days on end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really something amazing footage of</v>

3789
02:48:34.341 --> 02:48:36.000
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3790
02:48:36.380 --> 02:48:38.840
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they very,</v>

3791
02:48:38.841 --> 02:48:43.841
<v Speaker 1>very rarely attack people and that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only incident that I had ever heard </v>

3792
02:48:43.841 --> 02:48:45.140
<v Speaker 1>of where they had killed somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was pretty recent,</v>

3793
02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:47.860
<v Speaker 1>like within the last 10 years I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3794
02:48:48.350 --> 02:48:50.360
<v Speaker 1>They don't look real men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leopard seals.</v>

3795
02:48:50.420 --> 02:48:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen him?</v>

3796
02:48:51.230 --> 02:48:55.530
<v Speaker 1>That's one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please look at the teeth on that thing.</v>

3797
02:48:58.420 --> 02:49:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Look in the fucking teeth in that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that time she opened her mouth and </v>

3798
02:49:03.420 --> 02:49:05.440
<v Speaker 1>her head was twice as large as a grizzly</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears head.</v>

3799
02:49:05.770 --> 02:49:09.900
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how come when we were kids,</v>

3800

<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of that fucking thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is the leopard seal that was trying</v>

3802
02:49:16.861 --> 02:49:18.960
<v Speaker 1>to feed the photographer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the photographer.</v>

<v Speaker 1>outright,</v>

3847
02:51:22.201 --> 02:51:27.201
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the things they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been doing with Jordan Peterson and </v>

3848
02:51:27.201 --> 02:51:27.201
<v Speaker 1>recently it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

<v Speaker 1>about him and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Charlottesville and all these </v>

3851
02:51:34.281 --> 02:51:36.801
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd have him lump Jordan Peterson </v>

3852
02:51:36.801 --> 02:51:38.930
<v Speaker 1>have him lumped in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're actually not charlottesville </v>

3853

<v Speaker 1>They called them a far right.</v>

3855
02:51:41.851 --> 02:51:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not true.</v>

3856
02:51:43.250 --> 02:51:45.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not true when it also muddies the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

3857
02:51:45.061 --> 02:51:48.630
<v Speaker 1>So there's no meaning and they call them</v>
<v Speaker 1>outright like he's not all right.</v>

3858
02:51:49.140 --> 02:51:49.920
<v Speaker 1>He's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

3863
02:51:59.970 --> 02:52:04.770
<v Speaker 1>he's genuine and he has real concerns </v>
<v Speaker 1>about all these things.</v>

3864
02:52:04.771 --> 02:52:05.860
<v Speaker 1>And I think</v>

3865
02:52:06.130 --> 02:52:11.130
<v Speaker 2>very valid concerns in particular about </v>
<v Speaker 2>people wanting to enforce their ideas on</v>

3866
02:52:12.401 --> 02:52:17.401
<v Speaker 2>other people and make people behave a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way and there's a real </v>

3867
02:52:17.401 --> 02:52:18.100
<v Speaker 2>inclination that people have for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they really do.</v>

3868
02:52:18.460 --> 02:52:23.460
<v Speaker 2>And you're seeing that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlottesville mean part of the </v>

3869
02:52:23.460 --> 02:52:27.061
<v Speaker 2>reaction to all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reaction to all this stuff </v>

3870
02:52:27.061 --> 02:52:27.930
<v Speaker 2>is realizing that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

3871
02:52:27.940 --> 02:52:30.010
<v Speaker 2>this kind of thinking can exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3872
02:52:30.060 --> 02:52:35.060
<v Speaker 2>That this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit that you didn't expect to see </v>

3873
02:52:35.060 --> 02:52:38.430
<v Speaker 2>can just pop up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm almost thinking we have to see </v>

3874
02:52:38.430 --> 02:52:39.570
<v Speaker 2>it to know it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3875
02:52:39.580 --> 02:52:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Because I thought a lot of this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>

3876
02:52:41.170 --> 02:52:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Like I was fairly naive about it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3877
02:52:43.001 --> 02:52:43.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3878
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:46.390
<v Speaker 2>I hear people overuse these words all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and I'm like,</v>

3879
02:52:46.780 --> 02:52:47.770
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are gone.</v>

3880
02:52:47.771 --> 02:52:50.140
<v Speaker 2>We beat these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't even let them adopt highways,</v>

3881
02:52:50.560 --> 02:52:50.950
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3882
02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:52.870
<v Speaker 2>And then you call other people Nazis </v>
<v Speaker 2>that aren't,</v>

3883
02:52:52.871 --> 02:52:55.870
<v Speaker 2>that if fucks the whole thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a Nazi,</v>

3884
02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:58.260
<v Speaker 2>that's a Nazi right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are.</v>

3885
02:52:58.270 --> 02:53:01.180
<v Speaker 2>And you have to be able to identify it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also extremely,</v>

3886
02:53:01.260 --> 02:53:03.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shitty to,</v>

3887
02:53:03.580 --> 02:53:06.430
<v Speaker 2>to people that have been victims of </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual Nazis.</v>

3888
02:53:06.431 --> 02:53:07.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you're like,</v>

3889
02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:12.300
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a microbes like a microaggression at </v>

3890
02:53:12.300 --> 02:53:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Brown isn't my fucking grandmother and </v>
<v Speaker 2>an oven.</v>

3891
02:53:13.150 --> 02:53:15.040
<v Speaker 2>That's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

3892
02:53:15.041 --> 02:53:16.080
<v Speaker 2>too many don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3893
02:53:16.190 --> 02:53:18.250
<v Speaker 2>the problem is that it's an indefensible</v>
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>

3894
02:53:18.520 --> 02:53:20.290
<v Speaker 2>You call someone a Nazi and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>indefensible.</v>

3895
02:53:20.291 --> 02:53:22.510
<v Speaker 2>You put them on their back heels and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they have to deal with that.</v>

3896
02:53:22.570 --> 02:53:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what annoyed me about the right </v>

3897
02:53:27.570 --> 02:53:28.900
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid was a sinner or like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus because Jesus where it's like it's</v>

3898
02:53:28.901 --> 02:53:33.490
<v Speaker 2>a conversation ender and that's why I </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw almost that flip where now I see the</v>

3899
02:53:33.491 --> 02:53:35.770
<v Speaker 2>left doing it where it's like racist.</v>

3900
02:53:35.770 --> 02:53:36.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3901
02:53:36.461 --> 02:53:39.100
<v Speaker 2>we're arguing about like a proton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what does this even mean?</v>

3902
02:53:39.101 --> 02:53:40.870
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a way to end a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

3903
02:53:40.871 --> 02:53:42.250
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's starting to.</v>

3904
02:53:42.910 --> 02:53:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Starting to act like a religion where </v>

3905
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:49.791
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's like white guilt is original </v>

3906
02:53:49.791 --> 02:53:52.201
<v Speaker 2>sin and then being woke is baptism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>veganism is kosher and it starting to </v>

3907
02:53:52.201 --> 02:53:54.340
<v Speaker 2>align up Kurt Metzger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do love Kurt.</v>

3908
02:53:54.390 --> 02:53:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great Guy.</v>

3909
02:53:55.360 --> 02:53:58.450
<v Speaker 2>He grew up Jehovah's witness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

3910
02:53:58.451 --> 02:54:02.830
<v Speaker 2>he's super resistant to any like </v>
<v Speaker 2>enforced ideology and he was like,</v>

3911
02:54:02.831 --> 02:54:02.950
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3912
02:54:02.951 --> 02:54:03.100
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3913
02:54:03.101 --> 02:54:05.260
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell me what's right,</v>

3914
02:54:05.261 --> 02:54:07.300
<v Speaker 2>is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and right is left and left is right.</v>

3915
02:54:07.301 --> 02:54:08.500
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're doing.</v>

3916
02:54:08.530 --> 02:54:13.530
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this when I was a Jehovah's </v>

3917
02:54:13.530 --> 02:54:13.530
<v Speaker 2>witness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was like,</v>

3918
02:54:13.530 --> 02:54:16.441
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this enforcing this and in </v>

3919
02:54:16.441 --> 02:54:18.160
<v Speaker 2>silencing debate like there's.</v>

3920
02:54:18.210 --> 02:54:23.210
<v Speaker 2>There was one of the things that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about in the Google memo that I </v>

3921
02:54:23.210 --> 02:54:25.411
<v Speaker 2>thought was fascinating was that certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>subjects are too sacred to be discussed </v>

3922
02:54:25.411 --> 02:54:28.180
<v Speaker 2>and that that is one of them like gender</v>
<v Speaker 2>in tech.</v>

3923
02:54:28.570 --> 02:54:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Apparently I don't work in tech </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

3924
02:54:30.280 --> 02:54:33.670
<v Speaker 2>but in gender in specific like any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any women's issues,</v>

3925
02:54:33.671 --> 02:54:38.671
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to discuss them as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>man and a men's issue discussed by a </v>

3926
02:54:38.671 --> 02:54:41.370
<v Speaker 2>woman is like the thought of a woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to steal your money or come up,</v>

3927
02:54:41.630 --> 02:54:43.640
<v Speaker 2>she'll sneak your divorce laws are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3928
02:54:43.660 --> 02:54:48.660
<v Speaker 2>we don't want anybody having any opinion</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever about a side of.</v>

3929
02:54:48.911 --> 02:54:53.911
<v Speaker 2>They're not on that list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It limits growth and it's the opposite </v>

3930
02:54:53.911 --> 02:54:53.911
<v Speaker 2>of science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like scientists.</v>

3931
02:54:53.911 --> 02:54:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Science is skepticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is ask why until you hit</v>

3932
02:54:56.831 --> 02:55:01.831
<v Speaker 2>a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it isn't like to not address </v>

3933
02:55:01.831 --> 02:55:02.980
<v Speaker 2>this and people get labeled toxic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just kicked out toxic.</v>

3934
02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:07.280
<v Speaker 2>A dumb one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toxic masculinity and by the way,</v>

3935
02:55:07.281 --> 02:55:12.281
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of women that are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary psychologists that know a </v>

3936
02:55:12.281 --> 02:55:12.800
<v Speaker 2>shitload more about men than even men </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

3937
02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:13.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3938
02:55:13.730 --> 02:55:18.730
<v Speaker 2>sure they do and you got to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them if they're explaining the actual </v>

3939
02:55:18.730 --> 02:55:21.710
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary mechanisms that have caused</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings to behave a certain way and</v>

3940
02:55:21.711 --> 02:55:26.711
<v Speaker 2>why more men are inclined to favor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific activities and you look at all </v>

3941
02:55:26.711 --> 02:55:30.311
<v Speaker 2>the different numbers and variables that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could look at in terms of like how </v>

3942
02:55:30.311 --> 02:55:30.680
<v Speaker 2>many more men die on the job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many more men picked,</v>

3943
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:35.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult job and also like this weird </v>

3944
02:55:35.950 --> 02:55:38.621
<v Speaker 2>thing that we're doing where we're like </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to pretend that things are </v>

3945
02:55:38.621 --> 02:55:39.980
<v Speaker 2>different than they really are to sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of support your point better.</v>

3946
02:55:40.150 --> 02:55:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Like that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people do with the gender pay gap,</v>

3947
02:55:42.261 --> 02:55:42.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3948
02:55:42.680 --> 02:55:43.610
<v Speaker 2>There was one to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3949
02:55:43.611 --> 02:55:46.690
<v Speaker 2>the gender pay gap shows is real </v>
<v Speaker 2>prejudice between men went,</v>

3950
02:55:46.691 --> 02:55:46.930
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3951
02:55:46.931 --> 02:55:51.931
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not what it shows it all kind of </v>

3952
02:55:51.931 --> 02:55:53.351
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shows that women and men choose </v>

3953
02:55:53.351 --> 02:55:55.031
<v Speaker 2>different jobs and and when I told a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good buddy of mine that he didn't </v>

3954
02:55:55.031 --> 02:55:55.031
<v Speaker 2>believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

3955
02:55:55.031 --> 02:55:56.420
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the gender pay gap is.</v>

3956
02:55:56.421 --> 02:55:56.990
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3957
02:55:56.991 --> 02:55:59.690
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was like men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women and men doing the same job and the</v>

3958
02:55:59.691 --> 02:56:01.250
<v Speaker 2>woman makes seventy seven cents on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar.</v>

3959
02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:01.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3960
02:56:01.970 --> 02:56:03.290
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be horrible.</v>

3961
02:56:03.291 --> 02:56:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what it is.</v>

3962
02:56:04.370 --> 02:56:09.370
<v Speaker 2>They choose different jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at men and women doing the same </v>

3963
02:56:09.370 --> 02:56:09.890
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference is very small and when he</v>

3964
02:56:09.891 --> 02:56:11.900
<v Speaker 2>found that he was angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

3965
02:56:12.290 --> 02:56:14.330
<v Speaker 2>are you fucking serious to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got pissed.</v>

3966
02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:19.360
<v Speaker 2>You get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get mad because you hear the </v>

3967
02:56:19.360 --> 02:56:20.771
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>President Obama was talking about that </v>

3968
02:56:20.771 --> 02:56:20.771
<v Speaker 2>on television.</v>

3969
02:56:20.771 --> 02:56:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Surely someone must have alerted him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

3970
02:56:21.620 --> 02:56:23.570
<v Speaker 2>President,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is disingenuous line of,</v>

3971
02:56:23.571 --> 02:56:24.140
<v Speaker 2>thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

3972
02:56:24.230 --> 02:56:25.510
<v Speaker 2>President.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is nonsense.</v>

3973
02:56:25.511 --> 02:56:30.511
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they took every man and woman </v>

3974
02:56:30.511 --> 02:56:32.030
<v Speaker 2>and just put a line at the 50th </v>
<v Speaker 2>percentile and anyone who knows anything</v>

3975
02:56:32.031 --> 02:56:33.440
<v Speaker 2>about math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's insane.</v>

3976
02:56:33.930 --> 02:56:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Like there's so many factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the factor of having a child.</v>

3977
02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like so then you quit for 10 years,</v>

3978
02:56:38.751 --> 02:56:40.190
<v Speaker 2>you come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to make less money.</v>

3979
02:56:40.191 --> 02:56:43.400
<v Speaker 2>That all goes into the pay gap thing or </v>
<v Speaker 2>if he even quit for a few months.</v>

3980
02:56:43.401 --> 02:56:44.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3981
02:56:44.210 --> 02:56:46.370
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time that you have to take off,</v>

3982
02:56:46.371 --> 02:56:50.060
<v Speaker 2>that's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then women work less frequent hours.</v>

3983
02:56:50.061 --> 02:56:51.900
<v Speaker 2>They work less hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether they,</v>

3984
02:56:51.910 --> 02:56:55.280
<v Speaker 2>they take less overtime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that they're not just as</v>

3985
02:56:55.281 --> 02:56:57.620
<v Speaker 2>good at a job as a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a job?</v>

3986
02:56:57.621 --> 02:57:02.621
<v Speaker 2>It just means that overall they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably going to earn less money in </v>

3987
02:57:02.621 --> 02:57:02.621
<v Speaker 2>that sort of scenario.</v>

3988
02:57:02.621 --> 02:57:03.950
<v Speaker 2>They choose different jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they work less hours.</v>

3989
02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:06.770
<v Speaker 2>That's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that that's the,</v>

3990
02:57:07.040 --> 02:57:12.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't get some sort of </v>

3991
02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:13.271
<v Speaker 2>discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to be a chick work with </v>

3992
02:57:13.271 --> 02:57:13.271
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to be that.</v>

3993
02:57:13.271 --> 02:57:14.750
<v Speaker 2>That's a different argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think women working with.</v>

3994
02:57:14.751 --> 02:57:15.920
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there'll be terrible,</v>

3995
02:57:15.921 --> 02:57:18.380
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're attractive women,</v>

3996
02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:23.620
<v Speaker 2>you've got to work with like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>dickheads at some stupid fucking ups </v>

3997
02:57:23.620 --> 02:57:24.560
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet it sucks.</v>

3998
02:57:24.710 --> 02:57:29.710
<v Speaker 2>I bet those guys are annoying as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say stupid shit about you behind </v>

3999
02:57:29.710 --> 02:57:29.710
<v Speaker 2>your back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4000
02:57:29.710 --> 02:57:32.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a different argument.</v>

4001
02:57:32.240 --> 02:57:33.380
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

4002
02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:34.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4003
02:57:34.731 --> 02:57:37.220
<v Speaker 2>we're not saying that there's not some </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination.</v>

4004
02:57:37.221 --> 02:57:42.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not saying that that's </v>

4005
02:57:42.221 --> 02:57:45.431
<v Speaker 2>happening in tech to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why there's 10 men and </v>

4006
02:57:45.711 --> 02:57:46.850
<v Speaker 2>for women that's not.</v>

4007
02:57:46.940 --> 02:57:49.670
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't necessarily make sense and </v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you do that,</v>

4008
02:57:49.671 --> 02:57:51.290
<v Speaker 2>like what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equality of outcome.</v>

4009
02:57:51.550 --> 02:57:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the perfect way to describe it.</v>

4010
02:57:53.300 --> 02:57:53.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it it,</v>

4011
02:57:53.970 --> 02:57:57.710
<v Speaker 2>it guarantees that you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a problem and it also the biggest victim</v>

4012
02:57:57.711 --> 02:58:02.711
<v Speaker 2>or women that feel like they have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a CEO and a mom to be like normal and </v>

4013
02:58:03.541 --> 02:58:08.541
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's an impossible position </v>
<v Speaker 2>to put somebody in where it's like if </v>

4014
02:58:08.541 --> 02:58:10.560
<v Speaker 2>your instinct wants a child but you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to slip at work at all,</v>

4015
02:58:10.561 --> 02:58:12.940
<v Speaker 2>it's like dude workings for pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4016
02:58:13.050 --> 02:58:16.050
<v Speaker 2>my wife made life with her body and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

4017
02:58:16.260 --> 02:58:17.190
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do the funny bone.</v>

4018
02:58:17.191 --> 02:58:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Here's more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4019
02:58:19.260 --> 02:58:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also could see it from the point </v>

4020
02:58:24.260 --> 02:58:24.260
<v Speaker 2>of view from a woman who doesn't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>that new law.</v>

4021
02:58:24.260 --> 02:58:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Of course I'm just talking probability </v>
<v Speaker 2>just effect.</v>

4022
02:58:26.130 --> 02:58:28.320
<v Speaker 2>They have a womb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is gonna Affect Profitability,</v>

4023
02:58:28.580 --> 02:58:29.940
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's one percent.</v>

4024
02:58:29.941 --> 02:58:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if it's one percent,</v>

4025
02:58:31.410 --> 02:58:35.940
<v Speaker 2>I would never tell a woman that she has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have kids or not pursue any life that</v>

4026
02:58:35.941 --> 02:58:37.410
<v Speaker 2>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>

4027
02:58:37.630 --> 02:58:39.210
<v Speaker 2>Why don't think anybody should tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody what to do.</v>

4028
02:58:39.270 --> 02:58:40.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole point of all this,</v>

4029
02:58:41.190 --> 02:58:45.460
<v Speaker 2>but I think we should also stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretending that there's not some sort of</v>

4030
02:58:45.461 --> 02:58:48.630
<v Speaker 2>a meritocracy going on when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>most corporations,</v>

4031
02:58:48.660 --> 02:58:50.310
<v Speaker 2>most jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4032
02:58:50.311 --> 02:58:52.710
<v Speaker 2>whatever discrimination that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

4033
02:58:52.711 --> 02:58:57.711
<v Speaker 2>I really hope that gets routed out so we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can concentrate on what's important and </v>

4034
02:58:57.711 --> 02:59:01.150
<v Speaker 2>what's important is people finding </v>
<v Speaker 2>something they enjoy and doing it </v>

4035
02:59:01.150 --> 02:59:01.150
<v Speaker 2>without discrimination and doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>without,</v>

4036
02:59:01.490 --> 02:59:06.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having to deal with too much resistance </v>

4037
02:59:06.490 --> 02:59:06.490
<v Speaker 2>from the people that you're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

4038
02:59:06.490 --> 02:59:06.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

4039
02:59:06.490 --> 02:59:06.490
<v Speaker 2>that's a harmonious life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4040
02:59:06.490 --> 02:59:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Find something you love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find some sort of a path of least </v>

4041
02:59:11.240 --> 02:59:14.181
<v Speaker 2>resistance to get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can really enjoy it and participate </v>

4042
02:59:14.181 --> 02:59:14.181
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully with likeminded people.</v>

4043
02:59:14.550 --> 02:59:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things that I've always </v>
<v Speaker 2>been really happy about the store and </v>

4044
02:59:19.550 --> 02:59:20.050
<v Speaker 2>about standup comedy in general is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

4045
02:59:20.060 --> 02:59:25.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a brotherhood and a sisterhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when Whitney Cummings comes around </v>

4046
02:59:25.060 --> 02:59:28.401
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's as much my brother or sister as </v>

4047
02:59:28.401 --> 02:59:31.910
<v Speaker 2>any of the other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Andrew Santina was one of these </v>

4048
02:59:31.910 --> 02:59:31.910
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

4049
02:59:31.910 --> 02:59:34.871
<v Speaker 2>we're a family there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course there's not a whole lot of us </v>

4050
02:59:34.871 --> 02:59:38.180
<v Speaker 2>is very few and if you get through and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're funny if you're Sarah Silverman </v>

4051
02:59:38.180 --> 02:59:38.370
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>name that personally you're treated with</v>

4052
02:59:38.371 --> 02:59:39.870
<v Speaker 2>the same amount of respect that guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

4053
02:59:39.930 --> 02:59:44.930
<v Speaker 2>at least I would hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in the circles are the people </v>

4054
02:59:44.930 --> 02:59:44.930
<v Speaker 2>that I enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are.</v>

4055
02:59:44.930 --> 02:59:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least you're,</v>

4056
02:59:44.930 --> 02:59:49.801
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you were held up to the same </v>

4057
02:59:49.801 --> 02:59:49.801
<v Speaker 2>standards as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4058
02:59:49.801 --> 02:59:52.200
<v Speaker 2>and you're also like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you ask people like who's funny?</v>

4059
02:59:52.640 --> 02:59:54.000
<v Speaker 2>The we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we like funny people,</v>

4060
02:59:54.380 --> 02:59:55.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you say like,</v>

4061
02:59:56.010 --> 03:00:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see Sarah do said in the main </v>

4062
03:00:01.010 --> 03:00:01.010
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

4063
03:00:01.010 --> 03:00:01.780
<v Speaker 2>the fucking crush dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people tell you in sight,</v>

4064
03:00:01.990 --> 03:00:06.990
<v Speaker 2>there's no sexism when it comes to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a total results based appreciations</v>

4065
03:00:07.560 --> 03:00:08.100
<v Speaker 2>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4066
03:00:08.101 --> 03:00:09.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like fighting and comedies the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

4067
03:00:09.811 --> 03:00:14.811
<v Speaker 2>The stakes are so high you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you develop a no nonsense vibe where </v>

4068
03:00:14.811 --> 03:00:14.811
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

4069
03:00:14.811 --> 03:00:19.551
<v Speaker 2>bombing sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I can't say like I have to just </v>

4070
03:00:19.551 --> 03:00:20.220
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what joke is funny,</v>

4071
03:00:20.221 --> 03:00:22.380
<v Speaker 2>like I can't do the nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like with fighting,</v>

4072
03:00:22.381 --> 03:00:27.240
<v Speaker 2>it's like well if you commit to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo and not do the full package of</v>

4073
03:00:27.241 --> 03:00:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu and all that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're at a disadvantage.</v>

4074
03:00:29.880 --> 03:00:34.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's like that all like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That identity can hurt you if you don't </v>

4075
03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:35.640
<v Speaker 2>branch out into like what works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

4076
03:00:35.641 --> 03:00:36.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know shit about fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

4077
03:00:36.871 --> 03:00:41.871
<v Speaker 2>but I've just heard you talk about like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it just that well rounded grappling and </v>

4078
03:00:41.871 --> 03:00:46.101
<v Speaker 2>striking and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the stakes are so high that you </v>

4079
03:00:46.101 --> 03:00:49.341
<v Speaker 2>can't really be nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only other option is going to be a </v>

4080
03:00:49.341 --> 03:00:51.540
<v Speaker 2>specialist at such a high level that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>better than everybody else at one thing.</v>

4081
03:00:51.980 --> 03:00:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Like you get with this Guy Damien Maia </v>
<v Speaker 2>who just last actually two guys more </v>

4082
03:00:57.241 --> 03:01:01.060
<v Speaker 2>well rounded ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's been able to beat so many world</v>

4083
03:01:01.061 --> 03:01:03.340
<v Speaker 2>class fighters just because he's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing at Jujitsu.</v>

4084
03:01:03.341 --> 03:01:08.341
<v Speaker 2>It gets a hold of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drags him to the ground and either </v>

4085
03:01:08.341 --> 03:01:10.651
<v Speaker 2>strangles them or it gets really close </v>
<v Speaker 2>to strangle them to the point where he </v>

4086
03:01:10.651 --> 03:01:10.651
<v Speaker 2>dominates all the exchanges.</v>

4087
03:01:10.651 --> 03:01:14.580
<v Speaker 2>He's done that with like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you beat six or seven guys in a </v>

4088
03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:16.240
<v Speaker 2>row and really good guys by really </v>
<v Speaker 2>Carlos Condit,</v>

4089
03:01:16.241 --> 03:01:18.460
<v Speaker 2>former interim welterweight champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strangled them,</v>

4090
03:01:18.470 --> 03:01:19.580
<v Speaker 2>got them on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>choked him out.</v>

4091
03:01:19.930 --> 03:01:21.790
<v Speaker 2>So it's like there's a few guys that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>

4092
03:01:21.791 --> 03:01:23.740
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part you've got to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do everything.</v>

4093
03:01:24.130 --> 03:01:25.120
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4094
03:01:25.420 --> 03:01:29.890
<v Speaker 2>if you have blind spots when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like things that you,</v>

4095
03:01:30.820 --> 03:01:32.540
<v Speaker 2>if you're like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a,</v>

4096
03:01:32.930 --> 03:01:37.930
<v Speaker 2>you have a blind spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blind spot is you don't respect </v>

4097
03:01:37.930 --> 03:01:37.930
<v Speaker 2>women or you have a blind spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

4098
03:01:37.930 --> 03:01:39.670
<v Speaker 2>you don't like black people or you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like gay people.</v>

4099
03:01:39.671 --> 03:01:41.100
<v Speaker 2>If you have a real blind spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a real,</v>

4100
03:01:41.410 --> 03:01:43.750
<v Speaker 2>that's going to emanate through all your</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

4101
03:01:43.780 --> 03:01:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna fuck up your logic and how </v>

4102
03:01:48.780 --> 03:01:51.361
<v Speaker 2>you look at anything that happens in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world that you tried to turn it into a </v>

4103
03:01:51.361 --> 03:01:52.300
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that prejudice thinking like if you,</v>

4104
03:01:52.330 --> 03:01:56.470
<v Speaker 2>if you think you have that kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid hate and anger or resentment,</v>

4105
03:01:56.680 --> 03:02:01.680
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we not thinking clearly you're going to </v>

4106
03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:04.191
<v Speaker 2>miss things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not gonna be as good as you want </v>

4107
03:02:04.191 --> 03:02:04.300
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be at your best.</v>

4108
03:02:04.700 --> 03:02:08.480
<v Speaker 3>That's why I do a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't they laugh for like,</v>

4109
03:02:08.481 --> 03:02:09.680
<v Speaker 3>I literally just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

4110
03:02:09.800 --> 03:02:11.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't always do it because I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>always on the road,</v>

4111
03:02:11.931 --> 03:02:16.931
<v Speaker 3>but I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just show bombs and just almost </v>

4112
03:02:16.931 --> 03:02:16.940
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like sports where I'm like,</v>

4113
03:02:16.941 --> 03:02:21.941
<v Speaker 3>why didn't that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it motivated me to try shit a lot </v>

4114
03:02:21.941 --> 03:02:22.040
<v Speaker 3>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4115
03:02:22.041 --> 03:02:25.250
<v Speaker 3>I got an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta want to do another hour.</v>

4116
03:02:25.280 --> 03:02:27.050
<v Speaker 3>So let's make it fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That like,</v>

4117
03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:28.100
<v Speaker 3>I get to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4118
03:02:28.101 --> 03:02:29.900
<v Speaker 3>this one was on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I rushed this one,</v>

4119
03:02:30.830 --> 03:02:33.710
<v Speaker 3>this tag offended Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4120
03:02:33.711 --> 03:02:37.190
<v Speaker 3>like shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where it's humbling to re listen to</v>

4121
03:02:37.191 --> 03:02:40.010
<v Speaker 3>yourself and show up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I did a documentary,</v>

4122
03:02:40.011 --> 03:02:45.011
<v Speaker 3>60 minutes and seven days where I wrote </v>
<v Speaker 3>a new hour and a week just to remember </v>

4123
03:02:45.171 --> 03:02:45.850
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4124
03:02:45.970 --> 03:02:47.600
<v Speaker 3>that a few years back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right when you're out here.</v>

4125
03:02:47.890 --> 03:02:50.810
<v Speaker 3>My wife was pregnant so I was like maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>two years maybe.</v>

4126
03:02:51.110 --> 03:02:55.430
<v Speaker 3>And so it would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch me just struggle,</v>

4127
03:02:55.700 --> 03:02:58.880
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I maybe got 15 minutes out of it,</v>

4128
03:02:58.881 --> 03:03:01.490
<v Speaker 3>but it was just like heavy bag were </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing though.</v>

4129
03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:03.260
<v Speaker 3>You got 15 minutes and that short of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

4130
03:03:03.261 --> 03:03:06.590
<v Speaker 3>like how long would it take you to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>15 minutes in a normal time.</v>

4131
03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:10.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean if I'm in the wrong mindset like </v>
<v Speaker 3>we discussed that could do that for 3:30</v>

4132
03:03:10.581 --> 03:03:11.810
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see guys do that,</v>

4133
03:03:12.060 --> 03:03:14.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in the mindset of like,</v>

4134
03:03:14.900 --> 03:03:17.270
<v Speaker 3>oh this work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm just going to do that.</v>

4135
03:03:17.271 --> 03:03:19.310
<v Speaker 3>But if you're in the growth mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

4136
03:03:19.640 --> 03:03:21.350
<v Speaker 3>because I love doing new shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4137
03:03:21.530 --> 03:03:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it interesting like you coming </v>

4138
03:03:26.530 --> 03:03:26.530
<v Speaker 3>from a music background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know you've been playing piano,</v>

4139
03:03:26.530 --> 03:03:27.860
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as you can remember,</v>

4140
03:03:28.100 --> 03:03:30.260
<v Speaker 3>that requires practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4141
03:03:30.261 --> 03:03:31.610
<v Speaker 3>It requires 10 hours a day.</v>

4142
03:03:31.620 --> 03:03:36.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be dedicated and sit down a </v>

4143
03:03:36.620 --> 03:03:38.411
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is one of the major things that </v>

4144
03:03:38.411 --> 03:03:38.510
<v Speaker 3>comedians lack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't practice.</v>

4145
03:03:38.570 --> 03:03:39.620
<v Speaker 3>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4146
03:03:40.090 --> 03:03:41.930
<v Speaker 3>We don't sit down and go over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>

4147
03:03:41.931 --> 03:03:46.931
<v Speaker 3>We don't listen to the old recordings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I forced myself into doing </v>

4148
03:03:46.931 --> 03:03:50.561
<v Speaker 3>that just four or five times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just forced myself for an hour at a </v>

4149
03:03:50.561 --> 03:03:50.561
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a giant accomplishment,</v>

4150
03:03:50.561 --> 03:03:54.590
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it hurts to listen to old sets</v>

4151
03:03:54.591 --> 03:03:57.110
<v Speaker 3>like oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the mistakes.</v>

4152
03:03:57.140 --> 03:03:58.970
<v Speaker 3>And like even when you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4153
03:03:58.971 --> 03:04:03.971
<v Speaker 3>there was a crazy bomb in that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to make for a great episode </v>

4154
03:04:03.971 --> 03:04:05.270
<v Speaker 3>and then like my instincts are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to relive that man.</v>

4155
03:04:06.700 --> 03:04:08.030
<v Speaker 3>That's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where I party.</v>

4156
03:04:08.031 --> 03:04:08.640
<v Speaker 3>Like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

4157
03:04:08.710 --> 03:04:12.590
<v Speaker 3>I got spit on on Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't make a video about that.</v>

4158
03:04:12.620 --> 03:04:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that video and it was like,</v>

4159
03:04:17.260 --> 03:04:22.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a strong instinct of me to put </v>

4160
03:04:22.260 --> 03:04:25.151
<v Speaker 3>out my best shit all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like part of me also wants to be </v>

4161
03:04:25.151 --> 03:04:26.290
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This also happens,</v>

4162
03:04:27.420 --> 03:04:29.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even like Shit,</v>

4163
03:04:29.740 --> 03:04:30.910

<v Speaker 3>like Beethoven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my blinkers on with like with like </v>

<v Speaker 3>why didn't they laugh?</v>

4166
03:04:38.930 --> 03:04:43.930
<v Speaker 3>People are in India.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just decide somewhere along the </v>

4167
03:04:43.930 --> 03:04:43.930
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want this guy.</v>

4168
03:04:43.930 --> 03:04:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>street?</v>

4173
03:04:56.120 --> 03:04:58.190
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the city once I walked out in a suit and</v>

4174
03:04:58.191 --> 03:05:00.990
<v Speaker 3>someone yelled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>faggot before I said one word woe.</v>

<v Speaker 3>faggot at ya.</v>

4179
03:05:10.850 --> 03:05:13.700
<v Speaker 3>And they paid to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called systemic oppression.</v>

4180
03:05:14.110 --> 03:05:16.850
<v Speaker 3>Just any other job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would never be insane.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just people throw shit at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4182
03:05:18.640 --> 03:05:20.300

<v Speaker 3>A school teacher did.</v>

4183

<v Speaker 3>That's a lyric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were throwing tomatoes in my face</v>

4187
03:05:28.850 --> 03:05:31.580

<v Speaker 3>I learned to mock what people have pride</v>

4188
03:05:31.581 --> 03:05:33.410
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not what is where.</v>

4189
03:05:33.440 --> 03:05:36.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like a 400 pound man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fatness doesn't matter.</v>

4190
03:05:36.681 --> 03:05:40.250
<v Speaker 3>Someone 10 pounds overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will crush him.</v>
