00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.180
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people believe it's a</v>

2
00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:06.150
<v Speaker 1>controlled demolition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think necessarily she is saying</v>

3
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>that it is or it isn't and I certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>am not.</v>

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

5
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>You know what I believe more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a controlled demolition.</v>

6
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with it by us.</v>

7
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

8
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that's always been the</v>

9
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>case of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The argument,</v>

10
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>they don't think it was done by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists.</v>

11
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.170
<v Speaker 1>They think see building the tear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

12
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if the terrorists.</v>

13
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did a controlled demolition.</v>

14
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like if somehow they had.</v>

15
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Because terrace probably could easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would probably be before</v>

16
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>hijacking planes and flying them into</v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings before that would be putting a</v>

17
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:40.520
<v Speaker 1>bomb into building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

18
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

19
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>like when will you see what happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma City that was multiple bombs?</v>

20
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Oklahoma City they actually,</v>

21
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>there was all these reports of the FBI</v>
<v Speaker 1>removing bombs from the building like</v>

22
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>that didn't explode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you talk to these guys that are</v>

23
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>demolition experts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say there's no way.</v>

24
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>That was a fertilizer bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking way.</v>

25
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>They said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the amount of damage that</v>

26
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>did and look at where the blast radius</v>
<v Speaker 1>is from the way it blows out,</v>

27
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't blow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not designed to.</v>

28
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>You're saying this building because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've all seen the loose change where</v>

29
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>you watch the lights go off around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>building one floor by one.</v>

30
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

31
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>but see they don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what that means though.</v>

32
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>That also could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the ceiling is coming in and slamming</v>

33
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>into the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the windows would do that.</v>

34
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>They don't know that that's explosions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it really was collapsing like that.</v>

35
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>See no one's ever seen a building</v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed like that.</v>

36
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>So when they say that those are blips</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are squibs,</v>

37
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that because then you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying you know for sure what</v>

38
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 1>that is and I'm saying the fuck you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

39
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Even though there's just because someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to know.</v>

40
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it was as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it was an inside job.</v>

41
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 1>It just seems odd ergonomically that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would design a building that if impacted</v>

42
00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>at a certain point the entire thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>would demolish.</v>

43
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Like what structurally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What purpose does that serve?</v>

44
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

45
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weird.</v>

46
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could just be in competence.</v>

47
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at humans,</v>

48
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>that's our most likely option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean when did they make the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>trade center so fucking long ass time</v>

50
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:15.820
<v Speaker 1>ago to get so cocky to build a building</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 100 God damn stories high.</v>

51
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>And how long did they think that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna stay up there for you know,</v>

52
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>what if it started falling apart in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rotting,</v>

53
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just so just a wonky piece of</v>

54
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 1>shit by the time I got hit by those</v>
<v Speaker 1>planes.</v>

55
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>That's totally true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean fucking thing was oldest shit.</v>

56
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 1>That thing was around as black and white</v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

57
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Jessica Lange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>King Kong.</v>

58
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

59
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>but what's retrofitting the cheapest</v>
<v Speaker 1>goddamn floor and the cheapest guy.</v>

60
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>A bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that to do that.</v>

61
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.490
<v Speaker 1>How many floors was treated with bombs</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe?</v>

62
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the crazy idea.</v>

63
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>What we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're saying about a building seven</v>

64
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>or or the other building that terrorists</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have done it.</v>

65
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess they could have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how the fuck are they going to get</v>

66
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>in there and put all those explosives</v>
<v Speaker 1>in?</v>

67
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like dynamite up a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those red sticks of dynamite.</v>

68
00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>One tying up your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're working the fucking thing.</v>

69
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Five years everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking putting it into this closet.</v>

70
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back then they didn't have security</v>

71
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>department sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're walking down the hallway and you</v>

72
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>just smell shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Open this door.</v>

73
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>What's in this smells like shit and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>says shitty dynamite sticks.</v>

74
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fucking log house built with</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit dynamite sticks and little hairs.</v>

75
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>A Cat pee mattress.</v>
