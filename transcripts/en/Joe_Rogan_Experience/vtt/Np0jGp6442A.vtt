WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.740
And boom,
we're live.
You're here.
Thanks.

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.590
We're not a wolf tee shirt on nonetheless.
Yes.
And do Lawrence,

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.170
you know,
is that what it is?
Yeah.
Something I bought it this morning.

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.470
It's an after Lakota Indians in the vantage beach,
Venice beach,

5
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:24.000
Lakota Indians.
They're probably not legit it probably Pakistan or something.

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.190
Oh yeah,
yeah,
probably.
But uh,
the symbol

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.730
<v 1>lysis and deliverance but not,
you know,</v>

8
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.150
not physical endurance though I a dead stuff,

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.030
but a more a like a believing

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.420
<v 0>you have a very fascinating life,</v>

11
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.360
my friend and you have done some amazing things.
I,

12
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.960
I've been paying attention to you for last couple of months,
uh,
pretty,

13
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:49.980
pretty intensely.
And leading up to this podcast,
I've been researching you a lot.

14
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.960
And uh,
first of all,
I want to know how did all this get started?

15
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:56.510
For people who don't know who you are,
you've,

16
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.130
you've accomplished a ton of world records.

17
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.560
You've endured things that most people think may be physically impossible.

18
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:05.790
You proven their possible,

19
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.440
you've shown that you can alter your immune system on demand.
You can,

20
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.470
you can regulate levels of stress hormones that people thought were and unable

21
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:20.640
to be controlled by the human mind that we're autonomous.

22
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.250
And you're doing this all like on your own.

23
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:25.320
I've never heard of anybody else doing this.
First of all,

24
00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:29.280
how did you get started in this and what led you to this?

25
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.190
<v 1>Yes.
Um,</v>

26
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.700
like Manny probably I was in a solar search and uh,

27
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.360
I visited many a country's traditions,

28
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:45.530
languages as a terrorist disciplines and l two,
like you,
you know,

29
00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:48.250
karate and Kung Fu and a yoga,

30
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.900
but also the [inaudible],
the Sufi Buddhism,
uh,

31
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:56.390
all kinds of traditions and disciplines,

32
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.510
but that could not really fulfill me in the depth

33
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.210
he's hurt.
And a day was a Sunday,

34
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.880
I was attracted to cold water.
I don't know why,
but uh,

35
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.610
uh,
because I was seeking out already for years,
you have a charge within you.

36
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.610
You always keep on looking,
searching,
seeking.

37
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.620
And at that moment I felt the attraction and that I know I'm going to go in,

38
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.430
you know,
ice water.
And it only took me,
uh,

39
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.730
30 seconds or one minute it took.
But I felt this is it.

40
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.400
This is able to connect me with the depth of my physiology,

41
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.140
the way nature has mandated to be.
So it felt too good.

42
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.820
I felt connected.
This is not something you were drawn to before?

43
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.130
Not really now.
Yeah,
per accident.
I was more conscious at that moment.

44
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.300
And,
uh,
from there I began to do with every day 17 years old.

45
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:05.680
I was done.
That's about a 38 to years ago.

46
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.200
And,
uh,
from there I began to do it,
uh,
on daily,
uh,
you know,

47
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.034
every day.

48
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.780
And this is in Holland that this is in the Netherlands and an adolescent,

49
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.790
the where it's cold water and water transmits the temperature like 25 times more

50
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.980
than the air.
So,
um,

51
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.880
but I returned the other day and uh,

52
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.390
and the other day because I felt too good,
I felt connected.

53
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.670
And it's all about,

54
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.970
it's all about the connection within which I was looking for the depth,

55
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.990
which I could not find in books.
I read hundreds of books and,

56
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.830
um,
philosophy on religion,

57
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.420
on as a terror disciplines at all kinds of books.
You know,
it's searching,

58
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:55.210
searching,
searching.
But the answer is not in the hat.

59
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.260
The answer is in the body and the brain together.

60
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.730
And Coldwater triggered this and that from that route,
uh,

61
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.190
the cold water,
at a certain point when you do regularly,

62
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.450
you become coaches.

63
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:15.451
You breathing pattern is going to change because she got to be more effective.

64
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.010
You need more oxygen to withstand the impact of the cold and that needs oxygen.

65
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.340
It needs compassion in the cell.
And I'm feeling it.

66
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.870
I was doing that and I change my breathing pattern and when I change my

67
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:34.570
breathing pattern is when the magic began.

68
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.020
Then I began to see,
you know,

69
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:43.021
lights by manipulating the breathing differently lights like how so?

70
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.120
Yeah,
they got in the yoga,

71
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.380
they call it the Chakras in China,
they call it the key,

72
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.260
the Ci,
Eh,
and uh,
and so forth.
And uh,

73
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.280
I found out,
uh,

74
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.060
that this was very possible in a very short period of time.

75
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.850
And this is nothing someone's showed you how to do.

76
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.380
This is something you figured out on your own.

77
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.740
The cold is my only mastered the cold is my only teacher in the breeding police.

78
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:16.460
Say you altered your breathing patterns.
Like what do you mean exactly?
Like,
uh,

79
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.560
when I went in at a certain point I knew how to be,
you know,

80
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:23.350
very relaxed.
Go,
went in,

81
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.750
then latec a cold car,

82
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.810
impact a go within and then begin breathing deeper and then a certain dance

83
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:40.300
between the cold and to breathe.
A breath begins to start up,

84
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.800
begins to charge.
He bought it.
And after 25 breaths,

85
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:45.813
like that,

86
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.680
very conscious in the cold,

87
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:55.660
the cold is a forest and it has this impact and you go along with a cold and

88
00:05:55.661 --> 00:06:00.661
what it does in the Phasia on the physiology and you use your breathing.

89
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.840
Now I know what happens.

90
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:07.580
Visual Latika but then those days it was all by feeling and after what does

91
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:11.550
happen physiologically or you become a fully charged,
eh,
the,

92
00:06:11.551 --> 00:06:14.900
the carbon dioxide goes out,
eh,

93
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.880
oh to begins to roam freely throughout the body and the fields up.

94
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.770
Every cell and the Ph levels go up.
Now when you,

95
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:27.620
when you say you altered your breathing,
we,
what you're showing me here,

96
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:29.210
it's just breathing in and breathing out.

97
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:32.600
Like what is split specifically different about that than normal breathing?

98
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.700
The way I used it,
um,

99
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.470
W it was like after 25 breaths,
Eh,

100
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.140
it was so fully charged,

101
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.330
I could stay like five to seven minutes under the ice every time,

102
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.570
very controlled.

103
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.840
And that means that there is not only a whole lot of oxygen inside the body and

104
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:00.730
the,
but the Ph levels go up.
Now there's,
uh,

105
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.390
later on I began to understand by signs,
by,
by thinking about it,

106
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:10.250
and then,
uh,
I deducting and all that I,
I saw that,

107
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.180
uh,
that we are able to tap into the brainstem,

108
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.680
the adrenaline we showed lying in bad people,

109
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:21.170
a pure producing more adrenalin.

110
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.800
Now I know how to show to people just in a couple of days.

111
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.330
That means every listener right now is able to do that.

112
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.520
So we have proven this scientifically and it showed that people lying in bed

113
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.550
were able to produce more adrenaline than somebody in fear going for its first

114
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.410
punky jump,
bungee jump and when,
but you're still,

115
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.480
I'm still confused as to how you're,

116
00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:49.880
you're doing anything differently other than deep breathing.

117
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.460
You're taking a deep breathe in,
deep breathe out.

118
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:57.461
And now we retent from breathing after exhalation read tent.

119
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.810
Uh,
we stopped breathing after acceleration once.
Breathe in like,
well,

120
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.570
show me the method.
Like if,
if you,

121
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.380
if you go with me at 30 times,
okay,

122
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.290
go.
Okay,
boolean.
We're once again fully in.
Go

123
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.870
right on fully and but Latin girl.

124
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:22.870
<v 2>Hm.</v>

125
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.480
<v 1>Not fully out.
Just letting your but fully.
And</v>

126
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:32.260
once again,
I wanted to again,
come up,
don't hesitate.
Give it.

127
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.480
It's about changing the chemistry right now in your body.

128
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:42.930
So I'm going to become lightheaded and at a certain point you're so fully

129
00:08:44.651 --> 00:08:48.940
charged and ph levels go to a very high level.

130
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.200
You're able to stay without eh,
in the long four minutes.

131
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.620
Jess,
keep on that feeling is understanding.

132
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.240
Go on and deeply yet letting go deeply yet letting go deeply in Ladd and go 10

133
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:12.890
times more deeply than that.

134
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.160
Didn't go deeply in letting go.
I'm going to time.

135
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:22.161
It didn't go deeply and daddy go gave it fully.

136
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.273
Take him in,

137
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:29.350
let him go to air command Ladd and go take him in letting go.

138
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:36.300
No agitation.
I do this with the ovary and Matt as well and he feels wonderful.

139
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.910
Thank man.
Who are they?
Letting go.

140
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:50.190
Okay,
five times more deeply and letting go.

141
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.820
Letting go deeply and let it go two times more.

142
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.800
Letting go and stop

143
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.300
just top witness without and the lungs.

144
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.960
You are able to stay much more than normally that normally.

145
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.610
Why?
Because we change.
He'll chemistry.
Carbon dioxide went out,

146
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.740
oh two went up,

147
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.120
failed top oldest towels and the Ph levels go up.

148
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:32.230
Then we are able to tap into their central nervous system and at the end that we

149
00:10:33.081 --> 00:10:38.030
got the brain stamp and that's the place of the pineal gland.
Hypothalamus,

150
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.360
pituitary gland and the pineal gland makes the secretion of Adrenalin in

151
00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:45.530
dangerous situations.

152
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:50.480
Normally we do not get into it because of of our shallow breathing,

153
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.440
but this is the way to get into the most primitive part of the reptilian brain

154
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:02.500
without many difficulties and fend off bacteria getting better into the

155
00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:06.950
endocrine systems.
We talk about it later.

156
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.840
Your pastor one one 10 in minutes and you're still on.

157
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.970
They chose that the capacity to fill yourself up with oxygen,

158
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:22.971
there's a lot more than we normally use and as we do not use it,

159
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:29.120
we are not making use of the full capacity of our faith physiology.

160
00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:34.121
Now we found out we got a different layers and we never use it and this is the

161
00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:39.020
way to learn to use it to tap in and bang into the primitive brain,

162
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.180
into the endocrine systems,
immune systems,
the way nature has mandate to be.

163
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:50.290
Everybody is able to do one 45 and this is only ranked one if it would do like

164
00:11:51.591 --> 00:11:54.160
three rounds,
you would go to three minutes,
four

165
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.950
<v 3>minutes without air,
without training.</v>

166
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.150
It only shows the capacity to store up oxygen

167
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.460
<v 1>inside.
We never use that.</v>

168
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.130
<v 3>You're doing great.
And is he is doing already to two,</v>

169
00:12:08.131 --> 00:12:12.900
five almost to 10 whenever you feel the urge to breathe,

170
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.230
you don't need to.
Force is only learning how to access,

171
00:12:16.231 --> 00:12:18.090
energize the body and older cells.

172
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:24.500
<v 1>You're going Greg,
man,
now he's a field.
Good,
Huh?
Uh,</v>

173
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.940
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's okay.
Two 30 Oh

174
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.690
yeah.
When you feel the urge to breathe,

175
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.470
you breathe in fully and keep it for 10 15 seconds.

176
00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.820
That's one fully year.

177
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.960
And keep it and I will you press your belly,

178
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.260
the neck and then the hat

179
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:53.390
and now you are able to tap into the brainstem.

180
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:59.690
Yeah,
that's him.
If we would do it again,

181
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.553
you would,

182
00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:05.300
<v 3>you know,
it was very light headed,
breathing the breathing in part.</v>

183
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.460
So w w two to explain to people at home what I'm doing is I'm breathing in all

184
00:13:10.461 --> 00:13:14.180
the ways is deeply as I can,
but I'm not breathing out all the way.
Yeah.

185
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.960
I'm just breathing out a little bit and then I'm breathing in more and I'm just

186
00:13:17.961 --> 00:13:20.780
breathing out a little bit and I'm breathing in more and breathing out a little

187
00:13:20.781 --> 00:13:24.800
bit.
Yes.
And if you breathe,
breathe,
breathe,
and completely,

188
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:29.660
you got all the oxygen possible and it's hot.
If you just a go,

189
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.550
then you get a two,
uh,
where the exchange of the gasses happen.

190
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:39.590
And this is the way a bass to energize the body.

191
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.900
So it's a different way to get into the chemistry of the body.

192
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:49.560
We have shown this,
not you.
That's one of the fascinating things.
If,

193
00:13:49.561 --> 00:13:53.380
if people are listening to this guy,
this guy's fucking crazy.
Yeah,

194
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:59.030
definitely a crazy,
crazy,
beautiful,
beautiful way.

195
00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.893
I know,
I know.

196
00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:04.930
What you've done is you've allowed scientists to test you every step of the way

197
00:14:05.571 --> 00:14:09.380
and you've proven that all this is true when we're saying these things.
I mean,

198
00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:11.960
this is,
these are things that have been studied at universities.

199
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.460
What was the university in Holland that bow,

200
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.640
a university crowd bowed and they injected you with an endotoxin.

201
00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.390
Endotoxin.
Yeah.
To prove that you can,

202
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:27.950
you can autoregulate your immune system.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Uh,

203
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.300
normally it has a,

204
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.760
it's a controlled experiment and they did it with thousands of people already

205
00:14:35.211 --> 00:14:39.020
and nobody was able to control a,

206
00:14:39.021 --> 00:14:44.021
to the depth of the immune system because the endotoxin provokes a response and

207
00:14:44.391 --> 00:14:47.600
the immune system,
you,
you become feverish.

208
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.700
You get headaches all over agony,
uncontrolled vomiting,

209
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.960
uh,
in are things like that happen.
But,
uh,
the,

210
00:14:56.961 --> 00:15:00.950
the people I trained first,
I did it myself and then they said,
yeah,

211
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:04.130
but you are the ice man.
You are an exception on the roof.

212
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.960
Are you confirmed the rule because of this?
Now I said,
anybody can do this.

213
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.030
Why would they say that?
You confirm the rule.

214
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:14.420
If they have a rule and one person can do something different,

215
00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:17.660
then the rule doesn't work.
It's not a rule anymore.
It is.

216
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.130
That's absolutely true between us.
But in science it only works.

217
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.120
It's only validated if it is a group who's doing it right.

218
00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:29.660
But how many in the group are doing your method?
That's the thing.
When,

219
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:32.870
when when they test normal people on things,

220
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:37.670
did the amount of people that are doing what you're doing and trying these kind

221
00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:40.310
of experiments and going under ice and breathing and you're breathing.

222
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.310
It's almost none worldwide.

223
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.760
I mean I'm sure more people now are inspired to do it because of you,

224
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.230
but so I don't understand how they could say that you confirm the rule because

225
00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:54.600
you don't,
uh,
he,
you know,
you don't,
it doesn't apply to you.
Yeah.

226
00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.130
At that's the saying,
you know,
it take acception confirms the rule.

227
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.020
That's a Dutch say.
So I told him,
yes,
I'm the eyes man.

228
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:08.030
I got so much a experience.
I did so many challenges and records,
but no,

229
00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.231
the paying it,

230
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:14.231
my mission is to show to everybody is able to tap in there physiology a lot

231
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.080
deeper just in a couple of days and it has been shown 12 people in a comparative

232
00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:25.430
study,
12 people been instructed and 12 people,

233
00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.660
none as directed.
The non had instructed people are got to be sick,

234
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.580
all of them and the instructed people,
all of them were not sick.

235
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:40.150
Now this endotoxin would exactly is the endotoxin that endotoxin is a,

236
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:40.590
uh,

237
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:45.590
is a part of a bacteria and the immune system recognizes it as a,

238
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.790
as an,
uh,
uh,
a negative intruder.
So,
uh,

239
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:55.020
that's why it is a controlled experiment and,
uh,

240
00:16:55.270 --> 00:17:00.270
there's the way they inject it and they try to learn about immune system,

241
00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:05.330
the endocrine systems by doing this controlled experiments on many,

242
00:17:05.331 --> 00:17:08.660
many people all over the world.
Now,
prior to doing this,

243
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:11.410
what made you think that you could do this?
Like what,
what,

244
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:16.010
what convinced you that you could actually regulate your immune system to react

245
00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:20.460
to response?
It was injected into your body like that.
Now you're not,

246
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:25.510
now you're talking to now we begin to talk like 25 years ago already stated and

247
00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:31.781
told everybody the autonomous nervous system and the immune systems related to

248
00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:36.040
the atomic nervous system can be influenced.
Uh,

249
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:41.220
the autonomic nervous system will be no log autonomy at a,

250
00:17:41.221 --> 00:17:44.570
at just what I told,
uh,
uh,
many people mark meet because of it.

251
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.440
And they told me negatively that I was crazy and all that.
Which see,

252
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:50.160
25 years

253
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.140
<v 1>ago you were in your twenties,
then I,
yeah,
no,
no,
no.
Yeah.
Tell her thirties.
Okay.</v>

254
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.640
And that will be now 56.
Okay.
So,
uh,
yeah,
56.

255
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.680
Um,
but that I,
I told her then and now it's scientifically proven,

256
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:09.210
Eh,
uh,
uh,
yeah.
It's uh,
why,
uh,

257
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.430
because I inside,
I know.

258
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.270
<v 0>So you're this 31 year old guy and you have this,</v>

259
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:18.620
this idea in your head that you can control your,
your,
your,

260
00:18:18.621 --> 00:18:23.090
your immune system.
Yes.
What,
what gave you this thought that you could do this?

261
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.440
<v 1>I know in the beginning when I was 17 years old,
as the story began,</v>

262
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.510
I went into the cold and I,
it just felt good.
It felt,

263
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.870
I felt connection.
After years of searching,

264
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.500
I as a day you have a certain kind of knowledge,
you know,

265
00:18:40.501 --> 00:18:45.501
but from the inside altered the gut feeling and intuition and that's more than

266
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.490
the,
uh,
what we think,

267
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.780
<v 0>and this is not a reaction to how your body felt when you got out of the water.</v>

268
00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:54.900
Like you're saying,
Ooh,
I've,
I feel like I get less sick.

269
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:58.530
I feel like I'm healthier.
Oh,
he's just,
there was that too.

270
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.790
<v 1>Yes.
Yes.
But it was also you,
you felt internally that you were controlling it,</v>

271
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:07.140
like you could feel it.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh yeah.
You get a real sense.

272
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:11.080
There's say you are a fighter pilot example,
you got to opponent,

273
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:16.430
but this time the opponent is yourself.
Mm.
And uh,

274
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:21.830
and you know it from the inside and you feel it from the inside and it makes you

275
00:19:21.841 --> 00:19:23.850
happy.
It makes you strong and makes you healthy.

276
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.880
And this is what we have lost from nature and now it's back.

277
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.420
So,

278
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.680
<v 0>so in a sense,</v>

279
00:19:32.681 --> 00:19:36.910
what you've done is you tapped into something extremely primal by dealing with

280
00:19:36.911 --> 00:19:41.300
one of the most primal elements at all of all which is cold.
Yes.
So the cold,

281
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:45.340
like the,
in the vice documentary,
I thought it was really fascinating.

282
00:19:45.341 --> 00:19:46.990
You said cold is your God.

283
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.820
<v 1>Yes it is.
Yeah.
If I had a teach at,</v>

284
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.040
I've never had a teacher that's uh,
that's amazing.
I know.

285
00:19:55.041 --> 00:19:59.900
Goudreau or mentor or Sifu or anything like that.

286
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.620
<v 0>The cold,
that's my teacher.
That's my God.</v>

287
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.820
I've been dodging the colts and tells a little kid.
It's amazing.

288
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.230
You just felt compelled to jump into that.
Yes.

289
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:16.790
I feel good when you're saying this to people when you're 31 years old and

290
00:20:16.791 --> 00:20:20.090
you're telling people I can control my immune system,
they,
they have been like,

291
00:20:20.091 --> 00:20:21.170
you're out of your fucking mind.

292
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.420
Look at this guys jumping in the freezing water and he says he can controls

293
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.273
immune system.

294
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:30.460
How did you convince people to the point that you got actual scientists to

295
00:20:31.431 --> 00:20:36.050
measure your blood?
Do legitimate scientific studies on you?

296
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.030
Like what was it your accomplishments like you went for people who don't know

297
00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:46.730
you,
you did a bunch of really unbelievable tasks.
You climbed Everest in your,

298
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.300
<v 1>did you have shoes on when you climbed Everest?
Yes,
I had to with spikes spikes,</v>

299
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.920
ice climbing right at [inaudible].

300
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.960
No showed on
that.

301
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.280
I think I go buy clothes.

302
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:07.540
It's insane because it's like you are not challenging,
uh,

303
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:09.820
nature you can go up with,

304
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.340
with their car as well and then you go up Everest,
right?

305
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:19.410
Anything artificial you use in nature doesn't make you having the right

306
00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:21.580
connection with nature.

307
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:27.210
And what I wanted to challenge in all the challenges I did like marathons beyond

308
00:21:27.431 --> 00:21:29.710
the polar circle in midwinter in short,

309
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.920
but also in the heat of the desert without drinking or hanging by one finger on,

310
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.460
I want to have Columbia like a mile up in the air.

311
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.500
What in winter time you hung up by one finger.
A mile up in the air.
Yes.

312
00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:47.190
Yes.
Where was this alternate Holland.

313
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.010
Her between two hot air balloons and then climbing between them.

314
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.860
And then there was a,
you know,
a thing,

315
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.280
a device I could have looked it on with one finger.
Yes.

316
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:01.600
How long has your hang there for a 25 seconds.
Jesus Christ.
Five seconds.

317
00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:06.370
And with one finger in wintertime,
winter time,

318
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:11.170
you know you lose control when the blood becomes cold or into hands,

319
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.670
you lose control.
So that was the challenge.
It's mind over matter.

320
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.450
And I wanted to show that in all the challenges,

321
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.530
the adaptive power of ours is enormous.

322
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.030
But as we are not stimulating or using that anymore,

323
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:34.050
you got a neglected body and become sick or half [inaudible] in its potency.

324
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:40.090
And so very logic.
So the powers that our body has,

325
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.710
the untapped powers that we probably had for millennia,
dealing with the cold,

326
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:47.470
dealing with the heat,
dealing with adversity,
dealing with struggle,

327
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.770
all those powers are not being tapped into.
So because of that,

328
00:22:50.771 --> 00:22:54.370
the body just atrophies and we don't,
it doesn't know what to do with yourself.

329
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:59.170
Exactly.
You,
you think that that may be also a cause of depression?

330
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.230
Yes.
I'm a right now into new research.
Uh,
as soon as I,

331
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.720
I wa I want to do research.
Uh,

332
00:23:08.721 --> 00:23:13.400
they did research on mindfulness power example,
mindfulness,
uh,

333
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:18.250
related to depression.
And um,
I think not only me,

334
00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:21.370
all two psychiatrists,
they saw the blood values,

335
00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:26.820
the markers in the blood within the hour study and most probably our method,

336
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:32.610
this what we just did brings the people very much faster into controlling their

337
00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:38.650
endocrine system.
The endocrine system is about hormonal,

338
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.290
uh,
balances in the body and about,

339
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:47.430
because we are not able to tap into that and we are victimized because of too

340
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:51.140
much stress or this or the daily life or whatever.

341
00:23:51.141 --> 00:23:54.470
And we get depressed and we are not able to get out of it.

342
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.030
Now this method because of tapping into the endocrine systems,

343
00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:04.031
makes you feel you are able to re balance the hormonal,

344
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.800
this disturbance in the body,
creating,
uh,
eventually,

345
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.650
uh,
in length,
uh,
the,
the depression.

346
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.460
So I want research on this because this is,

347
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.930
my wife died in [inaudible] 95 because of suicide.

348
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.790
I have four children were with her,

349
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.140
I was powerless then my heart was broken and uh,

350
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.300
had no money,
no nothing.
And then they struggle.
And this fight began.

351
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.170
I'm going to prove this to the world and uh,

352
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:41.260
and create a shortcut for anybody who is depressed or you know,

353
00:24:41.451 --> 00:24:44.300
sick and everything.
And now we got to key,

354
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.360
we cut key to the endocrine systems and the immune systems and anybody can do

355
00:24:50.631 --> 00:24:54.620
this.
And because it is done by science,
it's beyond speculation.

356
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.820
We make it a choice.
And that's why I'm on a mission.

357
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.350
And this mission breaks me here to Joe Rogan,
who's a good guy.

358
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:08.470
He's a fighter himself and he loves life and he brings it out and he tries

359
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:13.600
people out.
I can see,
I can tell and I people out.
Yeah,
yeah.
Try it.
People,

360
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.700
uh,
who are you?
What are you doing?
And things like that.

361
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.680
It's a a,
I like it.
I love it.

362
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.910
And we need to do this because we got to change this world where there is no

363
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:30.620
control.
I mean we can build,
we can fly to the moon,

364
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.263
we can make,

365
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.600
this is more intelligence than the whole Apollo 13 project.

366
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.780
Yes.
If we can,

367
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:45.550
this is the fruit of our mind and that the power of our mind is enormous,

368
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.800
but now it is time to use the same power to learn to control our happiness,

369
00:25:51.921 --> 00:25:55.130
strength and health.
And we have shown this now.

370
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.990
So you feel like

371
00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.220
<v 0>the,
the what happened with your wife that your,</v>

372
00:26:00.221 --> 00:26:05.221
your wife killed herself was due to depression and you feel like that that type

373
00:26:05.891 --> 00:26:06.581
of depression,

374
00:26:06.581 --> 00:26:11.581
the depression that a lot of people experience is because their mind is not

375
00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:15.160
stimulated the way it was intended to by nature.

376
00:26:15.161 --> 00:26:18.970
Is that a fair way of describing your,
your thoughts on this?
Absolutely.

377
00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:24.240
And that we're left with a residual effect of civilization in a way where your

378
00:26:25.001 --> 00:26:29.230
mind is,
it's overwhelmed with things that really are not natural.

379
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.130
Like living in a cubicle distress of office life traffic,

380
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.930
things that aren't natural.

381
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.320
<v 1>Exactly.
We are living to work their system.</v>

382
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:42.580
It be going around,
right?
The system once again,
shoot,

383
00:26:42.581 --> 00:26:45.300
serve our happiness,
strength and health.

384
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:51.260
And now we have proof that we are able to tap in to the endocrine systems and

385
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:54.690
the immune system far deeper.

386
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.170
So we got to try this and it is natural.

387
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.840
Anybody can do this in just a couple of days.

388
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:06.090
Right now we are in the third year of the university books here in America.

389
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.410
The,
the testing,
the iceman.
It's not about me anymore.

390
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.190
It's about the comparative study.
Uh,

391
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:18.230
and then it tells the endocrine systems and they immune systems and it only

392
00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:23.040
takes one guy is endurance.

393
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:23.971
You know,

394
00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:28.971
believe that we are able to tap in deeper into our fish physiology.

395
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:34.380
Does a bling enabling the person to,

396
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.910
uh,
to direct his hormonal secretions.

397
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:44.490
Strength per example,
lying in bed as we told already,
producing,

398
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.790
lying in bed.
There's no rhinoceros coming to that guy.

399
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:53.390
Now he's at ease and he controls completely the stress hormone and the

400
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:59.210
controlled stress amone works like medicine and non controlled stress hormone

401
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:04.410
works in the end acidic and that becomes no good.
And that's,

402
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:08.400
we are victimized because we have no control in daily life anymore.

403
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:12.510
But the stress is there.
So the stress is there,
but there's no physical exertion.

404
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:17.340
Yes.
And that's why they've shown tasks that in many cases,
um,

405
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.980
exercise can be just as good as antidepressants,

406
00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:22.200
just as good as medication for people who are depressed.

407
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.170
W which totally makes sense if what you're saying is right,

408
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.240
that it totally makes sense that your,

409
00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:30.510
your body like has a desire to exert itself.

410
00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.890
And it has a built in system that's designed to deal with certain natural

411
00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.260
stresses running from predators,

412
00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:41.730
dealing with the cold and dealing with weather and climate and,

413
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.440
and nature and the adversities of the environment as far as like a challenging

414
00:28:46.441 --> 00:28:51.030
yourself,
climbing hills and exerting yourself,
we don't do that that much.

415
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.030
And because of that,
that's what you think leads to this,

416
00:28:54.031 --> 00:28:58.230
this disease of the brain.
Yes.
And you know,

417
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.070
for many people who are depressed,

418
00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:05.071
they are quite unable to get into that body and begin to run and things like

419
00:29:07.141 --> 00:29:09.990
that.
Eh,
Eh,
it's a,
it's a,

420
00:29:09.991 --> 00:29:14.991
it's the brain and where we are going to solve this by very easy techniques.

421
00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:20.060
A instead of them having to run because they are,

422
00:29:20.061 --> 00:29:22.530
our environment is really pressing upon them.

423
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:25.530
They feel completely immobilized.

424
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:29.970
But if you are able to tap into with the brain and lot to make,

425
00:29:29.971 --> 00:29:34.740
feel the change that he is changing the,
the,
the chemistry of the brain,

426
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.240
then it becomes a different person,
uh,
a much faster.

427
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.850
So,
um,
but uh,
yeah,

428
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:46.860
I'm a subject to science and I want more research on this and soon it we have

429
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:52.990
the outcomes and then we will tackle this problem with the depression because

430
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:58.740
it's related to the endocrine systems and having no connection with it.

431
00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:04.180
Normally the hypothalamus in a,
our,
uh,
primitive brain,

432
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:08.080
the brainstem is not under our control,

433
00:30:08.081 --> 00:30:13.081
but the idea is breathing techniques deriving from being in the cold so much.

434
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.320
They are very effective,
not only in the Colt,
which is stress,

435
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.830
but also in the heat ultra for a predator.

436
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.390
Also on Mount Everest where there is a lack,

437
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:27.460
a lack of oxygen outset and also for daily stress.

438
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.480
What was the first one of these experiments that you tried to do to try to show

439
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.630
the effectiveness of your methods day?

440
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:42.370
I was at a physiological department in the same university,

441
00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:46.930
different department,
and that's a cult physiological department.

442
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:52.590
And I still there for 80 minutes in a tank full of ice for 18 minutes,

443
00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:59.110
fully connected to wires being,
uh,
uh,

444
00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:03.910
blood was taken.
So you just covered in ice cover deniers,
pictures of it.

445
00:31:03.911 --> 00:31:07.410
It looks insane.
[inaudible]
except for this arm I,

446
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:11.650
because the blood was taken away from it.
Um,

447
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.700
and they,
you know,
what they saw and I was talking to these people,
Eh,

448
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.800
to these professors who were,
well,

449
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:24.570
everything was because I was very much in control and they saw the core

450
00:31:24.611 --> 00:31:29.611
temperature either rising while it was insight in a core temperature was rising

451
00:31:30.071 --> 00:31:32.330
while you're covered in ice for 80.
Yes.
Yes.

452
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:36.370
And you see how much power we have,
how much,
you know,

453
00:31:36.371 --> 00:31:38.980
how much power coal can be and,

454
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:43.090
but how much more power we are able to learn to control.

455
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:48.730
And,
and that the blood taken from me while I was in the tank,

456
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.410
I got a few remarkable results,
eh,
uh,

457
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.670
one s the blood taken,

458
00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.730
it was exposed to endotoxin afterwards,

459
00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:01.990
but in a laboratory without me ex vivo,
it's called.

460
00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:06.650
And they saw,
normally it has a very,
uh,

461
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:11.560
violent reaction on the immune cells in the,
in the,

462
00:32:11.561 --> 00:32:14.770
in the,
in the glass of the,
you know,
the laboratory.

463
00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:20.530
And this time,
0%,
a hundred percent suppression.

464
00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.250
And that's my blood a hundred percent,
hundred percent.

465
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.280
So the endotoxin just get squashed the moment he gets in there.

466
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.760
And that's the bacteria.
Yeah.
And that's the immune system.

467
00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:35.410
And that's the way we actually built a,
to be able to,

468
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.620
and uh,
that was one where way,
and now that I'm,
a remarkable thing,

469
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:45.320
before I was going into the tank,
they took blood from me as well.

470
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.410
And Eh,
this blood was

471
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.680
looked upon,
intuit my by a microscope.

472
00:32:55.220 --> 00:33:00.220
And they saw a 300% more metabolic activity in the cell without moving.

473
00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.050
That's the mind my mind was already into.

474
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.440
I go inside that one in the box,

475
00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.660
I need to do 80 minutes.

476
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:18.170
I program my on up till cell level.

477
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.000
What I'm about to do,

478
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.240
I need more energy because energy is needed to with Stan,

479
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.410
the impact of the cold.

480
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:32.330
So I control my buddy by my mind and that's all of us.

481
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.340
And this mine then makes the connection with the Hypothalamus,

482
00:33:37.341 --> 00:33:42.330
which is the brainstem.
And that is able to control the,

483
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.700
the hormonal system,
the immune systems,
the vascular system,

484
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:47.900
all the systems.

485
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:53.170
Now when you say that your metabolic rate rose 300% is not a normal thing

486
00:33:53.301 --> 00:33:54.200
because of the cold,

487
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:56.900
because that's one thing that they tell you that it's a great way to lose

488
00:33:56.901 --> 00:34:00.530
calories.
Just dress very lightly when it's cold outside.
Yes.

489
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.560
And it forces your body to work hard,
to stay warm.
So it,

490
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:08.180
it was an effective that.
Yeah.
Uh,
it was,
it was,

491
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:13.430
it was at,
that's a ultra a thing about the brown fat adipose,

492
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.950
Eh,
we got all these sales,
but as we never exposed to cold anymore,
it doesn't,
uh,

493
00:34:18.951 --> 00:34:23.540
it's not stimulated is like a muscle.
You,
you're new to a train,

494
00:34:23.541 --> 00:34:24.680
it becomes weaker.

495
00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:29.150
So we got old to alter the cells which needs stimulation.

496
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:34.610
I did experiments with a brown fat adipose and the,
and the nuclear,

497
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:39.800
uh,
department of nuclear,
uh,
medical,
uh,

498
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.560
department in Maastricht,
a different university.

499
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:48.190
And it showed that I had the same brown fat adipose levels as a young man,

500
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:53.870
like 20 years,
15 years.
They still have it,

501
00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.430
but you get older,
you wear clothes and that you get a,
you lose it.

502
00:34:58.820 --> 00:34:59.750
It's logical.

503
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:04.070
But I always a expose myself to cold on a regular basis.

504
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.120
So they had me expos as well too,

505
00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:09.740
in an experiment like that.

506
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.940
And they saw that I with the same level of,

507
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:18.590
or amount of adipose tissue,
brown fat adipose cells,

508
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.850
I could produce five time more,
uh,
more energy.

509
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.720
That's what they saw.
So compared to these guys,

510
00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:32.140
because of the breathing and influencing into on cell level,

511
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:38.100
I was able to do five times more and this could be a solution.
People

512
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.600
<v 3>who have overweigh because when the fat is consumed,
Eh,</v>

513
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.650
and which is very,
um,
in the moment when you need it,

514
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:52.040
then a gets depleted.
Then,
uh,
the rest of the,
the,

515
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:56.760
the white fat in the body is being withdrawn very systematically,

516
00:35:56.761 --> 00:36:01.740
very effectively,
direct and,
but like five times more effective.

517
00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:06.690
It's maybe a solution for many people living in the,
in the west with,
you know,

518
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:11.670
obese problems and heart problems because vascular problems because of it,

519
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.390
et cetera.
There's a,
a,

520
00:36:13.391 --> 00:36:16.650
a type of therapy that's becoming really popular here in America called

521
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:17.820
cryotherapy.

522
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:22.940
A lot of athletes use it and I started using it a few years ago.
Um,

523
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.800
a lot of people from Jujitsu were telling me about this thing when you go is

524
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.860
stay in this,
it's a box.

525
00:36:28.861 --> 00:36:31.680
It's 250 degrees below zero when you do three minutes in it.
Yeah,

526
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.900
I do it four days a week now.
It's,
it's amazing.
It's nice.
It's amazing.
I,

527
00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.230
I get out of there,
I feel so great.
And I had my friend,
doctor,
Rhonda Patrick,

528
00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:45.150
who's a scientist and she explained all the,
what's happening inside of it.

529
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.860
And then I took her to the,
to the,
to the chamber and had her stand in the,
uh,

530
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:53.710
the cryo chamber and she,
she said it was incredible when she got out of it,

531
00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:57.570
but seeing she was a scientist,
she understands the body very well.

532
00:36:57.571 --> 00:37:01.060
So she knew that there was,
it was raising her levels of neoprene,

533
00:37:01.061 --> 00:37:06.061
Afrin and her whole body was being stimulated by this reaction to this extreme

534
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:11.430
250 degree below zero cold.
Yes,
I did at that too.
And uh,

535
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.770
uh,
yeah.
Uh,

536
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:15.270
have you done the one where you get inside of it but fully or the one that's

537
00:37:15.271 --> 00:37:19.230
just from the not fully and uh,
and uh,

538
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.200
up til the neck a couple of times and uh,
yeah,

539
00:37:22.201 --> 00:37:25.200
I could stay a quite long and the like,
it's staying there forever.

540
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:29.820
I won't go in there for,
I don't know why my bay 10 minutes or something and,

541
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:33.890
but they're still feeling okay.
I didn't,
yeah,
three minutes,

542
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.530
three minutes and 30 seconds.
And I do it more than anybody in the whole place.

543
00:37:37.531 --> 00:37:41.790
I can't believe you get deterred by this.
Yeah.
You know,
it's a thing.

544
00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:42.770
We're with a nature.

545
00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:47.030
Keep going and keep going and then you just push your boundaries.
That's it.

546
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.360
But it is not necessary to uh,

547
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:55.700
reestablish the right natural connection between your brain and your endocrine

548
00:37:56.701 --> 00:37:58.140
systems and immune systems.

549
00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:03.590
Just a little bit of cold is enough to trigger the vascular system the right

550
00:38:03.841 --> 00:38:06.720
way,
enabling it,
uh,

551
00:38:06.721 --> 00:38:11.721
to work better with their nervous system and then the breathing and focus your

552
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:17.691
mind like the mind was able without moving to produce 300% more metabolic

553
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.750
activity in the cell that is mine.

554
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:27.060
That the mind is so much able to do so much more.

555
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:31.530
And this is the quintessential,
this is the essence of what I come to tell you.

556
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:36.250
We got to change how I believe we got to change

557
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.360
<v 1>the way we think.</v>

558
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:42.390
It's a like a paradigm shift and a why because we have proven with thousands and

559
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:49.090
thousands of results beyond speculation that we are able,

560
00:38:49.091 --> 00:38:51.280
if we use our mind once again,

561
00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:57.050
that not in dependency for doctors and this and that and [inaudible] no,

562
00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:02.310
you are able to repair yourself whenever you feel not healthy or depressed or

563
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:09.610
uh,
w with a loss of energy,
you know,
Eh,

564
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.400
strength,
happiness and to health,

565
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:18.090
then you should go in and breathe better and that you will reestablish the

566
00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.300
connection,
uh,
with the endocrine system,

567
00:39:22.301 --> 00:39:27.301
say immune systems and the brain together and then repair whatever is producing

568
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:31.780
an obstacle for you to function in the world.

569
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:35.560
Maybe you are able to function in the world,
but you don't feel good.

570
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.550
You don't feel uh,
happy and a,
you don't feel strong.

571
00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:44.530
So tell say if a person had a cold,
slight cold,
what would you recommend they do?

572
00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.630
I would say breathing once,
breeding your method,

573
00:39:49.631 --> 00:39:53.080
your breathing fully is hard and deep as you can.

574
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:57.120
And then just actually a little bit breathe in as far as your lung to stretch.

575
00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:00.160
How many likes?
I like 20 times,
20 times.
Dan,

576
00:40:00.161 --> 00:40:05.161
take him in and then go to the place to the spot where you feel the cold is

577
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:11.980
happening.
Could be in the throat,
could be eh,
could be,

578
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:16.390
you know,
somewhere in the,
at this part.
So go in your mind to that spot.

579
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:21.130
You know what happens when I'm in the ice for an hour,
for example.

580
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.540
Most of the Times I began to feel it,
the cold,

581
00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:29.780
Eh,
at the part of the kidneys,
which is a mostly on the,
on,

582
00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.550
on the surface,
and the cold gets there,
the eyes,

583
00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:35.950
then I ain't got no,

584
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.580
there is no way I'm able to move because it's like six,

585
00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:42.970
700 kilos of ice around me

586
00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:49.480
and I'm not able even to breathe very much because it's pressurizing.

587
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.880
What I learned is to think it a way,
within a minute,

588
00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:56.500
within a minute,

589
00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:01.500
I made a difference from the brain to the kidneys and change the temperature

590
00:41:02.171 --> 00:41:05.380
like 10 degrees.
This is a measurable thing.

591
00:41:05.381 --> 00:41:07.930
You've changed a measurable 10 degrees.
Eh,

592
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:12.610
Dr Ken Karma who did experiments with me,

593
00:41:12.611 --> 00:41:17.410
I did records a year in New York and Florida.
I don't know,

594
00:41:17.411 --> 00:41:21.470
it's a couple of places.
And while I was in the show,

595
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:25.900
for example,
Regis and Kelly show,
you know the guys,
right?

596
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:29.410
And uh,
an Isa,

597
00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:32.140
my core temperature was dropping,

598
00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:37.280
was dropped to 30 to a degree Celsius,

599
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:41.620
Celsius.
I don't know why,
but it is far low.
Way Low.
Eh,

600
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:46.750
people are not a normally not able to raise the temperatures anymore.

601
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:48.620
They just go into

602
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.730
unconsciousness and coma and things like that.

603
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:58.360
But I rose the temperature back and he said he had never had seen a person do

604
00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:04.310
that because facial logically stated in the signs of books,

605
00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.850
it's not possible.
And I say,
you know,

606
00:42:07.851 --> 00:42:11.480
so much more is possible than not only a,
you know,

607
00:42:11.481 --> 00:42:16.240
connecting with your core temperature but also with the endocrine system.

608
00:42:16.241 --> 00:42:18.770
So when you say you were raising your temperature,

609
00:42:18.771 --> 00:42:21.620
where w what was the environment that you were raising your temperature in,

610
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:24.980
where you were in the water while this was happening in the tank,

611
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:30.140
the ice freezing cold and you raise your temperature from there.
Yes.

612
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:34.820
That's amazing.
No,
what we are able to do.

613
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.830
That's amazing.
That's amazing.
Life is amazing.
Her,
Wanda,

614
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.820
and we have to reexperience that and that's the paradigm shift.

615
00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.370
We are able to learn to control.

616
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:51.380
It needs some steady attention like a baby needs attention to grow up.

617
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:56.870
We need to pay attention to ourselves again,
trust ourselves.
Again,
belief,

618
00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:01.900
believing is neurotransmitters in the right way and when it connects with the

619
00:43:02.391 --> 00:43:06.620
body again and we got the techniques and it does have been shown with thousands

620
00:43:06.621 --> 00:43:11.621
of results that we are able to control the endocrine systems or a better set,

621
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:18.320
eh,
our mood becoming happy,
yes or no.
Serotonin,

622
00:43:18.321 --> 00:43:22.310
Melatonin,
dematerial trip to mine and all the Yada,
our amounts,

623
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:26.990
we are able to tap into that system.
We have shown that another one,

624
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:31.210
the strength,
which is adrenaline,
epinephrine,
norepinephrine,

625
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.160
noradrenaline or accord is all and all that.

626
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.450
We have shown more than somebody lying in bed.

627
00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.770
Then somebody going into a bank of jam that's tracked and then health.

628
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:48.190
It's the immune system's learning to tap into the immune systems and like cry

629
00:43:49.131 --> 00:43:51.090
with therapy as you were talking,

630
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:55.850
mentioning it goes on to up till the bone marrow.

631
00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:01.780
It activates these blood markers over there and people with arthritis then are

632
00:44:02.781 --> 00:44:07.781
able to move a barrier again after a session like that,

633
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.300
but we were these breathing techniques.

634
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:16.280
We get into the bone marrow as well and there we have the t cells,

635
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:22.060
the t cells and the bees out and they are a part of the specific immune system

636
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:28.120
and the specific immune system normally only begins to work after two weeks and

637
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.780
then the body knows what kind of molecules it needs to produce to kill the SA,

638
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:38.220
the intruder cell and it gets on the membrane,

639
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:42.940
the skin of the cell and it killed it instead of inflammatory [inaudible].

640
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:47.070
The older body,
it goes very specifically,
but it takes two weeks.

641
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:52.250
We do with a one quarter of an hour with this breathing and only with his

642
00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:53.454
breathing,

643
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:58.860
you are able to control the Ph level and the Ph level,

644
00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:01.080
right as we are mammals,

645
00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:07.200
if you look in nature,
you see all these mammals.
If you take blood from them,

646
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:09.270
they all have the right Ph degree.

647
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:14.570
Very alkaline and but only because we were close and we are live in a comfort

648
00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:18.630
zone.
We do not stimulate.

649
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:23.160
That's oxygen doesn't get as deep as it could.

650
00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:28.020
You have shown this two and a half minutes without air in the lungs.

651
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:33.470
That means the capacity to store up oxygen is far bigger than you normally use.

652
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.470
But it's still pretty minor though,
right?
Like what you,

653
00:45:37.471 --> 00:45:40.770
you held your breath for seven minutes.
Is that what you did?
Yes.

654
00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:45.170
And under the eyes and but that once again that,
that,

655
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:49.290
that what day to do you have been fighting paypal?

656
00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.100
I have a good winner because I was not trained to do that.

657
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.440
You have trained to do that.
I trained to do this,
that,

658
00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:01.620
that but that's the range of possibilities.
But Eh,

659
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.460
it's very unimportant.
We don't need to know,
hey rose,

660
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:09.780
we knew it needed to become healthy,
strong and happy.

661
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.800
Does it matter whether you breathe in through your nose or in through your
mouth?

662
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.460
Cause there's a big thing in yoga and they teach you that in a lot of other

663
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:20.370
[inaudible] too.
They try to teach you to breathe in through your nose.

664
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.510
I wrote books on the subject before.
Now I say,

665
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.550
doesn't matter what county are your whole year use?
Just get it in

666
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.930
girls and these women and ask her.

667
00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:37.200
I just tell them that to make a joke,

668
00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:41.670
but it is a serious thing as we got it scientifically endorsed,
no speculation.

669
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.790
Just do.
It just is easy,
accessible,

670
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:48.360
very effective because the idea is when you breathe in through your mouth,

671
00:46:48.361 --> 00:46:52.410
they Burberry induces panic breathing.
That's what they say in in Jujitsu.

672
00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.900
That does to keep yourself calm.
You're supposed to,

673
00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.220
you breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth,

674
00:46:59.221 --> 00:47:01.410
in through your nose and out through your mouth and then yoga,

675
00:47:01.411 --> 00:47:04.830
they tried to teach you to do the entire class through your nose.
Yeah.

676
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:06.520
I don't think it matters.
Yeah.

677
00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:10.590
Now it doesn't matter a row and I'm going to tell him that tomorrow.
Yeah,

678
00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.440
test do it.
In this technique,

679
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:18.650
which has been shown as the first group in the world to be able to tap into the

680
00:47:18.871 --> 00:47:23.790
autonomic nervous system related to the immune system and endocrine system.

681
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.010
It shows the depth and,

682
00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.340
and this depth normally as a result maybe

683
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:35.340
<v 3>of Yogis who are really going into summaries and Dharana and,</v>

684
00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:41.050
and a into the Kundalini up to the Sahasrara and all that.
The,

685
00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.410
the,
the comeback.
I yogi and I know all this,

686
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:49.390
all the terminology I've been doing since creed in India and uh,

687
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.040
before,
but,
uh,

688
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:55.870
I thought to be far too complicated.

689
00:47:56.410 --> 00:48:01.090
They,
they,
Eh,
Eh,
you know,
they made it into a myth.

690
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:03.460
We Westerners,
we have no time.

691
00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:08.730
We want to understand things the way we are a living.

692
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:14.110
And I thought to simplify it and uh,
science,
uh,

693
00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:18.220
backed it up.
Now when you talking about your breathing,

694
00:48:18.221 --> 00:48:20.620
you were saying that when you were young that you,

695
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:24.940
when you discovered this type of breathing that you could see lights.
Yes.

696
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.360
You know,
Dan is,
that's one of the core components of Kundalini Yoga.
The chakras.

697
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:29.830
Yeah.

698
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:34.830
That they experience this intense state due to this specific type of re I don't

699
00:48:35.321 --> 00:48:38.260
have a presence.
There's this is a done nervous system.

700
00:48:38.261 --> 00:48:42.700
I could make you do they say in a 15 minutes and what do you but what is that?

701
00:48:42.701 --> 00:48:46.930
Is it just your body's production of the nervous system?

702
00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:51.520
The nervous system is about electrical potentials.
Just firing.
That's it.

703
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:54.730
You're just manipulating the nervous system,

704
00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.370
pressurizing her and then uh,

705
00:48:57.371 --> 00:48:59.860
electricity comes out a bigger,

706
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:02.800
so what you were saying before about someone who has a cold,

707
00:49:02.801 --> 00:49:07.360
so you would tell them to utilize your breathing method and concentrate on the

708
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:10.990
area in which they're sick.
Like if they have a lung infection,

709
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.460
concentrate on clearing the lung,
any infection,
any disease,
any,

710
00:49:15.461 --> 00:49:19.030
anything they got,
we have the ability to connect with our body.

711
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.890
You just have to absolutely believe it and you have to absolutely be focused on

712
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:23.830
if you are,

713
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:28.830
if you want to phone then if I want my phone then I need to grab this one.

714
00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.570
Not this one,
not this one.

715
00:49:31.571 --> 00:49:36.400
And not that I have to be busy with what I'm doing for grab the actual phone.

716
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:40.810
I got it.
Go to the place where something is happening.

717
00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:45.670
So if there is a disturbance,
she go to the to step until you release it.

718
00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.920
You got it.
Learn to connect.
Once again,

719
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:51.910
that's the change of the believe they changed the of the believers.

720
00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:56.930
Not nothing more than the the mind which is neurotransmitter's electrical

721
00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.720
potentials and use it once again instead of being alienated because of conflict

722
00:50:04.511 --> 00:50:05.344
behavior,

723
00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:10.740
you learn to use these neuro macro bola biological patterns again,

724
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:14.860
which are,
which are existent,

725
00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:20.310
but they are an a down exercise unexercised and that's why we,

726
00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:23.710
we don't trust them because they are not so strong.

727
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:28.250
Learn that these are very capable of you

728
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.540
<v 1>making connection with the endocrine systems,
immune systems far deeper,</v>

729
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:37.460
thus being able to control happiness,
health and strength.

730
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:42.080
And we are going to prove this more and more because um,
uh,
dealing with,
uh,

731
00:50:42.081 --> 00:50:46.700
universities and I want to,
I want cold measurements,

732
00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:48.260
figures,
statistics,

733
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.600
<v 0>no speculation.</v>

734
00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:53.290
Well that's what separates you from a lot of people who've made these crazy

735
00:50:53.291 --> 00:50:58.270
claims.
You've actually done physical feats that show extraordinary abilities.

736
00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:01.330
What,
what you did in Mt.
Everest.
No one's ever done before.

737
00:51:01.331 --> 00:51:03.760
And I've never even heard of anybody attempting to do something like that.

738
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:08.980
You ran a marathon,
half marathon in Finland.
We did you run a barefoot?

739
00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:13.810
Yes.
Yes.
Above.
I mean you were,
you were,
how cold was it out?

740
00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:18.610
It was like minus 30 outside.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
She's duty.
Reach about those.

741
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:23.230
Definitely a shirtless,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just shorts,
shirt,
shorts,

742
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.273
barefoot.

743
00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:28.810
You run a half mile at minus 30 so that's what this is that 15 miles.

744
00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:33.640
13 miles.
13 miles.
Yeah.
It was something.
What's up there?

745
00:51:33.641 --> 00:51:36.880
But that's undeniable.
That's undeniable.
So when,
when people,

746
00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.970
is that why you started doing these things so that people would pay attention to

747
00:51:39.971 --> 00:51:42.400
what you're doing?
Because when,
when you hear someone doing that,

748
00:51:42.401 --> 00:51:45.640
when you hear someone's climbing mount Everest and their shorts,
you go,
what?

749
00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.250
Okay,
what is he doing?
How's he doing that?

750
00:51:48.251 --> 00:51:52.900
And then when you find out you're incredibly healthy and you're vibrant and

751
00:51:52.901 --> 00:51:54.200
you're doing all these things and you,

752
00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:57.850
you're allowing yourself to be tested and you're showing this ability to

753
00:51:57.851 --> 00:52:00.940
regulate your immune system.
And this is all incredibly exciting stuff.

754
00:52:00.941 --> 00:52:03.370
And then the scientists come in because then they're like,
okay,

755
00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:05.170
what is going on here?

756
00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:08.860
And we have to change our beliefs about what is possible with the humans.

757
00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:09.843
Exactly.

758
00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:14.730
<v 1>And be very clear about it.
No speculation.
It all began with a,</v>

759
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:18.180
you know,
well,
and I felt so powerless with her,

760
00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:23.130
my wife then those days I loved her to death,
but not in that way.

761
00:52:23.131 --> 00:52:27.300
Of course,
I work now with the four children I have with her.

762
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:32.580
I had with her,
I still have with her.
And uh,
I began to,

763
00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:37.680
I only could find rest and peace within the depth of my own

764
00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:43.350
being emotionally,
you know,
you cannot see it,
but it is there.

765
00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:46.590
And uh,
for that I went into nature.

766
00:52:46.591 --> 00:52:50.790
I began to climb without gear and go into the eyes more.

767
00:52:50.791 --> 00:52:55.100
And this made me silent within that horse,
my Keurig,

768
00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.810
<v 0>it calmed your all the horrible stress and depression.</v>

769
00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:02.230
<v 1>Emotion is stress.
And uh,</v>

770
00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.650
later on I began to understand about it,

771
00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:09.930
but then I caught the attention of the news and then,

772
00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:14.250
uh,
they began to ask,
but are you able to do this then too?

773
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:17.910
And I able to do,
I told them,
oh yeah,
I can do that.

774
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.620
I can swim under the ice like this and says,
oh yeah,

775
00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:25.980
I can climb the mountain barefoot in the snow.
Yeah.
I can hang by

776
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.830
<v 3>one finger in the air.
Yeah.
I can't run a marathon.
A is SharePlus,</v>

777
00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:35.130
uh,
beyond the polar circle.
Midwinter I can do all this.

778
00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.020
And then science came in,

779
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:42.430
they came into the newspapers and the Internet and all that and they took,

780
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:46.560
how is this possible?
This is where the,

781
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:51.930
did they not believe you at first?
Of course if somebody,

782
00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:54.870
it tells in the books and the university books now,

783
00:53:55.250 --> 00:54:00.250
which have been dedicating one chapter about the ice man,

784
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:03.150
which is the study which we did,

785
00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:08.640
that you see the old story that w where professors normally they say,

786
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:10.290
yeah,
this is not possible in the,

787
00:54:10.291 --> 00:54:15.291
in the books it stated it is not possible to do a half marathon barefoot or

788
00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:21.270
climbing mount Everest that way because of the physiology of hours and,

789
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:26.400
and the hardships outside.
It's not possible,
but this guy is doing it.
So,

790
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:27.180
oh,

791
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:32.180
so began to raise questions and then they invited me to be tested and they were

792
00:54:34.141 --> 00:54:34.950
skeptical.

793
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:39.950
They were absolutely skeptical or only won't clinical proof of what I was doing,

794
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:45.450
which surpassed the official logical laws stated in the,
in the books.

795
00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:49.980
If I was able to produce that in laboratory settings.

796
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.110
And then they had a,
you know,

797
00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:55.890
something to start off with to do at a,

798
00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:01.040
which could be a possible method or a abilities,

799
00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:04.590
uh,
evidence based,
uh,

800
00:55:04.591 --> 00:55:06.540
helping people who are sick.

801
00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:11.700
And now we are going to do more clinical studies.

802
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:17.120
Show is sick people to be able to cure a lot faster or not to uh,

803
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:18.653
having,
uh,

804
00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:23.840
to make use of as much medicine as they do now because yeah,

805
00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.880
I'm a,
I'm not anti uh,

806
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:31.910
pharmaceutics or anything lighter because I'm not into politics but I'm a in a,

807
00:55:32.981 --> 00:55:33.331
you know,

808
00:55:33.331 --> 00:55:38.331
I want people to know there is so much more within every person here in the

809
00:55:38.671 --> 00:55:43.671
world which will enable you to tackle a disease unhappiness and having no energy

810
00:55:47.431 --> 00:55:52.140
or strength and uh,
we are able to do that and that's love.

811
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:57.210
I want to bring back love in the world constituted by happiness,

812
00:55:57.211 --> 00:56:00.670
strength and health.
It's just fascinating that it takes you,

813
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.040
you're such an outlier there.

814
00:56:02.041 --> 00:56:07.041
It took one person to come up with this method and one person to challenge these

815
00:56:07.411 --> 00:56:12.411
ideas that the body can't do this and now they have to reconsider this 7 billion

816
00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:13.950
people on the planet.

817
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:17.700
We've been around for who knows how long we've thousands of years of written

818
00:56:17.701 --> 00:56:21.210
history and then they had these laws that they believed that the body was

819
00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:23.980
capable of doing and not capable of doing.
This is,
this is where

820
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.340
<v 1>it ends that you body can't do this,
your body can't do that.</v>

821
00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:30.400
And you came along,
one guy,
Wim Hoff,

822
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:35.410
you come along and you change everything.
That's amazing.
That's,

823
00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:39.490
that's truly,
truly amazing.
It's amazing.
You know,
it's,
uh,

824
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:44.530
I wasn't ever out there to,
to,
to change the world,

825
00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:48.460
but because of,
you know,
things happened in my life,

826
00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:49.923
I triggered,

827
00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:54.940
it was triggered in the depth of my body and even in the emotional part as I

828
00:56:55.511 --> 00:56:59.920
explained before,
because of my wife and all that,
and now I'm very,

829
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:01.590
very certain.
I got a mission.

830
00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:06.040
It was born in 2007 in the Feinstein Institute,

831
00:57:06.041 --> 00:57:10.590
Manhasset New York.
When doctor Carol,
I've,
Kevin Carr,
Carmilla,
uh,

832
00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:11.530
uh,

833
00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:16.530
gave me the results of a blood result after an experiment in the Feinstein

834
00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:21.010
Institute,
which is a biochemical institute.
And he told me,

835
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:26.070
if you are able to reproduce these results and pass it on to a group of persons,

836
00:57:26.931 --> 00:57:28.180
say in two weeks,

837
00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:32.680
then that would mean huge consequences for human mankind.

838
00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:37.690
Then I did the,
the missionary was born,
my mission was born.

839
00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:43.440
And since then I want to get into it and beyond speculation,

840
00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:49.180
prove it by evidence and it is believe emotion,

841
00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:53.470
uh,
and believe are very close together.
We lost the emotion,

842
00:57:53.471 --> 00:57:55.300
we lost a feeling,
the,
the,

843
00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:59.830
the sensitivity and we lost the belief within ourselves.

844
00:57:59.831 --> 00:58:01.960
And we got to go back to the belief.

845
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:04.840
Believe as able to tackle science,

846
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:09.240
believe is able to tackle any problem into a,

847
00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:12.840
in life by every person.
And uh,

848
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.320
believe is chemistry.

849
00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:19.690
And we have to go back to that chemistry and we are showing this insight by

850
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:24.790
scientific,
uh,
evidence and a result.
I think what you're doing is so important.

851
00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:29.210
It's so important to,
to human beings.
Because we were existing,

852
00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:34.290
we were operating under a false assumption and this false assumption had made it

853
00:58:34.331 --> 00:58:35.980
into textbooks.
And we,

854
00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:39.150
for a guy like you comes along and shows a method for changing,

855
00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:42.520
changing your physiology.
And if you could teach that to children early on,

856
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:44.800
he would change their operating paradigm.

857
00:58:44.801 --> 00:58:48.130
You change the way their mind views the world.
You would change.

858
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:52.500
It would change our them at Joe,
Joe Rogan's.

859
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:55.480
Alright.
Pleasure.
Handshake shirt.

860
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:57.700
Now I understand why you can hang by one finger.
I will.

861
00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.020
What does that feeling like,
man,

862
00:58:59.021 --> 00:59:03.760
when you're hanging a mile in the air by one finger,
what does that feel on?
Like,

863
00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:09.070
I felt great.
You know,
all the,
all the things that I do,

864
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:12.370
I never know what before I'm doing it.

865
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.570
So you never know what it's gonna feel like.
Yeah.
What's going to chill.

866
00:59:15.571 --> 00:59:19.210
Act is hanging from your finger before.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I bet.
Then at home,
yeah.

867
00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.260
If you fall when you're a,
uh,
uhs fall,

868
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.750
<v 3>a 30 centimeters.
Right?
Right.
Like Ghana,</v>

869
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:29.210
but a over there it's a different thing.
You know,

870
00:59:29.211 --> 00:59:34.211
you learn to surpass your fears and you would learn to calculate with your body

871
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:35.990
as a part of the calculation.

872
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:40.800
What was the scariest one of these stunts that you tried to attempt this

873
00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:44.640
carriers?
What about the most exciting?
Most,
uh,

874
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:50.170
most of the fear because fear is just,
you know,
uh,
uh,

875
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:55.400
advising sickness within,
um,
which was the one,

876
00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:58.280
maybe it swimming under the ice.

877
00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:03.840
So I lost track lesson to this story.
This is nice.
Uh,

878
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.330
I had no goggles on.
Wow.

879
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:11.720
Why did I doubt dove like one meter thick ice.

880
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:15.920
So the ice is three feet tech for people to know what to meet her as you're

881
01:00:15.921 --> 01:00:19.460
diving into the water.
And where is this in a Finland,
Finland.

882
01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:24.860
Polar polar circle.
Insanely cold water.
It's a,
it's like a needles,

883
01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:26.540
but I was trained,

884
01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:30.560
I did not even feel the needles because that's one thing.

885
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:35.710
And then I did my breathing really good and this was the day before I was going

886
01:00:35.991 --> 01:00:38.990
to do attempting to do,
I will rack up.

887
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:44.710
So I had to general reputation and there was nobody only one diver somewhere,

888
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:50.470
but he was not in the water.
And Ah,
ah,

889
01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:55.780
to me I didn't want to just try and train half the distance.

890
01:00:56.391 --> 01:00:58.740
I was like,
no,
if I have to do with tomorrow,

891
01:00:58.741 --> 01:01:00.680
I'm going to do all the distance now.

892
01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.890
But nobody to Curiel attention.
And nobody was so serious.

893
01:01:06.891 --> 01:01:11.510
They only thought we are the safety around to real record with the television

894
01:01:11.511 --> 01:01:15.650
and this and that and all that.
So I began to do this breathing,

895
01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.970
which you just did.
And then at a certain point,

896
01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:22.310
how are so light headed and this and that,

897
01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:27.080
but then in the water in the cold and you become fully charged where?

898
01:01:27.081 --> 01:01:27.914
To oxygen.

899
01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:28.650
<v 2>Okay.</v>

900
01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:31.480
<v 3>So much that your Ph do elaborate.</v>

901
01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:36.540
Go really up there.
You feel lost.

902
01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:41.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>

903
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.310
<v 3>Okay.</v>

904
01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:45.790
First you need to go under the ice and then you'll begin to swim a stroke by

905
01:01:45.791 --> 01:01:48.970
stroke.
Every stroke is something more than a yard.

906
01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.790
How far are you going under the eyes?
I,

907
01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:55.090
I w w their length at that,
uh,

908
01:01:55.091 --> 01:01:58.450
at the end that roca was about 60 yards.

909
01:01:58.690 --> 01:02:01.510
So 60 yards holding your breath under the ice.

910
01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.280
But in like 40 hours later I could not see anything anymore because my,

911
01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.750
the rate enough froze.
Your retina froze.
Yes.

912
01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:18.680
Ratana froze and I missed the whole at the 60 yards.

913
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.130
I was counting subconsciously.

914
01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.090
I had it all figured out so much strokes.

915
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.000
That means I then I'll arrive at the,

916
01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:34.820
at the other whole hot foreign.
Did you go blind?
Eh,
like,

917
01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.060
uh,
like 70,
75 yards.

918
01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.210
It's when I need to go back.

919
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:45.810
You'll only think they're very instinctively.
Yeah.
That moment,

920
01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:49.740
there is no space for thinking.
And now when you say you went blind,

921
01:02:49.741 --> 01:02:54.630
how much could you see Barry?
Blur,
blur,
Blur.
Yes.

922
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:59.820
So I went on swimming and trying to find a way to the hole,

923
01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:00.930
but I never found it.

924
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:05.040
And I had actually in the distance I made the biggest,

925
01:03:05.041 --> 01:03:09.840
this isn't ever that I could never reproduce this,

926
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:15.240
but doesn't matter.
The thing is I lost a fear of death.

927
01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:16.440
Oh,
right over there.

928
01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:21.330
It's like every animal in the wild dice,
you know,

929
01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:25.830
at in peace one day die or not have an accident or this or that.

930
01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.640
Um,
because the blood is alkaline,

931
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:35.090
Ph level is really up and the body is able to retreat in the nervous system,

932
01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:40.990
then go into the central nervous system and then the terminal of the light and

933
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:45.570
that's it.
You go to sleep.
And I had the same sensation.

934
01:03:45.571 --> 01:03:48.800
My Ph levels was so raw,

935
01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:54.080
Rosen before I went in that there was never a lack of oxygen or the lack of

936
01:03:58.471 --> 01:04:01.620
oxygen was there,
but it was never disturbing.

937
01:04:01.621 --> 01:04:05.160
With the West drawable there's no panic of the entity.

938
01:04:05.161 --> 01:04:09.830
It was absolutely no panic.
Actually I felt a little bit good,
you know,
like,

939
01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:13.920
like a rush,
like going to sleep.
Wow.

940
01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:17.010
So you thought somebody grabbed me death?
Yes.

941
01:04:17.011 --> 01:04:19.980
So somebody grabbed you and said like two times I experienced this,

942
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.790
I lost my fear of death.
And that's a personal story.

943
01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:27.690
I wouldn't try it under a,
you know,

944
01:04:27.691 --> 01:04:32.691
buddy to water these breathing exercises you have to learn first to recondition

945
01:04:33.451 --> 01:04:37.860
your body to its natural state and then you get a different connection.

946
01:04:37.861 --> 01:04:41.010
You are more able and become more conscious of your abilities.

947
01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.440
So someone grabbed you and brought you to the hole?
Yes.

948
01:04:43.441 --> 01:04:46.490
To the 50 meter hole back as we knew it,

949
01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.650
turned around and went backwards trying to find out where the hole was.
Yes,

950
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:55.800
there was more than one horse.
Hair whole was there.
I went that way.

951
01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:59.350
So one was said,
I tried it right there.

952
01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:03.080
They brought me back here.
Okay.
So I did more than doubled it.

953
01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:04.800
So for people listening you,

954
01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:07.590
you missed it by going to the right and then you went to the left and you

955
01:05:07.591 --> 01:05:10.890
couldn't find it.
So there was a 50 meter hole.
And then what was the second hole?

956
01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:14.400
70 meters?
No,
no,
no.
It just one 50 meter.

957
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:19.380
50 meter hill was just one whole.
Okay,
so you just just totally missed it.
Yeah.

958
01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:21.250
And so then they brought you back to the whole,
yeah.

959
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:25.660
So you did accomplish what you set out to,
but you did it with while being blind?

960
01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:29.950
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm still be double the distance.

961
01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:33.620
Did it mess with your vision at all permanently?
No.
No,
no,
no.
No.

962
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:38.260
So when you got out of the water,
how long was it before he could see again?
Um,

963
01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:43.120
almost directly.
Really.
Almost directly.
A blue state.
A little,

964
01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:48.530
but that's what I began to feel as oxygen comes back,

965
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:55.010
uh,
it almost directly was restored again,
I'm,

966
01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:58.150
one of the things that I found fascinating about the Cryo tank is say your

967
01:05:58.151 --> 01:06:01.720
eyeballs don't get cold.
I took,
why does everything gets cold?

968
01:06:01.721 --> 01:06:03.600
But my eyes don't get cold.
I've,
I've,

969
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.300
I've found that fascinating when I'm outside and I'm freezing cold too.

970
01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:10.020
It's never the eyeball itself.
And I don't know if it's,

971
01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.730
there's a lack of nerve endings are,
I don't know what it is.

972
01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.760
We are not billed to swim under eyes,

973
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:20.790
but we are built to be able to walk like a in wits outside for hours and days

974
01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.970
and maintain vision because that's survival.
Right.

975
01:06:27.971 --> 01:06:32.310
But you can also get snow blind,
right?
Like with their white.
Yeah.

976
01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.380
White somehow or another the reflection off the white.
Yeah.

977
01:06:35.381 --> 01:06:38.860
That's the different story.
Yes.
Yeah.
With her.

978
01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:41.740
What I like on Mount Everest,

979
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:47.430
on these mountains actually we are not billed to get up there now either.

980
01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.390
I found out about to,

981
01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:55.600
it's a amazing,
once I hit it.
And you did it in shorts.
Yes.

982
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:58.180
And that piss off the other people that are trying to climb Everest.

983
01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:01.950
So did that piss off the other people that are trying to climb matters because

984
01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:07.000
the tanks and I don't think it is a challenge to do.
We didn't close.

985
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:10.210
Yeah.
Anything I,
it's no challenge.

986
01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:15.580
You are not in contact with the natural environment at that moment,

987
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:20.080
but well how come so many people dive.
It's not a challenge.

988
01:07:20.081 --> 01:07:24.140
It seems like it's a big challenge and they just not prepare properly.
Yeah,
yeah.

989
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:29.030
There's a lack of oxygen over there and if he used all the time oxygen at a

990
01:07:29.031 --> 01:07:34.031
certain point you don't use oxygen and you get in a storm or a blast or a

991
01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.760
wideout to things,
so they knew I was just lost.
Yeah,

992
01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:44.920
I simply lost the up there.
It's a different laws.
Now listen,

993
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:50.340
I am going for the fourth time now climbing Kilimanjaro in Eh,

994
01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.333
in,
in,

995
01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:56.370
in January coming and he and I teach people to do it in a record time without

996
01:07:57.941 --> 01:08:01.630
mountainy or experience and even having you know,

997
01:08:01.631 --> 01:08:06.160
diseases like Roma or asthma or chronic diseases,

998
01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:09.820
things like that.
In four months,
four days.

999
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:14.910
Actually one day in one month I trained them and then they have to do say

1000
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:21.190
<v 1>exercising at home and believing which I would just be in it and no,</v>

1001
01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:23.150
no ego.
We go,

1002
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:28.180
I always tell and then in four months the oldest participant without

1003
01:08:29.451 --> 01:08:34.451
mountaineering experience is 76 years old and we are going to do it in a record

1004
01:08:34.971 --> 01:08:38.150
time.
That's learning how to use,

1005
01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:43.180
if you know how to use the adaptive power of ours and you uh,

1006
01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.880
endorse it with a ride,

1007
01:08:46.881 --> 01:08:51.881
breathing and believe the believe was the neurotransmitters who are influencing

1008
01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:57.320
on some level the breathing brings about the right Ph level.

1009
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:59.150
And then uh,

1010
01:08:59.151 --> 01:09:04.151
and then the adaptive force is able to adapt to enter into the body because the

1011
01:09:04.881 --> 01:09:07.790
chemistry is right.
And when you say the right Ph levels,

1012
01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:11.890
is it something that's been measured?
The difference in the Ph level?

1013
01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:17.080
Yes.
We just completed a new studies and the Chiro,
uh,

1014
01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:20.690
that all the people who are doing this,
uh,

1015
01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:22.220
they had uh,

1016
01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:27.460
Ph level average of 7.8 and then went down to the normal,

1017
01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:34.340
a real natural standard,
which is 7.3,

1018
01:09:34.341 --> 01:09:36.520
7.4,
eh.

1019
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:40.280
But most of us we have lower and more aesthetic,

1020
01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:44.570
steady state levels of a Ph decrease.

1021
01:09:45.230 --> 01:09:48.500
And we did a research on pain.

1022
01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:54.310
Now if you get a few are able to control to 7.6 Ph level,

1023
01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.500
you are able to control the pain signal.
It falls apart.

1024
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:05.600
Try Mary's [inaudible] try mayor is the three components.

1025
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:10.430
And if you bring up the Ph level controlled to 7.6,

1026
01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:13.160
it falls apart.
You don't feel the pain anymore.

1027
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:17.030
And we lost the ability to suppress or control the pain.

1028
01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:22.370
Now with this breathing,
influencing on the Ph level,
uh,

1029
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.580
consciously,
you're able to come to learn to control the pain.

1030
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:30.590
We just finished a studies and a hundred percent school once again.
Wow.

1031
01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.750
Now this Mount Kilimanjaro thing,

1032
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:36.460
is this the first time you've ever led a group of people say a third time

1033
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:41.330
already?
Would you like anything else to drink
more coffee or anything?
Oh yeah,

1034
01:10:41.331 --> 01:10:46.210
yeah,
yeah.
Okay.
Let's get a get a few beers.
Oh yeah.
Oh boy.
Here we go.
Yeah,

1035
01:10:46.211 --> 01:10:50.510
sure man.
So this Mount Kilimanjaro thing you are,

1036
01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:52.070
you're going to take these people know,

1037
01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:56.330
do you have any concern or taking a 76 year old person without any understanding

1038
01:10:56.331 --> 01:10:57.500
of their physical condition?

1039
01:10:57.710 --> 01:11:01.130
Do you going to give them a thorough examination or have someone do that or what

1040
01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:03.470
do you,
how are you going to approach the,
you know,

1041
01:11:03.471 --> 01:11:06.740
after 30 years or 35 years,

1042
01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:11.180
almost five 40 years already.
Uh,
you know,

1043
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:16.110
experience of exposing buddy the physiology to extremes.

1044
01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:17.063
I know,

1045
01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:22.250
and I can feel if I'm fit or somebody is able or fit to do,

1046
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:28.110
uh,
being part of a calculation in the extreme.

1047
01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.350
I learned to climb without gear on blogs.

1048
01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:36.890
That means you read the rock first and then you are part of the calculation and

1049
01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:41.310
add a Sam Adams in there.
Okay.

1050
01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:46.210
Good Solos to Eh,
have nausea,
man.
Yeah.
Have a Heineken.
Let's see.

1051
01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:50.790
From your people right now.
That's,
that's German,
right?
Isn't it?
Boston.
Boston.
Oh,

1052
01:11:50.791 --> 01:11:54.900
is that a Boston yesterday?
It wasn't Boston past.

1053
01:11:54.901 --> 01:11:59.700
And they say about Chicago and the other one.
Yeah.
Oh,
oh,
oh.
So it's Heineken.

1054
01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:01.860
Heineken.
What does that start from Germany?

1055
01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:07.100
[inaudible] isn't that from as to how to staff your people?
Yeah.
People,

1056
01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:10.110
yeah.
People have,
uh,
accomplished some incredible things.

1057
01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.750
Holland is the birthplace,
the birthplace,

1058
01:12:12.751 --> 01:12:16.020
but one of the greatest star kickboxing nations in the world.
Yeah,
yeah.

1059
01:12:16.021 --> 01:12:19.050
My training.
Oh,
Allister over.
I want to talk about that.

1060
01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:20.970
So what are you doing for Alster?

1061
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.800
The same my data with you and get into you.
Yeah.
You know,

1062
01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:29.010
if you do cheers.
Yeah.
Cheers man.

1063
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:37.190
All right.
So,
um,
so with Allister,
how did,
I asked her,
found out about it,

1064
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:40.170
find out about you and how did this get started?

1065
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.930
Alice data is absolutely not stupid,

1066
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:47.350
is a very controlling and intelligent person.
Yeah.

1067
01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:51.990
It's very smart guy kick calculating what he is doing and he's trying to get

1068
01:12:51.991 --> 01:12:56.950
always the best out of it.
So he came to me,
uh,

1069
01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:01.140
because of people saying,
Hey,
this guy is scientifically endorsed.

1070
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:06.390
He got some methods about breathing and focus and it's all been measured.

1071
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.260
So he asked me,
uh,
to come by.

1072
01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:14.610
He came by and this is in Holland?
In Holland.
In Amsterdam.

1073
01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:19.060
Where does beer come from?
Two chairs.

1074
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:26.910
And we just had,
we had a talk and uh,

1075
01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:31.140
demand is so in control of his body.
He can,

1076
01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:34.590
he can read my mind when he's talking with me,

1077
01:13:35.130 --> 01:13:36.840
if I'm being right,

1078
01:13:36.841 --> 01:13:41.841
because he can feel what happens with his logic and his body.

1079
01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:46.650
So he thought it to be right and okay.

1080
01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:51.180
And then he is,
he's listening.
He's a pupil.

1081
01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.550
He's very humble.
He's a nice guy.
That's all.

1082
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:59.160
And uh,
he has learning,
listening,
respecting.

1083
01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:04.320
Okay.
And Danny took it up.
I told him what to do.

1084
01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.030
I told him,

1085
01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:10.620
you have to regain the connection with the hormonal system.

1086
01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:12.760
You know,
when you fight,

1087
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:17.790
you try everything and your hormonal system gets out of balance.

1088
01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.100
Sort of is possible from Strauss.
Yeah.

1089
01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.770
From stress meaning a,
yeah.
And those people live in their extremes.
So,

1090
01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:30.610
eh,
your mono system gets out of control and uh,

1091
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.230
we bring it back first and Youdo you know what you want,

1092
01:14:35.231 --> 01:14:37.360
you want to win,
but more of it,

1093
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:42.250
you want to have control with it and you want to feel that you are able to stare

1094
01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:47.200
and to direct your body.
And in the training you want to get better.

1095
01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:49.210
But if you frustrate yourself,

1096
01:14:49.211 --> 01:14:53.910
then it's because of hormonal disbalance and a training,

1097
01:14:53.911 --> 01:14:56.560
training,
training.
But it doesn't get through.

1098
01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.540
And what we do is just taking away the blockages and the balance.

1099
01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:06.820
The disbalance balance does,
you got to open way because you want to win,

1100
01:15:06.821 --> 01:15:10.540
you want to increase,
you want to become better and you know you're feeling

1101
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:17.150
and then take up with cold water.
I told him and uh,
the,

1102
01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:20.320
uh,
easy does it you in a bit.
You begin with cold showers,

1103
01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:23.860
that's hill and now he's taking cold baths,
you know,

1104
01:15:23.861 --> 01:15:28.560
ice bath every day and it's two weeks later he told me,

1105
01:15:28.561 --> 01:15:31.910
uh,
he is improving so much that,

1106
01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:35.890
that you regained the connection with his,
uh,

1107
01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:39.540
deeper physiological systems.
The,
and the green and the,

1108
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:43.870
and the immune immune system as well.
But he is healthy already.

1109
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:48.520
But the systems that's important for him because you know,

1110
01:15:48.521 --> 01:15:51.880
it's pure adrenaline.
What happens,
right when you do a match,

1111
01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:56.770
but you're living to word it.
I learned,
I've learned how to deal with the mind.

1112
01:15:57.130 --> 01:15:59.710
I explained about the mind as well.

1113
01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:04.990
And now two weeks later I got a phone.
He told me,

1114
01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:10.770
I'm going to win.
Why?
Because I feel I've taking charge.

1115
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:15.660
I'm in charge with my own body and I'm not talking,
uh,
you know,
bigger.

1116
01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:19.750
Alistair Overeem is his person.
I don't know the way he is now,

1117
01:16:19.751 --> 01:16:24.751
but I'm going to meet him say next week and do a lost training directing simply

1118
01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:32.010
awakening his ability.
Like everybody,
Eh,

1119
01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:37.020
the ability to connect with a deeper physiological systems within our body,

1120
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.680
enabling us to do anything because this adaptive power is really so far out.

1121
01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.231
It will for fighters,

1122
01:16:47.231 --> 01:16:50.890
that can be a huge advantage because one of the big things that happened to them

1123
01:16:50.891 --> 01:16:55.090
during hard training is their endocrine system starts to break down.

1124
01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.040
Their testosterone levels are very,

1125
01:16:57.041 --> 01:17:01.240
very low during training camps because they're oftentimes overtraining,

1126
01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:04.180
meaning their body can't recover and they're training so hard.

1127
01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.650
My body doesn't have enough time to recover.

1128
01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:10.100
You think that you can stimulate the production of testosterone?
Yeah.
In people's

1129
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.430
<v 3>bodies.
Oh yes.
You know,
Eh,
W W eh.</v>

1130
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:18.530
Think logically testosterone is about program creation and all that,

1131
01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:22.640
you know,
all right,
and the fans of your territory.

1132
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:27.380
It's a natural thing.
But if you keep on training,
training,

1133
01:17:27.381 --> 01:17:28.220
training,
training,

1134
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:33.430
then the body shuts down because there is no meat to the fence.

1135
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:38.270
You are looking for some imaginary opponent.

1136
01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:42.350
That's what the nature of this and the endocrine system is telling you.

1137
01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:47.570
So you have to learn to control this primitive reactive part of ours.

1138
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:54.050
It's a primitive brain,
the brainstem and learn to bring it under your dominion.

1139
01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:59.420
And as we are,
uh,
if you take on too much adrenaline,

1140
01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:04.310
then it becomes acidic and you mess up the endocrine systems.

1141
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:08.630
Very logic.
Now we have shown that without,
for us,

1142
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.960
we are able to produce more adrenaline than somebody in a,

1143
01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:19.100
in a,
a low going into a bungee jump,
you know,
very fearful.
Allow.

1144
01:18:19.170 --> 01:18:21.260
Do you do that?
Like you were,
you were saying that earlier,

1145
01:18:21.261 --> 01:18:24.870
like if someone's lying and what did you do?
The breathing method.
Exactly.

1146
01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:29.780
But do you have them visualize something terrifying or no at once again,
if I,

1147
01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.390
if I want my bear,
I'm not grabbing this telephone.
Right.

1148
01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:37.900
And they're not an either this right.
Nowadays,
you know,

1149
01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:42.620
I just be busy with what you,
what you are aiming at.

1150
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.270
Okay.
That's it.

1151
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:48.200
And visualization comes from itself.
You know,

1152
01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:52.310
you see a mountain and you feel I want to climb this,

1153
01:18:52.730 --> 01:18:57.730
then it'll be there every time you are there and tuning the body to work the,

1154
01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.750
the eventual performance.
Uh,

1155
01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:07.280
and this is the way it is done inside.
And sometimes you can,

1156
01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:08.173
you know,

1157
01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:13.160
visualize first and then I say,
well,

1158
01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:16.650
I'm breathing a badger knows by this.

1159
01:19:17.770 --> 01:19:21.140
I dare say that.
Oh,
it doesn't matter what kind of hole you use,

1160
01:19:21.141 --> 01:19:24.590
just make it happen.
But how do you stimulate adrenaline though?

1161
01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:26.330
Like if you have someone lie in the back,

1162
01:19:26.331 --> 01:19:28.820
like if you have me lie on my back and I'm starting to do your breathing

1163
01:19:28.821 --> 01:19:33.590
exercises.
Gotcha.
You know what we do?
Okay.
A day.
So odd in the university

1164
01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:38.650
they saw,
they got,

1165
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:43.460
they got these devices to measure the saturation of oxygen in the blood.

1166
01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:48.890
And normally at sea level,
like here,
it's like 100%,

1167
01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.920
but this is only the measurement device.

1168
01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:57.160
They created it and it goes from a hundred percent to 30% 30% everybody's dad,

1169
01:19:58.610 --> 01:20:03.500
something like that.
At 40 50.
Normally the people die.

1170
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:08.400
So they have these measurements.
They measured us,

1171
01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:12.760
<v 1>no,
the guys I e trade and they saw,</v>

1172
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:15.900
uh,
not only a hundred percent,

1173
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:21.470
but probably 150% but the measurement device is wrong.

1174
01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:27.410
It's just based on what we think that our body is capable of.

1175
01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:33.060
I put this aside,
we do this breathing exercise.

1176
01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:37.920
Then you see it directly on the monitors.

1177
01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:42.330
What happens if you're,
uh,
are without,

1178
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:46.560
eh in the lungs staying without air in the lungs like you did two and a half

1179
01:20:46.561 --> 01:20:50.370
minutes.
What happens?
Everybody after one and a half minute,

1180
01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:55.110
got to do this a hundred percent on the device,
on the Monitor,

1181
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:59.730
probably 150,
but it was only visual,

1182
01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:04.740
really showing and invisible after one and a half minute that the a hundred

1183
01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:10.920
percent was rich.
Then went into 90,
80,
70,
60,

1184
01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:15.330
50,
40,
30 measurement device shuts down,
Bang,

1185
01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:20.190
we go even lower.
And then a buddy,

1186
01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:24.600
eh,
the primitive bearer brain in the brainstem,

1187
01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:28.420
the reptilian brain who only reaction cold,

1188
01:21:28.421 --> 01:21:33.270
like reptilian called warm deprivation of air,
things like that,

1189
01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:35.820
you know,
very primitive.
We got a Po,

1190
01:21:36.330 --> 01:21:40.200
the brainstem of ours works like that.
It react.

1191
01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:45.030
So at that moment it doesn't think,

1192
01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:48.270
Eh,
uh,
there is no oxygen.
No,

1193
01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:52.770
I just reacts because there is no oxygen inside the body.

1194
01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:57.400
But because the Ph levels we went,
uh,

1195
01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:01.380
have been resined,
nothing is happening to the body.

1196
01:22:02.730 --> 01:22:06.530
We at the primitive brain is reacting the,
the,

1197
01:22:06.610 --> 01:22:10.680
the brainstem and it gets into this survival mode.

1198
01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:16.290
And so much that that adrenaline wow is over there.

1199
01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:20.070
So it's just about holding the breath for long periods of time.

1200
01:22:20.071 --> 01:22:23.790
While you were symbolism,
I will sample as well.
And that causes a dry well,

1201
01:22:23.791 --> 01:22:27.630
that makes sense.
Yeah.
And,
and,
and that,
that way,

1202
01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:31.710
without any damage in the brain or nothing like that,

1203
01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:36.180
it also begins to,
if you do to on a regular basis,

1204
01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:38.280
it begins to,
uh,

1205
01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:42.540
reestablish neuro patterns between the Neocortex,
the,

1206
01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:46.440
the surface of the brain,
our thinking,
and the primitive brain.

1207
01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:47.251
Does that make sense?

1208
01:22:47.251 --> 01:22:50.370
Because when you had me hold my breath and I only did it for two minutes,

1209
01:22:50.371 --> 01:22:54.060
but I was starting to panic.
I was like,
my body was going,

1210
01:22:54.061 --> 01:22:56.550
what are you doing dude?
What are you doing?
Come on,
breathe,
bitch.

1211
01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:01.460
My body was telling me,
come on,
breathe,
breathe.
Hey Joe Rogan isn't bitch.

1212
01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.560
I call myself a bitch all the time.
It's my secret.

1213
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.830
<v 3>My secret is I'm a fan.
He's a bitch.</v>

1214
01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:13.690
My secret is I'm never impressed by me.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Me Too.
Me Too.

1215
01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:18.510
Now this Mount Kilimanjaro thing,
um,

1216
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.960
I want to get back to that because that to me what's dangerous about that is not

1217
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:23.740
you.

1218
01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:26.800
Because I think that you have a very deep understanding of who you are and what

1219
01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:29.320
you're capable of.
And obviously you've done amazing things,

1220
01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:34.540
but these other people,
how do you know them?
Do you know how,
how well

1221
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:39.580
you know them and how you love that

1222
01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.940
feeling as understanding.
Right.

1223
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:48.010
And we have the ability like living in a a,
you know what a pack of wolves.

1224
01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:51.220
No,
we are mammals.
Stool and a pack of people.

1225
01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:57.090
We are able to exist in nature and as I know the challenges in nature and how to

1226
01:23:58.151 --> 01:24:01.120
counteract it with the interaction with the nature.

1227
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.060
I know how to lead people through uh,

1228
01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:09.670
extreme in extreme conditions and already did it twice.

1229
01:24:09.730 --> 01:24:11.170
First of all,
26 people.

1230
01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:16.171
The oldest one was 65 people without mountaineering experience and with four

1231
01:24:17.891 --> 01:24:18.880
bypasses,

1232
01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:24.180
coronary by 65 years old and coronary artery bypass us.

1233
01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:29.000
And uh,
a guy with cancer,
two people with the disease of chrome,

1234
01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:31.000
one went to Roma Arthritis,

1235
01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:35.740
[inaudible] Roma,
Roma,
Roma Arthritis,
arthritis,

1236
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:40.080
arthritis,
atrocious.
You haven't had all kinds and uh,

1237
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:44.200
outer immune diseases and we had a lot of them.

1238
01:24:44.230 --> 01:24:48.200
Ms Multiple Sclerosis for example.
Yes,

1239
01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:52.300
you've been able to help those people improve their conditions and are not only

1240
01:24:52.570 --> 01:24:57.040
26 people and we told them at a,
in the press,

1241
01:24:57.430 --> 01:25:02.430
we are going to climb the Kilimanjaro in three days in shorts and everybody's

1242
01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:06.970
saying,
but in this condition,
without mountainy arena experience,

1243
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:12.160
people are going to die.
The physiology states that this is not possible.

1244
01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:17.200
Right.
Many,
many,
many,
many arguments.
And then we didn't do it in three days.

1245
01:25:17.201 --> 01:25:21.730
We did it in two days.
Oh my God.
And they change these guys.

1246
01:25:21.731 --> 01:25:26.500
They have a lot more control within their lives and they know from within.

1247
01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:28.360
Then last year,

1248
01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:33.420
oh this year or January we did it once again over and we did it.

1249
01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:39.060
We took 16 hours off from the two days from the 46 hours where two 31 48 hours

1250
01:25:42.431 --> 01:25:47.431
to 31 hours and this time the oldest man is 76.

1251
01:25:47.741 --> 01:25:51.640
I can feel it if one is able to do with it,
it's him.

1252
01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:57.530
And then I have still have to see about the youngsters because their mind is yet

1253
01:25:58.930 --> 01:26:02.560
not so in connection with the body.

1254
01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:06.140
That's that you say that because ultra marathons,
um,

1255
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:08.540
are typically run by older people.

1256
01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:13.070
It's one of the more interesting aspects of that endurance sport is brain body

1257
01:26:13.071 --> 01:26:17.080
connection.
They,
they're also tougher.
Yes.
And a no.

1258
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:22.090
I would like to Bush man [inaudible] they haunt a kudu like for two days and the

1259
01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:27.410
Kudos
and they just persistence training.
Ah,

1260
01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:28.620
that's us.

1261
01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:33.620
We do conscious breathing and this conscious breathing is a neural pattern

1262
01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:38.120
between the body and mind and the animal hasn't got it.
Well,

1263
01:26:38.121 --> 01:26:41.420
the animals also not physiologically cable running long distances,

1264
01:26:41.421 --> 01:26:43.760
like a person who is they?
They,
they tire out there.

1265
01:26:43.761 --> 01:26:47.540
They're built for sprints and that's what they do.
They just wear them out.

1266
01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:50.210
They persistent tent.
They chase him down and they wear him out.

1267
01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:54.770
But oftentimes they're too exhausted at the end of it to even enjoy it.
Yes,

1268
01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:59.810
yes.
Bye.
Okay.
I,
but it shows once again,
the mind,

1269
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:03.980
the mind and the breathing because the breathing,

1270
01:27:03.981 --> 01:27:05.180
when people get a headache,

1271
01:27:05.181 --> 01:27:08.630
which is the first sign of a acclimatization problems,

1272
01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:13.680
a high altitude disease and a mass acute mountain sickness is what it is,

1273
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:19.760
then I just make them breathe and bring more oxygen to the brain.
So if you're,

1274
01:27:19.761 --> 01:27:23.690
if you're climbing up,
you're not using any of those oxygen tanks,

1275
01:27:23.691 --> 01:27:25.740
and a lot of those people use not thinking.

1276
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:28.160
And when you hear about people dying up there,

1277
01:27:28.161 --> 01:27:31.700
do you think that you could have helped those people if you taught them?
Oh yeah,

1278
01:27:31.701 --> 01:27:36.260
I'm techniques.
Oh,
yes,
yes,
yes.
Oh,
absolutely.
I saw all the,
you know,

1279
01:27:36.261 --> 01:27:41.261
26 people ranging from 22 to 65 with coronary problems with,

1280
01:27:42.710 --> 01:27:47.660
uh,
all these diseases and still able to do within two days in shorts.

1281
01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:53.180
That means all in shorts.
All in short,
76 year old guys in shorts.
Yes,
yes.

1282
01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:57.440
And women.
Yeah.
Not,
not only in shorts.
Uh,
wow.

1283
01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:01.820
But it happens,
you know,
and it's possible people transform,

1284
01:28:02.370 --> 01:28:06.800
people get back to their natural ability.
That's it.
Wow.

1285
01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:08.090
That's,
um,

1286
01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:11.870
that's a big responsibility to take a group of people like that and to,
to be,

1287
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:15.680
you understand?
Yeah.
It is a big responsibility,

1288
01:28:15.681 --> 01:28:19.370
but I'm so sure because I trust nature.

1289
01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:24.980
[inaudible] so I just respond to what I feel naturally with these people.

1290
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:28.370
But what if you get somebody with you that's a legitimate bitch?

1291
01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:32.540
Like what if someone signs up for it and they just,
it just fold under pressure.

1292
01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:35.570
There are people like that,
that do that.
Yeah,
I know.
I know what you mean.

1293
01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.350
I say ego,
no ego.
We go like before,
right.

1294
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:41.300
And this is that.

1295
01:28:41.301 --> 01:28:46.301
And I got a very good sense of control on and detecting if somebody is hiding

1296
01:28:47.151 --> 01:28:47.984
something.

1297
01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:52.220
Because if you hide something and you have an attitude on the mountain,

1298
01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:56.990
the mountain is much stronger than you that is going to break you.

1299
01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:00.140
And you think that would be part of that would be a big issue with the attitude

1300
01:29:00.141 --> 01:29:01.950
of the person.
Yes,
yes.

1301
01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:03.390
<v 0>It will,
will uh,</v>

1302
01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:08.400
horrify the person said to ration and then it's not in a way he will,

1303
01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:13.680
uh,
he will block us of going up,
you know,

1304
01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:18.360
and get a rate amount is just a problem but he won't be,

1305
01:29:18.361 --> 01:29:22.860
he or she won't be able to get up on the mountain anymore.

1306
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:27.660
And you're saying an attitude meaning like a negative attitude or an attitude of

1307
01:29:27.690 --> 01:29:31.750
ego,
like the ego protecting you from giving in and,
and,
and,

1308
01:29:31.751 --> 01:29:35.700
and if realizing your true potential,
right.
You have to learn to let go,

1309
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:38.340
like in the cold as well.
You have to learn to let go.

1310
01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:43.760
Then things can happen in the body naturally and that you are able to manipulate

1311
01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:48.000
and they can absorb your mindset as well.
They can absorb your example.

1312
01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:48.900
And that's one of the things,

1313
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:52.740
like I can tell just talking to you and being around you,
that you,
you have,

1314
01:29:52.741 --> 01:29:56.970
this is very powerful belief in what you're saying and what you're doing.

1315
01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:59.230
And when people around you and they

1316
01:30:02.370 --> 01:30:03.600
fucking good bitch,
man,

1317
01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:11.360
we love live.
Well,
you know what I'm saying?
I love you too.
People absorb.

1318
01:30:11.361 --> 01:30:15.210
It's back when,
when people around someone like you that has this legitimate,

1319
01:30:15.211 --> 01:30:19.560
powerful belief in what you're saying and what you've proven to be true,

1320
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:22.740
then other people absorb that.
And it's one,

1321
01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:27.510
it's a thing that if someone has an attitude,
meaning a negative attitude,

1322
01:30:27.511 --> 01:30:30.850
or they have too much ego,
they're gonna say,
wow,
who the fuck's this guy?
Well,

1323
01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:32.900
why does he think he knows this?
Well,
you know,
you know,

1324
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:34.740
you know what I've done when we tell you what I've done,

1325
01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:39.240
you know that type of person is going to fall apart,
right?
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

1326
01:30:39.250 --> 01:30:39.790
yeah,
yeah.

1327
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:44.790
I always blocks the hoc nature is my teacher and he is merciless but righteous.

1328
01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.400
Mm.
Yeah.
Merciless.
But righteous is true.

1329
01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:53.160
You know what is possible?

1330
01:30:53.161 --> 01:30:57.940
Because you have achieved it and they know that you know this truly,
you know,

1331
01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:01.370
there are,
there are people you know,
uh,
uh,

1332
01:31:01.410 --> 01:31:06.180
in taekwondo that the teacher is a called a Saba Nim.
You know,

1333
01:31:06.181 --> 01:31:10.020
like Sensei and karate is Sabam Nim is the Korean version of it.

1334
01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:14.250
And what that means,
the literal translation is one who leads by example.

1335
01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.800
And so,
but you leading by this example,
you,
you,

1336
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:21.030
you doing this and showing these people that this is all possible.
Yes.

1337
01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:22.710
They absorb that when you,

1338
01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:26.420
that's one of the reasons why it's so important to be around and we got notified

1339
01:31:26.490 --> 01:31:30.630
nor very people.
Yeah.
When you're around them,
you take that in,

1340
01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:31.560
who take that hit.

1341
01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:35.010
And when you're around people who are troubled and were falling apart and

1342
01:31:35.011 --> 01:31:38.920
failing at everything,
you take that into and it's bad for you.
You know,

1343
01:31:38.921 --> 01:31:39.360
when you could,

1344
01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:42.570
you could be around people that are always in trouble and your life will be

1345
01:31:42.571 --> 01:31:46.500
affected by their negativity.
Yes.
So when you take these people with you,

1346
01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:51.000
you are raising them up with your own mind,
with your own,

1347
01:31:51.001 --> 01:31:55.830
your own belief in what you have done and what they can do.
You make them better.

1348
01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:01.320
Yes sir.
It is.
That way we shoot,
heal each other again.
Yeah.

1349
01:32:01.450 --> 01:32:04.300
And we can,
we can get everybody does their own part.
Yes.

1350
01:32:04.330 --> 01:32:05.740
If everybody gets in that fucking water,

1351
01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:09.940
don't be scared and not water.

1352
01:32:10.690 --> 01:32:15.640
Do you think that cold water is maybe even better than like a cryo chamber

1353
01:32:15.641 --> 01:32:19.150
because it's so hard to breathe in cold water?
You know,

1354
01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:21.700
when I was hosting a fear factor,

1355
01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:26.380
one of the hardest things that we had people do was cold water stunts because,

1356
01:32:26.381 --> 01:32:29.640
uh,
you're,
if you're,
especially if you're not used to it,
one,
I mean,

1357
01:32:29.670 --> 01:32:34.360
I jumped in cold water before.
One of the craziest feelings is you can't breathe.

1358
01:32:34.570 --> 01:32:36.470
Like when you get in the water,
you body,
it was,

1359
01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:40.960
it's like this weird thing where you bought,
you can't,

1360
01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:45.940
even if your head is above water,
you can't,
like if I get in a pool,
okay.

1361
01:32:45.941 --> 01:32:50.920
Like a normal pool,
like a swimming pool.
Um,
I am,
it's nice.
I can breathe.

1362
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:54.220
I breathe just like I can right now.
But if you get in cold water,

1363
01:32:54.221 --> 01:32:58.450
even if you're up to the same level,
your head is above water,
you can't breathe.

1364
01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:03.600
It constricts your body's ability to take in oxygen.
You're like,
Ooh,
Ooh,
Ooh,

1365
01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:04.653
Ooh.

1366
01:33:05.050 --> 01:33:10.050
Do you think then in that sense that maybe there's more benefit even to getting

1367
01:33:11.111 --> 01:33:15.460
in a tub of ice and water than there isn't one of those cryo chambers?

1368
01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:20.290
I think so,
yes.
Yeah.
You see it longer too,
right?
Yes.

1369
01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:24.490
A USC had a difficulty with a cold water.
You see,

1370
01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:25.773
and as you see it,

1371
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:30.870
that means that it needs a greater performance and greater control over the body

1372
01:33:33.370 --> 01:33:37.960
to do that.
Yeah.
But then why don't you do this consciously?

1373
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:42.990
You get a bigger control over your body and you are able to perform better.

1374
01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:48.250
And it's a avascular thing.
I can explain,
but it takes quite some time.

1375
01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:49.630
So maybe it's like the,

1376
01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:53.470
maybe the smart thing to do is to do both things is do like a cryo chamber for

1377
01:33:53.471 --> 01:33:56.980
the physical effects because they say that the cytokines are released in the

1378
01:33:56.981 --> 01:33:59.950
body.
When you get to like 150 degrees below zero,

1379
01:33:59.951 --> 01:34:03.650
like that's like the most benefit where your body produces the most anti

1380
01:34:03.651 --> 01:34:04.990
inflammatory reaction.

1381
01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:09.760
You don't get that cold when you get in the ice bath with water and the ice

1382
01:34:09.761 --> 01:34:11.620
doesn't get to 250 degrees below zero.

1383
01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:16.620
But maybe that there's more benefit with the mind and with controlling the

1384
01:34:16.811 --> 01:34:21.811
breathing in that respect because you have to breathe in deeper longer and you

1385
01:34:22.151 --> 01:34:26.410
can sit in an ice bath for 20 minutes as opposed to the three minutes of the,

1386
01:34:26.650 --> 01:34:30.250
like when I've,
when I've taken people into the Cryo therapy place,
you know,

1387
01:34:30.251 --> 01:34:32.360
they say,
I don't think I could do it.
I'm like,
well,
the first time you do it,

1388
01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:34.270
you're going to do it for 22 for two minutes.

1389
01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:38.950
You count to 60 twice and it's over.
Just go one,
two,
three,
four,

1390
01:34:38.951 --> 01:34:42.490
five.
So you do that.
You're,
you're one 10th of the ways there.

1391
01:34:42.491 --> 01:34:47.200
He can't to six you one 10th of the way to 60 can do it 10 times.
You get to 60,

1392
01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:50.620
do it again and you're done.
It's over.
It's two minutes is nothing.

1393
01:34:50.621 --> 01:34:52.810
You can hold your breath for two minutes.
It's not that hard.

1394
01:34:53.110 --> 01:34:58.040
But ice bath is a different story.
Again,
that ice bath you into that thing

1395
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.440
<v 3>and it's all half eyes,
half water use.</v>

1396
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:08.270
That's when you really have to,
so this,
but you can't,
for athletes,

1397
01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:12.050
you can't train after you do the ice bath after you the ice bath,

1398
01:35:12.051 --> 01:35:15.620
your body is so cold that they say you can't work out afterwards,

1399
01:35:15.621 --> 01:35:18.320
but you can work out after you do cryotherapy.

1400
01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:21.860
So maybe like the benefit for athletes is dual combination of the two things.

1401
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:26.180
Yeah,
sure,
sure,
sure.
Uh,
though,
when I get the,

1402
01:35:26.181 --> 01:35:31.181
I got these people going done with a cup and within a couple of hours you will

1403
01:35:31.791 --> 01:35:34.340
see that they are able to do so much more.

1404
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:38.360
And that's that wakening the right Ph levels.
Once again,

1405
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:41.930
controlling it by breathing and focus,
using focus.

1406
01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:43.940
And then,
uh,

1407
01:35:43.970 --> 01:35:48.020
having a lot more control over the chemistry and the chemistry is needed,

1408
01:35:48.021 --> 01:35:52.610
controlled when you get the impact of the cold,
which is a force,

1409
01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:57.020
you need to produce a cat,
a chemically,
a within your own body,

1410
01:35:57.021 --> 01:36:01.070
consciously a contract force,
a,
uh,

1411
01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:04.640
opposing force.
And we are quite able to do that.

1412
01:36:04.670 --> 01:36:06.810
But you have to know how to do that,
that,
that,
uh,

1413
01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:10.370
and for every individual is a little bit different.

1414
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:14.900
So for tuning like,
so,
uh,
yeah,

1415
01:36:14.901 --> 01:36:18.630
it's a vascular thing,
Eh,
USA,
uh,

1416
01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.720
we are able to go like 20 minutes,
uh,
in a,

1417
01:36:22.730 --> 01:36:25.610
in a cold ice bath eventually,

1418
01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:30.120
but not in a cryo therapy.
I've had a political,
uh,

1419
01:36:30.630 --> 01:36:31.370
uh,

1420
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:36.370
chamber and that's because it works different on the body and Eh,

1421
01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:41.420
it works on the marrow,
it gets deeper insight.
It's a dry,

1422
01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:46.610
it's dry and you know,
water gets 25 times faster into the body.

1423
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:51.290
It's a different force.
And A,
I recommend myself,

1424
01:36:51.291 --> 01:36:52.670
I don't know exactly,

1425
01:36:52.671 --> 01:36:57.050
but I would recommend the ice bath beyond cryotherapy.

1426
01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:02.300
Cryotherapy is,
you know,
very artificial union.
You need a tank,

1427
01:37:02.301 --> 01:37:06.580
you know it is and people are not able to get into it.

1428
01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:11.330
But when you get a means,
I cry therapists.
Okay.

1429
01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:13.820
I always had cold.
The cold is okay,

1430
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:19.220
but there needs to be so much more research.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
for sure.

1431
01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:24.470
Yeah.
There needs to be more research,
so much more research and once again,

1432
01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:29.360
I want to be beyond speculation,
but we are able,

1433
01:37:29.361 --> 01:37:33.590
and that's my belief.
Like 25 years ago I told everybody,

1434
01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:34.580
Eh,

1435
01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:39.380
the automatic nervous system in relationship to the immune system can be

1436
01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:44.381
influenced far deeper and they mocked me then and now it's science and they

1437
01:37:46.041 --> 01:37:50.000
changed the books and now I tell everybody,
listen,

1438
01:37:50.001 --> 01:37:54.740
up held strength.
Happiness is ours.

1439
01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:56.280
That's our natural

1440
01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:01.280
<v 1>state and whatever we'll use therein cold or heat or stress or this or that,</v>

1441
01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:04.830
which has an impact on the body,

1442
01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:09.890
we are able to withstand it or able to control it as we are able to control the

1443
01:38:10.531 --> 01:38:14.880
system,
which is our producing happiness,
strength and health will.

1444
01:38:14.881 --> 01:38:15.714
Your story,

1445
01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:20.790
<v 0>most amazing aspects of it is your story is a story of persistence and a belief</v>

1446
01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:24.610
because you've been doing this for a long time,

1447
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:28.900
but it's not until recently that you've sort of broken through to the
mainstream.

1448
01:38:29.170 --> 01:38:33.820
I think vice has a lot to do with that.
That advice piece was so powerful.
Thanks.

1449
01:38:33.821 --> 01:38:37.840
Vice Vice Shane Smith,
my man.
Yeah,
right on.
When you,
um,

1450
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:40.210
when you watch that piece,

1451
01:38:40.211 --> 01:38:44.200
it's undeniable because you're seeing you do these things and you're,
you're,

1452
01:38:44.201 --> 01:38:46.510
you're watching your enthusiasm and your belief.

1453
01:38:46.511 --> 01:38:47.740
You're taking these other people,

1454
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:52.420
those reporters that were with you through this,
uh,
these experiments in these,

1455
01:38:52.421 --> 01:38:54.100
these techniques.
It,

1456
01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:59.180
it's got to feel good for you to finally be able to get this word out and to,

1457
01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:01.480
to realize that the light is at the end of the tunnel and that you've,

1458
01:39:01.481 --> 01:39:05.620
you've sort of reached this place where you're,
your ideas have gone viral.

1459
01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.640
Yes.
Eh?
Recognition.
Do you know Kelly Star?
It is.

1460
01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:14.380
He's a famous strength and conditioning coach and he's the author of the supple

1461
01:39:14.381 --> 01:39:16.960
leopard becoming the sub.
A leopard is a very,

1462
01:39:16.961 --> 01:39:19.000
very respected strength and conditioning coach.

1463
01:39:19.001 --> 01:39:21.640
When he found out that I was going to,
I didn't even talk to him,

1464
01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:24.430
but he found out through the grapevine that you were going to be on my podcast

1465
01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:27.460
and he sent me a text message and a a paraphrase it,

1466
01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:31.390
but he said that what your work is some of the most important work that's being

1467
01:39:31.391 --> 01:39:34.240
done today in the world of understanding the human body.

1468
01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:36.300
That's what he was saying.
He was saying that you,

1469
01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.650
what you're doing right now for,

1470
01:39:38.651 --> 01:39:42.340
for athletes and for people that want to understand how their body works is some

1471
01:39:42.341 --> 01:39:46.300
of the most important shit that's being happening right now and that four for

1472
01:39:46.301 --> 01:39:49.540
self empowerment for,
for this book.
I mean that's got to feel good for you.

1473
01:39:49.541 --> 01:39:49.990
It does it.

1474
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:53.920
I mean what is the way I like to to to realize that from the time he was 17

1475
01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:56.450
having this calling to jump in the cold water,

1476
01:39:56.451 --> 01:40:00.820
do getting this understanding of what that really means to this breathing
method.

1477
01:40:00.821 --> 01:40:05.670
You're the developing and then having this scientific proof like this,

1478
01:40:05.671 --> 01:40:07.150
this,
this justification.

1479
01:40:07.410 --> 01:40:12.400
This elaborate testing that was done on you that shows that your,

1480
01:40:12.401 --> 01:40:16.030
your method has been,
it's been proven.
It's effective.
It's real.

1481
01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:19.000
It's written down.
It's undeniable

1482
01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.250
<v 1>emotionally.</v>

1483
01:40:20.251 --> 01:40:25.251
I know how deep can you go if you loose your wife at teatro but eh,

1484
01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:28.030
Eh,
Eh,
it,

1485
01:40:28.190 --> 01:40:32.510
it has been healed and it's one of my songs to,

1486
01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:37.620
and I think now I've scientifically proven it.

1487
01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:40.830
Recognition as calm,
the mockery I stopped.

1488
01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:45.450
Respect is regained,
reestablished and that's good.

1489
01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:50.780
But there is still so much work to do because the love and the care for the

1490
01:40:51.331 --> 01:40:55.930
planet,
for the children,
for all living beings still is not established.

1491
01:40:55.931 --> 01:40:59.770
We got to change the mind and we got to go on now.

1492
01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:04.860
I don't want anybody to suffer anymore from and not being happy or not having

1493
01:41:05.741 --> 01:41:08.960
strength or not being healthy and uh,

1494
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:13.940
and bring back to harmony until that we need to go on.
But,

1495
01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:18.730
um,
I'm really thankful for people like yourself and,
uh,

1496
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:23.140
this person Telia Keller.
Yup.
Kelly,
thank you very much for,

1497
01:41:23.170 --> 01:41:25.420
for uh,
endorsing this.

1498
01:41:25.690 --> 01:41:29.570
We are going on and a Harvard is coming in and uh,

1499
01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:32.350
which is one of the best universities of the world.

1500
01:41:32.351 --> 01:41:37.351
And we will undeniably proof that we are able to become strong,

1501
01:41:38.590 --> 01:41:42.850
healthy and happy.
Everybody.
Would it start,
what does Harvard want to do?

1502
01:41:42.851 --> 01:41:44.590
What are their,
I don't know yet,

1503
01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:49.530
but you know the same person you were talking about the Rhonda and Rhonda.

1504
01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:52.960
Who is Patrick?
Yeah,
exactly.
Uh,
Rhonda,
Patrick,

1505
01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.530
she was with me two weeks ago,

1506
01:41:55.650 --> 01:42:00.490
one and a half week in Amsterdam or in a,
in the Netherlands.
My place.

1507
01:42:00.491 --> 01:42:02.290
We had a great,
great discussion.

1508
01:42:02.590 --> 01:42:07.260
Later she looked it up and compare the blood results with uh,

1509
01:42:07.770 --> 01:42:11.580
the threat number one in America,
which is uh,
uh,

1510
01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:15.550
arterial sclerosis.
It's the heart disease.

1511
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:20.750
Anything what goes with the arteries and the veins and all that and that our,

1512
01:42:22.090 --> 01:42:27.000
uh,
alkalosis,
Eh,
within our,
uh,
within this technique is a,

1513
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:31.960
is a capable of influencing in the arterial sclerosis.

1514
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:34.720
Not Little bit pick time,
it's chemistry.

1515
01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:39.640
So we got it not only for the public enemy,
number one,

1516
01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:42.340
killing so many people in us.

1517
01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:45.010
It's all over the western world.

1518
01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:48.520
We got it all to for depression and we got it all.

1519
01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.010
So for any actually any disease,

1520
01:42:51.011 --> 01:42:56.011
we got to bring back the belief that we are beings who naturally should be

1521
01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:59.110
happy,
strong and healthy.

1522
01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:04.150
And as long as there are systems or this or complications and nobody knows

1523
01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:09.250
anymore how to be happy and without war and without tensions and too much

1524
01:43:09.821 --> 01:43:12.070
grieving and too much greed and all that,

1525
01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:17.500
then then we got work to do because the new world is a world of harmony and we

1526
01:43:19.091 --> 01:43:21.670
are working on this and we do this together.

1527
01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:25.860
<v 0>I love the fact that you believe that and I think that it is possible.</v>

1528
01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:30.960
And I really do.
I mean,
I've been called a chink,
my brother.
Yes.
I think,
uh,

1529
01:43:31.010 --> 01:43:34.790
we,
we live in a unique time because we can share information now in a,

1530
01:43:34.791 --> 01:43:39.270
in a way that was never possible just a decade ago.
And like something like this,

1531
01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:43.830
a podcast,
it's free and it goes out instantly and then the world gets it.

1532
01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:47.850
You know what in this information gets shared and transferred and everybody gets

1533
01:43:47.851 --> 01:43:50.730
a hold of it.
And then it reshapes the way people think.
And the,

1534
01:43:50.731 --> 01:43:52.040
the millions of people that will listen

1535
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:54.650
<v 3>to this,
it will absolutely affect their lives.</v>

1536
01:43:54.651 --> 01:43:58.160
And how many of them will act on it.
You know,
it's up to them but it,

1537
01:43:58.161 --> 01:44:01.720
but it is possible and it will become viral because of that.
You know,

1538
01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:06.680
your ideas are becoming viral.
Yes.
And it's a non duct madec choice.

1539
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:11.330
We gave the people no religion.
We give the people results,

1540
01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:15.470
no speculation.
If you do this,
then this happens.

1541
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:19.850
And uh,
we want to bring back the natural state,

1542
01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.310
which is healthy,
strong and healthy.

1543
01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:27.290
Anybody could do this because it's endorsed with thousands of results and these

1544
01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:30.660
are the means you are helping,
Eh,

1545
01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:32.690
to make a paradigm shift possible.

1546
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:38.050
So it's great work what you do and the world needs it and somebody needs to do

1547
01:44:38.271 --> 01:44:43.220
it.
So we do this together.
I told that this is good,
is very good,

1548
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:45.620
but the beautiful thing about what I'm,
it's not really work.

1549
01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:49.940
I was just having a conversation with a cool guy.
Yeah,
that's a beautiful thing.

1550
01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:53.750
Likewise.
Now do you monitor your diet at all?
Do you,

1551
01:44:53.751 --> 01:44:56.030
are you conscious about what kind of foods you eat?
Are you,

1552
01:44:56.031 --> 01:45:00.560
do you have a specific diet that you follow?
They messed up a food really good,

1553
01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:04.380
Eh,
they synthesize that and a volume nice.

1554
01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:07.190
That and they make it really shiny.
You know,

1555
01:45:07.191 --> 01:45:11.200
if you take a paprika you can always,
you don't need a mirror.
Right?
Eh,

1556
01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:15.260
but the nutrients that they're in,
they are changed.
You know,

1557
01:45:15.261 --> 01:45:18.980
it was maybe half or less than the half of the nutrients,

1558
01:45:18.981 --> 01:45:23.620
which normally should be in there.
And vegetables.
You mean vegetable?

1559
01:45:23.630 --> 01:45:25.280
More durable and,
yes,

1560
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:29.810
and a and a and also with the meat and a and all that.

1561
01:45:29.811 --> 01:45:33.170
So my,
my diet is,
uh,

1562
01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:37.850
is more vegetarian and I eat once a day,
once a day,

1563
01:45:38.150 --> 01:45:42.260
once a day,
off to sex or after sex after six.
So you haven't had anything to eat?

1564
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:47.150
No.
Yeah,
after 35 years.

1565
01:45:47.151 --> 01:45:52.010
Today I had my breakfast.
I have,
I have at breakfast,

1566
01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:54.660
but it's because of the jet lag.

1567
01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:00.050
And so what time is it now in Holland and highlight this like at nine hours

1568
01:46:00.051 --> 01:46:04.100
difference.
And I know ahead,
I had,
oh yeah.
Well,
that's,
that makes sense.

1569
01:46:04.101 --> 01:46:08.790
It's midnight takes energy and Becca,
but because I have this control over the,

1570
01:46:08.830 --> 01:46:12.770
uh,
the endocrine systems,
the Melatonin and Serotonin,

1571
01:46:12.771 --> 01:46:17.000
which is the day and the night,
I did not suffer any jet lag,

1572
01:46:17.001 --> 01:46:21.130
but still it takes energy.
You don't suffer jet lag when you fly.
No,

1573
01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:26.860
no,
no,
no.
That,
that's a,
you know,
hormones,
you,

1574
01:46:26.910 --> 01:46:30.440
um,
by doing your breathing method,
you can sort of mitigate that.

1575
01:46:30.441 --> 01:46:32.270
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

1576
01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:37.540
So I have a rule that I follow whenever I go anywhere that I might get jet lag,

1577
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:38.571
which really far,

1578
01:46:38.571 --> 01:46:42.200
I go immediately to the gym is the first thing that I do and the less I'm

1579
01:46:42.201 --> 01:46:44.920
exhausted,
it's to regain strength.
But I've,

1580
01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:51.210
I exert myself in a very,
very way.
I don't do a light workout.

1581
01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:55.030
I do a ferocious workout when I land and I usually reset to me.

1582
01:46:56.150 --> 01:46:59.780
Yeah.
I'm just talking because if you do a ferocious workouts,

1583
01:46:59.850 --> 01:47:04.100
you get into the adrenaline access,
uh,

1584
01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:08.250
of yourself as well by two.
A lot of people might think it's silly,

1585
01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:11.680
but I do a lot of things when I work out.
One of the things that I do is I,

1586
01:47:11.681 --> 01:47:15.510
I work myself into this state that where I feel like what I'm doing is I'm

1587
01:47:15.511 --> 01:47:19.170
fighting for my life.
I mean,
it might sound crazy,
but I,

1588
01:47:19.171 --> 01:47:21.360
I put myself out to the ocean.
Yeah.

1589
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:26.340
If I lift weights or if I run on a elliptical machine or one of those things,

1590
01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:30.660
do a,
some sort of a cardiovascular,
I do it like I'm fighting for my life.

1591
01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.480
And I feel like that's,

1592
01:47:32.490 --> 01:47:34.830
that's the way I know that get the maximum benefits of it.

1593
01:47:34.831 --> 01:47:37.710
And now listening to you,
it makes sense why I'm doing this.

1594
01:47:37.711 --> 01:47:41.520
Like I just been doing this sort of instinctively because I feel like over the

1595
01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:45.300
years of exercising,
that's the way I've gotten the best results.
But people,
they,

1596
01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:47.550
let's say,
what the fuck you doing?
You're not fighting for your life.

1597
01:47:47.770 --> 01:47:51.770
Like I know I'm not,
but in my mind I am,
when I do it,
um,
I'm,

1598
01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:56.100
I'm 100% committed to it because my survival depends on it.

1599
01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:00.970
You are literally,
we're fighting for your life when you do extreme.

1600
01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:04.080
So like I do.
And,
uh,
I,

1601
01:48:04.081 --> 01:48:09.081
you know it and you are very focused at that moment that you have to go beyond

1602
01:48:09.721 --> 01:48:11.910
your conditioning.
You're not playing,

1603
01:48:11.911 --> 01:48:13.770
you're not pretending you and you're under the ice.

1604
01:48:13.771 --> 01:48:18.450
You are fighting for your life and you know a chat like something out of your

1605
01:48:18.451 --> 01:48:21.840
conditioning it with a,
if you are conditioned,

1606
01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:26.760
you are not able to surpass the effects of a,

1607
01:48:26.761 --> 01:48:30.690
of a jet lag.
But if you are able to get out of the conditioning,

1608
01:48:31.110 --> 01:48:32.460
go through it all,

1609
01:48:32.850 --> 01:48:37.850
then you are able to regain contact with the Serotonin and Melatonin balance

1610
01:48:37.891 --> 01:48:42.750
within the body.
And uh,
that's uh,
yeah,
overcome jet lag.

1611
01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:47.010
There is no jet lag.
So one meal a day in the evening.

1612
01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:52.080
And what like what's typically a meal for you?
Well,

1613
01:48:52.081 --> 01:48:53.880
I like pasta.
I'm sorry

1614
01:48:55.890 --> 01:49:00.690
that they say it's terrible at Teardra but I like macaroni.

1615
01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:04.530
It's delicious.
Yeah,
I'm Italian.
I enjoy it.
It tastes great.

1616
01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:09.390
I love it too.
I love it there.
My Pr.
So you eat a lot of pasta.

1617
01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:12.630
Well that's a lot of carbs.
You,
you burn off a lot of calories obviously.

1618
01:49:12.631 --> 01:49:16.230
If you're doing all this crazy physical stuff,
anything.
I can eat anything,

1619
01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:20.430
any amount.
Uh,
but I do it after six o'clock.
Why?

1620
01:49:20.431 --> 01:49:23.090
After six to when you wake up in the morning.
Is that you're not hungry or is it,

1621
01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:29.310
I don't want it to be stuffed.
I eat very lightly,
very lightly.

1622
01:49:29.311 --> 01:49:32.880
In the morning I eat.
My first meal is almost always fruit now.

1623
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.620
That's mostly what I eat.
But that's not workout in the morning.
That's nice.

1624
01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:39.480
I have like a few pieces of fruit and I don't stuff myself.

1625
01:49:39.481 --> 01:49:42.870
I do it until I feel like I don't need any more.
She and I work out.
Sure.

1626
01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:45.900
And then afterwards I'll have something light.
Like today I had some Sushi,

1627
01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:48.130
very light,
you know,
not much.
Sounds great.

1628
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:52.120
<v 0>And then a dinner.
I usually eat a lot,
but I bet it's not about you.</v>

1629
01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:57.100
It's about those people who are getting in so much.

1630
01:49:57.430 --> 01:50:02.260
Right.
It's not,
Eh,
Eh,
they don't use it in the body anymore.

1631
01:50:02.290 --> 01:50:06.340
It's a thinking and too many calories and they have no control,

1632
01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:09.310
but it tastes good.
It says about it.
See for,
I think for a lot of people,

1633
01:50:09.311 --> 01:50:12.790
the problem is they go to a job that they don't really enjoy and they're stuck

1634
01:50:12.791 --> 01:50:16.510
in traffic and then they get to work and the reward is they'll have a donut,

1635
01:50:16.690 --> 01:50:18.940
they'll have some coffee,
they'll have a,
a break,

1636
01:50:18.941 --> 01:50:23.941
an egg sausage sandwich with cheese and mayonnaise we want,

1637
01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:28.540
but it's you're getting sensations when you're eating that that are pleasurable

1638
01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:33.350
and that's the reward and it's to take that a reward away from them.
You're,

1639
01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:33.671
you're,

1640
01:50:33.671 --> 01:50:38.671
you're giving them a few less bright spots and otherwise dull day.

1641
01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:43.480
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
Is what you call it.
And that,
so,

1642
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:46.330
Eh,
the day's got to be dull.

1643
01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:52.140
We got to bring back the intensity of the wonder of the day.

1644
01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:57.900
And that comes with it being consciously connected with the depth of your

1645
01:50:58.710 --> 01:51:03.260
physiological systems and also comes with making good choices as to where you

1646
01:51:03.261 --> 01:51:07.900
are,
what you do for a living and how you spend your time.
Oh yes.
Wait,

1647
01:51:07.901 --> 01:51:09.160
we need to be creative.

1648
01:51:09.161 --> 01:51:14.161
All of us because creation and being creative is the expression of the soul and

1649
01:51:14.711 --> 01:51:18.650
the soul needs to breathe.
Like anything,
you know,
and,
uh,

1650
01:51:18.750 --> 01:51:20.760
it needs to expand in consciousness.
Yeah.

1651
01:51:20.770 --> 01:51:23.800
I've always had a real hard time with the expression creative people.

1652
01:51:23.801 --> 01:51:25.420
This guy's creative.
He's creative.

1653
01:51:25.421 --> 01:51:29.500
She's creative because people are all creative.
Everyone is creative.

1654
01:51:29.501 --> 01:51:32.410
It's just a matter of finding what it is that you're creative with.

1655
01:51:32.590 --> 01:51:35.350
Some people creative with the constructing cars.

1656
01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:39.250
Some people creative with clothing.
Oh yeah.
People are creative.

1657
01:51:39.251 --> 01:51:41.830
Like it's a part of being a human being.
It's not,

1658
01:51:41.831 --> 01:51:46.450
it's saying someone's a creative person.
It's like saying there are hard rock.

1659
01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:50.100
You know,
everyone,
every,
everybody's creative.
Yeah.
I did.

1660
01:51:50.110 --> 01:51:54.630
[inaudible] which goes along when people are creative.

1661
01:51:55.110 --> 01:51:58.750
It's beautiful.
It's,
it's,
it's a natural part of being a child.

1662
01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:03.780
Every child draws and paints and plays with things and sculpts and makes little

1663
01:52:04.721 --> 01:52:07.540
things.
It's a GNAT and it gets beaten out of us.

1664
01:52:07.570 --> 01:52:09.190
It gets beaten out of us in school,

1665
01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:13.030
beaten out of us with jobs and beaten out of us with responsibilities and

1666
01:52:13.031 --> 01:52:17.830
careers.
Paying Floyd.
Yeah.
A teacher.
Kids.
Hello.
Yeah.
No,

1667
01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:22.760
the brick in the wall.
Ah,
Shit.

1668
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:28.320
My man.
Yeah.
That's,
um,

1669
01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:31.690
but for a lot of people,
they're like,
that's great,
but how do I get out of this?

1670
01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:35.020
And that's unfortunately,
that's your own path.

1671
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:38.530
You've got to figure that out on your own.
But if,
if you can,
the problem,

1672
01:52:38.531 --> 01:52:42.520
if people also people get burdened down with bills and responsibilities and
debt,

1673
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:44.860
credit card debt,
first of all,
they get you with student loan debt.

1674
01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:46.280
I don't know how it is in Holland.

1675
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:50.780
<v 3>Do you guys have a public universities?
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
The same thing,
man.</v>

1676
01:52:50.781 --> 01:52:51.200
That's her word.

1677
01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:53.630
There's a resistance to that in this country and it makes me sick.

1678
01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:55.490
School should be fucking free.
You know,

1679
01:52:55.491 --> 01:52:58.490
it should be frigging not making any money and we should encourage people to

1680
01:52:58.491 --> 01:53:01.250
learn as much as possible so that they could contribute more.

1681
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:05.690
And I don't know how to do it,
but if I have to pay more taxes,
Jesus Christ,

1682
01:53:05.691 --> 01:53:06.710
I'll pay more taxes.

1683
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:11.780
I think we should all be enthusiastic about people being able to get out of

1684
01:53:11.781 --> 01:53:15.410
school without being hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.
I mean,

1685
01:53:15.411 --> 01:53:18.070
we have an enormous problem in this call.
We got a,

1686
01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:21.760
we don't have the same problem where is or without us.
We,
we,

1687
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:26.390
we got a partial,
uh,
you know,
you got to redeposit the,
the,
the,

1688
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:31.330
the loan which you build up a something like that,
but,

1689
01:53:32.050 --> 01:53:36.140
um,
but it's much smaller.
It's smaller Italian spot.

1690
01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:38.990
It's yet,
it is not their solution.

1691
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:42.180
Their solution should be that,
eh,

1692
01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:46.940
that the system is so complicated.
So,
uh,

1693
01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:50.540
away from us to begin to look,

1694
01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:54.350
people should be strong,
healthy and happy.

1695
01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:57.320
Are we able to do that?

1696
01:53:57.890 --> 01:54:00.560
And that's what we do scientifically right now.

1697
01:54:01.070 --> 01:54:03.450
And as he entered the day,

1698
01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:08.480
monster [inaudible] soon [inaudible] talk in rainy day.
It's,

1699
01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:11.820
it's a sort of a Latin and Churchill.
It's,

1700
01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:15.680
the science didn't prove it though.

1701
01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:20.740
There is more to prove and the school is not a way we should live for the life

1702
01:54:23.091 --> 01:54:27.680
is the school and in life we should be happy,
strong and healthy.

1703
01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:32.480
That's the way we are natural built.
So all the systems together,
right?

1704
01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:36.530
Yes,
yes.
It's,
it's quite large.
Heck,
very simple.

1705
01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:40.490
Very effective.
Very there.
And um,
yeah,

1706
01:54:40.491 --> 01:54:45.000
we just keep on making sense too.
We lost the sands.

1707
01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:50.840
Do you tell if it society has moved too fast for our bodies and that [inaudible]

1708
01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:54.740
this is all kind of tied together who you're talking about depression and you're

1709
01:54:54.741 --> 01:54:59.210
talking about how our body is not really designed to deal with the stress that

1710
01:54:59.211 --> 01:55:02.970
it deals with without any of the physical taxing of the,

1711
01:55:02.971 --> 01:55:07.070
the actual unit of the body itself.
You know,
the stress of exercise,

1712
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:09.450
of exertion,
of a,
you know,

1713
01:55:09.451 --> 01:55:12.300
of dealing with the environment and Nicole,

1714
01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:14.480
all these things are sort of,

1715
01:55:14.481 --> 01:55:19.481
there's demands that are on the body and the same could be said about the

1716
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:25.010
demands of society,
the demands of our culture,
the demands of civilization.

1717
01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:26.910
Do you think that maybe what's good,

1718
01:55:26.930 --> 01:55:31.280
what's happened is that our civilization has gotten too advanced too fast and

1719
01:55:31.281 --> 01:55:33.320
our bodies just have not be able to adapt.

1720
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:37.790
So they're left in this state of confusion and anguish because they're trying to

1721
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:39.760
get,
trying to get the there.

1722
01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:44.160
There's reward systems that are deeply ingrained in our DNA and they're not

1723
01:55:44.161 --> 01:55:45.670
being satisfied.
Exactly.

1724
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:51.950
That's the neural connection between the neocortex and the and the brainstem.

1725
01:55:51.961 --> 01:55:54.570
The primitive part.
The,
the,
the,
you know,

1726
01:55:54.571 --> 01:55:59.160
the human part of the thinking and the Reptilian,
the primitive brain,

1727
01:55:59.190 --> 01:56:03.270
the brainstem is,
it's cut off somehow.

1728
01:56:03.870 --> 01:56:08.870
And W that's why we don't control the stress of just stress,

1729
01:56:09.330 --> 01:56:12.030
which is stress hormone and a,

1730
01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:17.080
and the Korean system is connected to the brainstem and we lost this and it's

1731
01:56:18.511 --> 01:56:21.990
too much going on and we think the body will follow up,

1732
01:56:21.991 --> 01:56:25.310
but it is not following anymore.
We have problems and we,

1733
01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:30.090
what we are right now too is consciously bring back to neuro,

1734
01:56:30.570 --> 01:56:34.410
uh,
channeling between the neocortex with the brainstem.

1735
01:56:35.010 --> 01:56:39.030
And then I think it'll solve a,
it'll make sense again.

1736
01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:43.800
So exercise,
breathing,
diet,
all in consciousness,

1737
01:56:43.801 --> 01:56:48.210
mindfulness,
all these things are connected to live a happy life.
Yes.

1738
01:56:48.570 --> 01:56:52.610
Because happiness is about controlling the endocrine systems and they,
uh,

1739
01:56:52.630 --> 01:56:56.100
reciting it over there and that it needs a neural challenging.

1740
01:56:56.550 --> 01:57:01.550
What is the difference between the way you approach a cold environment versus

1741
01:57:01.771 --> 01:57:04.140
the way you approached what the,
what is the,

1742
01:57:04.141 --> 01:57:07.080
the thing that you did in the desert with no water?
Yeah.

1743
01:57:08.430 --> 01:57:09.960
I did it with a physiologist,

1744
01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:15.100
a doctor who was monitoring me and he saw eh,

1745
01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:19.530
without me having prior experience in the heat.

1746
01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:23.340
You didn't have any experience in the heat at all?
No.
It was w up into the,

1747
01:57:23.490 --> 01:57:26.790
where did you go and what did you do?
It not me and not me.
A desert.

1748
01:57:27.150 --> 01:57:31.740
Where's that as valet in the near a South Africa.
Uh,

1749
01:57:31.741 --> 01:57:35.970
and uh,
yeah,
I went down there and uh,
uh,

1750
01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:41.030
it's very dry desert by maybe the driest deserts in the world.

1751
01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:43.320
Maybe the second,

1752
01:57:43.650 --> 01:57:48.650
I don't know enough to have an impact on the physiology and I went up there and

1753
01:57:50.911 --> 01:57:55.620
I lost 5.2 liters of water.
Of Water.

1754
01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:00.790
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,
things happening.
That's jugs.
Yeah,

1755
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:03.880
that's a,
it's that's quite,
I ran a marathon.
Is that what it was?
Yeah,

1756
01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:08.630
it was 26 miles in that desert without drinking.
No drinking water.
No drink.

1757
01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:10.710
Did you rehydrate beforehand?

1758
01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:14.430
Did you like drink a shitload of water before you ran to coffee?

1759
01:58:14.490 --> 01:58:19.170
To Two cups of coffee?
I'm a little bit addicted to coffee.

1760
01:58:19.171 --> 01:58:24.030
I don't know if I'm going to master this.
Doesn't matter.

1761
01:58:24.330 --> 01:58:25.163
This is good,

1762
01:58:26.610 --> 01:58:30.240
but that's all know my mind was already there.

1763
01:58:30.241 --> 01:58:34.790
You know I'm going to do this and whatever w uh,

1764
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:38.130
no extra water or anything like that.

1765
01:58:38.190 --> 01:58:42.250
And so you brought in physiologists to Ma to monitor your body what you're doing

1766
01:58:42.251 --> 01:58:46.540
this yes and that he saw all the range.

1767
01:58:46.630 --> 01:58:50.950
My core body temperature remained 37 degrees.

1768
01:58:51.370 --> 01:58:52.540
It's like Eno,

1769
01:58:52.541 --> 01:58:57.541
the normal body core that per but do I lost 5.2 liters of water.

1770
01:58:59.110 --> 01:59:01.900
So even an extreme conditions,

1771
01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:05.410
you are able to control the body and while you're running,

1772
01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:10.210
are you actively engaging in these breathing exercises while you're running?

1773
01:59:10.450 --> 01:59:14.230
I always say to the persons who would do endurance,
you know,

1774
01:59:14.231 --> 01:59:18.260
raw long distance rang could be a hundred kilometers or 100 miles,

1775
01:59:18.370 --> 01:59:19.340
500 miles.

1776
01:59:20.410 --> 01:59:25.410
They probably are knowing not probably they have to know to breathe more than

1777
01:59:29.141 --> 01:59:34.141
the normal air conditioned a breathing patterns which are shallow it because if

1778
01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:41.790
not breathing deep enough you will exhaust he reserves of oxygen in the tissue

1779
01:59:43.690 --> 01:59:48.500
and then the man with the hammer gums.
Yeah,
no you are not.
You become acidic.

1780
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:50.140
You are not able to run anymore.

1781
01:59:50.650 --> 01:59:55.000
That's because the depletion of the oxygen in the tissue to is the expression

1782
01:59:55.001 --> 01:59:57.780
the man with the hammer comes.
Yes.
Yeah.

1783
01:59:58.810 --> 02:00:02.860
You're not able to do anything.
That's a crazy way to look at it though.

1784
02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:04.840
And then the man with the hammer comes.

1785
02:00:07.380 --> 02:00:09.090
Yeah.
So,
uh,

1786
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:14.750
I always say take one principal because we have the ability to store up my

1787
02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:19.810
oxygen,
but then you have to go past your condition breathing pattern,

1788
02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:24.820
which is too shallow and underperformance on the pressure.

1789
02:00:25.150 --> 02:00:30.150
It will just take the oxygen out of your tissue and then at a certain point it's

1790
02:00:31.751 --> 02:00:36.700
depleted and you are not able to run anyway,
but cozy ph levels become too low.

1791
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.960
So you are able to influence in that pat,
uh,
in,
in that,
uh,

1792
02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:46.630
uh,
uh,
while you perform by thinking,

1793
02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:49.570
you know,
what thinking does,
influencing cell level,

1794
02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:54.610
but also breathe more than you feel is needed.

1795
02:00:55.210 --> 02:00:58.600
Oh,
okay.
A few running and you're like,

1796
02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:01.743
instead,

1797
02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:08.030
just big deep breath and just mess with your own buddy.

1798
02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:13.320
Daniel are able to get into the tissue and maintain in the,

1799
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:14.880
in the cell biology,

1800
02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:19.590
oxygen instead off disconnecting and becoming acidic,

1801
02:01:20.010 --> 02:01:25.010
you oxygen is inside and gets on and is producing energy.

1802
02:01:25.590 --> 02:01:29.310
It's called Aerobic dissimilation.
It's a process in the cell.

1803
02:01:29.730 --> 02:01:31.290
But we are very able to do that.

1804
02:01:31.470 --> 02:01:35.970
And I do do it and I showed at people just in a couple of hours how to do it.

1805
02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:39.950
I stamp with people like,
eh,

1806
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.950
<v 1>even barefoot in the snow in short,</v>

1807
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:48.470
say on day two or three for one hour in the horse stance,
you know,

1808
02:01:48.471 --> 02:01:53.471
the horse dance and then stand for one hour in shorts and freezing temperatures,

1809
02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:58.900
barefooted for one hour in the snow in horse stance because they influence call

1810
02:02:02.361 --> 02:02:05.810
takes,
uh,
oxygen to combust energy.

1811
02:02:06.170 --> 02:02:10.040
Kabocha and it takes energy and it needs oxygen.

1812
02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:11.930
And uh,

1813
02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:16.330
and the horse stance is a performance is a pressure to it.

1814
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:20.990
Heat it,
it creates heat.
It could create control.

1815
02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:26.530
It shows that we are able to influence sal biology by bringing consciously more,

1816
02:02:28.890 --> 02:02:32.870
uh,
oxygen inside,
thus producing more energy.

1817
02:02:33.230 --> 02:02:36.620
So how do you keep people from getting frostbite?

1818
02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:42.680
Because I would think that standing in the snow barefoot could make you get

1819
02:02:42.681 --> 02:02:46.580
frostbite after an hour.
They are still not,
not,

1820
02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:50.120
not suffering from frostbite and anything.
So high in day for us,

1821
02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:55.130
we begin to sing and we began to have fun and we're going on.

1822
02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:56.510
So I had,

1823
02:02:56.540 --> 02:03:01.540
I had these east European and Russian people coming to my place as well and they

1824
02:03:02.481 --> 02:03:07.220
look really tough and this and that.
And they have at this as a to you,
I say,

1825
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:11.990
okay,
let's do an experiment.
If somebody is very tough at,

1826
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.140
he just,
we take a bottle of water,

1827
02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:17.480
we put it in front of us,

1828
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:22.990
we stand outside in the horse stance it barefooted and then uh,

1829
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:27.320
in one hour or one half hours old alter.
Okay.

1830
02:03:27.650 --> 02:03:32.480
We drink all the butter and still remain in balance because the cold,

1831
02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:36.500
uh,
is affected.
Or if you get alcohol in,
uh,
in the blood.

1832
02:03:36.590 --> 02:03:38.090
So you need more oxygen,

1833
02:03:38.091 --> 02:03:43.060
unique mark on tour and we drink the whole bottle of vodka.
Oh,

1834
02:03:43.130 --> 02:03:47.400
drink vodka,
not water vodka.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I think you said water.

1835
02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:52.560
I bought cat kind of comes from the word water is water.

1836
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:55.250
So it looks like what Russians are

1837
02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:02.450
water,
same thing,
just drink

1838
02:04:06.170 --> 02:04:08.360
vodka in front of them.
They have to drink.

1839
02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:14.270
I say I do crazy experiments and I guess,
yeah man,
come on.

1840
02:04:15.250 --> 02:04:20.240
Life is crazy.
You got a crazy experiments under anybody's definition.

1841
02:04:20.241 --> 02:04:23.670
Life is crazy that we having fun and uh,
uh,

1842
02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:28.790
but we never did it.
Uh,
but uh,
I think,
Eh,

1843
02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:32.870
you know,
if you have a hangover,
a hangover,
you know,

1844
02:04:33.890 --> 02:04:38.010
then if you do 20 minutes this breathing,
then you have

1845
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:41.730
<v 3>no hangover anymore.
The uh,
it works that way.</v>

1846
02:04:41.731 --> 02:04:45.120
You are learning to detox yourself in 20 minutes.

1847
02:04:45.410 --> 02:04:48.260
<v 0>I have a,
a guy that I do podcasts with occasionally.</v>

1848
02:04:48.261 --> 02:04:52.550
His name's Dr. Carl Hart and he's an addiction specialist and brilliant guy.

1849
02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:56.660
And he explained hangovers to me in a way that I never understood he could.

1850
02:04:56.890 --> 02:05:01.760
He's like,
we have this very confused sense of what addiction is.
And he said,

1851
02:05:01.761 --> 02:05:05.660
what a hangover is,
is your body being addicted to alcohol.

1852
02:05:05.661 --> 02:05:07.700
Even from one binge session,

1853
02:05:07.940 --> 02:05:12.110
your body creates these mitigating responses to the alcohol.

1854
02:05:12.230 --> 02:05:14.060
And then when the alcohol is no longer present,

1855
02:05:14.061 --> 02:05:17.540
you body has this like horrible headache and route it is,

1856
02:05:17.541 --> 02:05:21.410
is a compensatory response to the alcohol.
That's what it is.
Amazing.

1857
02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:22.931
Adaptive.
Yeah.

1858
02:05:22.931 --> 02:05:27.931
I mean that's what a hand like he redefines the premise of addiction and he

1859
02:05:29.210 --> 02:05:32.600
believes that are our ideas of addiction are very self limiting.

1860
02:05:33.100 --> 02:05:34.260
<v 3>Yes.
So,</v>

1861
02:05:34.530 --> 02:05:39.530
so we have very self limiting ideas about every hour control over life

1862
02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:45.410
<v 0>itself.
Yes.
And then your breathing method just flushes this,</v>

1863
02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:49.410
this yes.
Out of the system.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Any sense?

1864
02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:52.200
What are the athletes have you worked with other than Allister?

1865
02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:56.670
<v 3>Um,
uh,
Olympic,
uh,
sports,
uh,</v>

1866
02:05:56.850 --> 02:06:01.210
sports like rowing people,
people who doing a robot.

1867
02:06:01.211 --> 02:06:05.970
You do judo.
Uh,
so very Roebuck,
right?
Yeah.
Uh,

1868
02:06:05.971 --> 02:06:09.920
and uh,
uh,
yeah.
It's k this

1869
02:06:11.450 --> 02:06:16.430
a hockey team.
I'm going and when did these people start coming to you?
Yeah.

1870
02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:20.670
Well whenever I had this scientifically endorsed a result,

1871
02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:25.680
this one,
people began to think,
hey man,
this is,
this is real.

1872
02:06:25.681 --> 02:06:29.910
People think when it is scientifically proved,
then something is real.

1873
02:06:30.330 --> 02:06:33.660
<v 0>No.
How do you have the time to engage all these people?
I mean,</v>

1874
02:06:33.661 --> 02:06:36.870
it seems like you've got a lot of people pulling on your your time now,
right?

1875
02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.930
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah,
it does.
But once again,</v>

1876
02:06:40.990 --> 02:06:42.100
I got my mission.

1877
02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:46.120
My mission is to help as much as children in the world as possible.

1878
02:06:46.140 --> 02:06:50.620
We have to bring back care and love.
And this is my mission and I,

1879
02:06:51.090 --> 02:06:55.630
I'm,
I believe in what I do.
So let the science come.

1880
02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:57.550
But to science as a,

1881
02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.420
as I see it sometimes is as fast as a slow toto,

1882
02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:04.720
they need to code very thorough.

1883
02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:09.370
The problem is your legitimate 100% but a lot of people are not

1884
02:07:09.890 --> 02:07:12.320
<v 0>a lot of people on this podcast that I thought were legit.</v>

1885
02:07:12.530 --> 02:07:15.830
And then after talking to them and then after going over their stuff and then

1886
02:07:15.831 --> 02:07:19.250
after being in contact with people have criticized their work.

1887
02:07:19.251 --> 02:07:21.110
You realize they're bullshit artists.

1888
02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:24.450
It did just really good at being a bullshit artist and they miss some of this

1889
02:07:24.451 --> 02:07:28.880
stuff they say is true self.
It is,
it is.
Unfortunately those people,

1890
02:07:28.881 --> 02:07:30.470
they bullshit themselves as well.

1891
02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:33.500
That's one of the fascinating things about bullshit artists is there their own

1892
02:07:33.501 --> 02:07:35.530
victim.
They're the victim of their work.

1893
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:38.590
And you know what a guy like you,

1894
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:42.370
it's frustrating to you because you are legit and you want this message to get

1895
02:07:42.371 --> 02:07:43.650
out there like that.

1896
02:07:43.651 --> 02:07:47.620
That scientific method is critical because that scientific method is also

1897
02:07:47.621 --> 02:07:48.630
establishing the,

1898
02:07:48.631 --> 02:07:52.480
the veracity of your work is establishing that absolutely what you're doing is

1899
02:07:52.481 --> 02:07:53.800
provable and it's real.

1900
02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:57.340
It's one of the things that makes you so unique is the fact that it's not just

1901
02:07:57.341 --> 02:08:01.240
you and your method is not just anecdotal evidence is the fact that there's a

1902
02:08:01.241 --> 02:08:03.460
bunch of people out there that have actually tested you,

1903
02:08:03.461 --> 02:08:07.330
that have no vested interest whatsoever and you being accurate.
And in fact,

1904
02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:10.780
we'd probably like to debunk you just as much as they would like to prove you

1905
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:15.760
accurate and they can't.
And that's what things get very,
very,
very interesting.

1906
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:18.250
And what's fascinating to me is that you're this one guy,

1907
02:08:18.610 --> 02:08:23.610
you're like an outlier in the most extreme sense of the term because there's 7

1908
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:27.910
billion people and this one guy has figured some shit out.

1909
02:08:27.911 --> 02:08:30.760
What if you weren't around,
man?
What have you didn't exist?

1910
02:08:30.761 --> 02:08:32.140
We might never figure this shit out.

1911
02:08:32.141 --> 02:08:35.290
It might be a hundred years for somebody figured it out.
You know,

1912
02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:39.400
it makes you wonder like what,
what and now,
now we work together.

1913
02:08:39.490 --> 02:08:43.900
Yes,
I do know all the love you.
I love your work.

1914
02:08:44.410 --> 02:08:48.730
I love your spirit.
No,
I love the spirit.
That's why I love you.

1915
02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:53.680
You know,
for what we do and it needs to be done.
Somebody needs to do it.

1916
02:08:54.430 --> 02:08:58.180
And if we do it together,
we have stronger.
Well listen,
I'd love you to,

1917
02:08:58.181 --> 02:09:01.090
and I love your spirit and I love what you're doing and I will help you in any

1918
02:09:01.091 --> 02:09:03.820
way I can.
I will get this word out as much as possible.

1919
02:09:04.030 --> 02:09:05.290
I believe what you're doing,
man.

1920
02:09:05.291 --> 02:09:10.120
I think what's fascinating is that the parlor tricks as it were,

1921
02:09:10.121 --> 02:09:13.900
or your feets,
you're amazing endurance feats,
those,

1922
02:09:13.930 --> 02:09:16.950
that's what's bringing people to you.
You know the,
the,

1923
02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:22.290
when you see you on Everest and you shorts,
you know,
like,
uh,

1924
02:09:22.450 --> 02:09:27.430
there's this one image of you out in the snow and a,
you're bouncing on some ice.

1925
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:32.020
Yeah,
yeah.
Like look,
that gets people going.
What the fuck is this guy doing?

1926
02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:35.200
And then they start researching it and then they started realizing like,
Whoa,

1927
02:09:35.201 --> 02:09:36.460
this guy,
this,

1928
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:41.470
there's been scientific examinations of his claims and it holds up.

1929
02:09:41.770 --> 02:09:46.630
Like,
here's this is one image of you here.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Great Basher man.

1930
02:09:46.850 --> 02:09:48.520
You hope people see shit like that.
They go,

1931
02:09:48.530 --> 02:09:51.740
what the fuck is this crazy guy doing?
He's got no shorts on.

1932
02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:55.870
He's out in the snow.
It's freezing cold out and he's having a great time.
It's,

1933
02:09:55.871 --> 02:09:59.530
it's,
it's,
it's very contagious in a lot of ways.

1934
02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:02.800
I have a great time and it seems like what's going on here?

1935
02:10:02.801 --> 02:10:06.460
What is in this picture here?
This is Columbia sports wear.

1936
02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.680
This is a commercial.
Oh,
it's a commercial they did for it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1937
02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:15.880
They did it at it though.
Uh,
that's,
uh,
that,
that,
that sound a mum blah.

1938
02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:21.190
And then,
and uh,
the,
the,
the Indiana Alps.
Wow.

1939
02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:23.740
And uh,
yeah,
more,
more stuff.

1940
02:10:24.190 --> 02:10:28.900
That's a crazy picture to see you out there in that frozen Tundra.
Yeah.

1941
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:33.530
And your shorts,
Eh,
no church.
It's held out,
you know.
Well,

1942
02:10:33.531 --> 02:10:34.040
how about the one

1943
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:37.700
<v 3>when you're up there in the Lotus position?
Yeah,
that one.
What was that?</v>

1944
02:10:38.130 --> 02:10:40.730
That's a Iceland,
Iceland.

1945
02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:44.450
Now how do you keep your legs from getting frostbite?
Like what,

1946
02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:49.570
what causes frostbite and how are you able to stop that from happening?
Yeah,

1947
02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:53.920
we got an ability to maintain,
uh,

1948
02:10:54.550 --> 02:10:59.430
above a zero within the cell biology.
And,
uh,

1949
02:10:59.530 --> 02:11:03.230
but as we not expose ourselves anymore,
we get frostbite,

1950
02:11:03.231 --> 02:11:08.231
etc. But if you get into the system and you learn to control a ride and you get

1951
02:11:09.291 --> 02:11:11.830
the right Ph degrees,
then eh,

1952
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:14.810
the frostbite will not come because Eh,

1953
02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:19.820
we got the mechanism to do that,
uh,
that,
uh,
that,

1954
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:24.890
that will bring the cell temperature just above zero.

1955
02:11:25.190 --> 02:11:29.780
That means in a far now to what is 30 to 32.

1956
02:11:30.430 --> 02:11:35.330
And because if it gets below you get a rapper role,
a cell damage.
But yeah,

1957
02:11:35.331 --> 02:11:40.190
we,
uh,
mammals and we are able to do that like dogs and the cheaper,
well we do,

1958
02:11:40.191 --> 02:11:42.830
we know that people adapt to certain environments.
You know,

1959
02:11:42.831 --> 02:11:46.220
like they know that Inuits have a adapted,
uh,

1960
02:11:46.230 --> 02:11:48.150
a very interesting,
uh,

1961
02:11:48.210 --> 02:11:51.800
ability with their hands or their hands don't freeze up and get numb.

1962
02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:55.670
Whereas a person like me from California,
if I was in their environment,

1963
02:11:55.671 --> 02:11:56.870
I would have a real struggle.

1964
02:11:57.050 --> 02:12:01.850
But for them it comes natural and their body's adapted to this extremely harsh

1965
02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:02.833
environment.

1966
02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:07.280
It seems like human beings are much more pliable than we give them credit for.

1967
02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:10.400
That's the adaptive power which we have,

1968
02:12:10.401 --> 02:12:14.530
we are never resort to because we live in a conference,

1969
02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:17.870
a zone,
a kind of behavior,

1970
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:20.930
and we think we can control nature.

1971
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:26.000
But as long as we do not control what makes us happy,

1972
02:12:26.001 --> 02:12:28.670
strong and healthy,
we have no control at all.

1973
02:12:29.090 --> 02:12:32.510
And I want to bring it over there.
That's interesting.

1974
02:12:32.511 --> 02:12:35.210
So what we've been doing is trying to control nature.

1975
02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:39.590
We've been trying to build houses and heat them up and we've been trying to

1976
02:12:39.591 --> 02:12:44.570
control the environment instead of control ourselves to adapt to the
environment.

1977
02:12:44.810 --> 02:12:45.643
Exactly.

1978
02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:50.980
And it's nice to have a nice fireplace and everything a comment accommodated as

1979
02:12:52.071 --> 02:12:54.710
he'd rung.
But sometimes like a dog,

1980
02:12:54.770 --> 02:12:58.220
you need to go out and you know what else to the fireplace.

1981
02:12:58.221 --> 02:13:00.890
You don't appreciate that fireplace unless you're cold as fuck.

1982
02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:05.090
I really appreciate it when you're really begin to,
yeah.

1983
02:13:05.091 --> 02:13:09.270
Like after your eyeballs thought out,
like we were talking about going blind.

1984
02:13:09.290 --> 02:13:13.340
I bet if you've got in front of a fire then ah man,
it's,
man,

1985
02:13:13.370 --> 02:13:16.190
you're very silent than the Syrian at that moment.

1986
02:13:16.890 --> 02:13:21.350
And enjoying every bit.
We need the harsh to appreciate the mellow,

1987
02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:25.790
you know,
we,
we need,
we need hard things to appreciate soft things.

1988
02:13:25.791 --> 02:13:29.630
We need violence I think sometimes to appreciate piece.
Uh,

1989
02:13:29.650 --> 02:13:32.110
so there's something fascinating about human beings.

1990
02:13:32.110 --> 02:13:37.110
<v 0>So we almost are designed to overcome and if we do not overcome,</v>

1991
02:13:37.291 --> 02:13:39.420
we find that we find ourselves lost.

1992
02:13:39.910 --> 02:13:43.510
<v 1>Yes.
And it's all about consciousness.
Yeah.</v>

1993
02:13:43.570 --> 02:13:47.740
Being aware of live itself,
which is a wonder.

1994
02:13:48.460 --> 02:13:51.580
So we are going to bring it back first chemically.

1995
02:13:52.270 --> 02:13:55.390
And that make understandable,
that dinner,
you know,

1996
02:13:55.420 --> 02:13:59.560
consciousness and love are the best things on earth.

1997
02:13:59.770 --> 02:14:01.210
Accessible for everybody.

1998
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:03.820
<v 0>Now are you experiencing over like how,</v>

1999
02:14:03.821 --> 02:14:07.360
what has been the last few years?

2000
02:14:07.361 --> 02:14:10.690
Like what has it been like where people are awakening themselves to your

2001
02:14:10.691 --> 02:14:13.720
accomplishments and your work and your,
your,
your belief?
What,

2002
02:14:13.721 --> 02:14:14.740
what has it been like?

2003
02:14:14.741 --> 02:14:19.600
It seems like at least me on the outside becoming more and more aware of you.

2004
02:14:19.601 --> 02:14:23.860
It's like I'm getting people tweet at me all the time with your videos and

2005
02:14:23.861 --> 02:14:27.010
articles about you and all these different people.
Ask me about getting you on.

2006
02:14:27.250 --> 02:14:29.950
It seems like there's an awakening and it's going on.

2007
02:14:30.370 --> 02:14:34.420
How much of a requirement has that been on your time and,
and you,

2008
02:14:34.421 --> 02:14:35.920
and what does that feel like to you to,

2009
02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:40.000
to have all these people sort of like a overwhelmingly coming after you now?

2010
02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:43.750
<v 1>Yeah.
I love it.
I love it.
But,
uh,</v>

2011
02:14:43.751 --> 02:14:48.450
and I think this way and being with people like you,

2012
02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:53.340
like a Joe Rogan is a entity is not just you,

2013
02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:58.140
it's more to Amh.
We got to use and abuse all the,

2014
02:14:58.141 --> 02:15:03.060
as for the goal to bring it [inaudible] to any body.

2015
02:15:03.570 --> 02:15:07.200
And,
uh,
every person in the world,
we want to make the world happy.

2016
02:15:07.650 --> 02:15:09.960
We want to make it strong and healthy.
You know,

2017
02:15:09.961 --> 02:15:14.610
we want to bring consciousness of the wonders of life itself.

2018
02:15:14.910 --> 02:15:17.910
And as long as we,
uh,
as it is not there,

2019
02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:22.300
then these all these people who tweeted you and uh,

2020
02:15:22.530 --> 02:15:27.330
well helping me now,
that's where the way I feel it,
it's,
it's,

2021
02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:32.130
it's a of itself that brings me to wort,
uh,

2022
02:15:32.330 --> 02:15:33.450
this,
yeah,

2023
02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:38.340
this mission and the destination of it is helping children love and care.

2024
02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:40.500
I thank these people are very,

2025
02:15:40.501 --> 02:15:44.340
very much from the heart and we still need to go on.

2026
02:15:44.341 --> 02:15:48.360
So we all need you.
You,
you keep bringing it up.

2027
02:15:48.410 --> 02:15:50.960
<v 0>Children.
That's a primary focus.</v>

2028
02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:54.980
Is that because you feel like they're the most receptive to new ideas?

2029
02:15:55.200 --> 02:16:00.180
<v 1>Exactly.
They are open and they have to learn from people who are wise.
You know,</v>

2030
02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:04.320
we are,
we are the elders.
Somebody's got to do it.

2031
02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:06.360
And that's us.

2032
02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:11.760
So we have the responsibility and are we able to respond?

2033
02:16:12.810 --> 02:16:17.160
And that's right now,
right here.
That's why I'm here with you.

2034
02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:22.490
And you're asking,
and I can feel you are some,
you know,

2035
02:16:22.770 --> 02:16:26.280
you go deeper into,
uh,
at all.
None.

2036
02:16:27.710 --> 02:16:30.490
Yeah.
What is deeper than love?

2037
02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:32.950
What is deeper than the care for a child?

2038
02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:38.520
And that's what we need in once begins to establish the love continuously

2039
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:41.620
without fear of disease,

2040
02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:45.820
without fear of being unhappy,
without fear of being,

2041
02:16:45.821 --> 02:16:46.960
having no energy,

2042
02:16:46.961 --> 02:16:51.961
etc. Then the love will bloom because that's the natural flower of every person.

2043
02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:59.250
And uh,
I,
yeah,
that's why I call it a children or it's he'd drive,

2044
02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:03.340
we have to make this body,
this beautiful,
beautiful planet,

2045
02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:06.910
which is actually best part in all the universe.

2046
02:17:07.090 --> 02:17:11.200
We don't need to look beyond Maurice or they're,
or they're,

2047
02:17:11.201 --> 02:17:16.201
or they're just look within and make this world a better place in harmony with

2048
02:17:17.151 --> 02:17:19.180
the nature.
And it begins with the children.

2049
02:17:19.550 --> 02:17:21.100
<v 0>I share that idea and,</v>

2050
02:17:21.190 --> 02:17:24.200
and I've been saying to people for a long time that one of the things that makes

2051
02:17:24.201 --> 02:17:28.430
me so enthusiastic and so optimistic about the future is the fact that we can

2052
02:17:28.431 --> 02:17:32.570
reach kids now in a way that we couldn't reach them before we could reach kids

2053
02:17:32.571 --> 02:17:36.770
with ideas and with open mindedness and with just massive amounts of information

2054
02:17:36.771 --> 02:17:38.210
that just weren't available before.

2055
02:17:38.510 --> 02:17:43.510
And that if you can change their opinion or inform them or,

2056
02:17:43.581 --> 02:17:48.581
or expose them to new ideas that generate new creative ideas inside them,

2057
02:17:49.790 --> 02:17:54.790
then you have broken the system and this system that's designed to carve paths

2058
02:17:54.861 --> 02:17:58.460
that have already been,
they've already been traveled.
And then,
you know,

2059
02:17:58.461 --> 02:18:00.410
I want to be a lawyer just like my dad.

2060
02:18:00.411 --> 02:18:04.850
And you get on that same fucking path and you get stuck.
And I think now there's,

2061
02:18:04.851 --> 02:18:08.130
there's an infinite number of paths and they're branching off into infinite

2062
02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:12.500
different directions and new streams and new new tributaries.

2063
02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:15.500
And I think we live in a beautiful time because of that.

2064
02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:19.440
Because a guy like you in Holland can get your ideas out.
You see,

2065
02:18:19.550 --> 02:18:22.640
I have to do a few things and then all of a sudden people know about it and then

2066
02:18:22.641 --> 02:18:23.301
it spreads.

2067
02:18:23.301 --> 02:18:26.990
And then you connect with other people and you connect to me and I connect to

2068
02:18:26.991 --> 02:18:28.370
the Internet and then it connects us.

2069
02:18:28.371 --> 02:18:31.610
And then there's going to be people that are practicing what you do and then

2070
02:18:31.611 --> 02:18:33.290
they're gonna tell their friends and it's going to get,

2071
02:18:33.410 --> 02:18:36.110
they're going to tweet about it on the write blogs about it,
and boom,
boom,

2072
02:18:36.111 --> 02:18:40.430
boom and make videos.
And then to overwhelming,
that'd becomes overwhelming.

2073
02:18:40.431 --> 02:18:42.320
And then it becomes a natural part of life.

2074
02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:44.860
<v 1>Yes.
And it is overwhelming.</v>

2075
02:18:44.861 --> 02:18:49.720
The wonder of life is overwhelming and uh,
media is helping us.

2076
02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:51.520
It is to Napa and all that.

2077
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:55.120
This kind of media is the best because no one's controlling it.
You know,

2078
02:18:55.150 --> 02:18:58.100
the fact that anybody,
you could start your own podcast right now.

2079
02:18:58.110 --> 02:19:02.320
Dee is controlling.
You ever thought about starting a podcast?
No.
No chat.

2080
02:19:02.930 --> 02:19:07.870
I got this.
I got him to help me on the podcast.
You never did this.

2081
02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:09.790
Why didn't you get done?
Yeah.

2082
02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:14.280
<v 0>Yep.
We'll talk to him.
Jay Jamiel school.
We'll,
we'll get this trait.
All right.
Um,</v>

2083
02:19:14.370 --> 02:19:16.890
so beside the Harvard thing,
uh,
the studies,

2084
02:19:16.891 --> 02:19:18.750
what else do you have going on that people can look for it?

2085
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:22.400
<v 1>Ah,
well we get the unit different universities and uh,</v>

2086
02:19:22.401 --> 02:19:27.200
we got different protocol to out,
uh,
to do,
uh,
work on,
uh,
uh,

2087
02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:28.093
arthritis,

2088
02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:34.420
arthritis and different auto immune diseases in general and uh,

2089
02:19:35.181 --> 02:19:39.950
about depression.
I want to get,
we are able to control the pressure.

2090
02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:44.330
Really.
That's amazing.
That's a huge,
huge,

2091
02:19:44.331 --> 02:19:47.960
huge problem.
Not just in this country,
but all over the world.
Yes.

2092
02:19:48.700 --> 02:19:52.630
The one of the main problems that plagues modern human beings.
Yes.

2093
02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:55.730
And it's not so difficult.
It's very simple.
But yeah,
no,

2094
02:19:56.270 --> 02:19:59.750
the genius of things is to make things simple and that's,

2095
02:19:59.751 --> 02:20:03.770
believe we are built to be happy,
strong and healthy.

2096
02:20:04.250 --> 02:20:06.530
We just need to go back to nature,

2097
02:20:06.990 --> 02:20:11.600
a natural loss within us and uh,
and connect again.

2098
02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:14.660
Very simple.
Um,

2099
02:20:14.810 --> 02:20:19.810
is there anything that people should read that you've done or watch?

2100
02:20:20.631 --> 02:20:22.850
Is there any,
besides the vice documentary,

2101
02:20:22.851 --> 02:20:27.500
is there anything else that people that you recommend people check out?
You know,

2102
02:20:27.530 --> 02:20:29.150
I did this study,

2103
02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:34.240
which we did is actually the first study that showed that the autonomic nervous

2104
02:20:35.121 --> 02:20:40.121
system and relationship with the endocrine systems and immune systems are deeply

2105
02:20:40.761 --> 02:20:44.570
to be deeply,
uh,
able to be influenced.

2106
02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:48.860
So bacteria has no chance.
Things like that.
You know,

2107
02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:51.800
that's crazy because that's a,
that's also,
you know,

2108
02:20:51.801 --> 02:20:55.310
I had a friend of mine who got a staph infection,
the horrible staph infection.

2109
02:20:55.311 --> 02:20:58.640
I posted a photo of it online the other day because he got Murcia,

2110
02:20:58.641 --> 02:21:02.860
which has medication resistant staph infection.
It's horrific,
horrific Asia.

2111
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:06.440
You should do this.
And you think that this,
something like this could help that.

2112
02:21:06.470 --> 02:21:11.110
I,
uh,
I think I'm sure about it,
but my,
my son,

2113
02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:15.810
my team is always say,
I don't tell you I killing people.
I teach

2114
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:21.260
totally scientifically proved it was 25 years ago.

2115
02:21:21.261 --> 02:21:25.760
I stayed at something that is scientifically proved,
uh,
now,

2116
02:21:25.790 --> 02:21:27.910
and it changed his sirens as it is.
Well,

2117
02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:29.390
I think what they're doing is they're just,

2118
02:21:29.450 --> 02:21:33.230
they want to reign you in just because they not understand the importance of

2119
02:21:33.231 --> 02:21:36.090
what you're saying.
Yeah.
And that,
you know,
they're,
they're,
they're,

2120
02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:40.370
they're optimistic but cautiously optimistic.
It is.
So it is so,

2121
02:21:40.371 --> 02:21:43.940
but if I see the person and,
and always,
Eh,

2122
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:47.690
they won't get worse of it at least.

2123
02:21:48.590 --> 02:21:52.760
And I saw miracles happening because live is a miracle.

2124
02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:56.330
I saw people getting back to life,
you know,
to,

2125
02:21:56.331 --> 02:22:01.331
to be in connection with life and trust within their own natural ability.

2126
02:22:01.790 --> 02:22:04.550
And then changing the old a day,

2127
02:22:04.551 --> 02:22:09.551
a disbalance this so much that they felt confident within their own buddies

2128
02:22:10.551 --> 02:22:15.551
again and taking away a half a regaining control over their immune systems.

2129
02:22:16.170 --> 02:22:21.170
And then diseases go and it's very simple.

2130
02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:23.090
You just need to do it.

2131
02:22:23.210 --> 02:22:26.160

all stuff that's going on,
all the different activities and interactions,

2137
02:22:42.121 --> 02:22:45.030
all the different thoughts just takes one person,

2138
02:22:45.150 --> 02:22:50.150
step out with a new unique idea that could be completely revolutionary and

2139
02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:54.300
change the way people behave and the way people interface with nature.
