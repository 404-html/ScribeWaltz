122
00:05:56.171 --> 00:05:56.171
<v Speaker 1>talking shit about you online and act.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>

124
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.960

<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

125
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>we're just,</v>

<v Speaker 3>new coach or there's Robert Follis and </v>

128
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 3>I'd never met him before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy.</v>

129
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 3>I liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

130
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:10.241
<v Speaker 3>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I first got there before I was </v>

131
00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:10.241
<v Speaker 3>coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone said,</v>

132
00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:10.241
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you start coming?</v>

133
00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:10.241
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

134
00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:10.720
<v Speaker 3>well we'll see about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

135
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give them a trial run,</v>

136
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:12.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>

137
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you believe the rumors in him.</v>

138
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 3>He met me now every day he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad to have you here,</v>

139
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You train hard.</v>

140
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:18.670
<v Speaker 3>You're a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

141
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't know that.</v>

142
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 3>I know that he used to not like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

143
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.410
<v Speaker 3>but I get a lot of flack for my </v>
<v Speaker 3>shenanigans and uh,</v>

144
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 3>because it's blown out of proportion in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of things,</v>

145
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

146
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it's blown out of proportion,</v>

147
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 3>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

148
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 3>you actually did some shit.</v>

149
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 3>You did wind up going to jail for </v>
<v Speaker 3>beating the fuck out of.</v>

150
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Some people got a little crazy a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>

151
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 3>but I mean that's normal human stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

152
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.340
<v Speaker 3>like everyone gets in fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm driving here today and an old</v>

153
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 3>lady was flipped me off on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

154
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.470
<v Speaker 3>cutting me off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

155
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 3>people are violent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

156
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does happen.</v>

157
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.450
<v Speaker 3>It's a natural thing to get into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

158
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:51.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does happen,</v>

159
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:52.860
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying is like,</v>

160
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 3>it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you definitely are a good marketer.</v>

161
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 3>You definitely put your shenanigans out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there to get people excited about it and</v>

162
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:01.660
<v Speaker 3>a lot of talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

163
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 3>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean your twitter feeds very active,</v>

164
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's people hating on you or </v>

165
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.170
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

166
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.170
<v Speaker 3>I have no filter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

167
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.170
<v Speaker 3>and it works good.</v>

168
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.090
<v Speaker 3>Like people know who I am and I have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fan fans gives it,</v>

169
00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 3>but also I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of on the black edge,</v>

170
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:15.370
<v Speaker 3>but you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

171
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.180
<v Speaker 3>some people won't touch me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

172
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure like sponsors and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

173
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or even if I was in the UFC right now,</v>

174
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:26.741
<v Speaker 3>I'd be fired everyday probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking that when I started the </v>

175
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 3>blowjob tweet think they would let you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get away with.</v>

176
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.430
<v Speaker 3>I'd be fired every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

177
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.120
<v Speaker 3>Not Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my opinion,</v>

178
00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're not hurting anybody.</v>

179
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.430
<v Speaker 3>It's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were also talking before the show </v>

180
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 3>started about Tiago Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You where you got a really good point.</v>

181
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 3>Like Tiago Silva should've never left </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brazil.</v>

182
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you could act like that out of </v>

183
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

184
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:47.980
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the way I see it.</v>

185
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Bring a man from 19 thirties a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a criminal,</v>

186
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 3>a regular guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

187
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 3>a lawful citizens and let him live </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

188
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna go to jail because there's so</v>

189
00:07:57.201 --> 00:07:58.880
<v Speaker 3>many strict laws now and everything's </v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

190
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.300
<v Speaker 3>so you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't be raised with one set of </v>

191
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.030
<v Speaker 3>morals and guidelines and then come live</v>
<v Speaker 3>now when you can't do anything and we </v>

192
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.241
<v Speaker 3>don't want to give the wrong impression </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Brazil because I love Brazil and </v>

193
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:10.241
<v Speaker 3>I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a huge fan of Brazil.</v>

194
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Speaker 3>I think Rio is like one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>cities in the world,</v>

195
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Annapolis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've never been.</v>

196
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.120
<v Speaker 3>But the bottom line is Brazilian people </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't more relaxed about the way they </v>

197
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 3>do business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're more relaxed about the.</v>

198
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very aggressive men too.</v>

199
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:27.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a reason why the UFC and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mma,</v>

200
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 3>like all of it originated Valley Tudo </v>
<v Speaker 3>originated out of Brazil.</v>

201
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:37.151
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was fights going on all over the </v>

202
00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:37.151
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There always has been.</v>

203
00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 3>But Brazil has a very special </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with violence.</v>

204
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.780
<v Speaker 3>It's a third world country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

205
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.300
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

206
00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:42.770
<v Speaker 3>the police,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it is anymore.</v>

207
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

208
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

209
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.450
<v Speaker 3>the economy of Brazil has boomed so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the last decade.</v>

210
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 3>Apparently they discovered oil offshore </v>
<v Speaker 3>and resale and.</v>

211
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:56.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a bunch of other economic </v>

212
00:08:56.321 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 3>factors that have led their economies </v>
<v Speaker 3>like very strong right now.</v>

213
00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 3>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're probably,</v>

214
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

215
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:03.910
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're probably one of the biggest </v>

216
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.391
<v Speaker 3>growth countries over the past few years</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on the United States is made with </v>

217
00:09:05.391 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 3>this treatise country of own violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like did a,</v>

218
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.470
<v Speaker 3>like fights when I was in England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were getting into bar fights and </v>

219
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 3>the cops came and broke it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one to jail.</v>

220
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.390
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

221
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Paul daily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you beat that guy up?</v>

222
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 3>And he got what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens if he's not in jail?</v>

223
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.220
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to jail.</v>

224
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Who did Paul Bailey daily beat up some </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy in a bar fight.</v>

225
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.290
<v Speaker 3>Remember he lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he lost his visa.</v>

226
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't fight in Bellatore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

227
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:27.170
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why he lost his visa and me like,</v>

228
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.570
<v Speaker 3>I got a bar fight with the 300 pound guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year in jail.</v>

229
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.460
<v Speaker 3>Four times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

230
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 3>he's in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't his first offense.</v>

231
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 3>He had multiple offenses and no jail </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

232
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:35.930
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

233

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at,</v>

234
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:38.940

<v Speaker 3>neck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

238
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

239
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.610
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't know you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would assume like this guys are paid,</v>

240
00:09:49.611 --> 00:09:52.140
<v Speaker 3>but if you watch problem he watched on </v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube the first case.</v>

241
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 3>It's on the screens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cameras.</v>

242

<v Speaker 3>Navy seal.</v>

243
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.920

<v Speaker 3>He beats up everybody.</v>

244
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't jump into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets jumped and I'm the only one they</v>

245
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:02.430
<v Speaker 3>even got arrested.</v>

246
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.910
<v Speaker 3>So you got arrested just because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would make publicity and I think </v>

247
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.910
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 3>are we going to charge a navy seal that </v>
<v Speaker 3>just won a bronze medal?</v>

249
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Bronze Star or just wild maniac warmer </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheet who did porn and I kicked out of </v>

<v Speaker 3>war hero because my friend's mom was </v>

<v Speaker 3>You did everything.</v>

254

259
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:32.890
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrong time,</v>

260
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:32.890
<v Speaker 3>anything can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I don't go out anymore.</v>

261
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 3>Do period smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

262
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.410
<v Speaker 3>I can't risk it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is smart and we're also not trying</v>

263
00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:39.150
<v Speaker 3>to make light of what happened with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tiago Silva.</v>

264
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the specifics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the rules.</v>

265
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:41.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

266
00:10:41.931 --> 00:10:45.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean or rather the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he had a weapon.</v>

267
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:50.241
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even remember much different </v>

268
00:10:50.241 --> 00:10:50.241
<v Speaker 3>rumors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

269
00:10:50.241 --> 00:10:51.630
<v Speaker 3>but I liked that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way he fights.</v>

270
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.250
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

271
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:54.630
<v Speaker 3>He said dangerous too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tough.</v>

272
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:59.730
<v Speaker 3>But you know what the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the one thing for sure it was a </v>

273
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 3>woman was involved and people go crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>with their wife,</v>

274
00:11:00.241 --> 00:11:03.280
<v Speaker 3>women's involved so that anyone is </v>
<v Speaker 3>acceptable.</v>

275
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Susceptible to going crazy when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>white one,</v>

276
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:07.770
<v Speaker 3>the one that loves involved so it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't excuse it,</v>

277
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.420
<v Speaker 3>but who knows what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

278
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

279
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 3>It's apparently it's his ex wife and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what the story was,</v>

280
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:18.531
<v Speaker 3>but apparently there was an armed </v>
<v Speaker 3>standoff that was with the take the </v>

281
00:11:18.531 --> 00:11:18.540
<v Speaker 3>papers and all the press was reporting.</v>

282
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if there was any weapons </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>

283
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:22.320
<v Speaker 3>I really have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it sucks,</v>

284
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.770
<v Speaker 3>that guy's gone now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

285
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.910
<v Speaker 3>he was a great fighter in the UFC there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's never going to fight in the UFC </v>

286
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:29.160
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

287
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:34.210
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sucks if whatever he did actually </v>

288
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.401
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sucks way more for the people that </v>

289
00:11:37.401 --> 00:11:37.401
<v Speaker 3>were as victims of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

290
00:11:37.401 --> 00:11:38.880
<v Speaker 3>But it just sucks that a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't keep it together,</v>

291
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:44.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're a fan of the sport </v>

292
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:44.090
<v Speaker 3>and you're like watching them fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>their guys.</v>

293
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:44.160
<v Speaker 3>You always know you're going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun fight with.</v>

294
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:45.760
<v Speaker 3>That guy was in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

295
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.420
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed watching them because I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

296
00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:52.410
<v Speaker 3>but that your point about like a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that growing up in Brazil,</v>

297
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up,</v>

298
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 3>kind of wild coming over here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody is so conservative,</v>

299
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 3>so much.</v>

300
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 3>So many laws and so much buttoned down </v>
<v Speaker 3>on behavior.</v>

301
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.980
<v Speaker 3>You read about England to man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

302
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.120
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doug Stanhope has a whole bit about it.</v>

303
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.020
<v Speaker 3>A lot of countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

304
00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of countries fight as long </v>
<v Speaker 3>as it's one on one.</v>

305
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:09.070
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>

306
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

307
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 3>nothing can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but America is strict.</v>

308
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:13.780
<v Speaker 3>It's no joke with that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

309
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 3>It's rarely hear about UFC fighters </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting in fights though.</v>

310
00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:17.980
<v Speaker 3>If you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really pretty,</v>

311
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 3>pretty amazing in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

312
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.750
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

313
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.140
<v Speaker 3>Badr Hari that motherfuckers always </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting in trouble,</v>

314
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:28.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is another terrible situation </v>

315
00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.380
<v Speaker 3>because he's like one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting kickboxers on the planet.</v>

316
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.390
<v Speaker 3>Love watching that guy fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's always in trouble.</v>

317
00:12:32.391 --> 00:12:32.640
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

318
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.720
<v Speaker 3>he had to go to Morocco for awhile and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

319
00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:35.890
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hide.</v>

320
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:41.250
<v Speaker 3>And then he came back and he had to deal</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this issue and then a new issue </v>

321
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:41.250
<v Speaker 3>came up.</v>

322
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:41.800
<v Speaker 3>Some dude got his legs stomped at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>club.</v>

323
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it happens more than we think.</v>

324
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.700
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

325
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.770
<v Speaker 3>people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just get lucky to get away with it.</v>

326
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm the worst because I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had two twins,</v>

327
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.070
<v Speaker 3>tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm screwed.</v>

328
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.350
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

329
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.320
<v Speaker 3>Because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

330
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.280
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a fight.</v>

331
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.380
<v Speaker 3>A guy had a grenade on his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this,</v>

332
00:12:56.381 --> 00:12:58.110
<v Speaker 3>punch that into the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm going to do,</v>

333
00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

334
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:00.710
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

335
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.690
<v Speaker 3>someone else maybe no tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a white guy.</v>

336
00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 3>He was kind of most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

337
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.510
<v Speaker 3>unless you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you recognize them,</v>

338
00:13:07.511 --> 00:13:08.320
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

339
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you're deciding to stay in now.</v>

340
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.630
<v Speaker 3>I have to keep away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jail Sucks.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was boring.</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.400
<v Speaker 3>he should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he shouldn't be in general population.</v>

350
00:13:30.401 --> 00:13:32.110
<v Speaker 3>They put me in the holding the last six </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

351
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just because you're a UFC there </v>

352
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:37.200
<v Speaker 3>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

353
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.960
<v Speaker 3>how come I know that he could have </v>
<v Speaker 3>ordered people to attack me or another </v>

354
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:39.960
<v Speaker 3>inmate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he put me in the hole.</v>

355
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.690
<v Speaker 3>Then the second year when I went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>jail,</v>

356
00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:45.691
<v Speaker 3>the whole year in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in the whole the whole time </v>

357
00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:45.691
<v Speaker 3>because they already knew I wasn't just </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuck me in there.</v>

358
00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For how long were you in the hall?</v>

359
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:47.420
<v Speaker 3>The whole year?</v>

360
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 3>The second year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole year by yourself.</v>

361
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

362
00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:51.400
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds bad,</v>

363
00:13:51.401 --> 00:13:56.401
<v Speaker 3>but it's kind of better because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>no chance to get in trouble for me at </v>

364
00:13:56.401 --> 00:13:57.470
<v Speaker 3>least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

365
00:13:57.471 --> 00:13:59.610
<v Speaker 3>like after a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

366
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.700
<v Speaker 3>you get aggravated one day and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's those guys in our fake tough </v>

367
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.410
<v Speaker 3>guys and they want to be jerks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always a little politics.</v>

368
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.300
<v Speaker 3>You get in one little fight and next </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing you know,</v>

369
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm back in jail for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for who knows how long,</v>

370
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:14.131
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So especially depending upon what </v>

371
00:14:14.131 --> 00:14:15.700
<v Speaker 3>happens because I was in jail in San </v>
<v Speaker 3>Diego when I was in the mainland still.</v>

372
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.540
<v Speaker 3>And these guys were playing chess or </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushups and uh,</v>

373
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.330
<v Speaker 3>it was a little Asian guy looked at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was actually from mom,</v>

374
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.040
<v Speaker 3>Burma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice old man.</v>

375
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:29.180
<v Speaker 3>He was only in there because him and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a wife and three kids and a tow </v>

376
00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.190
<v Speaker 3>truck driver was towing his car and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

377
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:30.610
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

378
00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:30.740
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

379
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Try and stop them until the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pushed the driver so they put them in</v>

380
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:34.900
<v Speaker 3>jail for assault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

381
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.540
<v Speaker 3>While she was in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's playing chess with a,</v>

382
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:39.700
<v Speaker 3>with another guy and they bet 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushups.</v>

383
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.710
<v Speaker 3>The Burmese guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he won and he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And starts punching the Burmese guy.</v>

390
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 3>He hit him like three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four times in the guy who a,</v>

391
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 3>he closed his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one overhand right,</v>

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 3>knocked the guy out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy died,</v>

393
00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 3>the guy fell down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit his head.</v>

394
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.660
<v Speaker 3>They charged him with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They charged him with murder and it's on</v>

395
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:07.661
<v Speaker 3>camera like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know damn well that was held fence </v>

396
00:15:07.661 --> 00:15:09.720
<v Speaker 3>charged him with murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened to that guy </v>

397
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:09.720
<v Speaker 3>he was in.</v>

398
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.900
<v Speaker 3>He was in when I saw him in the hole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was there every day meditating.</v>

399
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.660
<v Speaker 3>He was the nicest old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he was probably like 45,</v>

400
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:17.300
<v Speaker 3>such a nice guy and that's a sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sad story,</v>

401
00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:18.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>

402
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.930
<v Speaker 3>and you know that that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he's,</v>

403
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.540
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

404
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:22.190
<v Speaker 3>he's Buddhist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's brainwashed.</v>

405
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.050
<v Speaker 3>This is my Karma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

406
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.530
<v Speaker 3>This is the plan for Godly accepting it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

407
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:29.450
<v Speaker 3>This is bullshit man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I felt so bad.</v>

408
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.580
<v Speaker 3>It made me want to cry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt bad for that guy.</v>

409
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:36.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There should be room in the system for </v>

410
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:36.730
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like with a guy like that.</v>

411
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:41.230
<v Speaker 3>It should be a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be able to pull the guy side </v>

412
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:41.230
<v Speaker 3>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

413
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:41.230
<v Speaker 3>Tell me what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

414
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.080
<v Speaker 3>What's your version of the story?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that?</v>

415
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:43.260
<v Speaker 3>And they should be like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

416
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.780
<v Speaker 3>just don't do this again.</v>

417
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.310
<v Speaker 3>And we're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just don't hit anybody,</v>

418
00:15:46.311 --> 00:15:48.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call the authorities if you have to toe,</v>

419
00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 3>toe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>toe touch people.</v>

420
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.830
<v Speaker 3>And the guy would probably be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll never happen again.</v>

421
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:54.440
<v Speaker 3>And then you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to put a guy like that in</v>

422
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:55.410
<v Speaker 3>a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

423
00:15:55.411 --> 00:15:56.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading,</v>

424
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.810
<v Speaker 3>reading like all these surveys and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>and articles,</v>

425
00:15:59.811 --> 00:16:04.811
<v Speaker 3>but they were saying that like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have more people in jail than any </v>

426
00:16:04.811 --> 00:16:09.311
<v Speaker 3>country by far by far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we incarcerate people five times </v>

427
00:16:09.311 --> 00:16:09.770
<v Speaker 3>more than England and then end a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>second place.</v>

428
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:15.070
<v Speaker 3>We have more prisoners in California and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole country of Canada and the </v>

429
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:15.110
<v Speaker 3>crime rates are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why is everyone in jail?</v>

430
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:15.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand it.</v>

431
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.060
<v Speaker 3>It's a business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but will,</v>

432
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:20.690
<v Speaker 3>that is the thing that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a crazy thing to admit and it's a</v>

433
00:16:20.691 --> 00:16:22.370
<v Speaker 3>crazy thing to talk about because most </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

434
00:16:22.371 --> 00:16:23.450
<v Speaker 3>it sounds so unreasonable.</v>

435
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.850
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like you're saying that.</v>

436
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can George Bush plan nine slash 11 and</v>

437
00:16:27.771 --> 00:16:29.420
<v Speaker 3>almost sounds the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The prisons,</v>

438
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.300
<v Speaker 3>they make profit off of putting people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in jail.</v>

439
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.860
<v Speaker 3>What do you want to charge me for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>stamped envelope?</v>

440
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.480
<v Speaker 3>It was like eighty nine cents for </v>
<v Speaker 3>stamped envelope.</v>

441
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.700
<v Speaker 3>Do stats forty four cents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how much does the envelope?</v>

442
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.310
<v Speaker 3>They're taxed you and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's taxed a lot.</v>

443
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like selling drugs better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>

444
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just what's going on for that,</v>

445
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:49.700
<v Speaker 3>but the actually the private prisons are</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting paid.</v>

446
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.720
<v Speaker 3>You get paid by the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the government to the amount of </v>

447
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.100
<v Speaker 3>prisoners that they have is directly </v>
<v Speaker 3>proportionate to what they get paid.</v>

448
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was reading,</v>

449
00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:57.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

450
00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.270
<v Speaker 3>I was reading an old stats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

451
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.440
<v Speaker 3>So they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

452
00:17:00.441 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year in jail,</v>

453
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.950
<v Speaker 3>cost to the state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$55,000</v>

454
00:17:03.951 --> 00:17:05.690
<v Speaker 3>something dollars for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

455
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:07.310
<v Speaker 3>A year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

456
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's called house arrest costs $5,000.</v>

457
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.740
<v Speaker 3>House arrest your half is likely to </v>
<v Speaker 3>receive,</v>

458
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:16.400
<v Speaker 3>to do new crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

459
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 3>So they know that it's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why wouldn't you put the gun on house</v>

460
00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:22.010
<v Speaker 3>arrest if it's only for a year and save </v>
<v Speaker 3>space in jail,</v>

461
00:17:22.011 --> 00:17:22.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

462
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:23.570
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens,</v>

463
00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:24.860
<v Speaker 3>is that a year in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

464
00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:25.640
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only a year.</v>

465
00:17:25.641 --> 00:17:26.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But guess what,</v>

466
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.490
<v Speaker 3>you lost your job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You lost your credit.</v>

467
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.650
<v Speaker 3>He lost her house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she lost her car.</v>

468
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.910
<v Speaker 3>So you come out with nothing and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

469
00:17:32.911 --> 00:17:33.980
<v Speaker 3>all right man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to do good,</v>

470
00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:36.950
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to do one more crime to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get some money and then I'll.</v>

471
00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.440
<v Speaker 3>Then I'll be straight again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you on house arrest,</v>

472
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.540
<v Speaker 3>it's like a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're still jail.</v>

473
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:42.740
<v Speaker 3>You can't do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fun.</v>

474
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.950
<v Speaker 3>Jail to work or no home work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>home to work.</v>

475
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.590
<v Speaker 3>But at the end of that year you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>lose your credit.</v>

476
00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 3>You didn't lose your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't lose your car.</v>

477
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.240
<v Speaker 3>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

478
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:53.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get in trouble again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

479
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to start from zero.</v>

480
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:55.530
<v Speaker 3>You still where you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

481
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.930
<v Speaker 3>but the government doesn't get paid when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you under house arrest,</v>

482
00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.250
<v Speaker 3>25 grand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

483
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.330
<v Speaker 3>instead of 55.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it should work on what works better,</v>

484
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:05.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

485
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.380
<v Speaker 3>It was jacked up system that was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

486
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:08.270
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

487
00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:12.540
<v Speaker 3>it's for profit system and any for </v>
<v Speaker 3>profit system becomes an organism.</v>

488
00:18:12.541 --> 00:18:14.820
<v Speaker 3>An organism is protect themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what they do.</v>

489
00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:19.821
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you find out that prison guards </v>

490
00:18:19.821 --> 00:18:22.100
<v Speaker 3>lobby and the prison guard unions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they lobby to make sure that certain </v>

491
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.371
<v Speaker 3>drug laws are in place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want certain drug laws in place to </v>

492
00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:25.371
<v Speaker 3>ensure that there's a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoners.</v>

493
00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:26.250
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:27.690
<v Speaker 3>That's slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

495
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.370
<v Speaker 3>that is fucking slave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is dude.</v>

496
00:18:29.371 --> 00:18:34.371
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just like the same thing all across </v>

497
00:18:34.371 --> 00:18:34.371
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

498
00:18:34.371 --> 00:18:36.780
<v Speaker 3>the inner cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're canceling afterschool programs </v>

499
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.471
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all this stuff and they're building </v>

500
00:18:39.471 --> 00:18:39.540
<v Speaker 3>more juvenile halls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a coincidence.</v>

501
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to fuck in these inner </v>
<v Speaker 3>city kids.</v>

502
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.780
<v Speaker 3>They're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to gang bang or they're </v>

503
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:47.780
<v Speaker 3>gonna play sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

504
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.960
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hear the stories of these kids and </v>

505
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:50.960
<v Speaker 3>why I play sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay out of trouble.</v>

506
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.740
<v Speaker 3>Well now there's no sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I'm a gang,</v>

507
00:18:51.741 --> 00:18:53.810
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now there's more juvenile halls and they</v>

508
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.810
<v Speaker 3>want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucked up,</v>

509
00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:55.270
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

510
00:18:55.490 --> 00:19:00.490
<v Speaker 3>If you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were trying to follow a </v>

511
00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:00.490
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be the exact correct thing to</v>

512
00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.971
<v Speaker 3>do to make sure there's more crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you were going to try to prevent </v>

513
00:19:04.971 --> 00:19:04.971
<v Speaker 3>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>save lives,</v>

514
00:19:04.971 --> 00:19:05.360
<v Speaker 3>you would do the exact opposite thing.</v>

515
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.080
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't spend the money on juvenile</v>
<v Speaker 3>halls.</v>

516
00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:12.081
<v Speaker 3>He had spent it on community centers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You spend it on counselors spending on </v>

517
00:19:12.081 --> 00:19:12.081
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

518
00:19:12.081 --> 00:19:16.730
<v Speaker 3>I saw your story on pellets about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>father dying when you were young and I </v>

519
00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:23.061
<v Speaker 3>grew up without my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't spoken to my dad since I was </v>

520
00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:25.170
<v Speaker 3>seven and I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of young men,</v>

521
00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:28.840
<v Speaker 3>especially growing up without any sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of father figure,</v>

522
00:19:28.841 --> 00:19:31.320
<v Speaker 3>I can get it into a fuck load of </v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>

523
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:36.500
<v Speaker 3>You can get so distorted and twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of the easiest ways for a </v>

524
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.290
<v Speaker 3>young man grew up fucked up to not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>an example for sure.</v>

525
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.620
<v Speaker 3>We somehow or another we need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

526
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.360
<v Speaker 3>we like identifying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we sort of like,</v>

527
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.000
<v Speaker 3>we connect with these examples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Positive examples or negative examples.</v>

528
00:19:50.001 --> 00:19:52.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's also the issue that a lot of</v>

529
00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 3>people deal with where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

530
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:54.900
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fucked up.</v>

531
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in trouble yet either.</v>

532
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.530
<v Speaker 3>But they grew up in a piece of shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>household.</v>

533
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:03.710
<v Speaker 3>They grew up with an asshole for a dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know we're not all starting from </v>

534
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.371
<v Speaker 3>scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everybody's not starting on the </v>

535
00:20:07.371 --> 00:20:09.501
<v Speaker 3>same level.</v>

<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of shit that you're </v>

542
00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:24.340
<v Speaker 3>dealing with in your house on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>basis.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

545
00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:25.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

546
00:20:25.561 --> 00:20:27.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more out there than most people.</v>

547
00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:29.260
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

548
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:34.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to complain about my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for I turned out pretty good for </v>

549
00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:34.410
<v Speaker 3>considering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

550
00:20:34.411 --> 00:20:39.411
<v Speaker 3>And if it wasn't for me finding an </v>
<v Speaker 3>outlet and weight lifting and sports and</v>

551
00:20:39.841 --> 00:20:42.000
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have been a maniac.</v>

552
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure,</v>

553
00:20:43.121 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

554
00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:45.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you,</v>

555
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.110
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

556
00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 3>you went through a lot of crazy shit for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

557
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:53.220
<v Speaker 4>but you've always been a good dude to </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk to and that's one of the reasons </v>

558
00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:53.950
<v Speaker 4>why I wanted to have you on the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's where I think that people</v>

559
00:20:53.951 --> 00:20:58.951
<v Speaker 4>get the wrong impression of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a lot of people in the same </v>

560
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:02.710
<v Speaker 4>circumstances have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would have turned out even worse and</v>

561
00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:06.880
<v Speaker 4>that's the reality of life about knots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't start off in the same place.</v>

562
00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:09.760
<v Speaker 4>We don't even know what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was actually on a pretty good track.</v>

563
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.980
<v Speaker 4>My Dad died when I was 13.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gave him CPR.</v>

564
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:12.510
<v Speaker 4>He died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

565
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:17.850
<v Speaker 4>So I went to live with my mom and she </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a drug addict and my step dad's a </v>

566
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:17.850
<v Speaker 4>drug addict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The losers,</v>

567
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:18.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a mess and I had no rules,</v>

568
00:21:18.671 --> 00:21:19.330
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could do anything.</v>

569
00:21:19.331 --> 00:21:22.140
<v Speaker 4>I wanted no rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I want.</v>

570
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.350
<v Speaker 4>I found a gym I went to.</v>

571
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.320
<v Speaker 4>It was a little hole in the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim's called mips gym and seeing value.</v>

572
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:31.470
<v Speaker 4>That's where I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was all like cops and </v>

573
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 4>firefighters and ex military.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's an old crusty navy seal,</v>

574
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.110
<v Speaker 4>his name's Jim Taylor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like 55 x Vietnam Guy.</v>

575
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:36.360
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he came be.</v>

576
00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:39.480
<v Speaker 4>He became kind of like my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was actually,</v>

577
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.010
<v Speaker 4>I pictured when I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was Jackson.</v>

578
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:46.020
<v Speaker 4>I was a kid bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was like this in high school </v>

579
00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:46.020
<v Speaker 4>because I lifted weights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I played sports,</v>

<v Speaker 3>kidnap.</v>

796
00:29:18.091 --> 00:29:23.091
<v Speaker 3>They were doing it because they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>kidnapping these European captains of </v>

797
00:29:23.091 --> 00:29:24.640
<v Speaker 3>these boats that were dumping toxic </v>

<v Speaker 3>They're just pirates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to.</v>

814
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.960
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the story of my friends </v>

815
00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:11.960
<v Speaker 3>don't know the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet my name is Cielo friends.</v>

816
00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they had that in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Hanks movie.</v>

817
00:30:12.701 --> 00:30:17.701
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's an important part of why </v>

818
00:30:17.701 --> 00:30:20.761
<v Speaker 3>those fucking deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you just fell upon a </v>

819
00:30:20.761 --> 00:30:22.110
<v Speaker 3>village of [inaudible] and they all </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine guns.</v>

820
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:27.120
<v Speaker 3>They're hopping into boats now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These poor fishermen for thousands of </v>

821
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.020
<v Speaker 3>years and we ruined their fish in like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that for thousands of years.</v>

822
00:30:29.021 --> 00:30:31.450
<v Speaker 3>These people live the exact same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fishing,</v>

823
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.820
<v Speaker 3>living off the land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a good time,</v>

824
00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:39.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting by and all of a sudden some </v>

825
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:39.180
<v Speaker 3>assets to dunk nuclear waste off duty.</v>

826
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:44.190
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always say technology is the great </v>

827
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:44.190
<v Speaker 3>evil dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

828
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:48.240
<v Speaker 3>some humans are evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's technology mean before technology?</v>

829
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:50.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gingiss con was evil as fuck.</v>

830
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was people that would be,</v>

831
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:57.450
<v Speaker 3>I guess both our technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's technology for back then people </v>

832
00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:57.450
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

833
00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.430
<v Speaker 3>do we have a great propensity for evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>and for good,</v>

834
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:05.460
<v Speaker 3>but I mean now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like as far as like the world </v>

835
00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.431
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean as it was all of history as far </v>

836
00:31:08.431 --> 00:31:08.590
<v Speaker 3>as in the last hundred years with </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>

837
00:31:08.591 --> 00:31:09.980
<v Speaker 3>we polluted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's fucked up.</v>

838
00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:10.960
<v Speaker 3>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

839
00:31:10.961 --> 00:31:12.880
<v Speaker 3>So I'm seeing that technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know in my.</v>

840
00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:17.970
<v Speaker 3>My thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that because I believe that the </v>

841
00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:18.400
<v Speaker 3>Michigan Lincoln Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that shit was really alien to know.</v>

842
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.550
<v Speaker 3>Do you really believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've written.</v>

843
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:25.560
<v Speaker 3>I read the best books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read a ball to the twelfth plants </v>

844
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:25.560
<v Speaker 3>series.</v>

845
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:25.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

846
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.330
<v Speaker 3>Zechariah stitching fucking good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Makes more sense than anything else </v>

847
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:30.330
<v Speaker 3>you've got to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Situation is wrong.</v>

848
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.380
<v Speaker 3>Dot Com and then they prove them wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

849
00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:33.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

850
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of what he,</v>

851
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:39.631
<v Speaker 3>based on his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his interpretation of some really </v>

852
00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:43.201
<v Speaker 3>bizarre old tax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's really incredible about the </v>

853
00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:44.680
<v Speaker 3>Sumerians was how much they absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>did know.</v>

854
00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:49.980
<v Speaker 3>There was many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many first came out of that area as far </v>

855
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.220
<v Speaker 3>as we know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First we'll first written language,</v>

856
00:31:51.221 --> 00:31:52.480
<v Speaker 3>first agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>

857
00:31:52.481 --> 00:31:57.481
<v Speaker 3>mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first written language that we're aware </v>

858
00:31:57.481 --> 00:31:57.481
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they had a Godfrey's thing.</v>

859
00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.320
<v Speaker 3>That's why I was thinking it made sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

860
00:31:59.321 --> 00:32:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for math,</v>

861
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.770
<v Speaker 3>because that was the elite and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought of math.</v>

862
00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.180
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The God for fucking I'll culture.</v>

863
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy showed me how to fucking make a</v>

864
00:32:08.001 --> 00:32:09.250
<v Speaker 3>farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be.</v>

865
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.010
<v Speaker 3>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had no way to prove either way,</v>

866
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:13.690
<v Speaker 3>but I figured like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this,</v>

867
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:14.950
<v Speaker 3>look at the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the earth.</v>

868
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:16.990
<v Speaker 3>We're the only thing that doesn't belong</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

869
00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.380
<v Speaker 3>We're the only thing on this earth that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't live on the earth,</v>

870
00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.150
<v Speaker 3>were wearing clothes with live in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings.</v>

871
00:32:22.151 --> 00:32:23.680
<v Speaker 3>Everything else is living on it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

872
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:24.850
<v Speaker 3>We're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>

873
00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:25.510
<v Speaker 3>we don't belong here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

874
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.370
<v Speaker 3>like we're out of place with the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that's out of place.</v>

875
00:32:27.371 --> 00:32:29.740
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're half fucking alien,</v>

876
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.750
<v Speaker 3>half human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't belong here.</v>

877
00:32:31.751 --> 00:32:33.640
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like us as dogs,</v>

878
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.470
<v Speaker 3>dogs are like us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they live.</v>

879
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.560
<v Speaker 3>They live off the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

880
00:32:36.561 --> 00:32:37.930
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How they're very.</v>

881
00:32:37.931 --> 00:32:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be like me and Shaquille o'neal</v>

882
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.030
<v Speaker 1>are the same species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could buy the same woman pregnant.</v>

883
00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.080
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

884
00:32:45.081 --> 00:32:48.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like a giraffe and a horse being </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to get a cow pregnant,</v>

885
00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.640
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

886
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't look anything alike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll bridge it to midget and Michael </v>

887
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the same species.</v>

888
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.110
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same.</v>

889
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Just like dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dogs are the only animal that we're </v>

890
00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:03.520
<v Speaker 1>aware of that have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogance that can interbreed like that.</v>

891
00:33:03.521 --> 00:33:08.521
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very strange thing because we </v>

892
00:33:08.521 --> 00:33:10.151
<v Speaker 1>know that dogs were human manipulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the whole argument with people </v>

893
00:33:10.151 --> 00:33:12.260
<v Speaker 1>that were the reason why there's a quote</v>
<v Speaker 1>unquote missing link,</v>

894
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:17.320
<v Speaker 1>which are I guess apparently when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to people really understand </v>

895
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:17.330
<v Speaker 1>biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there really isn't a missing link.</v>

896
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of the fossil record </v>
<v Speaker 1>been very difficult for all the pieces.</v>

897
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:26.200
<v Speaker 1>See the fossil record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue with fossils is if you die or </v>

898
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.431
<v Speaker 1>I die right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like say if there's a gas leak in </v>

899
00:33:30.431 --> 00:33:30.431
<v Speaker 1>this building and explode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not gonna leave.</v>

900
00:33:30.431 --> 00:33:33.500
<v Speaker 1>A fossil man has stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be stuck in mud or something.</v>

901
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:36.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's real hard to make a fossil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's probably.</v>

902
00:33:36.401 --> 00:33:38.030
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans are smart,</v>

903
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:43.210
<v Speaker 1>so the odds of them getting fossilized </v>
<v Speaker 1>are probably less likely than a dumb </v>

904
00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.631
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buffalo falls into a pit and all his </v>

905
00:33:46.631 --> 00:33:46.631
<v Speaker 1>buddies fall right in after them cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all fucking stupid.</v>

906
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Nobody figures out how to get the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes such good sense because it's like </v>

907
00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.090
<v Speaker 1>how they said that they came here and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

908
00:33:53.091 --> 00:33:57.140
<v Speaker 1>the in between links,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the monkey is Kinda guy like,</v>

909
00:33:57.141 --> 00:34:02.141
<v Speaker 1>well these things were fucking smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not smart enough to do what </v>

910
00:34:02.141 --> 00:34:02.141
<v Speaker 1>we would want them to do.</v>

911
00:34:02.141 --> 00:34:02.210
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still like animals,</v>

912
00:34:02.211 --> 00:34:03.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always put some,</v>

913
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.260
<v Speaker 1>put some our genes and I'm smart and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

914
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

915
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.850
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

916
00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.360
<v Speaker 1>It's sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

917
00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.420
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

918
00:34:11.421 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 1>like the Old Testament or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those stories,</v>

919
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.320
<v Speaker 1>if you read them in the terms of not God</v>
<v Speaker 1>but aliens.</v>

920
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:17.770
<v Speaker 1>That makes way more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

921
00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.290
<v Speaker 1>that's the switch and said he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nephew,</v>

922
00:34:19.291 --> 00:34:22.580
<v Speaker 1>limb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he got in trouble when he was in</v>

923
00:34:22.581 --> 00:34:26.840
<v Speaker 1>school because he said that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>translations were incorrect.</v>

924
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.060
<v Speaker 1>He said that the Nephilim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

925
00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would call them giants amongst men.</v>

926
00:34:30.801 --> 00:34:32.570
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was saying that isn't,</v>

927
00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:37.571
<v Speaker 1>it isn't the eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual translation shouldn't be </v>

928
00:34:37.571 --> 00:34:38.550
<v Speaker 1>those who came down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning those came from above.</v>

929
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.440
<v Speaker 1>And then the Annunaki,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the literal translation.</v>

930
00:34:42.441 --> 00:34:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Apparently as those from heaven to earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>came,</v>

931
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.550
<v Speaker 1>the idea that they came from some guys.</v>

932
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

933
00:34:47.331 --> 00:34:52.331
<v Speaker 1>if we put a fucking robot on Mars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2014 and we could watch realtime video </v>

934
00:34:52.331 --> 00:34:54.530
<v Speaker 1>that moving around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fact that things up there.</v>

935
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Humans are just one form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

936
00:34:57.771 --> 00:34:59.540
<v Speaker 1>If the universe is filled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

937
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you they're going to want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out what's on other planets.</v>

938
00:35:02.331 --> 00:35:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't they send things?</v>

939
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.990
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to go places course and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would definitely visit if we could,</v>

940
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:14.020
<v Speaker 1>if we could visit Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't been able to figure out how </v>

941
00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.241
<v Speaker 1>to do it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're trying to figure it out </v>

942
00:35:16.241 --> 00:35:18.160
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might be 20 years away from a person </v>

943
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:18.160
<v Speaker 1>going to Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if that's the case,</v>

944
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.970
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't someone come from another </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet?</v>

945
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.730
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is nobody agrees with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

946
00:35:22.731 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>translations.</v>

947
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:27.770
<v Speaker 1>That's one one problem and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is that all these people want to</v>

948
00:35:27.771 --> 00:35:29.270
<v Speaker 1>believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so bad.</v>

949
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:32.420
<v Speaker 1>It's so sexy that they don't look it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as a.</v>

950
00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe they gravitate towards it and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>run with it like this is the aliens came</v>

951
00:35:37.411 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 1>and they work with our</v>

952
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.840
<v Speaker 3>DA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you sure bitch you're not.</v>

953
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.840
<v Speaker 3>You're not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it makes more sense than the Bible.</v>

954
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.580
<v Speaker 3>It definitely makes more sense to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bible,</v>

955
00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:46.650
<v Speaker 3>but it's probably related.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I could pick,</v>

956
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.380
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather of the Bible to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to go to fucking heaven.</v>

957
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Just such thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

958
00:35:51.031 --> 00:35:56.031
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather have that true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather have Santa Claus all the </v>

959
00:35:56.031 --> 00:35:56.031
<v Speaker 3>fairytale fairytales.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True,</v>

960
00:35:56.031 --> 00:35:58.800
<v Speaker 3>but I just think it makes more sense if </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an option Bible aliens.</v>

961
00:35:58.801 --> 00:36:00.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm picking the aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's an either or option.</v>

962
00:36:00.931 --> 00:36:01.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

963
00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.770
<v Speaker 3>the real problem with the Bible is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that telephone game.</v>

964
00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tell your friends story,</v>

965
00:36:06.661 --> 00:36:08.550
<v Speaker 3>he tells time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets back to you.</v>

966
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:09.780
<v Speaker 3>It's fucked the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

967
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:15.170
<v Speaker 3>And they told the stories of the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 3>for over a thousand years before they </v>

968
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:15.170
<v Speaker 3>ever wrote them down.</v>

969
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:19.940
<v Speaker 3>The oldest version of the Bible they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have is in Aramaic and it's founded in </v>

970
00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.240
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these clay pots in a place called Qumran</v>

971
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:24.230
<v Speaker 3>and it's called the Dead Sea Scrolls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

972
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.440
<v Speaker 3>That's the oldest version of the Nag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hammadi scrolls wherever.</v>

973
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:28.640
<v Speaker 3>The other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

974
00:36:28.641 --> 00:36:33.641
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's quite a few ancient animal </v>

975
00:36:33.641 --> 00:36:33.641
<v Speaker 3>skins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

976
00:36:33.641 --> 00:36:35.520
<v Speaker 3>Even the Samaritans had almost the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

977
00:36:35.521 --> 00:36:37.980
<v Speaker 3>It's just different names.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an old story.</v>

978
00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:38.910
<v Speaker 3>From what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>From what?</v>

979
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:39.810
<v Speaker 3>Who's taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who taught us that?</v>

980
00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be a bunch of different things,</v>

981
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:42.120
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

982
00:36:42.121 --> 00:36:46.680
<v Speaker 3>you stop and think about the variance in</v>
<v Speaker 3>how far cultures of advanced today.</v>

983
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Like you could today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could go to the Amazon and find some</v>

984
00:36:49.481 --> 00:36:51.480
<v Speaker 3>marine forest people that never seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

985
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.700
<v Speaker 3>You show them your watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be freaking out.</v>

986
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.980
<v Speaker 3>You show them a laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think you're a fucking wizard.</v>

987
00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just think about that today.</v>

988
00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.000
<v Speaker 3>But that happened in World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

989
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it did.</v>

990
00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.030
<v Speaker 3>Island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're from,</v>

991
00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chariots of the gods,</v>

992
00:37:05.031 --> 00:37:09.270
<v Speaker 3>a Erich von Daniken documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we gave them candies and shit.</v>

993
00:37:09.271 --> 00:37:12.540
<v Speaker 3>And like they thought we were a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they built fake airplanes.</v>

994
00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:17.541
<v Speaker 3>The worship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want us to come back and whenever </v>

995
00:37:17.541 --> 00:37:17.541
<v Speaker 3>he came back and we want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

996
00:37:17.541 --> 00:37:18.900
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

997
00:37:18.901 --> 00:37:20.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what it's like.</v>

998
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.760
<v Speaker 3>I think that if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>superintelligent race or a super </v>

999
00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:29.191
<v Speaker 3>intelligent civilization rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you run into someone of your own </v>

1000
00:37:29.191 --> 00:37:32.481
<v Speaker 3>race that just happens to be trapped in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the outback of Australia and living off </v>

1001
00:37:32.481 --> 00:37:36.981
<v Speaker 3>the land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have no idea that within a </v>

1002
00:37:36.981 --> 00:37:36.981
<v Speaker 3>thousand years they had been living like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1003
00:37:36.981 --> 00:37:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Which cultures exist in the same static </v>
<v Speaker 3>state for a thousand years all the time,</v>

1004
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:42.270
<v Speaker 3>but look what's happened in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

1005
00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Just 200 fucking years crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no America.</v>

1006
00:37:44.881 --> 00:37:46.530
<v Speaker 3>Three hundred years ago it didn't exist.</v>

1007
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.570
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no buildings.</v>

1008
00:37:48.571 --> 00:37:51.960
<v Speaker 3>There's no roads and in 300 years you </v>
<v Speaker 3>got la,</v>

1009
00:37:51.961 --> 00:37:53.880
<v Speaker 3>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Orleans,</v>

1010
00:37:53.881 --> 00:37:57.090
<v Speaker 3>and fucking fucking chaos all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1011
00:37:57.091 --> 00:38:02.091
<v Speaker 3>That's a blip in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for these people living in a static </v>

1012
00:38:02.091 --> 00:38:03.570
<v Speaker 3>state for a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden people come in.</v>

1013
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.160
<v Speaker 3>Then they tell stories about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1014
00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:07.380
<v Speaker 3>Those people are fucking alien span.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They came,</v>

1015
00:38:07.381 --> 00:38:12.381
<v Speaker 3>they had chariots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horses drove them around like when the </v>

1016
00:38:12.381 --> 00:38:13.280
<v Speaker 3>ink is first saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

1017
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Spaniards,</v>

1018
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:17.880
<v Speaker 3>they thought they were fucking God's </v>
<v Speaker 3>people on horses.</v>

1019
00:38:17.881 --> 00:38:19.260
<v Speaker 3>They thought they were a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>horse.</v>

1020
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.060
<v Speaker 3>They didn't even know what the fuck was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

1021
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.220
<v Speaker 3>They thought it was quite so quantile </v>
<v Speaker 3>returning.</v>

1022
00:38:23.221 --> 00:38:25.470
<v Speaker 3>They had no idea was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were freaking out.</v>

1023
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.460
<v Speaker 3>So I think that those stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

1024
00:38:28.461 --> 00:38:33.461
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with over a thousand </v>

1025
00:38:33.461 --> 00:38:33.461
<v Speaker 3>years of them telling them back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth before anybody writes them down.</v>

1026
00:38:33.461 --> 00:38:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Then they write them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They write them down an era man,</v>

1027
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:36.080
<v Speaker 3>they</v>

1028
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.010
<v Speaker 1>write them down in ancient Hebrew and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meech and Hebrew.</v>

1029
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:44.160
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they only know like three out of four </v>

1030
00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.051
<v Speaker 1>words today in ancient Hebrew and </v>
<v Speaker 1>letters were numbers like the word God </v>

1031
00:38:46.051 --> 00:38:50.791
<v Speaker 1>and the word love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had the same numeric value like </v>

1032
00:38:50.791 --> 00:38:53.821
<v Speaker 1>words like war machine would have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific numeric value that would not </v>

1033
00:38:53.821 --> 00:38:58.321
<v Speaker 1>just represent your name but also like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you are and like a person who your </v>

1034
00:38:58.321 --> 00:39:03.271
<v Speaker 1>lover or your mother would represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a certain number to it and that </v>

1035
00:39:03.271 --> 00:39:06.100
<v Speaker 1>was important in the waist sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was translating information.</v>

1036
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.790
<v Speaker 1>They lost all that shit when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>translated it to to Greek,</v>

1037
00:39:09.791 --> 00:39:14.791
<v Speaker 1>into Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they did all that's missing and say </v>

1038
00:39:14.791 --> 00:39:16.600
<v Speaker 1>you get this flat interpretation of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bizarre,</v>

1039
00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:21.601
<v Speaker 1>ancient language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a language that it was also </v>

1040
00:39:21.601 --> 00:39:22.570
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a math and a language together.</v>

1041
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.630
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for us to even wrap our heads </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

1042
00:39:24.631 --> 00:39:26.470
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy that people fucking </v>

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I was so dizzy trying to fuck her going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to throw up.</v>

1157
00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:41.180
<v Speaker 3>I laid down and I was asked if he did </v>
<v Speaker 3>come and throw up at the same time I </v>

1158
00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:42.290
<v Speaker 3>laid down bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1159
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.190
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just got to ride me.</v>

1160
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:45.370
<v Speaker 3>But I couldn't lay flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The room was spinning.</v>

1161
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:46.610
<v Speaker 3>Did you call her bro?</v>

1162
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Fucking hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were.</v>

1163
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:55.870
<v Speaker 3>But I had to sit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to stood up like upright and have </v>

1164
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:55.910
<v Speaker 3>a riding because I laid down the room </v>
<v Speaker 3>was spinning.</v>

1165
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.920
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1166
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.810
<v Speaker 3>But he jacked me up with those elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

1167
00:43:58.811 --> 00:44:01.430
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the most effective uses </v>
<v Speaker 3>of elbows from the guard.</v>

1168
00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:06.440
<v Speaker 3>I've ever seen the only other time I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen something really crazy from the </v>

1169
00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.561
<v Speaker 3>guard looked at as you're Brian Hall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop that dude from his guard on the </v>

1170
00:44:08.561 --> 00:44:11.861
<v Speaker 3>last issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last version of tough and you have </v>

1171
00:44:11.861 --> 00:44:12.380
<v Speaker 3>to guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on top.</v>

1172
00:44:12.381 --> 00:44:13.390
<v Speaker 3>He got reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had to do,</v>

1173
00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.830
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget how he got into his car,</v>

1174
00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his guard,</v>

1175
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.980
<v Speaker 3>knocks the guy out with punches from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

1176
00:44:18.981 --> 00:44:21.320
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't seem that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen that before.</v>

1177
00:44:21.321 --> 00:44:26.240
<v Speaker 3>But that mother fucker hits hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that Jay rock fight was also intense</v>

1178
00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:28.430
<v Speaker 3>because you guys were really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

1179
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:33.640
<v Speaker 3>You guys have become real close in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>house and you were hitting him and then </v>

1180
00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:33.640
<v Speaker 3>you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

1181
00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.620
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

1182
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:35.060
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1183
00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:36.380
<v Speaker 3>we were talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1184
00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.240
<v Speaker 3>we talk and during the fight and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing it like a couple feet from me</v>

1185
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.010
<v Speaker 3>and I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1186
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:43.740
<v Speaker 3>this is some heavy shit and I'm trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do the commentary.</v>

1187
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:48.890
<v Speaker 3>I would like to have just been able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>just say nothing and just watch it </v>

1188
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:49.680
<v Speaker 3>because it was a great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was also like,</v>

1189
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.050
<v Speaker 3>there was a crazy interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

1190
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:52.740
<v Speaker 3>It was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1191
00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:54.880
<v Speaker 3>after the fight when you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>me A.</v>

1192
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:58.950
<v Speaker 3>I cried because I was happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cry because I was sad because I ruined</v>

1193
00:44:58.951 --> 00:45:00.060
<v Speaker 3>his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His dreams.</v>

1194
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was genuine.</v>

1195
00:45:00.901 --> 00:45:02.650
<v Speaker 3>It was very genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like fuck,</v>

1196
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:05.380
<v Speaker 3>like was I want to win it because at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>end of the day is my,</v>

1197
00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:10.540
<v Speaker 3>my life has to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to kick with my </v>

1198
00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:10.540
<v Speaker 3>friend's dreams.</v>

1199
00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:10.540
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1200
00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.310
<v Speaker 3>And that's the hard thing about mma is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if we were making,</v>

1201
00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.780
<v Speaker 3>if we're all making maybe with her money</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1202
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.920
<v Speaker 3>like oh just go joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 million.</v>

1203
00:45:17.921 --> 00:45:22.921
<v Speaker 3>She gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like when you know that the person </v>

1204
00:45:22.921 --> 00:45:22.921
<v Speaker 3>that they lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might not,</v>

1205
00:45:22.921 --> 00:45:25.300
<v Speaker 3>they might not have a job anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different doing,</v>

1206
00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:30.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you like the Guy George </v>

1207
00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:30.400
<v Speaker 3>said it best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said he would never fight a friend.</v>

1208
00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.240
<v Speaker 3>He said because there's things that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>does to Apollo.</v>

1209
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 3>He would never do to a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said I just couldn't.</v>

1210
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:35.970
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't not do it if I was on top of </v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

1211
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:40.260
<v Speaker 3>I could not deliver elbows to his head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Concussive damage.</v>

1212
00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:45.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just talking about like the </v>

1213
00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:45.860
<v Speaker 3>viciousness of dropping elbows on </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's head.</v>

1214
00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:46.260
<v Speaker 3>You just wouldn't do that to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend.</v>

1215
00:45:46.261 --> 00:45:47.610
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be able to do that to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend.</v>

1216
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But more than that,</v>

1217
00:45:49.081 --> 00:45:54.081
<v Speaker 3>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spoil my buddies and we'd beat the </v>

1218
00:45:54.081 --> 00:45:54.081
<v Speaker 3>shit out of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1219
00:45:54.081 --> 00:45:54.081
<v Speaker 3>there's a little different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1220
00:45:54.081 --> 00:45:55.270
<v Speaker 3>It's different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but trying to kill him.</v>

1221
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:56.880
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1222
00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.660
<v Speaker 3>there's the fee thing in competition </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's fucking real.</v>

1223
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.100
<v Speaker 3>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1224
00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:04.860
<v Speaker 3>this is not just competing in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1225
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:06.390
<v Speaker 3>this is ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ready,</v>

1226
00:46:06.391 --> 00:46:07.080
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ding.</v>

1227
00:46:07.081 --> 00:46:08.550
<v Speaker 3>The bell rings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cameras are on you.</v>

1228
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.780
<v Speaker 3>There's no take backs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no redos.</v>

1229
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:12.480
<v Speaker 3>The hard part would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1230
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.850
<v Speaker 3>would be finishing in front enough ones </v>
<v Speaker 3>that hurt.</v>

1231
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Like say if you're going to knock him </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and then that has happened.</v>

1232
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.650
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you rock him and he's like,</v>

1233
00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to put them out that,</v>

1234
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:23.740
<v Speaker 3>that'd be like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1235
00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:25.830
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd want the rep to stop it.</v>

1236
00:46:25.831 --> 00:46:26.490
<v Speaker 3>It'd be different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1237
00:46:26.491 --> 00:46:28.680
<v Speaker 3>like Mochida Munoz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect example,</v>

1238
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:33.710
<v Speaker 3>real good friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Machita head kicks him and moved into </v>

1239
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:33.710
<v Speaker 3>close the show and decided not to.</v>

1240
00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Whereas anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would have hit him with seven punches</v>

1241
00:46:36.421 --> 00:46:38.350
<v Speaker 3>before that referee kill mode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1242
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:39.960
<v Speaker 3>he gets into those fucking karate </v>
<v Speaker 3>punches.</v>

1243
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:43.380
<v Speaker 3>He throws those rapid fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right hands.</v>

1244
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:45.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Machida's a closer.</v>

1245
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:50.300
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a perfect example of the </v>

1246
00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:50.300
<v Speaker 3>difference between fighting a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was crazy.</v>

1247
00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:55.010
<v Speaker 3>That was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Head kicked too because he knocked them </v>

1248
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.010
<v Speaker 3>out through his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had his guard up.</v>

1249
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:56.370
<v Speaker 3>He went through his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes that's not enough.</v>

1250
00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:00.120
<v Speaker 3>Not enough for a head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some power in the dude like that</v>

1251
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:02.750
<v Speaker 3>is so fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why the Thai guys,</v>

1252
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.860
<v Speaker 3>they both hands and away from their </v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

1253
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

1254
00:47:06.831 --> 00:47:08.700
<v Speaker 3>it'll still at the Andrew transfers </v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

1255
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:13.870
<v Speaker 3>through your army.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it hard to make that transition </v>

1256
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:13.870
<v Speaker 3>though to the smaller gloves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

1257
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:18.681
<v Speaker 3>the problem with the smaller gloves too </v>
<v Speaker 3>is when dudes try to do like that k one </v>

1258
00:47:18.681 --> 00:47:19.290
<v Speaker 3>styled Dutch thing like this.</v>

1259
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.980
<v Speaker 3>There's all these openings that don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist with those exact.</v>

1260
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:26.210
<v Speaker 3>This is exactly why since two years ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>I refused the spoiler.</v>

1261
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.530
<v Speaker 3>Big Loss and I don't do it ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do it.</v>

1262
00:47:28.531 --> 00:47:32.800
<v Speaker 3>Smart could just be and people say and </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous,</v>

1263
00:47:32.801 --> 00:47:33.670
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what,</v>

1264
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:36.960
<v Speaker 3>watching UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing from punches,</v>

1265
00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:39.310
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>headbutts,</v>

1266
00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.170
<v Speaker 3>accident needs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever I'm that happens,</v>

1267
00:47:41.171 --> 00:47:46.171
<v Speaker 3>but it's rare and they're going all out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Punches usually don't get cut that much </v>

1268
00:47:46.171 --> 00:47:48.160
<v Speaker 3>and in practice I've never cut normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>little gloves.</v>

1269
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:53.190
<v Speaker 3>When you grease your face up to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight and fight a lot of grease and they</v>

1270
00:47:54.551 --> 00:47:58.180
<v Speaker 3>sell the puffy sparring gloves and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you what mean.</v>

1271
00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:00.550
<v Speaker 3>We go hard with those and I've never </v>
<v Speaker 3>been cut,</v>

1272
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:05.670
<v Speaker 3>not cut anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then when I was sparring j Romley </v>

1273
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:07.150
<v Speaker 3>foster and pure long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>headgear ambig gloves.</v>

1274
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:08.440
<v Speaker 3>I cut the shit out of him.</v>

1275
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.410
<v Speaker 3>I just a wild party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what's happening.</v>

1276
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.830
<v Speaker 3>If it's gonna happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna happen,</v>

1277
00:48:11.831 --> 00:48:16.831
<v Speaker 3>but like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big loves you can get used to </v>

1278
00:48:16.831 --> 00:48:16.831
<v Speaker 3>blocking way differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big old thing,</v>

1279
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.000
<v Speaker 3>but you can't block that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't.</v>

1280
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.550
<v Speaker 3>I only probably a little gloves now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1281
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.410
<v Speaker 3>you see that a lot from like the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>high level kickboxer guys.</v>

1282
00:48:23.411 --> 00:48:26.890
<v Speaker 3>They'd go into mma when they realized </v>
<v Speaker 3>how many openings are left,</v>

1283
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:32.010
<v Speaker 3>where they're so used to like if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>find like a nicky hold sand in one of </v>

1284
00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:33.730
<v Speaker 3>those type guys that like fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that classic Amsterdam style,</v>

1285
00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.360
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1286
00:48:34.361 --> 00:48:36.250
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have that hands up high,</v>

1287
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:41.251
<v Speaker 3>which is fantastic for kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when guys like that enter to mma </v>

1288
00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:42.280
<v Speaker 3>like alister,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's.</v>

1289
00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:45.520
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird thing because there's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these openings there now and say,</v>

1290
00:48:45.521 --> 00:48:46.570
<v Speaker 3>I think that you want good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1291
00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Boxers are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can,</v>

1292
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:49.360
<v Speaker 3>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can block always punches.</v>

1293
00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:50.770
<v Speaker 3>That was a little bit ain't gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>Happen.</v>

1294
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:54.700
<v Speaker 3>It's not going it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what happens is if your defense,</v>

1295
00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.200
<v Speaker 3>if you're not comfortable in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>defense,</v>

1296
00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:59.830
<v Speaker 3>then it ruined everything because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>start panicking like why am I,</v>

1297
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:00.910
<v Speaker 3>how's it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's it hitting me?</v>

1298
00:49:00.911 --> 00:49:03.490
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Such a difference in the impact as well.</v>

1299
00:49:03.491 --> 00:49:08.491
<v Speaker 3>If even if you do catch a punch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you catch a guys right hand </v>

1300
00:49:08.491 --> 00:49:09.880
<v Speaker 3>and you know you have it in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your face with that little glove,</v>

1301
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:13.930
<v Speaker 3>there's not much protecting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You enhance that big ass glove.</v>

1302
00:49:13.931 --> 00:49:18.931
<v Speaker 3>The boxing glove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a big pillow hitting you in </v>

1303
00:49:18.931 --> 00:49:18.931
<v Speaker 3>the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously you know,</v>

1304
00:49:18.931 --> 00:49:23.251
<v Speaker 3>it's still fucking hurts and dudes get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's such a difference in those </v>

1305
00:49:23.251 --> 00:49:25.270
<v Speaker 3>four rounds to eight ounce gloves to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous difference and most of them are</v>

1306
00:49:25.271 --> 00:49:26.380
<v Speaker 3>fighting with 10 ounce gloves.</v>

1307
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:27.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1308
00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.440
<v Speaker 3>the last two years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1309
00:49:29.441 --> 00:49:34.441
<v Speaker 3>I don't it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like right now I could towards him like </v>

1310
00:49:34.441 --> 00:49:35.500
<v Speaker 3>tours and they do Tuesday is little </v>
<v Speaker 3>gloves and there's this big lifts.</v>

1311
00:49:35.501 --> 00:49:37.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't go to Thursday really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they say,</v>

1312
00:49:37.421 --> 00:49:40.360
<v Speaker 3>well it's good to do both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think is good is my opinion,</v>

1313
00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:44.980
<v Speaker 3>but I'm stubborn and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the way I don't believe in it.</v>

1314
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:50.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely different and it's </v>

1315
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:50.040
<v Speaker 3>interesting to see even though the court</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1316
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.961
<v Speaker 3>what year you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what year was your year of the ultimate </v>

1317
00:49:53.961 --> 00:49:53.961
<v Speaker 3>fighter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand seven.</v>

1318
00:49:53.961 --> 00:49:55.330
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even from 2007 to today,</v>

1319
00:49:55.331 --> 00:49:56.710
<v Speaker 3>thinking about how much things have </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed,</v>

1320
00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:01.920
<v Speaker 3>there was no we'll kicks back then no </v>
<v Speaker 3>front kicks to the face and what it was </v>

1321
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:01.920
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The karate kids were coming in.</v>

1322
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:06.990
<v Speaker 3>They were starting to now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like ufc one people thought quite.</v>

1323
00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.260
<v Speaker 3>It was disapproved because they got only</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing.</v>

1324
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.570
<v Speaker 3>Then everyone went to like wrestling Jiu</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jitsu and now cried.</v>

1325
00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:19.590
<v Speaker 3>He keeps coming back because I figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can box and wrestling Jiu Jitsu </v>

1326
00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:20.440
<v Speaker 3>and a cool credit kick acute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could work.</v>

1327
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.100
<v Speaker 3>You got to mix a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything because like even Bruni,</v>

1328
00:50:23.101 --> 00:50:26.390
<v Speaker 3>you don't fucking meathead Bruni.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well last year,</v>

1329
00:50:26.391 --> 00:50:28.790
<v Speaker 3>so I'm gonna start doing like shut up </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>

1330
00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:29.810
<v Speaker 3>I swear dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1331
00:50:29.811 --> 00:50:32.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm serious dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter was doing it and he's like,</v>

1332
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:33.750
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good to know.</v>

1333
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:35.280
<v Speaker 3>I just want to like three of those good </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicks.</v>

1334
00:50:35.281 --> 00:50:35.900
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1335
00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.280
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it won't hurt,</v>

1336
00:50:37.281 --> 00:50:42.281
<v Speaker 3>but you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I can't really picture Brian </v>

1337
00:50:42.281 --> 00:50:42.281
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can picture him doing it.</v>

1338
00:50:42.281 --> 00:50:42.440
<v Speaker 3>Could you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a bad ass kicked.</v>

1339
00:50:42.441 --> 00:50:44.960
<v Speaker 3>I was watching some videos of you </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicking the bag with St Pierre.</v>

1340
00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

1341
00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.010
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all I did was taekwondo,</v>

1342
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:53.550
<v Speaker 3>taekwondo fan type one was all kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kicks,</v>

1343
00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:58.810
<v Speaker 3>but the problem was I transitioned into </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing when I was 21 and my fucking </v>

1344
00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:01.070
<v Speaker 3>hands were terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was getting lit up in the gym,</v>

1345
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:06.220
<v Speaker 3>but I just couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought my hands were way better and </v>

1346
00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:06.220
<v Speaker 3>then I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1347
00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:10.600
<v Speaker 3>I cut out like maybe 60 percent of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>taekwondo techniques and I concentrated </v>

1348
00:51:10.971 --> 00:51:14.510
<v Speaker 3>on like a core fundamental techniques </v>
<v Speaker 3>and started learning how to box and then</v>

1349
00:51:14.511 --> 00:51:16.070
<v Speaker 3>I started doing more Tine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized,</v>

1350
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.570
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's leg kicks.</v>

1351
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:18.740
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a.</v>

1352
00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:22.490
<v Speaker 3>those are lots of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone was so stubborn.</v>

1353
00:51:22.491 --> 00:51:24.410
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's good things and everything.</v>

1354
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:28.670
<v Speaker 3>The thing about learning the taekwondo </v>
<v Speaker 3>is you because there's no punches to the</v>

1355
00:51:28.671 --> 00:51:32.450
<v Speaker 3>face and there's no leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get really good at doing shit that's</v>

1356
00:51:32.451 --> 00:51:33.290
<v Speaker 3>super risky.</v>

1357
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:35.960
<v Speaker 3>If guys are throwing leg kicks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>punches you in the face,</v>

1358
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:41.170
<v Speaker 3>whereas you might not really get good at</v>
<v Speaker 3>those techniques because you wouldn't </v>

1359
00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:41.170
<v Speaker 3>put as much care to throw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1360
00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:41.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1361
00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:41.960
<v Speaker 3>So you get real good at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1362
00:51:41.961 --> 00:51:43.250
<v Speaker 3>and then when you learn those other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1363
00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.800
<v Speaker 3>you already have that crazy dexterity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1364
00:51:45.801 --> 00:51:50.240
<v Speaker 3>my boy has bad ass kicks at Radcliffe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the black kid and I'm living here.</v>

1365
00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:50.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1366
00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.250
<v Speaker 3>He has nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nasty kicks.</v>

1367
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:54.740
<v Speaker 3>His actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his mom taught him about it.</v>

1368
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Karate Pedis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the both of the brothers,</v>

1369
00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:59.060
<v Speaker 3>brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have nasty taekwondo.</v>

1370
00:51:59.061 --> 00:52:04.061
<v Speaker 3>They started out and taekwondo and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they learned from Duke Roufus all the </v>

1371
00:52:04.061 --> 00:52:05.060
<v Speaker 3>other fundamentals of kickboxing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mma.</v>

1372
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:10.210
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a good combination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good way to do it because </v>

1373
00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:10.210
<v Speaker 3>otherwise it's hard to learn those </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicks.</v>

1374
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:15.400
<v Speaker 3>It's hard unless you're feet to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck that kind of like </v>

1375
00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:15.400
<v Speaker 3>downloaded a black belt to his brain.</v>

1376
00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:15.740
<v Speaker 3>That's what Joe Silva said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1377
00:52:15.741 --> 00:52:20.741
<v Speaker 3>Well that's like he's a freak of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was like St Pierre,</v>

1378
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:27.070
<v Speaker 3>his first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you watch it in like second Canada </v>

1379
00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:27.070
<v Speaker 3>ring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't wrestle were shit.</v>

1380
00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:28.050
<v Speaker 3>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now he's like,</v>

1381
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:31.070
<v Speaker 3>no one can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wasn't a fascinating.</v>

1382
00:52:31.071 --> 00:52:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Now when you saw him lock up with Johnny</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hendricks,</v>

1383
00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:35.660
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't take Hendrix down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1384
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:38.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the difference between,</v>

1385
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you catch a guy,</v>

1386
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:42.710
<v Speaker 3>especially not in the transition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in between punches,</v>

1387
00:52:42.711 --> 00:52:44.960
<v Speaker 3>but actually just just trying to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>him down.</v>

1388
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Henry's hopping around on one leg,</v>

1389
00:52:48.201 --> 00:52:49.490
<v Speaker 3>punched him in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1390
00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:54.540
<v Speaker 3>And George couldn't take them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is crazy when you think about how </v>

1391
00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:54.540
<v Speaker 3>good George's wrestling is in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>his other fights.</v>

1392
00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:57.860
<v Speaker 3>Not that was a johnny did a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a burden.</v>

1393
00:52:57.861 --> 00:52:58.400
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1394
00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:59.660
<v Speaker 3>it was funny when the fight.</v>

1395
00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:00.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to fight.</v>

1396
00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:01.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he won the fight.</v>

1397
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:07.690
<v Speaker 3>He got robbed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think almost everybody that I've </v>

1398
00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:07.690
<v Speaker 3>talked to that watch that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1399
00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:11.770
<v Speaker 3>I want to say a period of when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't really know what.</v>

1400
00:53:11.771 --> 00:53:12.890
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want him to fight Johnny </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hendricks,</v>

1401
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.710
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>college tech beat Hendrix.</v>

1402
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.420
<v Speaker 3>That was a bad decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

1403
00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.510
<v Speaker 3>I think Katrin won that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was ready for Hendrix because I didn't</v>

1404
00:53:20.511 --> 00:53:22.370
<v Speaker 3>like how strict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a very close fight.</v>

1405
00:53:22.371 --> 00:53:25.580
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that if I was seeing pure man,</v>

1406
00:53:25.581 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 3>I would say fuck</v>

1407
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:28.590
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would fight Anderson and retire.</v>

1408
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.860
<v Speaker 4>I think it could be the Anderson who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually can't wrestle.</v>

1409
00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:34.210
<v Speaker 1>He's had headaches for the last couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years,</v>

1410
00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:35.440
<v Speaker 1>George.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1411
00:53:35.441 --> 00:53:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freddie Roach was just talking about it.</v>

1412
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:42.190
<v Speaker 1>George has had some migraines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been talking to them about it over </v>

1413
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.580
<v Speaker 1>the last two years has been suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Migraines,</v>

1414
00:53:42.581 --> 00:53:44.110
<v Speaker 1>so that was the personal problems we was</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

1415
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Well that was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there was some other stuff that </v>

1416
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.650
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the physical problems are legit.</v>

1417
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:51.940
<v Speaker 1>When he was on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1418
00:53:51.941 --> 00:53:55.040
<v Speaker 1>he was talking to me about aliens and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about like I was.</v>

1419
00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:56.110
<v Speaker 1>I was pushing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1420
00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:57.310
<v Speaker 1>you believe in aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe?</v>

1421
00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Like apparently when they filmed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>countdown show with him primetime show,</v>

1422
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:07.790
<v Speaker 1>there was a whole segment that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>filmed while he was talking about like </v>

1423
00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:08.320
<v Speaker 1>worrying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like has nightmares about being abducted</v>

1424
00:54:08.321 --> 00:54:11.350
<v Speaker 1>by aliens and then he has it in his mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he would do if,</v>

1425
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.330
<v Speaker 1>if aliens came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Anthony Junior,</v>

1426
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Donald told me about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1427
00:54:14.441 --> 00:54:19.441
<v Speaker 1>why didn't they put that in the show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the UFC didn't want to have that </v>

1428
00:54:19.441 --> 00:54:19.441
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like that's crazy.</v>

1429
00:54:19.441 --> 00:54:23.611
<v Speaker 1>So I asked him about it on the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things he was talking </v>

1430
00:54:23.611 --> 00:54:26.020
<v Speaker 1>about though was about missing time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometime I'm in my car and then all of a</v>

1431
00:54:26.021 --> 00:54:28.180
<v Speaker 1>sudden I'm at the gym and I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how it got there.</v>

1432
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:29.500
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay dude,</v>

1433
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:31.960
<v Speaker 1>like that is not aliens</v>

1434
00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:37.090
<v Speaker 4>that's called we had too much and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fact because I'm not that.</v>

1435
00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:41.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I punched drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I lose my car all the time.</v>

1436
00:54:41.081 --> 00:54:42.420
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eric Jensen,</v>

1437
00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:43.600
<v Speaker 4>j rock fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually I lose my car,</v>

1438
00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.330
<v Speaker 4>look like if I go through them all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my car's gone.</v>

1439
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:51.130
<v Speaker 4>I literally do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to fucking get a flag.</v>

1440
00:54:51.131 --> 00:54:52.720
<v Speaker 4>And put it on his roof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to put A.</v>

1441
00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:55.450
<v Speaker 4>I put a little note in my phone like </v>
<v Speaker 4>level four,</v>

1442
00:54:55.451 --> 00:55:00.451
<v Speaker 4>like I had to put a note.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll lose my car if I park like memento </v>

1443
00:55:00.451 --> 00:55:00.940
<v Speaker 4>for parking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>

1444
00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:03.820
<v Speaker 4>but like a Broan is worse than me </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

1445
00:55:03.821 --> 00:55:08.821
<v Speaker 4>Even if you forgets things I can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You asked me that same question like </v>

1446
00:55:08.821 --> 00:55:08.950
<v Speaker 4>five times in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1447
00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:13.270
<v Speaker 4>but this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean everyone who fights noses,</v>

1448
00:55:13.271 --> 00:55:18.271
<v Speaker 4>dangerous sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I get pissed off when the </v>

1449
00:55:18.271 --> 00:55:19.720
<v Speaker 4>football players are suing the NFL </v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker.</v>

1450
00:55:19.721 --> 00:55:22.240
<v Speaker 4>You guys made millions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a violent sport.</v>

1451
00:55:22.241 --> 00:55:27.241
<v Speaker 4>You knew you're going to get a head </v>
<v Speaker 4>injury like you got paid what you could </v>

1452
00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:27.241
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1453
00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:27.290
<v Speaker 4>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1454
00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:32.320
<v Speaker 4>we don't get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think what we do and we're </v>

1455
00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:32.320
<v Speaker 4>getting the same injuries when nothing's</v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna happen to us.</v>

1456
00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.210
<v Speaker 4>We're going back to the wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rest of the movie is gonna Happen to</v>

1457
00:55:34.211 --> 00:55:36.130
<v Speaker 4>80 percent of fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1458
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that they're going to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out some sort of a medical solution.</v>

1459
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>advancements in science and medicine and</v>

1460
00:55:43.061 --> 00:55:48.061
<v Speaker 1>what they've been able to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to fix all sorts of injuries </v>

1461
00:55:48.061 --> 00:55:49.030
<v Speaker 1>that fixing traumatic brain injuries </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably next,</v>

1462
00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:50.230
<v Speaker 1>and I know that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1463
00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:55.650
<v Speaker 1>this uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing called the intrepid center for </v>

1464
00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:58.090
<v Speaker 1>excellence and they work with soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming back from the war that have brain</v>

1465
00:55:58.091 --> 00:56:03.091
<v Speaker 1>injuries to big issue and they've made </v>
<v Speaker 1>some big improvements and helping </v>

1466
00:56:03.091 --> 00:56:03.091
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1467
00:56:03.091 --> 00:56:04.010
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1468
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1469
00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I would way rather see a fighter retired</v>
<v Speaker 1>too soon and too late and it bums me out</v>

1470
00:56:09.851 --> 00:56:13.180
<v Speaker 1>when I see a guy that's been in too long</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see them struggling</v>

1471
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:15.220
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the worst part is,</v>

1472
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:20.360
<v Speaker 4>is if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing it just because they need </v>

1473
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:20.360
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1474
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:20.360
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1475
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:20.360
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1476
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.950
<v Speaker 4>some guys like they didn't even retire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but these don't,</v>

1477
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 4>they needed for their money when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>take</v>

1478
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.880
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't take short notice.</v>

1479
00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're not prepared against a </v>

1480
00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:31.170
<v Speaker 1>dangerous guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they get more damaged,</v>

1481
00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:31.170
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1482
00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real,</v>

1483
00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1484
00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:33.880
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to fight this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1485
00:56:33.881 --> 00:56:38.881
<v Speaker 1>why do you think nobody wants to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy because they're not the same </v>

1486
00:56:38.881 --> 00:56:41.311
<v Speaker 1>level as him and because if they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally going to get knocked the fuck </v>

1487
00:56:41.311 --> 00:56:44.071
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they say they're scared that </v>

1488
00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:45.521
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna get fired and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can't say that a guy scared </v>

1489
00:56:45.521 --> 00:56:49.200
<v Speaker 1>because nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone entering into the UFC is not a </v>

1490
00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.320
<v Speaker 1>perfect finished product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just not.</v>

1491
00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.400
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a development cycle that goes </v>

1492
00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.751
<v Speaker 1>through the entirety of your career and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about boxing is they </v>

1493
00:56:57.751 --> 00:57:01.591
<v Speaker 1>know where their fighter is at and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to match them up well before they </v>

1494
00:57:01.591 --> 00:57:01.660
<v Speaker 1>give them a title shot.</v>

1495
00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.600
<v Speaker 1>If you look at boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see a lot of guys challenging for</v>

1496
00:57:04.601 --> 00:57:09.601
<v Speaker 1>the title that only have like maybe one </v>
<v Speaker 1>last two losses in their entire career </v>

1497
00:57:09.601 --> 00:57:12.520
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of them happen early because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a manager and they slowly build</v>

1498
00:57:12.521 --> 00:57:15.010
<v Speaker 1>them up and then they start testing them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they do test them,</v>

1499
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:18.280
<v Speaker 1>but they test them once they develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>some serious worldclass skills.</v>

1500
00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fight nothing but chumps pretty much</v>

1501
00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.890
<v Speaker 1>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1502
00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.380
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a lot of work,</v>

1503
00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:24.130
<v Speaker 1>easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy,</v>

1504
00:57:24.131 --> 00:57:25.810
<v Speaker 1>easy guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step up a little bit.</v>

1505
00:57:25.811 --> 00:57:27.490
<v Speaker 1>So he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he didn't do good,</v>

1506
00:57:27.491 --> 00:57:28.770
<v Speaker 1>pull them back the next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make it easier,</v>

1507
00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:30.670
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have so many fights.</v>

1508
00:57:30.671 --> 00:57:32.260
<v Speaker 1>I thought that's how the guys get like </v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

1509
00:57:32.261 --> 00:57:33.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1510
00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Because they didn't fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No 1:30,</v>

1511
00:57:34.581 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realize also that that's the way to</v>

1512
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:41.791
<v Speaker 1>make the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to make the money to build up a </v>

1513
00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:42.430
<v Speaker 1>manny Pacquiao to build up a ricky </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hatton to build up a floyd mayweather.</v>

1514
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:44.410
<v Speaker 1>You gotta have a lot of fights like </v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd made.</v>

1515
00:57:44.411 --> 00:57:49.411
<v Speaker 1>They're made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the only one has been able </v>

1516
00:57:49.411 --> 00:57:49.411
<v Speaker 1>to go through the fire over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over again and come on undefeated.</v>

1517
00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:51.940
<v Speaker 1>See and there's a special athlete and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the thing like,</v>

1518
00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:54.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to knock on the UFC because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your boss.</v>

1519
00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you work for them,</v>

1520
00:57:55.751 --> 00:57:57.850
<v Speaker 1>but like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't want to.</v>

1521
00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Margaret Carter was one of the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC.</v>

1522
00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's smart.</v>

1523
00:58:00.581 --> 00:58:02.800
<v Speaker 1>If you were a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're a business.</v>

1524
00:58:02.801 --> 00:58:05.230
<v Speaker 1>It's smart to market fighters as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1525
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Ronda Rousey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how much Ronda Rousey's making.</v>

1526
00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:10.840
<v Speaker 1>She's making incredible money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a paper view draw,</v>

1527
00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.140
<v Speaker 1>if you're a George St Pierre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're someone that's making a ton of</v>

1528
00:58:14.141 --> 00:58:19.141
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make you make money based on how </v>

1529
00:58:19.141 --> 00:58:19.141
<v Speaker 1>many paper views you sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're.</v>

1530
00:58:19.141 --> 00:58:23.380
<v Speaker 1>They're making shitloads of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's what people read online as </v>

1531
00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:24.430
<v Speaker 1>far as like how much the UFC pays.</v>

1532
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like these are the disclosed </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenue.</v>

1533
00:58:27.311 --> 00:58:29.830
<v Speaker 1>They disclosed incomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what they get paid.</v>

1534
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:31.510
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of other shit involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

1535
00:58:31.511 --> 00:58:35.020
<v Speaker 1>There's there's bonuses and then on top </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the bonuses there's what they get for</v>

1536
00:58:35.021 --> 00:58:40.021
<v Speaker 1>each paper view sale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they don't disclose and a lot of is </v>

1537
00:58:40.021 --> 00:58:40.480
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of fighters don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to disclose,</v>

1538
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:45.870
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a guy who's start now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to eventually work your way up </v>

1539
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:49.540
<v Speaker 1>to to get to championship status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a fucking minefield.</v>

1540
00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Like look at Brock Lesnar is a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

1541
00:58:51.941 --> 00:58:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to Dana about this last </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

1542
00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Is there ever been a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas fucking second fight and he's </v>

1543
00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:01.670
<v Speaker 1>fighting the former UFC heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion is who mirror was in his prime.</v>

1544
00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean mayor was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1545
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.750
<v Speaker 1>as good as he's ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When brock fought him,</v>

1546
00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:10.030
<v Speaker 1>know that his problem was that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous.</v>

1547
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:13.030
<v Speaker 1>He had to be thrown in there and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what Kim was last,</v>

1548
00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I think at the same kind of problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kimbo slice it when he sucks.</v>

1549
00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:19.270
<v Speaker 1>He's only been training a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1550
00:59:19.271 --> 00:59:20.920
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't suck.</v>

1551
00:59:20.921 --> 00:59:22.970

<v Speaker 1>He has potential,</v>

1552
00:59:22.971 --> 00:59:27.971
<v Speaker 1>but he was too famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too fast and he had a fight to go to </v>

1553
00:59:27.971 --> 00:59:28.230
<v Speaker 1>guys too fast and got washed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1554
00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:31.140
<v Speaker 1>It was like his own a marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1555
00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:34.460
<v Speaker 1>guerrilla marketing on the Internet </v>

<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the Sean Gannon fight,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pull that shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shawn Garrett versus Kimbo slice.</v>

1561
00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:46.760
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the greatest displays of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart ever.</v>

1562
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:51.761
<v Speaker 1>For folks who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kimbo slice became famous on the </v>

1563
00:59:51.761 --> 00:59:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Internet for all these crazy knockouts </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his backyard fights.</v>

1582
01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Kimbo was tuning them up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the fight,</v>

1583
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>but that guillotine,</v>

1589
01:00:50.841 --> 01:00:55.841
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was because Sean was battering </v>

<v Speaker 1>Because Kimbo slice hit him with some </v>

1608
01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:37.181
<v Speaker 1>bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His face was completely swollen and </v>

1609
01:01:37.181 --> 01:01:40.121
<v Speaker 1>bloody by the end of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that dude had just no give up in </v>

1610
01:01:40.121 --> 01:01:41.330
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And plus he had been used to MMA.</v>

1611
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had been used to fighting with better</v>

1612
01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:46.160
<v Speaker 1>plugs and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pacing himself,</v>

1613
01:01:46.550 --> 01:01:48.970
<v Speaker 1>like Kimbo Kimbo just fighting dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>national.</v>

1614
01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:54.310
<v Speaker 1>He just jumped out of the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Kimbo obviously had some good </v>

1615
01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:56.981
<v Speaker 1>punching skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as like his defense and as </v>

1616
01:01:56.981 --> 01:01:58.130
<v Speaker 1>far as like his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ability to pace himself,</v>

1617
01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:03.131
<v Speaker 1>like he was really way outclassed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gannon started tuning them up with body </v>

1618
01:02:03.561 --> 01:02:08.561
<v Speaker 1>shots and slowly but surely he starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating them down and by the end it's </v>

1619
01:02:08.561 --> 01:02:10.880
<v Speaker 1>absolutely brutal because they're giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>them these crazy counts to the game,</v>

1620
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:12.710
<v Speaker 1>like a 30 count or some shit like that.</v>

1621
01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.510
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the guy goes down,</v>

1622
01:02:14.511 --> 01:02:16.160
<v Speaker 1>you don't follow him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in mma,</v>

1623
01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:18.470
<v Speaker 1>you got to let them get back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1624
01:02:18.471 --> 01:02:23.471
<v Speaker 1>he could have died easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kimma was absolutely exhausted and he's </v>

1625
01:02:23.471 --> 01:02:25.110
<v Speaker 1>getting just force fed knuckle </v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwiches.</v>

1626
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>But this was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a perfect indication that </v>

1627
01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>although he became famous on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

1628
01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:35.370
<v Speaker 1>like he had a lot of growth to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting guys in the UFC.</v>

1629
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys like Brandon Lee Hinkle,</v>

1630
01:02:37.201 --> 01:02:42.201
<v Speaker 1>like national class wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You been not getting up off your </v>

1631
01:02:42.201 --> 01:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>backside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got the guy gets you down.</v>

1632
01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1633
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.400
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible a type of match up.</v>

1634
01:02:48.401 --> 01:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>And so Gannon went in there against </v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys too.</v>

1635
01:02:50.371 --> 01:02:52.670
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fought permanently hinkle in,</v>

1636
01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the octagon.</v>

1637
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:58.970
<v Speaker 1>And kimbo fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fought quite a few guys who actually </v>

1638
01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:58.970
<v Speaker 1>did well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1639
01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:59.640
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got better.</v>

1640
01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:01.280
<v Speaker 4>He got better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We still do.</v>

1641
01:03:01.281 --> 01:03:03.190
<v Speaker 4>These guys have so many years on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had some bad,</v>

1642
01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:07.320
<v Speaker 1>nice to hae a Kimbo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had some serious arthritis in his knees.</v>

1643
01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:11.070
<v Speaker 4>It goes crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Band people never died on the wars.</v>

1644
01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:13.700
<v Speaker 4>Like I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember I was backstage members.</v>

1645
01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.080
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever go to Draca?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1646
01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:18.060
<v Speaker 4>I went to the Olympic Auditorium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like in high school,</v>

1647
01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.890
<v Speaker 4>but I'll go there and like Kennedy with </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

1648
01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:25.240
<v Speaker 4>I was at one one time and the guy from </v>
<v Speaker 4>France fought and like of that until he </v>

1649
01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.090
<v Speaker 4>died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1650
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.970
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

1651
01:03:26.971 --> 01:03:27.840
<v Speaker 4>Nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a,</v>

1652
01:03:27.841 --> 01:03:32.841
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it wasn't like that where you </v>

1653
01:03:32.841 --> 01:03:32.841
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1654
01:03:32.841 --> 01:03:32.841
<v Speaker 4>someone dies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't be surprised.</v>

1655
01:03:32.841 --> 01:03:32.841
<v Speaker 4>Nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1656
01:03:32.841 --> 01:03:34.320
<v Speaker 4>It's always those kind of weird fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People just die.</v>

1657
01:03:34.321 --> 01:03:35.940
<v Speaker 4>There's die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the war is like,</v>

1658
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:36.630
<v Speaker 4>they're fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1659
01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that most of the people who die</v>

1660
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.240
<v Speaker 1>cut weight really say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1661
01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Most of the serious issues of brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and,</v>

1662
01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>and real serious brain damage from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight happens and the weight classes </v>

1663
01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:53.370
<v Speaker 1>below heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was a recent fight on hbo were</v>

1664
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:58.400
<v Speaker 1>a guy wound up in the hospital with </v>
<v Speaker 1>swelling and the blend some Russian </v>

1665
01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.221
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a ferocious beating and it was a </v>

1666
01:04:01.221 --> 01:04:01.221
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a heavyweight fight.</v>

1667
01:04:01.221 --> 01:04:05.901
<v Speaker 1>This Cuban Olympian and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just beat the fucking shit out of </v>

1668
01:04:05.901 --> 01:04:09.711
<v Speaker 1>this Russian dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Russian dude was just </v>

1669
01:04:09.711 --> 01:04:09.711
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kept coming.</v>

1670
01:04:09.711 --> 01:04:12.951
<v Speaker 1>And his face was swollen out to here by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the fight and apparently he </v>

1671
01:04:12.951 --> 01:04:14.490
<v Speaker 1>had some serious brain swelling after </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight in his career is done.</v>

1672
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This shotgun.</v>

1673
01:04:16.421 --> 01:04:18.240
<v Speaker 1>And after that I was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

1674
01:04:18.241 --> 01:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That face.</v>

1675
01:04:19.581 --> 01:04:21.660
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the winner,</v>

1676
01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:22.860
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's our share.</v>

1677
01:04:22.861 --> 01:04:25.120
<v Speaker 4>Might look like after the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1678
01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:28.040
<v Speaker 4>I was there because I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was feeding him ice cream in the hotel</v>

1679
01:04:28.041 --> 01:04:28.790
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1680
01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:30.680
<v Speaker 4>because I drove with them and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking</v>

1681
01:04:31.850 --> 01:04:33.090
<v Speaker 1>up man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got beat up.</v>

1682
01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.660
<v Speaker 1>He fought that fight with a torn acl </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

1683
01:04:35.661 --> 01:04:36.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1684
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean fighting a guy like tito with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>torn acl.</v>

1685
01:04:38.571 --> 01:04:41.520
<v Speaker 1>And Tito was Tito back then to now the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tables on fire yet dude,</v>

1686
01:04:41.521 --> 01:04:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Tito had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

1687
01:04:43.021 --> 01:04:48.021
<v Speaker 1>still to this day has some of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground and pound from inside a guard </v>

1688
01:04:48.021 --> 01:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>because he didn't even bother passing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guard.</v>

1689
01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.830
<v Speaker 1>You weren't going to control his </v>
<v Speaker 1>posture.</v>

1690
01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:52.890
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't going to let you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was just dropping elbows on you,</v>

1691
01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.300
<v Speaker 1>smashing you from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He battered can afford.</v>

1692
01:04:55.830 --> 01:05:00.830
<v Speaker 1>He had a lot of people could learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was a lot of people that </v>

1693
01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:03.891
<v Speaker 1>thought they had good guards and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had fight Tito and you get stuck in </v>

1694
01:05:03.891 --> 01:05:03.891
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1695
01:05:03.891 --> 01:05:04.470
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was smashing guys from their guard.</v>

1696
01:05:04.471 --> 01:05:09.471
<v Speaker 1>The guard didn't mean shit to Tito.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never even got close to getting </v>

1697
01:05:09.471 --> 01:05:09.471
<v Speaker 1>caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember getting caught ever.</v>

1698
01:05:09.471 --> 01:05:10.800
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't get enough credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy,</v>

1699
01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it's because of things he says,</v>

1700
01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:18.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it is a little fuck ups here </v>

1701
01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:18.081
<v Speaker 1>and there that he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like as a fighter,</v>

1702
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because he couldn't beat chuck.</v>

1703
01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Tito.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tito was still a great fighter.</v>

1704
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Tina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't,</v>

1705
01:05:22.871 --> 01:05:24.970
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't get nearly enough credit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially.</v>

1706
01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:26.890
<v Speaker 3>I think he has some of the best ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>and pound ever.</v>

1707
01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Everyone wants you to lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ain't no suck.</v>

1708
01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:34.570
<v Speaker 3>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sucks.</v>

1709
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.280
<v Speaker 3>It's just easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to shit on them,</v>

1710
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:36.940
<v Speaker 3>eh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1711
01:05:36.941 --> 01:05:40.750
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing that's like sports shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sports radio.</v>

1712
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.930
<v Speaker 3>They love to shit on players.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy drops the ball,</v>

1713

<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love to do that,</v>

1714
01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:47.100
<v Speaker 3>but in the end it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they apply it.</v>

1715
01:05:47.101 --> 01:05:52.101
<v Speaker 3>They try to apply that shit to fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you're dealing with a way more </v>

1716

1722
01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.890
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be scared for junior dos </v>
<v Speaker 3>Santos to punch in the face.</v>

1723
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:08.250
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to be crazy to not be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1727
01:06:16.841 --> 01:06:21.841
<v Speaker 3>Do you find it like drunk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially drunk white guys try to talk </v>

1728
01:06:21.841 --> 01:06:22.990
<v Speaker 3>extra tough if they're watching MMA </v>
<v Speaker 3>around you.</v>

1729
01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:23.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1730
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:30.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then drunk guys sober.</v>

1731

<v Speaker 3>People don't do as much drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll come with you right away.</v>

1732
01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:36.960
<v Speaker 3>But it's always in wanting to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories of fights and fights.</v>

1733
01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:39.010
<v Speaker 3>There's been no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not want to talk about fighting.</v>

1734
01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:44.810
<v Speaker 3>Not give a fuck about fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess they feel like that's all you </v>

1735
01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:44.810
<v Speaker 3>can relate to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1736
01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:44.810
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking train all day.</v>

1737
01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:45.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to watch the fight.</v>

1738
01:06:45.971 --> 01:06:48.400
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk about fighting like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk about that girl's ass.</v>

1739
01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:53.550
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend and her boyfriend </v>

1740
01:06:53.550 --> 01:06:53.560
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know anything about martial </v>
<v Speaker 3>arts.</v>

1741
01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:57.430
<v Speaker 3>He's never trained a day in his life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he likes to watch fights,</v>

1742
01:06:57.550 --> 01:06:59.550
<v Speaker 3>but when he watched his fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1743
01:06:59.610 --> 01:07:04.450
<v Speaker 3>he starts like getting all aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>and saying crazy shit and she gets mad.</v>

1744
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Know she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's a fucking pussy.</v>

1745
01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:09.370
<v Speaker 3>I kicked this fucking guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's guys push and she's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You ain't kicking.</v>

1747
01:07:10.691 --> 01:07:12.400
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's asked like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you saying that?</v>

1748
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:17.640
<v Speaker 3>You know how annoying that is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the word I'll give you this </v>

1749
01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:17.640
<v Speaker 3>fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to.</v>

1750
01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.270
<v Speaker 3>So are you saying that it doesn't suck </v>
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

1751
01:07:19.271 --> 01:07:24.271
<v Speaker 3>That's the perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get up the fuckers like you don't think </v>

1752
01:07:24.671 --> 01:07:26.970
<v Speaker 3>he wants to get up just laying there for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1753
01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:27.970
<v Speaker 3>He wants to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

1754
01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:30.640
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't this knock him out?</v>

1755
01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:33.350
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to knock them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did he advise you to knock him out?</v>

1756
01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:38.720
<v Speaker 3>It's so frustrating here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people critique fights when they </v>

1757
01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:38.720
<v Speaker 3>have no idea what they're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1758
01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:39.580
<v Speaker 3>he's ever hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1759
01:07:39.581 --> 01:07:41.540
<v Speaker 3>if there was enough and punched like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1760
01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:43.300
<v Speaker 3>what are you looking to punch you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Knock.</v>

1761
01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.100
<v Speaker 3>Like someone was telling me about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris Weidman.</v>

1762
01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Chris Weidman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva looked like a fixed fight</v>

1763
01:07:47.711 --> 01:07:48.280
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

1764
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:53.390
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He caught him perfectly on the end of </v>

1765
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.390
<v Speaker 3>the chin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1766
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.800
<v Speaker 3>has anybody ever hit you in the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your chin?</v>

1767
01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.720
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your legs just go.</v>

1768
01:07:55.721 --> 01:07:56.440
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1769
01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.940
<v Speaker 3>they just give it a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1770
01:07:57.941 --> 01:07:58.700
<v Speaker 3>knock out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So weird.</v>

1771
01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.810
<v Speaker 3>Like you remember when um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lawler lawler,</v>

1772
01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:02.550
<v Speaker 3>India's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1773
01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:05.050
<v Speaker 3>There were slugging it out and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked him out.</v>

1774
01:08:05.051 --> 01:08:07.570
<v Speaker 3>It was a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was like a little tip.</v>

1775
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:09.010
<v Speaker 3>Like it was a weird right hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1776
01:08:09.011 --> 01:08:11.320
<v Speaker 3>it was like a softer one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like nothing but it knocked him</v>

1777
01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:13.740
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been hit hardest elbow head.</v>

1778
01:08:13.741 --> 01:08:14.990
<v Speaker 3>The weights in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fine.</v>

1779
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:20.260
<v Speaker 3>And I've been dropped by a little guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if it hits you in the right </v>

1780
01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:20.480
<v Speaker 3>spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just done.</v>

1781
01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

1782
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes were punched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't look like it should knock out.</v>

1783
01:08:23.771 --> 01:08:26.120
<v Speaker 3>Like remember when Henzel gracie fought </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan Henderson.</v>

1784
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:29.450
<v Speaker 3>Hanzo is trying to shoot in on dance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to take him to the ground.</v>

1785
01:08:29.451 --> 01:08:31.100
<v Speaker 3>And Dan uppercut him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hits somebody.</v>

1786
01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.580
<v Speaker 3>It's like a upper cut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like his wrist and,</v>

1787
01:08:34.581 --> 01:08:38.630
<v Speaker 3>and hence went out and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so could you versus a little knock.</v>

1788
01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Same Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hit him with a punch but he didn't </v>

1789
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:43.640
<v Speaker 3>even land the punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hit him with his wrist and he knocked</v>

1790
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.210
<v Speaker 3>him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

1791
01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:48.440
<v Speaker 3>That's why I like people like I use the </v>
<v Speaker 3>term lucky punch.</v>

1792
01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:49.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use it.</v>

1793
01:08:49.641 --> 01:08:51.140
<v Speaker 3>People say it was because you through </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1794
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess what though?</v>

1795
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:57.630
<v Speaker 3>He through 65 hard ones that didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and those software knocked them </v>

1796
01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:57.650
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lucky punch.</v>

1797
01:08:57.850 --> 01:08:59.300
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen guys were like,</v>

1798
01:08:59.570 --> 01:09:02.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm beating up the whole fight as a last</v>
<v Speaker 3>minute left.</v>

1799
01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.830
<v Speaker 3>And you close your eyes and overhand </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1800
01:09:03.831 --> 01:09:04.340
<v Speaker 3>Knocked me out.</v>

1801
01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:06.080
<v Speaker 3>So lucky punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

1802
01:09:06.081 --> 01:09:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Like the sex thing sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then again,</v>

1803
01:09:08.331 --> 01:09:09.620
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a perfect example.</v>

1804
01:09:09.621 --> 01:09:14.621
<v Speaker 3>Like Marcus Davis and Jeremy Stevens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marcus Davis was outbox and Jeremy </v>

1805
01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:19.900
<v Speaker 3>Stevens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Jeremy Stevens landed a few good </v>

1806
01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:22.181
<v Speaker 3>shots but not enough to put them away </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then finally in the third round hit </v>

1807
01:09:22.181 --> 01:09:26.021
<v Speaker 3>him with just his haymaker from Jupiter </v>
<v Speaker 3>and landed right on his chin and Marcus </v>

1808
01:09:26.021 --> 01:09:27.440
<v Speaker 3>was stretched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was out cold,</v>

1809
01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:29.870
<v Speaker 3>but I mean he hit him with all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>punches before it didn't do it,</v>

1810
01:09:29.871 --> 01:09:31.610
<v Speaker 3>but he was looking for that perfect </v>
<v Speaker 3>punch.</v>

1811
01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.290
<v Speaker 3>That's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a lucky,</v>

1812
01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:35.930
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes there are a few.</v>

1813
01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:37.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just like fuck,</v>

1814
01:09:37.311 --> 01:09:40.370
<v Speaker 3>like weird shit happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Matt Hughes Fought Matt Serra,</v>

1815
01:09:40.371 --> 01:09:42.620
<v Speaker 3>they collided heads and Matt Hughes went</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1816
01:09:42.621 --> 01:09:44.600
<v Speaker 3>He thought he got punched but it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a head.</v>

1817
01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:46.060
<v Speaker 3>But that dropped and he went to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corner.</v>

1818
01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:46.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what hit me?</v>

1819
01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.110
<v Speaker 3>Did I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did I get dropped?</v>

1820
01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.940
<v Speaker 3>And like they thought he got hit by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>punch,</v>

1821
01:09:49.941 --> 01:09:54.941
<v Speaker 3>but we watched it in the replay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see they'd collide heads and </v>

1822
01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:54.941
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1823
01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:54.941
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets dropped from that.</v>

1824
01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:55.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1825
01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:00.400
<v Speaker 3>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why I think standup a little </v>

1826
01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:00.500
<v Speaker 3>more shaky because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more luck than standup.</v>

1827
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there isn't wrestling and Jujitsu.</v>

1828
01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:07.960
<v Speaker 3>There's also more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's important is like things that </v>

1829
01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.771
<v Speaker 3>you're physically born with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like reach and athleticism and fast </v>

1830
01:10:10.771 --> 01:10:12.260
<v Speaker 3>twitch muscle fibers that come into play</v>
<v Speaker 3>way more with standup.</v>

1831
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:14.750
<v Speaker 3>Whereas a guy can get real good once </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1832
01:10:14.751 --> 01:10:18.140
<v Speaker 3>If you teach a guy the fundamentals of </v>
<v Speaker 3>striking and he's a long tall guy,</v>

1833
01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could get real good,</v>

1834
01:10:20.241 --> 01:10:23.390
<v Speaker 3>real effective real quick as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a short,</v>

1835
01:10:23.391 --> 01:10:27.320
<v Speaker 3>fat white guy who's good short ass arms </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're fucked man.</v>

1836
01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:30.620
<v Speaker 3>You the physical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that short guy,</v>

1837
01:10:30.621 --> 01:10:35.621
<v Speaker 3>if they were just rolling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that guy was a wicked black belt in </v>

1838
01:10:35.621 --> 01:10:35.621
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just knows positioning.</v>

1839
01:10:35.621 --> 01:10:38.840
<v Speaker 3>He could just run around that dude time </v>
<v Speaker 3>up in a knot and do whatever he wants to</v>

1840
01:10:38.841 --> 01:10:39.500
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1841
01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:41.690
<v Speaker 3>So you can get like a black belt in </v>
<v Speaker 3>striking.</v>

1842
01:10:42.090 --> 01:10:43.840
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to be as athletic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1843
01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the weird thing too,</v>

1844
01:10:46.330 --> 01:10:48.020
<v Speaker 3>like with me and Brian were talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

1845
01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.660
<v Speaker 3>about like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of the day,</v>

1846
01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:54.470
<v Speaker 3>everything's genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we know right away the race horses,</v>

1847
01:10:54.471 --> 01:10:56.180
<v Speaker 3>bloodline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fighting dogs,</v>

1848
01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:57.230
<v Speaker 3>bloodline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] fighting,</v>

1849
01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:57.980
<v Speaker 3>roosters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bloodline,</v>

1850
01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:03.070
<v Speaker 3>it's all blurred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the best animals were a </v>

1851
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:03.070
<v Speaker 3>fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like it comes a lot.</v>

1852
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:05.830
<v Speaker 3>Like some guys are freaks while they </v>
<v Speaker 3>fixed because genetically they're just,</v>

1853
01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.370
<v Speaker 3>they're magic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1854
01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:10.010
<v Speaker 3>So it's like Bj Penn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1855
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.850
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1856
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:11.910
<v Speaker 3>George Foreman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1857
01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:13.890
<v Speaker 3>These guys are just fucking freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1858
01:11:13.891 --> 01:11:14.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1859
01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.370
<v Speaker 4>you can want to get so good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1860
01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:22.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me like Jeremy Horn is an example of </v>

1861
01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:22.410
<v Speaker 4>someone that's a great fighter really </v>
<v Speaker 4>tight.</v>

1862
01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:25.380
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he went as far as you could go off skill</v>

1863
01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:28.110
<v Speaker 4>and an effort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he'd never had the athleticism.</v>

1864
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:33.290
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where if you put that skill into st </v>

1865
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.780
<v Speaker 4>pierre or pg pan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would kill everyone.</v>

1866
01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:37.140
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Genetics is a lot.</v>

1867
01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.990
<v Speaker 1>That's why the perfect storm is a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>like gsp.</v>

1868
01:11:39.991 --> 01:11:44.991
<v Speaker 1>You has the genetics and works like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherFucker and is smart and most guys </v>

1869
01:11:44.991 --> 01:11:45.340
<v Speaker 1>that had the genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lazy like bj.</v>

1870
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>

1871
01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:50.030
<v Speaker 1>well it's interesting seeing bj come </v>
<v Speaker 1>back now because bj is going to fight at</v>

1872
01:11:50.031 --> 01:11:52.790
<v Speaker 1>1:45</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's already down to like 1:55</v>

1873
01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:55.790
<v Speaker 1>and he's already in the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen pictures on me skinnY as shit.</v>

1874
01:11:55.791 --> 01:11:57.380
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1875
01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:00.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those last few fights like the nick</v>

1876
01:12:00.471 --> 01:12:05.471
<v Speaker 1>diaz fight and the Roy Macdonald fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what kind of a beating he took in </v>

1877
01:12:05.471 --> 01:12:08.660
<v Speaker 1>those fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>FighTs were like first round effort and </v>

1878
01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:10.280
<v Speaker 1>then shut down and then it was like he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to win,</v>

1879
01:12:10.281 --> 01:12:13.040
<v Speaker 1>but it was basically on survival mode </v>
<v Speaker 1>for rounds two and three.</v>

1880
01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:18.220
<v Speaker 1>There were two fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should have never taken against one </v>

1881
01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:20.090
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the fact that he's now at 1:45</v>

1882
01:12:20.091 --> 01:12:25.091
<v Speaker 1>is just so crazy that he just is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme goes from I'm not going to cut </v>

1883
01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:28.451
<v Speaker 1>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to fight anybody at one </v>

1884
01:12:28.451 --> 01:12:29.720
<v Speaker 1>70 and then I'm fighting at 1:45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant difference.</v>

1885
01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:31.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1886
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:34.750
<v Speaker 4>But he's one guy that I think maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be lighter,</v>

1887
01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:37.510
<v Speaker 4>other other guys cut weight and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1888
01:12:37.511 --> 01:12:38.820
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

1889
01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:42.220
<v Speaker 4>The answer was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't you go to 50 fives?</v>

1890
01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:47.200
<v Speaker 4>Because I don't think I'm gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if 55 to 87,</v>

1891
01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking lean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fifty five.</v>

1892
01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:50.530
<v Speaker 4>Can I make it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1893
01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:52.530
<v Speaker 4>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But am I going be better that?</v>

1894
01:12:52.531 --> 01:12:54.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's always the curious,</v>

1895
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:56.960
<v Speaker 4>like really weak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just talking to john,</v>

1896
01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:59.050
<v Speaker 4>alyssa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we started yesterday and I said,</v>

1897
01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.090
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can stay at 55.</v>

1898
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:01.480
<v Speaker 4>He waS like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

1899
01:13:01.481 --> 01:13:03.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said that at one 70 was always small.</v>

1900
01:13:03.881 --> 01:13:07.960
<v Speaker 4>Like alessio in shape is like one 75,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like perfectly in shape.</v>

1901
01:13:07.961 --> 01:13:09.460
<v Speaker 4>But he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm smaller one the 50 fives.</v>

1902
01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:14.730
<v Speaker 4>He said 70.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one ever muscled me around and $55 I </v>

1903
01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:15.030
<v Speaker 4>told them to get manhandled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it gives is weak.</v>

1904
01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:18.460
<v Speaker 4>It isn't always the cure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody wants to go lower,</v>

1905
01:13:18.461 --> 01:13:18.900
<v Speaker 4>lower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lower,</v>

1906
01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:19.450
<v Speaker 4>lower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lower.</v>

1907
01:13:19.690 --> 01:13:20.500
<v Speaker 4>But I don't think it's.</v>

1908
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Look at cane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1909
01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:27.570
<v Speaker 1>40 but a little fat on him and he be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best headwinds for small look at federal</v>

1910
01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.120
<v Speaker 1>with small gains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small.</v>

1911
01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Randy was tiny.</v>

1912
01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:31.730
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're fighting giants.</v>

1913
01:13:31.731 --> 01:13:34.470
<v Speaker 4>So like if I want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I find one 70 and the guys 10,</v>

1914
01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:39.500
<v Speaker 4>12 pounds heavier than me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it ain't heavyweights lift 30 pounds </v>

1915
01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:39.500
<v Speaker 4>heavier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fine.</v>

1916
01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Well the thing about those really big </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweights is they can't keep the </v>

1917
01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.881
<v Speaker 1>pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just can't keep that kind of a </v>

1918
01:13:45.881 --> 01:13:45.881
<v Speaker 1>pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw with shane carwyn,</v>

1919
01:13:45.881 --> 01:13:48.200
<v Speaker 1>so brock lesnar see with allister they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't keep that pace.</v>

1920
01:13:48.201 --> 01:13:53.201
<v Speaker 1>There's too much muscle to feed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't keep that cain velasquez pain </v>

1921
01:13:53.201 --> 01:13:53.201
<v Speaker 1>because people,</v>

1922
01:13:53.201 --> 01:13:55.550
<v Speaker 4>people think our hearts and lungs are </v>
<v Speaker 4>kinda all the same size.</v>

1923
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.760
<v Speaker 4>Your body might be bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're the same size,</v>

1924
01:13:58.761 --> 01:14:00.200
<v Speaker 4>heart and lung.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to feed that muscle.</v>

1925
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird thing that people don't </v>

1926
01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:05.410
<v Speaker 1>really understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see a guy,</v>

1927
01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:05.410
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1928
01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:06.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just got to get In better shape.</v>

1929
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:11.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a fucking 500 horsepower </v>

1930
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.590
<v Speaker 1>engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got three gallons of gas.</v>

1931
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.990
<v Speaker 1>That's just what you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your heart</v>

1932
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.680
<v Speaker 3>and lungs are or uniform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

1933
01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:18.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because no matter how big words that </v>

1934
01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:18.690
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're like a weaned dude.</v>

1935
01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Like john doesn't have a huge dick </v>
<v Speaker 3>guaranteed.</v>

1936
01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:19.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is true.</v>

1937
01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.820
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be giant in comparison.</v>

1938
01:14:21.821 --> 01:14:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe like shaquille o'neal.</v>

1939
01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:26.440
<v Speaker 3>Someone told me he had a little deck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told him to shut the fuck up.</v>

1940
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:27.760
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to show me a picture.</v>

1941
01:14:27.761 --> 01:14:29.920
<v Speaker 3>You can't talk shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second of all,</v>

1942
01:14:29.921 --> 01:14:31.210
<v Speaker 3>little dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Compared to what?</v>

1943
01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.170
<v Speaker 3>What is he like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay?</v>

1944
01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.720
<v Speaker 3>So imagine if shaquille o'neal is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>humongous.</v>

1945
01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.480
<v Speaker 3>Like say you had eight inch dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big dick.</v>

1946
01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:40.960
<v Speaker 3>It's kinda like tanya,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should feel like he has to have like a</v>

1947
01:14:40.961 --> 01:14:43.000
<v Speaker 3>15 inch dick to make it look normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1948
01:14:43.001 --> 01:14:43.750
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:45.370
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tHe lungs,</v>

1950
01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:48.180
<v Speaker 3>lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hearts and dick's the big.</v>

1951
01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Well big guys have bigger lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't think.</v>

1952
01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:53.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean you must,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must have a larger heart too.</v>

1953
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:55.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's that much bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1954
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Like I like shaquille o'neal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1955
01:14:57.430 --> 01:15:02.430
<v Speaker 3>because think about your heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tony hinchcliffe say they say the size </v>

1956
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:02.430
<v Speaker 3>of your fist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1957
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:06.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well your fist came with that much </v>

1958
01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:06.060
<v Speaker 3>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a little bigger,</v>

1959
01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:07.630
<v Speaker 3>but 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60 pounds heavier.</v>

1960
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Well that sucks for people with little </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands and they got little last hearts </v>

1961
01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:16.350
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know some dudes he likes to see </v>

1962
01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:16.350
<v Speaker 3>their face and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's always what I hear.</v>

1964
01:15:16.601 --> 01:15:18.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it can't.</v>

1965
01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.780
<v Speaker 3>I think they're about the same size of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the heart.</v>

1966
01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:24.810
<v Speaker 3>Well either way there's not that much of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a variation and the amount of variation </v>

1967
01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:25.270
<v Speaker 3>in muscle mass that people put on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty huge.</v>

1968
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:28.820

<v Speaker 3>muscle mass and then they use it though.</v>

1971
01:15:35.891 --> 01:15:40.891
<v Speaker 3>Like hector lombard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a scary motherfucker with a lot of </v>

1972
01:15:40.891 --> 01:15:40.891

<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just being able to relax.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It just uh,</v>

2056
01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:05.570
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to see different styles</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how those styles play out and see if</v>

2057
01:19:05.571 --> 01:19:07.220
<v Speaker 1>people could find a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2058
01:19:07.221 --> 01:19:11.440
<v Speaker 1>george found a solution to that style </v>
<v Speaker 1>but never came close to finishing them.</v>

2059
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never really put them in danger.</v>

2060
01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:15.710
<v Speaker 1>It was like a very safety first version </v>

<v Speaker 3>in jail though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2161

2162
01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:20.850
<v Speaker 3>shadowboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like pushups and squats.</v>

2163
01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:23.350
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't really work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that's crazy.</v>

2164
01:23:23.351 --> 01:23:26.580
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do it like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only once a week just just,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

2166
01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.160

2169
01:23:33.131 --> 01:23:34.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you need to do that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2170
01:23:34.511 --> 01:23:37.600
<v Speaker 3>This is a point of diminishinG returnS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>esPecially with taking shots.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>running and stuff like that because I </v>

2174
01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.681
<v Speaker 3>think in the beginning when you're new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important to spar because </v>

2175
01:23:52.681 --> 01:23:57.061
<v Speaker 3>you can get comfortable once you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable is less important because </v>

2176
01:23:57.061 --> 01:23:59.110
<v Speaker 3>you're relaxed and you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not nervous no more and stuff.</v>

2177
01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:04.140
<v Speaker 3>So much of it is also dependent upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>finding people that you could trust a </v>

2178
01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:04.140
<v Speaker 3>spar with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a,</v>

2179
01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:07.120
<v Speaker 3>when I first moved to hollywood in </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 94,</v>

2180
01:24:07.121 --> 01:24:12.121
<v Speaker 3>I was training at the jet center and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of real cool guys there and there </v>

2181
01:24:12.161 --> 01:24:14.230
<v Speaker 3>was a bunch of real cool guys to spar </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

2182
01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.540
<v Speaker 3>Was this one dude in particular?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget his name.</v>

2183
01:24:16.541 --> 01:24:17.650
<v Speaker 3>I think his name was ed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget,</v>

2184
01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:22.980
<v Speaker 3>but he was an older dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and that duty spar all the time </v>

2185
01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:25.921
<v Speaker 3>because I knew that he would never try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to tee off on me and he knew that I'd </v>

2186
01:24:25.921 --> 01:24:27.430
<v Speaker 3>never tried tee off on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything was like 50 percent always.</v>

2187
01:24:27.431 --> 01:24:28.390
<v Speaker 3>He never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was never,</v>

2188
01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:33.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some dudes will 50 percent you and then </v>

2189
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:33.520
<v Speaker 3>hit you with some shit and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man,</v>

2190
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:37.711
<v Speaker 3>what are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we fight and we spark and the next </v>

2191
01:24:37.711 --> 01:24:37.711
<v Speaker 3>thing that you try to get them back.</v>

2192
01:24:37.711 --> 01:24:38.920
<v Speaker 3>next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a wall in berlin and you know,</v>

2193
01:24:39.130 --> 01:24:40.300
<v Speaker 3>in your brain up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2194
01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that you need a spar </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>

2195
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:43.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I was going to say is this,</v>

2196
01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:47.620
<v Speaker 3>I got better with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>my sparring got sharper,</v>

2197
01:24:47.621 --> 01:24:52.621
<v Speaker 3>my reflexes has got sharper because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was constantly sparring with this dude </v>

2198
01:24:52.621 --> 01:24:53.230
<v Speaker 3>where I wasn't worried about getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked out in,</v>

2199
01:24:53.231 --> 01:24:54.880
<v Speaker 3>in our training sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2200
01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:56.300
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2201
01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.400
<v Speaker 3>either you're tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not dude,</v>

2202
01:24:57.610 --> 01:24:59.020
<v Speaker 3>so you didn't get hit and you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a poster,</v>

2203
01:24:59.021 --> 01:25:00.130
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get hit and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take it.</v>

2204
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:04.720
<v Speaker 3>And by that standard and you think </v>
<v Speaker 3>robbie lawler has got a point.</v>

2205
01:25:04.721 --> 01:25:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Do you think maybe his style of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of not sparring it all,</v>

2206
01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:09.400
<v Speaker 3>it'll be a good idea for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for him?</v>

2207
01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's it,</v>

2208
01:25:10.301 --> 01:25:10.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2209
01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Find what works for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2210
01:25:12.371 --> 01:25:17.371
<v Speaker 3>like some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you could get away with it more </v>

2211
01:25:17.371 --> 01:25:17.371
<v Speaker 3>than others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2212
01:25:17.371 --> 01:25:17.620
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't feel comfortable confident </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

2213
01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:20.440
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard the one I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that except for him.</v>

2214
01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder.</v>

2215
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:22.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>

2216
01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:24.880
<v Speaker 3>he might just be bullshitting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might like to spread rumors,</v>

2217
01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:30.340
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was living with me for a little bit </v>

2218
01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:30.340
<v Speaker 3>in vegas like million back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so bernie,</v>

2219
01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:31.810
<v Speaker 3>that didn't spark and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bullshit dude.</v>

2220
01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:33.370
<v Speaker 3>He asked us was probably only wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do a spoiler,</v>

2221
01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:35.560
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he needed confirmed it.</v>

2222
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:36.310
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2223
01:25:36.311 --> 01:25:38.650
<v Speaker 3>I got to ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's really interesting man.</v>

2224
01:25:38.690 --> 01:25:40.350
<v Speaker 3>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2225
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:44.810
<v Speaker 3>he's a scary fucking finisher though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The check and he fought koscheck.</v>

2226
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:45.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he fights,</v>

2227
01:25:45.611 --> 01:25:47.050
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't need this part obviously.</v>

2228
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:50.620
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that'll save his brand in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>long run.</v>

2229
01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:52.210
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get hit.</v>

2230
01:25:52.930 --> 01:25:55.570
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem with boxers is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they only punch.</v>

2231
01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:59.560
<v Speaker 3>So they're getting hit in the head all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time and practice and the fight.</v>

2232
01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:01.700
<v Speaker 3>So they get more brain damage than us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2233
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:05.540
<v Speaker 3>I was probably once a week and I through</v>
<v Speaker 3>come dipping a hard.</v>

2234
01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:07.220
<v Speaker 3>When you see guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2235
01:26:07.670 --> 01:26:09.740
<v Speaker 3>like meldrick taylor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that freak you out?</v>

2236
01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.030
<v Speaker 3>It's scary dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It freaked me out man.</v>

2237
01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:16.640
<v Speaker 3>I stopped sparring when I was in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties.</v>

2238
01:26:16.730 --> 01:26:21.730
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done any sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 46 years old now and I still wonder </v>

2239
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:24.710
<v Speaker 3>if what I did when I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe it would have been smarter,</v>

2240
01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.450
<v Speaker 3>maybe I wouldn't have been so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2241
01:26:26.451 --> 01:26:27.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can't be good at hitting the head.</v>

2242
01:26:28.170 --> 01:26:29.650
<v Speaker 3>Can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2243
01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:34.660
<v Speaker 3>That's why you got to accept the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to be careful with yourself and </v>

2244
01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:34.660
<v Speaker 3>you got to be smart.</v>

2245
01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:35.400
<v Speaker 3>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2246
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:40.990
<v Speaker 3>last week I was sparring with evan </v>
<v Speaker 3>dunham and I shot at the exact same time</v>

2247
01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:45.470
<v Speaker 3>he kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a fluke accident.</v>

2248
01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Super common though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2249
01:26:47.181 --> 01:26:48.080
<v Speaker 3>And boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2250
01:26:48.081 --> 01:26:53.081
<v Speaker 3>I was on my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna ask like I was like pretty </v>

2251
01:26:53.081 --> 01:26:53.480
<v Speaker 3>much almost out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2252
01:26:53.481 --> 01:26:53.930
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

2253
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:55.420
<v Speaker 3>bad timing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2254
01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:57.740
<v Speaker 3>what was this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did this happen last week?</v>

2255
01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Now what do you do when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when something like that happens,</v>

2256
01:27:00.051 --> 01:27:04.460
<v Speaker 3>how much time do you take off as barn?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depending on how I feel afterwards,</v>

2257
01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:08.240
<v Speaker 3>but like I took the whole week out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was the only tuesdays anyway.</v>

2258
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:12.530
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I would've been dizzy like that night</v>

2259
01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.560
<v Speaker 3>still afterwards and the next day I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have spotted for a couple of </v>

2260
01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:17.560
<v Speaker 3>weeks Because that's how you lose your </v>
<v Speaker 3>chin.</v>

2261
01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:17.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2262
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:20.870
<v Speaker 3>But then it sucked because then like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said I was fine.</v>

2263
01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:22.780
<v Speaker 3>It was that that night I was already </v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

2264
01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:24.680
<v Speaker 3>It was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2265
01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:28.970
<v Speaker 3>then on tuesday we got this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>silver medalist olympic,</v>

2266
01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.550
<v Speaker 3>a guy from Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from martin cameron's buddy,</v>

2267
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.180
<v Speaker 3>he's a silver medalist and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2268
01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:35.930

<v Speaker 3>ruined wrestler.</v>

2269
01:27:36.690 --> 01:27:39.560
<v Speaker 3>So it was probably with this guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday and he stand up,</v>

2270
01:27:39.561 --> 01:27:44.561

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2272
01:27:44.561 --> 01:27:48.730
<v Speaker 3>but then he took me down double leg and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was good up on the fence and that </v>

<v Speaker 3>I would always stop for today.</v>

2335
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:20.940
<v Speaker 1>But travis luder was a wicked jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

2336
01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.730
<v Speaker 1>dominated everybody in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see,</v>

2337
01:30:23.731 --> 01:30:25.740
<v Speaker 1>when he was fighting on the ultimate </v>

01:30:25.741 --> 01:30:30.480
<v Speaker 1>his fucking takedowns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his jujitsu is laser sharp and he fucked</v>

2339
01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:34.560
<v Speaker 1>up and he fought anderson silva.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost so much weight.</v>

2340
01:30:34.561 --> 01:30:39.561
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never seen a guys I lost so closer to </v>

<v Speaker 1>luder.</v>

2342
01:30:39.561 --> 01:30:44.231
<v Speaker 1>He never made the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never made the way to miss the way </v>

2343
01:30:44.231 --> 01:30:45.720
<v Speaker 1>was a non title fight when he fought </v>
<v Speaker 1>anderson and when he got on that scale,</v>

2344
01:30:45.721 --> 01:30:50.721
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his lips were cracked and bleeding he's </v>

2345
01:30:50.721 --> 01:30:53.860
<v Speaker 1>faced was completely sucked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no water in his body and he </v>

2346
01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:55.650
<v Speaker 1>was shuffled and I'll never forget that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't even walk.</v>

2347
01:30:55.710 --> 01:30:58.110
<v Speaker 1>He was shuffling towards a scale for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second time.</v>

2348
01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.660
<v Speaker 1>This was after he missed weight on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the stage.</v>

2349
01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:03.870
<v Speaker 1>They weighed him backstage afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't make the weight.</v>

2350
01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:05.980
<v Speaker 1>He was off by like a couple pounds to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2351
01:31:06.010 --> 01:31:11.010
<v Speaker 1>so it was a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no way he was going to lose </v>

2352
01:31:11.010 --> 01:31:13.011
<v Speaker 1>any more weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was going to die and so they changed </v>

2353
01:31:13.011 --> 01:31:14.760
<v Speaker 1>it to a non title fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when if that guy had just earlier in</v>

01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:11.040
<v Speaker 4>This what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read the China study and I already had</v>

2401
01:33:11.041 --> 01:33:16.041
<v Speaker 4>a friend that was vegan and I started </v>
<v Speaker 4>reading a lot and it just made sense to </v>

2402
01:33:16.041 --> 01:33:16.430
<v Speaker 4>me and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe this,</v>

2403
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:21.510
<v Speaker 4>the study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of stats and stuff and that </v>

2404
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:22.430
<v Speaker 4>documentary forks over knives and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I gave it a shot.</v>

2405
01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:23.500
<v Speaker 4>I'll try it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2406
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:25.340
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I mean I'm still a strong,</v>

2407
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:26.120
<v Speaker 4>muscular whatever.</v>

2408
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:29.450
<v Speaker 1>What are you getting your protein from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say 90 percent vegan.</v>

2409
01:33:29.451 --> 01:33:30.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's 10 percent animal protein.</v>

2410
01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically what I do.</v>

2411
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:36.780
<v Speaker 4>So my protein and there's a lot of from </v>
<v Speaker 4>I get a supplement,</v>

2412
01:33:36.781 --> 01:33:39.470
<v Speaker 4>a lot of powder from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like sponsored garden of life.</v>

2413
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:40.690
<v Speaker 4>That's a great company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2414
01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:45.760
<v Speaker 4>well I got good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked their in jail and I was taking </v>

2415
01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:45.760
<v Speaker 4>that stuff and I was like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was expensive.</v>

2416
01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:47.480
<v Speaker 4>I thought there are two main stream to </v>
<v Speaker 4>sponsor me.</v>

2417
01:33:47.481 --> 01:33:48.470
<v Speaker 4>you're like I'm a maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're like sure.</v>

2422
01:33:53.541 --> 01:33:54.710
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

2423
01:33:54.970 --> 01:33:59.270
<v Speaker 4>I'll say just let you know like a jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did porn and be like,</v>

2424
01:33:59.330 --> 01:34:00.260
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we already googled you.</v>

2425
01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:01.780
<v Speaker 4>And I was like all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

2426
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:04.010
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they're a great company.</v>

2427
01:34:04.011 --> 01:34:09.011
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the daytime mostly I make </v>

2428
01:34:09.011 --> 01:34:11.630
<v Speaker 4>smoothies just old like bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spinach,</v>

2429
01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:13.130
<v Speaker 4>strawberries and the protein.</v>

2430
01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.560
<v Speaker 4>So do you avoid a big meal until like </v>
<v Speaker 4>later?</v>

2431
01:34:15.561 --> 01:34:16.930
<v Speaker 4>Are you doing that right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing this.</v>

2432
01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:18.740
<v Speaker 4>I'll try and his warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the warrior diet.</v>

2433
01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:20.570
<v Speaker 4>I never read the book but I know the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2434
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:25.590
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a little bit about it but I like </v>

2435
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.590
<v Speaker 4>it because here's what happens is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>my whole life,</v>

2436
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:26.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2437
01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:31.420
<v Speaker 4>I did the regular body building diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat every two or three hours and it was </v>

2438
01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:33.530
<v Speaker 4>always easy in the daytime and </v>
<v Speaker 4>nighttime,</v>

2439
01:34:33.531 --> 01:34:36.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm starving and I want to cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was always the problem,</v>

2440
01:34:36.501 --> 01:34:37.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at nighttime was like,</v>

2441
01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:42.550
<v Speaker 4>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to eat this or that and you </v>

2442
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.550
<v Speaker 4>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't cheat.</v>

2443
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.550
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then I read the warrior diet,</v>

2444
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:44.330
<v Speaker 4>the theory behind it and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it makes sense man.</v>

2445
01:34:44.331 --> 01:34:46.400
<v Speaker 4>Like all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not hungry anyway.</v>

2446
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:49.380
<v Speaker 4>So I did a little bit during the day and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I'll pig out at night.</v>

2447
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:50.540
<v Speaker 4>I have big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big dinner.</v>

2448
01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:55.720
<v Speaker 4>So the last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just just the last few months I've been </v>

2449
01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.860
<v Speaker 4>doing this warrior diet thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but basically all I do is only eat this.</v>

2450
01:34:57.890 --> 01:34:59.720
<v Speaker 4>I'll make a smoothie an hour before </v>
<v Speaker 4>practice.</v>

2451
01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:02.630
<v Speaker 4>And then I one right after practice.</v>

2452
01:35:02.670 --> 01:35:03.500
<v Speaker 1>One hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

2453
01:35:03.570 --> 01:35:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you need is an hour.</v>

2454
01:35:05.010 --> 01:35:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's good for me.</v>

2455
01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:09.120
<v Speaker 1>That's probably because it's a vegetable</v>
<v Speaker 1>base smoothie,</v>

2456
01:35:09.121 --> 01:35:09.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2457
01:35:09.721 --> 01:35:13.860
<v Speaker 1>It's all fruit and I've tried to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>with like whey protein.</v>

2458
01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:15.630
<v Speaker 1>You start shitting your pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wear it</v>

2459
01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:17.660
<v Speaker 4>brains out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2460
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:23.410
<v Speaker 4>like way it comes from milk and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>tastes better than whey protein taste </v>

2461
01:35:23.410 --> 01:35:24.340
<v Speaker 4>better and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't know,</v>

2462
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:26.750
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's bad from what I've read,</v>

2463
01:35:26.751 --> 01:35:29.180
<v Speaker 4>I try to stay away from all dairy animal</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

2464
01:35:29.181 --> 01:35:32.060
<v Speaker 4>especially dairy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then like what I usually do is like,</v>

2465
01:35:32.170 --> 01:35:35.690
<v Speaker 4>I'll eat vegan all week and sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like a fucking pig.</v>

2466
01:35:35.691 --> 01:35:37.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You give a one cheat day,</v>

2467
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:38.720
<v Speaker 4>like pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like anything.</v>

2468
01:35:38.721 --> 01:35:43.721
<v Speaker 4>I don't care anything like nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing forbidding but sometimes say </v>

2469
01:35:43.721 --> 01:35:46.010
<v Speaker 4>like a flight to go to sushi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get sushi tonight.</v>

2470
01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.980
<v Speaker 4>Big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in my house I only eat vegan.</v>

2471
01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:54.520
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So most of my protein comes from mostly </v>

2472
01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:54.520
<v Speaker 4>beans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rice,</v>

2473
01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.440
<v Speaker 4>a stash fields.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2474
01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:57.700
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2475
01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:00.070
<v Speaker 4>the protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But mostly I eat a boring diet.</v>

2476
01:36:00.090 --> 01:36:01.910
<v Speaker 4>Did the same thing every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same time today.</v>

2477
01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:04.760
<v Speaker 4>That's smart because it freedom makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2478
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:07.340
<v Speaker 4>If I don't have a schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucked.</v>

2479
01:36:07.341 --> 01:36:09.260
<v Speaker 4>I can't even if I have any freedom in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>schedule,</v>

2480
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:11.540
<v Speaker 4>I'll screw it all up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had that written down.</v>

2481
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:12.770
<v Speaker 4>Eat this now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise I'm screwed.</v>

2482
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:15.590
<v Speaker 4>Like same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I even get woke up early,</v>

2483
01:36:15.591 --> 01:36:17.600
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my schedule is so exact.</v>

2484
01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:19.490
<v Speaker 4>Like today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm here,</v>

2485
01:36:19.491 --> 01:36:20.850
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2486
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:23.720
<v Speaker 4>if this ended early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't trade after this.</v>

2487
01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:25.730
<v Speaker 4>My skin is ruined already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And on the way here I had the,</v>

2488
01:36:25.731 --> 01:36:27.760
<v Speaker 4>I already ate junk food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking went the jak inhibitor.</v>

2489
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:31.040
<v Speaker 1>so you sort of manage yourself against </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own impulses?</v>

2490
01:36:31.150 --> 01:36:33.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I know that like,</v>

2491
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:35.020
<v Speaker 4>I had this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't.</v>

2492
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:37.950
<v Speaker 4>If I have a schedule in front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll follow it to a t.</v>

2493
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:39.280
<v Speaker 4>If I don't have one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2494
01:36:39.810 --> 01:36:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't trust myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're too impulsive.</v>

2495
01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2496
01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do it.</v>

2497
01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:44.670
<v Speaker 1>But at least you understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2498
01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:46.610
<v Speaker 1>if that's a trial and error thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2499
01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:49.690
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2500
01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:53.160
<v Speaker 1>if you think about like your life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the circumstances that you've had in</v>

2501
01:36:53.161 --> 01:36:56.850
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those develop like paths they developed,</v>

2502
01:36:56.851 --> 01:36:58.950
<v Speaker 1>like behavior paths and those behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>paths.</v>

2503
01:36:58.951 --> 01:37:03.951
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you already go down that impulsive </v>

2504
01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:03.951
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes very difficult to break those</v>

2505
01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:08.121
<v Speaker 1>paths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people are like gambling </v>

2506
01:37:08.121 --> 01:37:08.121
<v Speaker 1>junkies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll fucking fall off the wagon.</v>

2507
01:37:08.121 --> 01:37:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking let me just play one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one hand a black chair and next thing </v>

2508
01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:15.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking sweating their collars </v>

2509
01:37:15.891 --> 01:37:15.891
<v Speaker 1>oN dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their fucking hair is crazy.</v>

2510
01:37:15.891 --> 01:37:15.891
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2511
01:37:15.891 --> 01:37:16.920
<v Speaker 1>I forbiD myself with a gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2512
01:37:16.921 --> 01:37:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a gambler either.</v>

2513
01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:19.040
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2514
01:37:19.050 --> 01:37:21.920
<v Speaker 4>But this right now my diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to do,</v>

2515
01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:27.100
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we need to eat them that </v>

2516
01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:27.100
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Animals and stuff.</v>

2517
01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:30.680
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the child studies shows like in the ras </v>

2518
01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:33.690
<v Speaker 4>and stuff that if the rats that ate a </v>
<v Speaker 4>more than 10 percent animal products,</v>

2519
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:39.910
<v Speaker 4>the cancer that would turn on and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd take them to a 90 percent of </v>

2520
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:40.500
<v Speaker 4>their diet and they would turn off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cancers.</v>

2521
01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to tell you that I'm an </v>

2522
01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:46.561

<v Speaker 1>I'm a human being top of the food chain.</v>

2523
01:37:46.630 --> 01:37:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat a rat if I'm hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like to base my died of some</v>

2524
01:37:50.051 --> 01:37:51.550
<v Speaker 1>shitty road and said eat themselves.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2526
01:37:51.981 --> 01:37:53.190
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you think about it.</v>

2527
01:37:53.191 --> 01:37:54.710
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're in tribes.</v>

2528
01:37:54.711 --> 01:37:57.180
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So those guys are the hunters.</v>

2529
01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:02.660
<v Speaker 4>We're going to go out all day and hunt </v>
<v Speaker 4>along the way when we're going to be </v>

2530
01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:02.660
<v Speaker 4>eating fucking apples and wherever we </v>
<v Speaker 4>find.</v>

2531
01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:03.750
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever we could find.</v>

2532
01:38:03.751 --> 01:38:06.000
<v Speaker 4>We gonna getting along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The chicks are going to be at home,</v>

2533
01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:08.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting or gathering and a clean shit up</v>

2534
01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.530
<v Speaker 4>and w we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get a pig,</v>

2535
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:13.140
<v Speaker 4>we bring it home at nighttime and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a feast,</v>

2536
01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:17.640
<v Speaker 4>but it's one pig we caught maybe and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole fucking village so we're</v>

2537
01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:20.070
<v Speaker 4>all gonna get a small amount of meat and</v>
<v Speaker 4>mostly we're going to eat vegetables and</v>

2538
01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:21.960
<v Speaker 4>plants and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just to let you know,</v>

2539
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:23.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know how much you've done</v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

2540
01:38:23.970 --> 01:38:28.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with eating a vegan diet and I'm a big </v>

2541
01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:30.610
<v Speaker 1>proponent in eating a lot of vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of vegetables.</v>

2542
01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I think I feel better when I drink kale </v>
<v Speaker 1>shakes and eat a lot of fresh </v>

2543
01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:36.980
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the China study has been debunked by</v>

2544
01:38:36.981 --> 01:38:39.120
<v Speaker 1>many different scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot.</v>

2545
01:38:39.150 --> 01:38:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2546
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:40.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has.</v>

2547
01:38:40.590 --> 01:38:45.590
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of different work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things they accused the China</v>

2548
01:38:45.741 --> 01:38:50.741
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was cherry picking data in order to </v>

2549
01:38:50.741 --> 01:38:51.050
<v Speaker 1>match their conclusions that they wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make.</v>

2550
01:38:51.051 --> 01:38:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Like there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just google China study debunked.</v>

2551
01:38:54.611 --> 01:38:56.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different articles </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it like here,</v>

2552
01:38:56.750 --> 01:39:01.750
<v Speaker 1>here's one rest in peace China study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all about a guy who wrote a </v>

2553
01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:04.280
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started analyzing the,</v>

2554
01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:05.810
<v Speaker 1>the original,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to study data.</v>

2555
01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:07.730
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no intention of writing and actual</v>

2556
01:39:07.731 --> 01:39:10.430
<v Speaker 1>critique of a campbell's much lauded </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

2557
01:39:10.431 --> 01:39:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm a data junkie numbers along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>strawberries and audrey hepburn films,</v>

2558
01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:13.820
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2559
01:39:13.821 --> 01:39:14.120
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2560
01:39:14.150 --> 01:39:19.150
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after spending a solid month and a </v>

2561
01:39:19.150 --> 01:39:19.150
<v Speaker 1>half reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gRaphing,</v>

2562
01:39:19.150 --> 01:39:21.890
<v Speaker 1>sticky noting and passing out at 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM from studious exhaustion upon my copy</v>

2563
01:39:21.891 --> 01:39:24.980
<v Speaker 1>of the raw China study data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've decided that it's tiMe to voice all</v>

2564
01:39:24.981 --> 01:39:29.981
<v Speaker 1>my criticisms and there are many and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy just goes into all these </v>

2565
01:39:29.981 --> 01:39:32.090
<v Speaker 1>different points where there's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2566
01:39:32.091 --> 01:39:37.091
<v Speaker 1>campbell was influenced by his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations about animal protein and </v>

2567
01:39:37.091 --> 01:39:40.361
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading him to seek out specific </v>

2568
01:39:40.361 --> 01:39:41.480
<v Speaker 1>correlations in the China study data and</v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere to confirm his prediction,</v>

2569
01:39:41.690 --> 01:39:43.520
<v Speaker 1>which means that he didn't use real </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

2570
01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:47.720
<v Speaker 1>What he did was he used confirmation </v>
<v Speaker 1>bias and he tried to go towards a lot of</v>

2571
01:39:47.721 --> 01:39:48.650
<v Speaker 1>vegans do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2572
01:39:48.651 --> 01:39:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried,</v>

2573
01:39:49.071 --> 01:39:50.390
<v Speaker 1>I had this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2574
01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:53.300
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the endurance runner that we had on</v>

2575
01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:57.250
<v Speaker 4>the dude talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

2576
01:39:57.670 --> 01:39:59.140
<v Speaker 1>cat was a vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good guy.</v>

2577
01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:01.990
<v Speaker 1>And we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about,</v>

2578
01:40:01.991 --> 01:40:03.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about v rick roll.</v>

2579
01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:09.160
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about veganism and you </v>

2580
01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:09.190
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was saying that it had nothing to</v>

2581
01:40:09.191 --> 01:40:12.250
<v Speaker 1>do with not wanting to eat animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just all about health.</v>

2582
01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:15.790
<v Speaker 1>So I started talking to him about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits of fish oil and you know,</v>

2583
01:40:15.791 --> 01:40:18.520
<v Speaker 1>and he was like agreeing that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of health benefits officials.</v>

2584
01:40:18.530 --> 01:40:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I do supplement with fish oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2585
01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:20.900
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2586
01:40:20.901 --> 01:40:21.640
<v Speaker 4>no I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2587
01:40:21.641 --> 01:40:26.641
<v Speaker 4>well why wouldn't you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you know all the benefits official </v>

2588
01:40:26.641 --> 01:40:27.370
<v Speaker 4>because it becomes a thing where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to say you don't eat any animals.</v>

2589
01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:32.400
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like my old buddies or my old roommate </v>

2590
01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:32.500
<v Speaker 4>was a vegan real deacon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like reading labels and shit.</v>

2591
01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:36.850
<v Speaker 4>I will never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't believe in the whole hundred</v>

2592
01:40:36.850 --> 01:40:37.990
<v Speaker 4>percent vegan diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that.</v>

2593
01:40:38.290 --> 01:40:43.290
<v Speaker 4>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my opinion is we're meant to eat some </v>

2594
01:40:43.290 --> 01:40:45.271
<v Speaker 4>meat but mostly plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think we are probably </v>

2595
01:40:45.271 --> 01:40:47.440
<v Speaker 4>meant to eat naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2596
01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:52.660
<v Speaker 4>like I'll eat whatever I want to grow a </v>
<v Speaker 4>great deal of benefit to eating animal </v>

2597
01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:53.560
<v Speaker 4>protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now a lot,</v>

2598
01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:54.400
<v Speaker 4>especially</v>

2599
01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:59.400
<v Speaker 3>animal protein that's grass fed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start looking into a wild game and </v>

2600
01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:04.381
<v Speaker 3>grass Fed animal protein and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between like the essential </v>

2601
01:41:04.381 --> 01:41:04.390
<v Speaker 3>fats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like way more,</v>

2602
01:41:04.391 --> 01:41:09.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was like the salmon essential fatty</v>

2603
01:41:09.101 --> 01:41:11.590
<v Speaker 3>acids are way more than the wild game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more,</v>

2604
01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:12.520
<v Speaker 3>much more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2605
01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:14.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is most people,</v>

2606
01:41:14.651 --> 01:41:18.850
<v Speaker 3>when you're judging diets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's one gigantic thumb.</v>

2607
01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:22.570
<v Speaker 3>The sore thumb that sticks out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people have sedentary lifestyles.</v>

2608
01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:25.330
<v Speaker 3>So if you start judging the diet of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>average american,</v>

2609
01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.790
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is the average american </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing with their on their shit?</v>

2610
01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:32.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't even compare the average </v>

2611
01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:33.190
<v Speaker 3>american to an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you start talking to athletes,</v>

2612
01:41:33.370 --> 01:41:38.370
<v Speaker 3>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the specific nutritional </v>

2613
01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:40.681
<v Speaker 3>demands of your red line and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking body every day when you're </v>

2614
01:41:40.681 --> 01:41:44.011
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing strength and </v>

2615
01:41:44.011 --> 01:41:44.011
<v Speaker 3>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen the videos you were,</v>

2616
01:41:44.011 --> 01:41:47.200
<v Speaker 3>you're doing chin ups would fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight belts on and 90 pound dumbbells </v>

2617
01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:51.511
<v Speaker 3>on in between your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your red line and your body all the </v>

2618
01:41:51.511 --> 01:41:53.740
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you need as much protein,</v>

2619
01:41:53.741 --> 01:41:55.630
<v Speaker 3>nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essential fatty acids,</v>

2620
01:41:55.631 --> 01:41:57.700
<v Speaker 3>vitamins you need all the good shit.</v>

2621
01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:02.700
<v Speaker 3>You can't afford to have a deficiency in</v>
<v Speaker 3>any area you should look into if you're </v>

2622
01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:04.610
<v Speaker 3>not opposed to it from a moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>standpoint.</v>

2623
01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:07.340
<v Speaker 3>Look into the benefits of grass fed </v>
<v Speaker 3>proteins.</v>

2624
01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:10.150
<v Speaker 3>That's why I like the way I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do both,</v>

2625
01:42:10.151 --> 01:42:13.320
<v Speaker 3>but mostly the plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think as long as I'm.</v>

2626
01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:15.690
<v Speaker 3>My energy's high and my muscles staying </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same strength,</v>

2627
01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:19.230
<v Speaker 3>the saying like I could judge you by </v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of.</v>

2628
01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:20.860
<v Speaker 3>I feel I feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2629
01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:23.200
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely better than the average </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet.</v>

2630
01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the thing is too,</v>

2631
01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:29.400
<v Speaker 3>this is why in jail I stopped reading </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking fiction fiction is the real </v>

2632
01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:29.400
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2633
01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fiction is fake over the nonfiction.</v>

2634
01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:34.750
<v Speaker 3>So now he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why in jail I stopped reading</v>

2635
01:42:34.751 --> 01:42:39.751
<v Speaker 3>nonfiction was because oh fucking read </v>
<v Speaker 3>one book written by four phds and </v>

2636
01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:45.100
<v Speaker 3>they're telling me this right and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>read another book by four phds and they </v>

2637
01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:45.100
<v Speaker 3>told me the opposite.</v>

2638
01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:49.590
<v Speaker 3>No one knows shit and it pisses me off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the after awhile I started reading </v>

2639
01:42:49.590 --> 01:42:49.720
<v Speaker 3>only fixing just stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a shit,</v>

2640
01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:55.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I got sick and tired of reading </v>

2641
01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.630
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>contradict each other and no one knows </v>

2642
01:42:57.630 --> 01:42:59.161
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see what's going on is that </v>

2643
01:42:59.161 --> 01:43:00.460
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that no one knows anything.</v>

2644
01:43:00.490 --> 01:43:05.490
<v Speaker 3>It's just like people are still learning</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're still learning about the </v>

2645
01:43:05.490 --> 01:43:07.951
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you just look at training </v>

2646
01:43:07.951 --> 01:43:09.931
<v Speaker 3>methods that people used to use just 100</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago in comparison to training </v>

2647
01:43:09.931 --> 01:43:10.990
<v Speaker 3>methods today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever watched like those old training</v>

2648
01:43:10.991 --> 01:43:15.991
<v Speaker 3>camps like Jack Johnson and jack and </v>
<v Speaker 3>jack dempsey and all these guys just </v>

2649
01:43:15.991 --> 01:43:18.760
<v Speaker 3>doing all this crazy like old school </v>
<v Speaker 3>training methods.</v>

2650
01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:24.300
<v Speaker 3>It's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their bodies look different like </v>

2651
01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:24.400
<v Speaker 3>athletes or just different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Today we understand tabata methods,</v>

2652
01:43:24.401 --> 01:43:26.620
<v Speaker 3>we understand different protocols for </v>
<v Speaker 3>endurance training.</v>

2653
01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:29.320
<v Speaker 3>You understand heart rate monitors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We understand overtraining,</v>

2654
01:43:29.530 --> 01:43:32.470
<v Speaker 3>who understand like hydration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>electrolytes.</v>

2655
01:43:32.471 --> 01:43:34.060
<v Speaker 3>There's just so much they understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

2656
01:43:34.061 --> 01:43:35.020
<v Speaker 3>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know.</v>

2657
01:43:35.021 --> 01:43:36.820
<v Speaker 3>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's constantly growing.</v>

2658
01:43:36.850 --> 01:43:37.820
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

2659
01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:43.620
<v Speaker 3>I think the main problem is though is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like if me and you are a scientist and </v>

2660
01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:46.000
<v Speaker 3>we figured out this thing like we think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're right,</v>

2661
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:48.700
<v Speaker 3>but then we like the design since they </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking.</v>

2662
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:52.020
<v Speaker 3>They refuse to believe they're wrong and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2663
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:57.030
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll push this even though now they </v>

2664
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.030
<v Speaker 1>know it might be wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

2665
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.800
<v Speaker 1>They wasted so much time to fucking make</v>
<v Speaker 1>this right.</v>

2666
01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Now they're scared it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with the flat earth and </v>

2667
01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:02.860
<v Speaker 1>around with all that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same type of theory.</v>

2668
01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:03.140
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

2669
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:05.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get committed to their idea.</v>

2670
01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:10.190
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to budge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would rather preach their idea even</v>

2671
01:44:10.191 --> 01:44:11.750
<v Speaker 1>though it's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then let go,</v>

2672
01:44:11.751 --> 01:44:13.820
<v Speaker 1>and then that's the problem too with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sign shit.</v>

2673
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an issue with people that study </v>

2674
01:44:18.850 --> 01:44:22.451
<v Speaker 1>ancient civilizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy that we've had on this </v>

2675
01:44:22.451 --> 01:44:24.911
<v Speaker 1>podcast several times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a good friend of mine named graham </v>

2676
01:44:24.911 --> 01:44:27.431
<v Speaker 1>hancock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gregg guy who wrote this amazing book </v>

2677
01:44:27.431 --> 01:44:30.270
<v Speaker 1>called fingerprints of the gods and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all about ancient structures and they.</v>

2678
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:32.480
<v Speaker 1>THey've taken geologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2679
01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:35.720
<v Speaker 1>they had this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robert schoch from boston university.</v>

2680
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:40.990
<v Speaker 1>They studied the erosion marks on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sphinx and they're trying to backdate </v>

2681
01:44:40.990 --> 01:44:45.900
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The enclosure for the sphinx and trying </v>

2682
01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:45.900
<v Speaker 1>to say rain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2683
01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say it's from thousands of years of</v>

2684
01:44:46.161 --> 01:44:51.161
<v Speaker 1>rain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem was the last time they had that </v>

2685
01:44:51.161 --> 01:44:51.530
<v Speaker 1>kind of rainfall in the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 9,000</v>

2686
01:44:51.531 --> 01:44:53.930
<v Speaker 1>bc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like we're talking about thousands of</v>

2687
01:44:53.931 --> 01:44:58.660
<v Speaker 1>years before that because back then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be a rain forest denial.</v>

2688
01:44:58.670 --> 01:45:00.200
<v Speaker 1>We used to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rich reinforce.</v>

2689
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:04.010
<v Speaker 1>So what he's saying is that just based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on geological evidence,</v>

2690
01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:07.550
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with something that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed a long time ago,</v>

2691
01:45:07.551 --> 01:45:12.551
<v Speaker 1>much longer than anybody thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these egyptologists did not want to </v>

2692
01:45:12.551 --> 01:45:15.260
<v Speaker 1>believe they were digging their heels in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sand and they were saying there's no</v>

2693
01:45:15.261 --> 01:45:16.160
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

2694
01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Whereas this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were laughing like,</v>

2695
01:45:18.250 --> 01:45:20.510
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's this culture from 12,000</v>

2696
01:45:20.511 --> 01:45:25.511
<v Speaker 1>plus years ago you talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't even know that anybody </v>

2697
01:45:25.511 --> 01:45:27.460
<v Speaker 1>had built anything like that from 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago until recently they found this</v>

2698
01:45:27.461 --> 01:45:30.950
<v Speaker 1>structure in Turkey called gold beckley </v>
<v Speaker 1>tappy without a doubt.</v>

2699
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:33.620
<v Speaker 1>12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus years old because someone 12,000</v>

2700
01:45:33.621 --> 01:45:38.621
<v Speaker 1>years ago covered It because they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>proven by doing carbon testing on the </v>

2701
01:45:38.621 --> 01:45:40.400
<v Speaker 1>soil that it was all put at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2702
01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:45.700
<v Speaker 1>So they know the 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago for sure someone was making </v>

2703
01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:49.541
<v Speaker 1>big crazy chinese shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want to talk about that </v>

2704
01:45:49.541 --> 01:45:52.721
<v Speaker 1>because they've been teaching college </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses in university and forever and </v>

2705
01:45:52.721 --> 01:45:55.250
<v Speaker 1>they gave a timeline because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeline has been established and that's</v>

2706
01:45:55.251 --> 01:46:00.251
<v Speaker 1>how they base their phds at today based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on their studies and their words don't </v>

2707
01:46:00.251 --> 01:46:00.770
<v Speaker 1>want to let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem.</v>

2708
01:46:00.970 --> 01:46:01.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem,</v>

2709
01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:02.570
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2710
01:46:03.110 --> 01:46:03.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2711
01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:06.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem with ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations for sure,</v>

2712
01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:09.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little bit of a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>health and a lot of these fucking people</v>

2713
01:46:09.021 --> 01:46:10.010
<v Speaker 1>that are talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2714
01:46:10.011 --> 01:46:11.620
<v Speaker 1>you don't need vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need this.</v>

2715
01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we find out what you do with your </v>

2716
01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:18.551
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I have a feeling you're a fat </v>

2717
01:46:18.551 --> 01:46:20.471
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you just sit around doing nothing </v>

2718
01:46:20.471 --> 01:46:20.471
<v Speaker 1>mean telling people they don't need </v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamins,</v>

2719
01:46:20.471 --> 01:46:20.471
<v Speaker 1>they don't need nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought I should.</v>

2720
01:46:20.471 --> 01:46:25.250
<v Speaker 1>That day on dr oz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr was trying to tell them that you </v>

2721
01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:25.250
<v Speaker 1>don't need to take vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>

2722
01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:25.760
<v Speaker 1>And then dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oz was saying,</v>

2723
01:46:25.761 --> 01:46:28.250
<v Speaker 1>well you need to take your daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommended allowance.</v>

2724
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Fucked the daily recommended allowance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys don't know shit.</v>

2725
01:46:30.471 --> 01:46:31.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe none of that I take.</v>

2726
01:46:31.791 --> 01:46:32.570
<v Speaker 1>I take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2727
01:46:32.571 --> 01:46:37.571
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's going to hurt you to </v>

2728
01:46:37.571 --> 01:46:37.571
<v Speaker 1>mega doses of vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2729
01:46:37.571 --> 01:46:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also they love to make these these </v>

2730
01:46:41.170 --> 01:46:43.990
<v Speaker 1>headlines like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw this recent </v>

2731
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.570
<v Speaker 1>story that where this research is st </v>
<v Speaker 1>case closed vitamins don't work,</v>

2732
01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:47.090
<v Speaker 1>but they based it on two things.</v>

2733
01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks who listened and they like,</v>

2734
01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:54.580
<v Speaker 1>you got to fucking talk about it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One more time is the last time I </v>

2735
01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:54.580
<v Speaker 1>promise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just for war machine,</v>

2736
01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:56.880
<v Speaker 1>they based it on six people over 65 that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had had heart attacks,</v>

2737
01:46:57.030 --> 01:47:01.110
<v Speaker 1>that vitamins didn't keep them alive any</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer and people that were over 65 that</v>

2738
01:47:01.111 --> 01:47:06.111
<v Speaker 1>had already had mental decline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were already experiencing </v>

2739

<v Speaker 1>but that's not.</v>

2741
01:47:08.341 --> 01:47:13.341
<v Speaker 1>Vitamin doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with old people that are </v>

<v Speaker 1>Your heart attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain stopped working and you </v>

<v Speaker 1>It didn't fix that.</v>

2747
01:47:19.470 --> 01:47:21.510
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

2748
01:47:21.690 --> 01:47:24.690
<v Speaker 1>But this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a headline to get press,</v>

2749
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:27.000
<v Speaker 1>so they put these headlines out to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>their study,</v>

2750
01:47:27.210 --> 01:47:29.190
<v Speaker 1>to get people to read it and pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to it.</v>

2751
01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:31.890
<v Speaker 1>It gets hits all these websites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody gets excited about it,</v>

2752
01:47:31.891 --> 01:47:35.640
<v Speaker 1>they inflame the results because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>more you inflaming more people are going</v>

2753
01:47:35.641 --> 01:47:37.440
<v Speaker 1>to share them on twitter and the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you know,</v>

2754
01:47:37.441 --> 01:47:39.480
<v Speaker 1>people were arguing that you don't need </v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamins.</v>

2755
01:47:39.481 --> 01:47:41.970
<v Speaker 1>There's just a study that released why </v>
<v Speaker 1>even taking vitamins?</v>

2756
01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:47.120
<v Speaker 1>These had study and there's no fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies that tell you don't need </v>

2757
01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:47.120
<v Speaker 1>vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This the stupidity.</v>

2758
01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the same thing.</v>

2759
01:47:47.941 --> 01:47:52.941
<v Speaker 1>What's up with the soy milk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear people say that it raises </v>

2760
01:47:52.941 --> 01:47:52.941
<v Speaker 1>estrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people say it doesn't.</v>

2761
01:47:52.941 --> 01:47:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Is there a real study?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is soy?</v>

2762
01:47:54.930 --> 01:47:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Most definitely can have effects on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone levels for men or just women or </v>

2763
01:47:59.930 --> 01:48:02.070
<v Speaker 1>men or men in the study?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I hear both and I don't.</v>

2764
01:48:02.071 --> 01:48:07.071
<v Speaker 1>I don't know which one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure soy can affect your </v>

2765
01:48:07.071 --> 01:48:07.071
<v Speaker 1>hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2766
01:48:07.071 --> 01:48:07.071
<v Speaker 1>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just google it right now.</v>

2767
01:48:07.071 --> 01:48:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Can affect hormone levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone levels.</v>

2768
01:48:12.570 --> 01:48:14.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna affect hormone levels.</v>

2769
01:48:14.241 --> 01:48:16.360
<v Speaker 1>You got to be careful about having added</v>
<v Speaker 1>nami.</v>

2770
01:48:17.190 --> 01:48:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Nami,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he cries like a girl.</v>

2771
01:48:18.991 --> 01:48:23.991
<v Speaker 1>He grows milk when he eats soybeans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That our drinking water though is so </v>

2772
01:48:23.991 --> 01:48:26.940
<v Speaker 1>full of a birth control pills when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2773
01:48:26.970 --> 01:48:31.970
<v Speaker 1>when they cleaned it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hormone staying in it's lauren </v>

2774
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:31.970
<v Speaker 1>testosterone to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2775
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:34.941
<v Speaker 1>there is some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also antidepressants that make </v>

2776
01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:34.941
<v Speaker 1>their way into our tricky water from </v>
<v Speaker 1>people processing.</v>

2777
01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Like when people flush them down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>toilet was like when you drink water,</v>

2778
01:48:38.251 --> 01:48:41.370
<v Speaker 1>like in some places you're drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>water that's been processed,</v>

2779
01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:45.300
<v Speaker 1>they'll process sewage water back into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the drinking and then somehow or another</v>

2780
01:48:45.301 --> 01:48:50.301
<v Speaker 1>micro doses of these antidepressants and</v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics and all kinds of shit can </v>

2781
01:48:51.181 --> 01:48:55.010
<v Speaker 1>make it into that water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the levels are so low address,</v>

2782
01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.390
<v Speaker 1>it'd be almost impossible to.</v>

2783
01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:00.840
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just.</v>

2784
01:49:01.170 --> 01:49:04.680
<v Speaker 1>It's just detectable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does soy.</v>

2785
01:49:04.681 --> 01:49:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Does eating soy increase estrogen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Estrogen production?</v>

2786
01:49:08.011 --> 01:49:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes it does.</v>

2787
01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Soy beans are a complete protein source </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a dietary staple of many cultures.</v>

2788
01:49:14.671 --> 01:49:19.671
<v Speaker 1>Store can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soy contains phytoestrogen is called </v>

2789
01:49:19.671 --> 01:49:21.750
<v Speaker 1>isol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flay isoflavones owns that may mimic the</v>

2790
01:49:21.751 --> 01:49:23.670
<v Speaker 1>activity of hormone estrogen in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

2791
01:49:23.671 --> 01:49:28.140
<v Speaker 1>The effects of soy isoflavones on human </v>
<v Speaker 1>estrogen levels are complex,</v>

2792
01:49:28.370 --> 01:49:33.370
<v Speaker 1>so it's safe for everyone to consume in </v>
<v Speaker 1>moderation and can have a modest effect </v>

2793
01:49:33.370 --> 01:49:34.830
<v Speaker 1>on estrogen levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that means it can have an effect,</v>

2794
01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:39.150
<v Speaker 1>so don't get crazy and drink a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>soy mIlk or dick would go soft,</v>

2795
01:49:39.450 --> 01:49:41.970
<v Speaker 1>grow some titties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you're a girl,</v>

2796
01:49:41.971 --> 01:49:43.650
<v Speaker 1>you need some extra estrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men.</v>

2797
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if girls can eat like certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>foods and their tips.</v>

2798
01:49:45.831 --> 01:49:50.831
<v Speaker 1>We grow bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There be none of that shit at whole </v>

2799
01:49:50.831 --> 01:49:50.831
<v Speaker 1>foods.</v>

2800
01:49:50.831 --> 01:49:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Try finding soybeans and hopefully it </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be out.</v>

2801
01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soy.</v>

2802
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:57.790
<v Speaker 1>So it's always an interesting one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the best protein.</v>

2803
01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Like keen was one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2804
01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:03.880
<v Speaker 1>that's real high in protein and all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden amino acids.</v>

2805
01:50:04.210 --> 01:50:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Hampshire real good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One to mcz digest to.</v>

2806
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that I think that the garden of </v>

2807
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.790
<v Speaker 1>life one and it's like a blend I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2808
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:14.230
<v Speaker 1>but you can get a lot of protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe mac danzig pulls it off.</v>

2809
01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:16.690
<v Speaker 1>You can do a lot of protein in a vegan </v>
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

2810
01:50:16.691 --> 01:50:18.040
<v Speaker 1>You just gotta know what the fuck you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

2811
01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:21.940
<v Speaker 1>The real issue is healthy fats too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to eat avocados and shit.</v>

2812
01:50:21.941 --> 01:50:26.941
<v Speaker 1>You got to get a lot of fats or just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a flax oil shake because I'm the </v>

2813
01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:29.620
<v Speaker 1>boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not against.</v>

2814
01:50:29.710 --> 01:50:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I would take the fish oils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't bother me.</v>

2815
01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Like mac wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a real,</v>

2816
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:35.350
<v Speaker 1>real hardcore vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2817
01:50:35.351 --> 01:50:36.990
<v Speaker 1>he's an anImal.</v>

2818
01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:38.680
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit.</v>

2819
01:50:38.710 --> 01:50:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2820
01:50:39.591 --> 01:50:41.740
<v Speaker 1>I figured that he's been a deacon salon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he knows.</v>

2821
01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:42.590
<v Speaker 1>So I believed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2822
01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:43.570
<v Speaker 1>what did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bullshit.</v>

2823
01:50:43.571 --> 01:50:45.160
<v Speaker 1>The soy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's bullshit.</v>

2824
01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:47.700
<v Speaker 1>There's no study that getting emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the woman in them.</v>

2825
01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:50.020
<v Speaker 1>And the estrogen is making them </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional.</v>

2826
01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Tell him to back off the beans back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's a very smart dude and he's a strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>believer.</v>

<v Speaker 1>in character.</v>

2833
01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:10.300
<v Speaker 1>That's why he chooses not to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of any animal protein.</v>

2834
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:12.400
<v Speaker 1>He started for some reason I started </v>

2848
01:51:37.541 --> 01:51:38.470
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why he started to.</v>

2849
01:51:38.530 --> 01:51:43.530
<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that he started researching more </v>

2850
01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:43.530
<v Speaker 1>and that's why he became a vegan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>plus the animal stuff.</v>

2851
01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:44.440
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

01:51:44.441 --> 01:51:49.441
<v Speaker 1>been homogenized and pasteurized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with drinking raw milk </v>

2853
01:51:49.441 --> 01:51:49.630
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you know who's milking that cow,</v>

2854
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:54.990
<v Speaker 1>that cow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what the fuck you're </v>

2855
01:51:54.990 --> 01:51:56.520
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they're dealing and handling the </v>

2856
01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:56.520
<v Speaker 1>milk right afterwards.</v>

2857
01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:59.250
<v Speaker 1>If you can get a good source though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get a real good farm that's </v>

2858
01:51:59.250 --> 01:51:59.460
<v Speaker 1>reputable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that knows how to deal with their,</v>

2859
01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:00.130
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

2860
01:52:00.150 --> 01:52:02.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the raw milk some.</v>

2861
01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:07.120
<v Speaker 1>There was a recent study also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to discredit wall milk saying </v>

2862
01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:07.630
<v Speaker 1>one out of six people who drink raw milk</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get sick,</v>

2863
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:12.990
<v Speaker 1>but then in the article itself it shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't prove that what happened </v>

2864
01:52:12.990 --> 01:52:17.761
<v Speaker 1>to them came from the raw milk and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have been from the only had raw </v>

2865
01:52:17.761 --> 01:52:21.511
<v Speaker 1>milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't controlling the rest of </v>

2866
01:52:21.511 --> 01:52:21.511
<v Speaker 1>their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their input and their input varied.</v>

2867
01:52:21.511 --> 01:52:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's input varied and people get </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick all the time.</v>

2868
01:52:23.561 --> 01:52:28.561
<v Speaker 1>So it's real sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a double blind placebo </v>

2869
01:52:28.561 --> 01:52:31.210
<v Speaker 1>test taken raw milk because of rose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>homogenized or pasteurized milk and then</v>

2870
01:52:31.211 --> 01:52:34.120
<v Speaker 1>they both eat the same diet and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled st portions.</v>

2871
01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Living lab.</v>

2872
01:52:35.170 --> 01:52:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2873
01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:37.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to live in the same info.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2874
01:52:37.331 --> 01:52:37.960
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard,</v>

2875
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:43.950
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be careful whenever </v>

2876
01:52:43.950 --> 01:52:46.681
<v Speaker 1>anything's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you've got gotta have really </v>

2877
01:52:46.681 --> 01:52:46.681
<v Speaker 1>fresh stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what we're supposed to eat.</v>

2878
01:52:46.681 --> 01:52:46.880
<v Speaker 1>We're not speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed,</v>

2879
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:49.660
<v Speaker 1>old rotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those refrigerators and all,</v>

2880
01:52:49.710 --> 01:52:50.390
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

2881
01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2882
01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:58.900
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most people they're not going to be </v>

2883
01:52:58.900 --> 01:52:58.900
<v Speaker 1>able to afford to just buy milk every </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2884
01:52:58.900 --> 01:53:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to live in societies where </v>

2885
01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:04.250
<v Speaker 1>you've keep up a steak for a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2886
01:53:04.290 --> 01:53:09.290
<v Speaker 1>it takes not supposed to sit in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator and the only way meet can </v>

2887
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:12.611
<v Speaker 1>sit in your refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be like some fucking bologna </v>

2888
01:53:12.611 --> 01:53:12.860
<v Speaker 1>thing that's barely a meat,</v>

2889
01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:16.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just been filled with all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit to the point where it can't.</v>

2890
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>hot dogs.</v>

2892

<v Speaker 1>What are those like meet with fake </v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible for you.</v>

2895
01:53:28.230 --> 01:53:30.260
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff just makes you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>awful.</v>

2896
01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Just makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2897
01:53:31.590 --> 01:53:34.790
<v Speaker 1>your body just goes into shutdown mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even on my cheat day,</v>

2898
01:53:34.791 --> 01:53:36.870
<v Speaker 1>like I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because a,</v>

2899
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to have my pig day.</v>

2900
01:53:39.330 --> 01:53:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you eat gluten?</v>

2901
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2902
01:53:43.401 --> 01:53:45.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know nothing about gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never really read up on it.</v>

2903
01:53:45.801 --> 01:53:50.630
<v Speaker 1>So like the real science behind my </v>
<v Speaker 1>cousin is a lawyer in Washington.</v>

2904
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:55.310
<v Speaker 1>She has a bag gluten allergy where </v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll like be in bedridden for gluten.</v>

2905
01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:56.390
<v Speaker 1>She was telling me blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2906
01:53:56.391 --> 01:53:57.080
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2907
01:53:57.590 --> 01:53:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know nothing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>gluten.</v>

2908
01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:01.760
<v Speaker 1>I have no gluten allergy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've eaten pasta all my life.</v>

2909
01:54:01.761 --> 01:54:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up eating bread and pasta,</v>

2910
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:06.500
<v Speaker 1>but when I cut it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed a big difference.</v>

2911
01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:08.660
<v Speaker 1>My face got skinnier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2912
01:54:08.661 --> 01:54:13.661
<v Speaker 1>I felt like less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less soreness in the areas that I </v>

2913
01:54:13.661 --> 01:54:14.510
<v Speaker 1>usually get inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my back.</v>

2914
01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:16.480
<v Speaker 1>I went to it because of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2915
01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:21.540
<v Speaker 1>a therapist told me that she told me </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have good results with helping </v>

2916
01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:22.250
<v Speaker 1>people out back injuries by getting off </v>
<v Speaker 1>of gluten,</v>

2917
01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:24.320
<v Speaker 1>getting off gluten and sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2918
01:54:24.321 --> 01:54:26.260
<v Speaker 1>anything bad for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible for you.</v>

2919
01:54:26.410 --> 01:54:27.440
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>

2920
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:29.180
<v Speaker 1>they're not just bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2921
01:54:29.210 --> 01:54:30.920
<v Speaker 1>they're inflammatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

2922
01:54:30.921 --> 01:54:32.960
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the issue is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issue is inflammation.</v>

2923
01:54:32.961 --> 01:54:35.480
<v Speaker 1>And if you have foods that cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation,</v>

2924
01:54:35.630 --> 01:54:37.640
<v Speaker 1>it makes injuries more difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>heal.</v>

2925
01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iT was.</v>

2926
01:54:37.941 --> 01:54:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I was reading about all that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sugar and stuff.</v>

2927
01:54:42.110 --> 01:54:46.520
<v Speaker 1>It taxes your kidneys and your liver and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can't do their jobs right?</v>

2928
01:54:46.610 --> 01:54:51.610
<v Speaker 1>So your body has more toxins and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>should have and it makes your body </v>

2929
01:54:51.610 --> 01:54:51.610
<v Speaker 1>inflamed and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2930
01:54:51.610 --> 01:54:51.610
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

2931
01:54:51.610 --> 01:54:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Sugar's not good for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too bad.</v>

2932
01:54:52.251 --> 01:54:54.730
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking delicious though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

2933
01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Everything good for you is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>boring and bland.</v>

2934
01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.940
<v Speaker 1>everything delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking terrible for you.</v>

2935
01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:03.380
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where we are,</v>

2936
01:55:03.650 --> 01:55:06.410
<v Speaker 1>where we are as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't to figure out how to make.</v>

2937
01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:11.650
<v Speaker 1>They've got a genetically engineered </v>
<v Speaker 1>food to just be unbelievably delicious </v>

2938
01:55:11.650 --> 01:55:13.750
<v Speaker 1>but nutritious it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that gmo?</v>

2939
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:16.160
<v Speaker 1>That's the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the devil or what?</v>

2940
01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's up with gmos.</v>

2941
01:55:18.081 --> 01:55:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Some of it is good and some of it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

2942
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Just like everYthing else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2943
01:55:21.291 --> 01:55:23.450
<v Speaker 1>there's things like golden rice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they figured,</v>

2944
01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:28.480
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way to engineer proteins </v>
<v Speaker 1>to rice and make a rice that's more easy</v>

2945
01:55:29.541 --> 01:55:30.640
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2946
01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:35.760
<v Speaker 1>to process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people have benefited from </v>

2947
01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:39.461
<v Speaker 1>it greatlY.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also shit that they </v>

2948
01:55:39.461 --> 01:55:39.461
<v Speaker 1>designed that they want to make so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2949
01:55:39.461 --> 01:55:40.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plant,</v>

2950
01:55:40.050 --> 01:55:42.110
<v Speaker 1>certain plants can deal with pesticides.</v>

2951
01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:44.000
<v Speaker 1>There's that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a,</v>

2952
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.010
<v Speaker 1>but they've always done that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>selective breeding,</v>

2953
01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:47.880
<v Speaker 1>but they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

2954
01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:53.240
<v Speaker 1>they've messed with things so that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal wIth pesticides better and </v>

2955
01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:56.250
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately like a lot of times that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucks up the environment like bs,</v>

2956
01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:59.070
<v Speaker 1>like they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've connected the drop of dropoff in</v>

2957
01:55:59.071 --> 01:56:00.780
<v Speaker 1>the population of bees to a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

2958
01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:03.360
<v Speaker 1>They say that cell phones are not good </v>
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>

2959
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:08.510
<v Speaker 1>They're not digging the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all these cell phone signals </v>

2960
01:56:08.510 --> 01:56:08.510
<v Speaker 1>everywhere that fucks with bees </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently.</v>

2961
01:56:08.510 --> 01:56:12.950
<v Speaker 1>But they can deal with that I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's fucking them up is there's </v>

2962
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:15.921
<v Speaker 1>certain pesticides that just wreck havoc</v>
<v Speaker 1>on b communities and if you get a </v>

2963
01:56:16.171 --> 01:56:21.171
<v Speaker 1>genetically modified plant and in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals are involved in that process </v>

2964
01:56:22.141 --> 01:56:25.120
<v Speaker 1>and these bees get ahold of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals or they come into contact with</v>

2965
01:56:25.121 --> 01:56:27.150
<v Speaker 1>these chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be deadly to them.</v>

2966
01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:29.430
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2967
01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:31.360
<v Speaker 1>this is a real issue with fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with nature,</v>

2968
01:56:31.361 --> 01:56:36.361
<v Speaker 1>with we don't know the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences because the world that we </v>

2969
01:56:36.361 --> 01:56:38.280
<v Speaker 1>live in is an ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything affects everything.</v>

2970
01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:43.460
<v Speaker 1>They say that if aunts died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we killed all the aunts and the </v>

2971
01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:43.460
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will be fucked.</v>

2972
01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Like the whole world would go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

2973
01:56:45.170 --> 01:56:46.680
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows these two?</v>

2974
01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:47.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2975
01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:49.140
<v Speaker 1>We need everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all here for a reason.</v>

2976
01:56:49.141 --> 01:56:54.141
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all connected and when you have </v>

2977
01:56:54.141 --> 01:56:55.881
<v Speaker 1>something that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it can absorb chemicals better so </v>

2978
01:56:55.881 --> 01:56:59.721
<v Speaker 1>we can kill off all these bugs and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to worry about and we get a </v>

2979
01:56:59.721 --> 01:57:02.630
<v Speaker 1>big yield and we can sell that yield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's killing bees like that's.</v>

2980
01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:07.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a yin and a yang to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a push and a pull to everything </v>

2981
01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:10.521
<v Speaker 1>and the more you you dabble with nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with this unbelievably </v>

2982
01:57:10.521 --> 01:57:11.310
<v Speaker 1>complex structure.</v>

2983
01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:14.250
<v Speaker 1>The structure of nature so intertwined </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

2984
01:57:14.490 --> 01:57:17.370
<v Speaker 1>so broad that when you fuck around with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2985
01:57:17.850 --> 01:57:20.640
<v Speaker 1>hopefully it has a good effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also,</v>

2986
01:57:20.670 --> 01:57:23.820
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be the potential for </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative downsides.</v>

2987
01:57:25.170 --> 01:57:26.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think about gmo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>

2988
01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we could figure out a way to make </v>

2989
01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:33.270
<v Speaker 1>food that all these poor people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have nutritious food,</v>

2990
01:57:33.271 --> 01:57:36.120
<v Speaker 1>it's super easy to grow and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits from it.</v>

2991
01:57:36.630 --> 01:57:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for it,</v>

2992
01:57:37.890 --> 01:57:42.890
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in genetically modified foods </v>

2993
01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:43.050
<v Speaker 1>are doing it for profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do other things for money.</v>

2994
01:57:43.230 --> 01:57:46.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a big part of what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up.</v>

2995
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was like,</v>

2996
01:57:47.641 --> 01:57:51.430
<v Speaker 1>we think about money now this now with </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing carrier.</v>

2997
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:53.370
<v Speaker 1>What's gonna happen next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2998
01:57:54.150 --> 01:57:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that definitely </v>

2999
01:57:59.150 --> 01:57:59.280
<v Speaker 1>don't think about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just fucking ride that bitch.</v>

3000
01:57:59.280 --> 01:57:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3001
01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:03.030
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck do we do still use oil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It a bunch of reasons.</v>

3002
01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:06.330
<v Speaker 1>One because we know how to do it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have the whole systems in place for</v>

3003
01:58:06.331 --> 01:58:09.600
<v Speaker 1>oil to change the system and change it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like solar.</v>

3004
01:58:09.601 --> 01:58:14.601
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like la could probably run on solar if </v>

3005
01:58:14.601 --> 01:58:17.271
<v Speaker 1>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really a shame that we don't </v>

3006
01:58:17.271 --> 01:58:20.211
<v Speaker 1>have solar panels everywhere in la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The motherfucker is constantly and they </v>

3007
01:58:20.211 --> 01:58:23.670
<v Speaker 1>work and it's sunny constantly mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be definitely more expensive.</v>

3008
01:58:23.671 --> 01:58:28.671
<v Speaker 1>It would take awhile to then you also </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to get batteries and the batteries </v>

3009
01:58:28.671 --> 01:58:28.700
<v Speaker 1>have to have minerals and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries.</v>

3010
01:58:28.710 --> 01:58:33.710
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those minerals come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict areas like the Congo or </v>

3011
01:58:33.710 --> 01:58:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not all simple,</v>

3012
01:58:34.321 --> 01:58:37.840
<v Speaker 1>sweet and clean to have electric power </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

3013
01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:40.800
<v Speaker 1>from solar because you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries to store that power.</v>

3014
01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it goes off at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what about,</v>

3015
01:58:43.190 --> 01:58:45.100
<v Speaker 1>what about that nikola tesla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3016
01:58:45.970 --> 01:58:47.080
<v Speaker 1>we Buy them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3017
01:58:47.081 --> 01:58:47.730
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3018
01:58:47.780 --> 01:58:48.580
<v Speaker 1>She got fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3019
01:58:48.581 --> 01:58:50.170
<v Speaker 1>we never learned about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he meant that all the,</v>

3020
01:58:50.171 --> 01:58:53.110
<v Speaker 1>all the best electrIc electric stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he invented a lot of cool shit,</v>

3021
01:58:53.111 --> 01:58:56.440
<v Speaker 1>but he also fell in love with a pigeon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in love with the pigeon before he</v>

3022
01:58:56.441 --> 01:58:58.520
<v Speaker 1>died and here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I likes to fly pigeon.</v>

3023
01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he fucked hIm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he fucked anything.</v>

3024
01:59:00.730 --> 01:59:02.560
<v Speaker 1>He actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the quotes,</v>

3025
01:59:02.561 --> 01:59:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I can't find this anywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I read it once.</v>

3026
01:59:05.381 --> 01:59:10.381
<v Speaker 1>I know for sure that he destroyed his </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality was the quotes because yeah,</v>

3027
01:59:10.990 --> 01:59:14.530
<v Speaker 1>you had some issue with some woman and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't work out and it just destroyed</v>

3028
01:59:14.531 --> 01:59:15.670
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't concentrate,</v>

3029
01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:16.810
<v Speaker 1>so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

3030
01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:19.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with these balls and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

3031
01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:23.000
<v Speaker 4>hey did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a guy in my gym,</v>

3032
01:59:23.001 --> 01:59:24.080
<v Speaker 4>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's from New York.</v>

3033
01:59:24.081 --> 01:59:25.280
<v Speaker 4>Actually we a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3034
01:59:25.570 --> 01:59:27.930
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a normal guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's a scientist and he,</v>

3035
01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:29.570
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he invented this thing,</v>

3036
01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:35.040
<v Speaker 4>do I?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now this company is in the works for </v>

3037
01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:35.040
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a $20,000,000</v>

3038
01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:35.040
<v Speaker 4>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huge thing,</v>

3039
01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:35.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

3040
01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:38.690
<v Speaker 4>it's a magnet assisted generator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3041
01:59:39.570 --> 01:59:41.810
<v Speaker 4>so once it gets going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's perpetual,</v>

3042
01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:44.120
<v Speaker 4>not perpetual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>But 10,000</v>

3043
01:59:44.121 --> 01:59:47.680
<v Speaker 4>years is how long a magnet last until </v>
<v Speaker 4>the energy to magnet dies.</v>

3044
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:49.370
<v Speaker 4>So it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll spend 10,000</v>

3045
01:59:49.371 --> 01:59:50.600
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus christ.</v>

3046
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:52.850
<v Speaker 4>It's like a fucking huge fucking deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3047
01:59:53.130 --> 01:59:53.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter is three,</v>

3048
01:59:53.970 --> 01:59:56.150
<v Speaker 4>a million or a huge deal and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says it'll,</v>

3049
01:59:56.151 --> 01:59:56.840
<v Speaker 4>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll,</v>

3050
01:59:56.900 --> 02:00:01.900
<v Speaker 4>it'll boost any power plant anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>from 70 to 100 percent more power </v>

3051
02:00:02.151 --> 02:00:07.151
<v Speaker 4>production,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like a pretty much like the </v>

3052
02:00:07.151 --> 02:00:08.270
<v Speaker 4>modern tesla coil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like the newest thing.</v>

3053
02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:14.080
<v Speaker 4>I actually told him I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to see if we can call them or </v>

3054
02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:16.001
<v Speaker 4>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said he would come down and talk to </v>

3055
02:00:16.001 --> 02:00:16.001
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a,</v>

3056
02:00:16.001 --> 02:00:16.001
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a bad ass.</v>

3057
02:00:16.001 --> 02:00:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me his email address and I'll email</v>

3058
02:00:17.211 --> 02:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll figure it out,</v>

3059
02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:23.960
<v Speaker 1>find out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told him about it at the gym that </v>

3060
02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:23.960
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

3061
02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:24.070
<v Speaker 4>But it's like it's gonna be a real deal </v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3062
02:00:24.071 --> 02:00:26.440
<v Speaker 4>And he says something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no.</v>

3063
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:28.690
<v Speaker 4>Because right now we use turbans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3064
02:00:28.691 --> 02:00:31.110
<v Speaker 4>the windmill was created electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The turbines on the waterfall.</v>

3065
02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:36.220
<v Speaker 4>Let's tricity the nuclear energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this thing is just fucking magnets </v>

3066
02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:36.610
<v Speaker 4>and they spend by themselves and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and it makes electricity</v>

3067
02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:38.410
<v Speaker 1>so it just needs something to start it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

3068
02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And then once it starts up they repel </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and I just keep on moving,</v>

3069
02:00:42.821 --> 02:00:43.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's that easy,</v>

3070
02:00:43.811 --> 02:00:48.811
<v Speaker 1>why hasn't someone else figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Petro emotion and supposedly not </v>

3071
02:00:48.811 --> 02:00:50.800
<v Speaker 1>supposed to ever been solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not perpetual motion.</v>

3072
02:00:50.801 --> 02:00:53.650
<v Speaker 1>If you get something to start it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something starts it up,</v>

3073
02:00:53.730 --> 02:00:57.790
<v Speaker 1>you know you're gonna need something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only last 10,000</v>

3074
02:00:57.791 --> 02:00:59.080
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking long enough,</v>

3075
02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:01.450
<v Speaker 1>but you got to get it going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then once it goes,</v>

3076
02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:03.020
<v Speaker 1>it just keeps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keeps on moving.</v>

3077
02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

3078
02:01:03.341 --> 02:01:04.720

02:01:54.970 --> 02:01:59.690
<v Speaker 3>you could just add somebody's name to </v>

02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:05.180
<v Speaker 3>There's too much on the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The internet,</v>

3104
02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:08.750
<v Speaker 3>too much freedom on the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was at the citadel at the college</v>

3105
02:02:08.751 --> 02:02:13.730
<v Speaker 3>I was at because I was a biology major,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they had some scientists were touring</v>

3106
02:02:13.731 --> 02:02:16.940
<v Speaker 3>the country and they were like coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>around to schools and uh,</v>

3107
02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:18.790
<v Speaker 3>trying to like tell us stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3108
02:02:18.791 --> 02:02:20.060
<v Speaker 3>what will make us aware.</v>

3109
02:02:20.150 --> 02:02:25.150
<v Speaker 3>It was like a team of four scientists </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was just them and their </v>

3110
02:02:25.150 --> 02:02:28.250
<v Speaker 3>adventures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're saying these are our inventions </v>

3111
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:28.250
<v Speaker 3>that the government is fucking canned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're only four guys,</v>

3112
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:33.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine how many other things are out </v>

3113
02:02:33.011 --> 02:02:33.011
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one guy,</v>

3114
02:02:33.011 --> 02:02:35.500
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he invented a carburetor that you can </v>

3115
02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:35.570
<v Speaker 3>hook on any car and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's 80 miles a gallon.</v>

3116
02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Like instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3117
02:02:37.461 --> 02:02:38.330
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking.</v>

3118
02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:40.470
<v Speaker 3>He was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we went for like jam or what?</v>

3119
02:02:40.471 --> 02:02:45.471
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't saY.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like he thought I saved all this </v>

3120
02:02:45.471 --> 02:02:45.471
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be rich,</v>

3121
02:02:45.471 --> 02:02:45.471
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

3122
02:02:45.471 --> 02:02:45.471
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

3123
02:02:45.471 --> 02:02:46.430
<v Speaker 3>the fuckIng government got the patent </v>
<v Speaker 3>candidate,</v>

3124
02:02:46.610 --> 02:02:48.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this lady,</v>

3125
02:02:48.351 --> 02:02:52.130
<v Speaker 3>she made a clear enamel coat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He put her teeth one time,</v>

3126
02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:54.830
<v Speaker 3>the dentist puts it on the clear coat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and keith are invincible.</v>

3127
02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:56.360
<v Speaker 3>They'll never get a caBbie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

3128
02:02:56.450 --> 02:02:57.510
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a seal.</v>

3129
02:02:57.511 --> 02:03:02.511
<v Speaker 3>It seals your teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They bought the patent through the way </v>

3130
02:03:02.511 --> 02:03:02.511
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really know the guy invented.</v>

3131
02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:05.060
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes are addicting,</v>

3132
02:03:05.290 --> 02:03:06.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it causes fucking cancer.</v>

3133
02:03:06.711 --> 02:03:11.690
<v Speaker 3>One dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He invented a molecule that It addicts.</v>

3134
02:03:11.691 --> 02:03:15.500
<v Speaker 3>You like nicotine still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you just have no cancer.</v>

3135
02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:19.460
<v Speaker 3>So the cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you smoke and you're hooked on it,</v>

3136
02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:21.110
<v Speaker 3>but you won't die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3137
02:03:21.111 --> 02:03:22.130
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the best invention ever.</v>

3138
02:03:22.131 --> 02:03:27.131
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna save all these lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the company that he worked for </v>

3139
02:03:27.131 --> 02:03:27.950
<v Speaker 3>bought it and shoved it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't sound right.</v>

3140
02:03:28.010 --> 02:03:31.370
<v Speaker 3>How is it possible that you could smoke </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not get sick?</v>

3141
02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.100
<v Speaker 3>Because the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3142
02:03:32.170 --> 02:03:33.120
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3143
02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:35.540
<v Speaker 3>the molecule event that was just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>nicotine or whatever it was.</v>

3144
02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:37.280
<v Speaker 3>It was addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a car.</v>

3145
02:03:37.370 --> 02:03:39.530
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe he said that to you,</v>

3146
02:03:39.531 --> 02:03:40.970
<v Speaker 3>but I also believe he's full of shit.</v>

3147
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:46.030
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some pretty complicated medicine right </v>

3148
02:03:46.030 --> 02:03:48.971
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They people would know about the </v>

3149
02:03:48.971 --> 02:03:48.971
<v Speaker 3>possibility of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys were,</v>

3150
02:03:48.971 --> 02:03:52.920
<v Speaker 3>there were a team of scientists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're coming around like telling us </v>

3151
02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:55.700
<v Speaker 3>like we're four guys and like we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>invented this shit.</v>

3152
02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.220
<v Speaker 3>It's hard when you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's so long ago too.</v>

3153
02:03:58.221 --> 02:03:58.940
<v Speaker 3>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3154
02:03:58.941 --> 02:04:01.970
<v Speaker 3>you try to like recant the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell the story,</v>

3155
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:03.650
<v Speaker 3>but that was adjusted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I mean.</v>

3156
02:04:03.651 --> 02:04:05.150
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like wait a while.</v>

3157
02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:10.240
<v Speaker 3>If you had an enamel coat in her teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot get a cavity then most </v>

3158
02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:10.240
<v Speaker 3>answers out of work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3159
02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:14.790
<v Speaker 3>you know they that the car didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't want 80 mile per gallon </v>

3160
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.790
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3161
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.990
<v Speaker 3>They don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3162
02:04:14.991 --> 02:04:15.450
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3163
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:17.650
<v Speaker 3>back then you hook It on your car and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3164
02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:18.480
<v Speaker 3>you're set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3165
02:04:18.490 --> 02:04:20.630
<v Speaker 3>the definitely would be a blow back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>

3166
02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:22.640
<v Speaker 3>it was definitely a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're losing money,</v>

3167
02:04:22.641 --> 02:04:27.641
<v Speaker 3>if they would lose money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if something came along that made cars </v>

3168
02:04:27.641 --> 02:04:28.100
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably more efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would need less gasoline.</v>

3169
02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:33.280
<v Speaker 3>That would be a fuckload less money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The amount of money that's spent every </v>

3170
02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:36.850
<v Speaker 3>day In this country on fossil fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't even wrap our head around that </v>

3171
02:04:36.850 --> 02:04:36.850
<v Speaker 3>number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

3172
02:04:36.850 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 3>It's an insane number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to get</v>

3173
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:40.650
<v Speaker 1>that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take many generations.</v>

3174
02:04:41.310 --> 02:04:46.310
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take a long window of </v>
<v Speaker 1>change or it's going to take one </v>

3175
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:47.190
<v Speaker 1>spectacular invention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the electric car.</v>

3176
02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Electric cars are cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fuck,</v>

3177
02:04:49.801 --> 02:04:53.340
<v Speaker 1>they take a long time to charge up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could only go like 300 miles.</v>

3178
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:56.760
<v Speaker 1>It takes like you gotta charge them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even if you need rapid charge,</v>

3179
02:04:56.761 --> 02:05:01.761
<v Speaker 1>it's a half hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to sit in a gas station for </v>

3180
02:05:01.761 --> 02:05:01.761
<v Speaker 1>half hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your fucking car charges.</v>

3181
02:05:01.761 --> 02:05:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Talked to doing it for my gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy,</v>

3182
02:05:02.841 --> 02:05:04.650
<v Speaker 1>the scientist guy about the cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3183
02:05:04.651 --> 02:05:07.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he says it's a scam though.</v>

3184
02:05:07.381 --> 02:05:12.381
<v Speaker 1>He says that the whole car was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much a battery and he says that all the </v>

3185
02:05:12.381 --> 02:05:15.660
<v Speaker 1>lead in the shit and the battery is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually ends up being just as bad or</v>

3186
02:05:15.661 --> 02:05:20.661
<v Speaker 1>worse for the environment than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than if you just would have had a car </v>

3187
02:05:20.661 --> 02:05:20.661
<v Speaker 1>with gas.</v>

3188
02:05:20.661 --> 02:05:20.661
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he says.</v>

3189
02:05:20.661 --> 02:05:20.661
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

3190
02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was all propaganda dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he says,</v>

3191
02:05:22.711 --> 02:05:24.450
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking,</v>

3192
02:05:24.730 --> 02:05:26.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not as good as you think it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

3193
02:05:26.220 --> 02:05:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely need minerals.</v>

3194
02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Knew the same thing is with the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the batteries that you need for </v>

3195
02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:36.021
<v Speaker 1>solar generators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need minerals to put into the mean </v>

3196
02:05:36.021 --> 02:05:37.770
<v Speaker 1>at least in the current technology that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had used lithium ion.</v>

3197
02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:39.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the big discoveries </v>
<v Speaker 1>they found.</v>

3198
02:05:39.211 --> 02:05:44.211
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan was lithium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lithium is pretty valuable stuff and </v>

3199
02:05:44.211 --> 02:05:48.201
<v Speaker 1>then when they converted it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries like you to get that out of </v>

3200
02:05:48.201 --> 02:05:51.291
<v Speaker 1>the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to get it out of the ground and </v>

3201
02:05:51.291 --> 02:05:51.291
<v Speaker 1>that's so anybody thinks that you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>this completely green,</v>

3202
02:05:51.291 --> 02:05:56.151
<v Speaker 1>clean thing because it's made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries now it's just not using as </v>

3203
02:05:56.151 --> 02:05:57.780
<v Speaker 1>much fossil fuel every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he was saying.</v>

3204
02:05:57.780 --> 02:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>He said that when you add it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really isn't all you think is </v>

3205
02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:03.840
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes fossil fuel to make a car too.</v>

3206
02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken into consideration and there's no </v>

3207
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:09.720
<v Speaker 1>tires other than rubber tires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3208
02:06:09.721 --> 02:06:14.721
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta use synthetic materials to </v>

3209
02:06:14.721 --> 02:06:16.671
<v Speaker 1>make tires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't come up with a hemp tire </v>

3210
02:06:16.671 --> 02:06:16.671
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3211
02:06:16.671 --> 02:06:19.971
<v Speaker 1>until they come up with something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely green and biodegradable as a </v>

3212
02:06:19.971 --> 02:06:23.061
<v Speaker 1>tire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always going to deal with you </v>

3213
02:06:23.061 --> 02:06:23.061
<v Speaker 1>ever see a tire when it gets lit on fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

3214
02:06:23.061 --> 02:06:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3215
02:06:23.911 --> 02:06:28.911
<v Speaker 1>that is toxic waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things they do to </v>

3216
02:06:28.911 --> 02:06:28.911
<v Speaker 1>people in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a thing,</v>

3217
02:06:28.911 --> 02:06:29.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3218
02:06:29.441 --> 02:06:34.441
<v Speaker 1>they do what they call microwave you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put you inside a row of tires </v>

3219
02:06:34.441 --> 02:06:36.780
<v Speaker 1>burning and burn you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because your dna,</v>

3220
02:06:36.781 --> 02:06:41.781
<v Speaker 1>it becomes almost impossible to identify</v>
<v Speaker 1>you because you Just get intermingled </v>

3221
02:06:41.941 --> 02:06:42.990
<v Speaker 1>with these tires.</v>

3222
02:06:42.990 --> 02:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>It's just a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3223
02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Gasoline and tires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fucked up way to get rid of </v>

3224
02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:51.020
<v Speaker 1>a body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3225
02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what people go destroy vehicles </v>

3226
02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:57.510
<v Speaker 1>that they want insurance to be destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the tire's melts so hot.</v>

3227
02:06:57.511 --> 02:06:59.520
<v Speaker 1>That will actually bend the whole frame </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the car.</v>

3228
02:06:59.521 --> 02:07:03.750
<v Speaker 1>So that way you can do to get your car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people are so silly.</v>

3229
02:07:04.830 --> 02:07:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me,</v>

3230
02:07:06.541 --> 02:07:07.300
<v Speaker 1>mAn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

3231
02:07:07.330 --> 02:07:09.900
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we got off the subject.</v>

3232
02:07:09.901 --> 02:07:12.570
<v Speaker 1>What did you do the entire year that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were in solitary?</v>

<v Speaker 4>the day goes by real slow with like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>months go by quick and then when you get</v>

3258
02:08:13.601 --> 02:08:15.110
<v Speaker 4>out it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

3259
02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:15.850
<v Speaker 4>it was all a dream.</v>

3441
02:14:59.561 --> 02:14:59.561
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't afford a good lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was poor.</v>

<v Speaker 1>hard by the book shit.</v>

3445
02:15:06.681 --> 02:15:11.681
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't look at each individual case </v>

3446
02:15:11.681 --> 02:15:11.681
<v Speaker 1>as being a separate entity and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3447
02:15:11.681 --> 02:15:13.370
<v Speaker 1>these are circumstances that are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>unusual.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I see what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's not a criminal.</v>

3449
02:15:15.621 --> 02:15:18.980
<v Speaker 1>He just overreacted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can overreact like that</v>

<v Speaker 4>And like you watch the judges,</v>

3454
02:15:27.111 --> 02:15:29.430
<v Speaker 4>men given out 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 years,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even looking at but from the paper </v>

<v Speaker 4>10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like what the fuck.</v>

02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:36.390
<v Speaker 4>Like this guy has given out years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they don't understand how long that</v>

3458
02:15:36.391 --> 02:15:37.230
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they don't care.</v>

3459
02:15:37.290 --> 02:15:38.460
<v Speaker 4>They don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have no.</v>

3460
02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:41.220
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes sometimes the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 4>deserve a dude,</v>

3461
02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:42.930
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes it's like fuck.</v>

3462
02:15:43.490 --> 02:15:48.490
<v Speaker 1>When you heard about that judge in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania that was putting kids in </v>

3463
02:15:48.490 --> 02:15:49.290

02:15:55.441 --> 02:16:00.441
<v Speaker 1>And he was getting payoffs because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing we talked about about </v>

3467
02:16:00.441 --> 02:16:03.950
<v Speaker 1>privatized prisons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about prisons making profit off of the </v>

3468
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:03.950
<v Speaker 1>amount of people that they have in them.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm skinny,</v>

02:16:39.460 --> 02:16:44.460
<v Speaker 4>I didn't go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't push it for a month because I </v>

02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:46.261
<v Speaker 4>was trying to get decent schaefer's </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I thought I just felt like </v>

3489
02:16:46.261 --> 02:16:49.060
<v Speaker 4>insecurity plus the first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both towns I got out of jail.</v>

<v Speaker 4>The first two weeks were hard man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my anxiety is bad.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I got it right away.</v>

3495
02:16:58.510 --> 02:17:01.860
<v Speaker 4>So the first like ngo,</v>

3496
02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:03.430
<v Speaker 4>not because I'm tough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't cry.</v>

3497
02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:08.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why even my grandpa died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't cry and I just sat there and </v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3541
02:18:41.681 --> 02:18:46.030

<v Speaker 4>fight the truth and they created a </v>
<v Speaker 4>monster.</v>

3649
02:22:40.021 --> 02:22:42.150
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he wanted to go good.</v>

3650
02:22:42.151 --> 02:22:44.120
<v Speaker 4>Get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

3651
02:22:44.130 --> 02:22:46.460
<v Speaker 4>it was almost like they let alvarez go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3652
02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:50.100
<v Speaker 4>Why is marketable?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he fights wild asking.</v>

3653
02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:55.160
<v Speaker 4>No one wants it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's done so many fans and the ufc </v>

3654
02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:55.160
<v Speaker 4>didn't want him either because he's one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of you would have asked.</v>

3655
02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:57.300
<v Speaker 4>She goes in and beats everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm I want to see it.</v>

3656
02:22:57.330 --> 02:22:58.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he won't.</v>

3657
02:22:58.080 --> 02:22:59.640
<v Speaker 4>He has no hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what if we did.</v>

3658
02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:03.840
<v Speaker 4>Then you got this fucking guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that women prior to that,</v>

3659
02:23:03.841 --> 02:23:04.880
<v Speaker 4>when lynn was invincible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3660
02:23:05.550 --> 02:23:08.000
<v Speaker 4>He lost one time to fucking dave trail.</v>

3661
02:23:08.490 --> 02:23:13.490
<v Speaker 4>They fired him because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank god we got rid of matt lindland </v>

3662
02:23:13.490 --> 02:23:13.490
<v Speaker 4>because he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was not marketable.</v>

3663
02:23:13.490 --> 02:23:14.160
<v Speaker 4>Found eco vitaly too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And knocked himself out.</v>

3664
02:23:14.161 --> 02:23:18.420
<v Speaker 4>Remember he went to lateral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dropped him still.</v>

3665
02:23:18.421 --> 02:23:20.820
<v Speaker 4>He didn't deserve yet fired yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they wanted rid of them.</v>

3666
02:23:20.821 --> 02:23:21.990
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suplex.</v>

3667
02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:24.110
<v Speaker 4>They want to rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3668
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:24.960
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

3669
02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:27.720
<v Speaker 4>So like not as koreans didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Massland asking fucked up.</v>

3670
02:23:27.721 --> 02:23:32.721
<v Speaker 4>he should have stayed in builder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now what's he gonna do now is going to </v>

3671
02:23:32.721 --> 02:23:32.721
<v Speaker 4>fight in China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nfc,</v>

3672
02:23:32.721 --> 02:23:33.360
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3673
02:23:33.361 --> 02:23:35.610
<v Speaker 4>But is there any more?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're paying them good though.</v>

3674
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:40.670
<v Speaker 4>They have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like he's out of the most exposure </v>

3675
02:23:40.670 --> 02:23:45.111
<v Speaker 4>is obviously the fight in the ufc belt </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the second most exposure that you </v>

3676
02:23:45.111 --> 02:23:45.111
<v Speaker 4>can get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What else?</v>

3677
02:23:45.111 --> 02:23:45.111
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's gonna watch.</v>

3678
02:23:45.111 --> 02:23:45.390
<v Speaker 4>Who's going to watch?</v>

3679
02:23:45.860 --> 02:23:47.060
<v Speaker 3>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me personally,</v>

3680
02:23:47.061 --> 02:23:52.061
<v Speaker 3>I'm a purist and I feel like if there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy like ben asking that can hold you </v>

3681
02:23:52.061 --> 02:23:54.320
<v Speaker 3>down and dry hump you for five rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what he can do.</v>

3682
02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:59.440
<v Speaker 3>Like if that guy should be able to fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if he could take guys down and give </v>

3683
02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:00.890
<v Speaker 3>them the buggies and elbow him and punch</v>
<v Speaker 3>him in the head and,</v>

3684
02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:04.340
<v Speaker 3>and hold everybody down for five rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's reality.</v>

3685
02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:05.470
<v Speaker 3>That's reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

3686
02:24:05.480 --> 02:24:10.480
<v Speaker 3>You can't hide that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't not have that guy fight </v>

3687
02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:10.480
<v Speaker 3>because you're worried he's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>boring.</v>

3688
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:12.530
<v Speaker 3>He's doing everything according to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules.</v>

3689
02:24:12.620 --> 02:24:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't like penalize a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't particularly like his </v>

3690
02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:20.210
<v Speaker 3>style and that's my issue that I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>with every organization does.</v>

3691
02:24:20.270 --> 02:24:22.280
<v Speaker 3>I think they're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never do it.</v>

3692
02:24:22.281 --> 02:24:24.950
<v Speaker 3>If I was running bella tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have given the guy who's fucking</v>

3693
02:24:24.951 --> 02:24:25.190
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

3694
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:26.660
<v Speaker 3>He's the champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody could beat him.</v>

3695
02:24:26.661 --> 02:24:28.370
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of interesting.</v>

3696
02:24:28.371 --> 02:24:31.010
<v Speaker 3>you've got a boring champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got a guy like douglas lema who's</v>

3697
02:24:31.011 --> 02:24:32.930
<v Speaker 3>just fucking beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smashing people.</v>

3698
02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:34.280
<v Speaker 3>Then was fish too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vicious,</v>

3699
02:24:34.281 --> 02:24:36.860
<v Speaker 3>vicious dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Takes him down like nothing.</v>

3700
02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Cookie sandwiches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch pizzas.</v>

3701
02:24:39.530 --> 02:24:43.130
<v Speaker 3>That lean was a huge giant ashlyn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Small farewell walter,</v>

3702
02:24:43.660 --> 02:24:46.040
<v Speaker 3>and they asked her to take some down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No problem man,</v>

3703
02:24:46.050 --> 02:24:49.100
<v Speaker 3>handle them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it all comes down to to the ratings.</v>

3704
02:24:49.101 --> 02:24:50.510
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck.</v>

3705
02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:53.720
<v Speaker 3>I really think that the ratings are very</v>
<v Speaker 3>important,</v>

3706
02:24:53.721 --> 02:24:56.130
<v Speaker 3>but the product has to be pure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you.</v>

3707
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:59.000
<v Speaker 3>You fuck with things like you remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>what elite ecc was?</v>

3708
02:24:59.001 --> 02:25:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Standing people out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd go down for like 15 seconds.</v>

3709
02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:03.190
<v Speaker 3>Stand the most bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stood up.</v>

3710
02:25:03.191 --> 02:25:06.260
<v Speaker 3>Big country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had andre arlovski inside control and</v>

3711
02:25:06.261 --> 02:25:08.060
<v Speaker 3>he's Working on komora and they stood </v>
<v Speaker 3>him up.</v>

3712
02:25:08.390 --> 02:25:10.400
<v Speaker 3>He had this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had the double wrist lock.</v>

3713
02:25:10.401 --> 02:25:12.290
<v Speaker 3>He had the whole thing up there and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>stood them up,</v>

3714
02:25:12.291 --> 02:25:15.500
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out is this side control.</v>

3715
02:25:15.501 --> 02:25:16.520
<v Speaker 3>You're standing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy up,</v>

3716
02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:19.400
<v Speaker 3>they still dudes up from the mount guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>are full mountain.</v>

3717
02:25:19.401 --> 02:25:21.500
<v Speaker 3>They stood them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

3718
02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:25.740
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to be almost no ground time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want almost no ground time,</v>

3719
02:25:25.930 --> 02:25:28.990
<v Speaker 3>but when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you change in what mma really is.</v>

3720
02:25:28.991 --> 02:25:32.410
<v Speaker 3>Mma is a fight and in those five minutes</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have some specific rules.</v>

3721
02:25:32.411 --> 02:25:35.410
<v Speaker 3>You can't kick in the groin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Camp poke in the eyes can pull guys here</v>

3722
02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:36.400
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3723
02:25:36.401 --> 02:25:38.110
<v Speaker 3>you know what the rules are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't kick it down upon it.</v>

3724
02:25:38.180 --> 02:25:43.180
<v Speaker 3>Everything else you could do and if a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy like asking could just take dudes </v>

3725
02:25:43.180 --> 02:25:45.160
<v Speaker 3>down and get on top of him and punch him</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the face and they can't do shit about</v>

3726
02:25:45.161 --> 02:25:45.400
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3727
02:25:45.430 --> 02:25:47.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's winning within the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was winning.</v>

3728
02:25:47.530 --> 02:25:49.420
<v Speaker 3>you got to let them win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to let them win.</v>

3729
02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:51.360
<v Speaker 3>You got to let them try to win this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only,</v>

3730
02:25:51.390 --> 02:25:56.390
<v Speaker 3>the only reason I could think why they </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't keep them and why the use of why </v>

3731
02:25:56.390 --> 02:25:56.390
<v Speaker 3>didn't you want them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen.</v>

3732
02:25:56.390 --> 02:26:00.391
<v Speaker 3>If the ufc took him and then he fights </v>
<v Speaker 3>johny hendricks and gets put into </v>

3733
02:26:00.391 --> 02:26:00.640
<v Speaker 3>night-night land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fantastic.</v>

3734
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:01.890
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will see.</v>

3735
02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:03.040
<v Speaker 3>I think a scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he won't.</v>

3736
02:26:03.070 --> 02:26:04.750
<v Speaker 3>He could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's possible.</v>

3737
02:26:04.751 --> 02:26:07.120
<v Speaker 3>It's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at his record.</v>

3738
02:26:07.450 --> 02:26:09.390
<v Speaker 3>Well one guy gave him a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay here on game.</v>

3739
02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:11.770
<v Speaker 3>A real hard Time with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can wrestle inbox.</v>

3740
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:13.900
<v Speaker 3>He could wrestle any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

3741
02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:16.930
<v Speaker 3>I think hendrix would would have killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>them at cost check.</v>

3742
02:26:16.931 --> 02:26:18.970
<v Speaker 3>I think we're killing anyone that </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone's going to wrestle and punch,</v>

3743
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:19.870
<v Speaker 3>but I want to see it.</v>

3744
02:26:20.540 --> 02:26:25.540
<v Speaker 3>I want to see it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see a guy be effective until </v>

3745
02:26:25.540 --> 02:26:26.620
<v Speaker 3>he can't be effective anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when people said like they asked me</v>

3746
02:26:26.621 --> 02:26:31.621
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were you sad when anderson silva got </v>

3747
02:26:31.621 --> 02:26:31.621
<v Speaker 3>beat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3748
02:26:31.621 --> 02:26:31.621
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never sad when anybody gets beat.</v>

3749
02:26:31.621 --> 02:26:34.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm sad if someone gets hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was more sad the second fight to see a</v>

3750
02:26:34.151 --> 02:26:39.151
<v Speaker 3>dude fuck his leg up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I want to see a guy like anderson </v>

3751
02:26:39.151 --> 02:26:41.350
<v Speaker 3>silva who looks invincible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a guy,</v>

3752
02:26:41.351 --> 02:26:44.140
<v Speaker 3>figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the evolution of the game.</v>

3753
02:26:44.141 --> 02:26:45.910
<v Speaker 3>It's all about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it was,</v>

3754
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:47.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever it was,</v>

3755
02:26:47.141 --> 02:26:49.450
<v Speaker 3>whether it was vittorio was chris </v>
<v Speaker 3>weidman,</v>

3756
02:26:49.451 --> 02:26:52.060
<v Speaker 3>whoever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to see these guys figure it out.</v>

3757
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:56.770
<v Speaker 3>I like to see a guy salva guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean that's the only reason that I</v>

3758
02:26:56.771 --> 02:26:58.000
<v Speaker 3>can say why you sit in silence.</v>

3759
02:26:58.750 --> 02:26:59.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3760
02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:04.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was also the issue that they </v>

3761
02:27:04.860 --> 02:27:05.800
<v Speaker 3>felt that a bell tour was playing games </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like bella tour was,</v>

3762
02:27:05.900 --> 02:27:07.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they might know,</v>

3763
02:27:07.980 --> 02:27:10.780
<v Speaker 3>oh we we cast off are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't even want them anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That guy's boring.</v>

3766
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:17.080

<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fan of his style,</v>

02:31:29.181 --> 02:31:29.181
<v Speaker 4>I saw way more if I made a trip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>said warm,</v>

3875
02:31:29.181 --> 02:31:30.420
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not nearly as much.</v>

3876
02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:32.340
<v Speaker 4>I saw hundreds of these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

3877
02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:33.720
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a smart move.</v>

3878
02:31:33.721 --> 02:31:35.730
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of dudes who want to pretend </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be alpha.</v>

3879
02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:36.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3880
02:31:37.620 --> 02:31:39.900
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like a body's wanting to do this.</v>

3881
02:31:39.930 --> 02:31:41.460
<v Speaker 4>I want to fight and be able to do these </v>
<v Speaker 4>shirts.</v>

3882
02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:46.700
<v Speaker 4>And me and my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my navy seal buddies were getting a </v>

3883
02:31:46.700 --> 02:31:46.700
<v Speaker 4>government contract to we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

3884
02:31:46.700 --> 02:31:47.640
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're building a whole curriculum dude.</v>

3885
02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:51.580
<v Speaker 4>So it's three seals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and bruny and we're building a me and</v>

3886
02:31:51.581 --> 02:31:54.630
<v Speaker 4>brittany or putting on navy seal gear </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're going to wrestle with it.</v>

3887
02:31:54.631 --> 02:31:59.631
<v Speaker 4>And shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to actually the vulnerable </v>

3888
02:31:59.631 --> 02:31:59.631
<v Speaker 4>brand new curriculum from start to </v>
<v Speaker 4>finish and we're going to.</v>

3889
02:31:59.631 --> 02:32:04.520
<v Speaker 4>We're getting government contracts to </v>
<v Speaker 4>train seals and green berets around the </v>

3890
02:32:04.520 --> 02:32:04.520
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a great idea.</v>

3891
02:32:04.520 --> 02:32:05.460
<v Speaker 4>And it's going to be fucking lucrative </v>
<v Speaker 4>dudes.</v>

3892
02:32:06.620 --> 02:32:09.840
<v Speaker 4>Brandon wolfe from you remember him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was an ex silly fight.</v>

3893
02:32:09.841 --> 02:32:14.841
<v Speaker 4>The ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's doing a similar thing on the east </v>

3894
02:32:14.841 --> 02:32:15.240
<v Speaker 4>coast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they did obviously they did it where</v>

3895
02:32:15.870 --> 02:32:20.870
<v Speaker 4>seals method moves and then they had </v>
<v Speaker 4>brandon since he fought to help them </v>

3896
02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:20.870
<v Speaker 4>teach it.</v>

3897
02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:26.270
<v Speaker 4>So we're doing the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have us or the shit and </v>

3898
02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:26.270
<v Speaker 4>the event moves and we're going to teach</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3899
02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:27.420
<v Speaker 4>but it's going to be like it's never </v>
<v Speaker 4>been done before.</v>

3900
02:32:27.450 --> 02:32:30.750
<v Speaker 4>And we already have like my buddy has </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the government contracts so it could</v>

3901
02:32:30.751 --> 02:32:35.751
<v Speaker 4>be a thing where if it gets big enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can be where we can hire out other </v>

3902
02:32:35.751 --> 02:32:37.920
<v Speaker 4>fighters that are done fighting because </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of us don't have shit to do.</v>

3903
02:32:37.921 --> 02:32:42.921
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we don't have a backup if you're </v>

3904
02:32:42.921 --> 02:32:45.310
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had the champion that you didn't </v>

3905
02:32:45.310 --> 02:32:46.401
<v Speaker 4>make enough money to have a backup plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I can make fucking 150 grand a </v>

3906
02:32:46.401 --> 02:32:50.571
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>training seals and green berets this </v>

3907
02:32:50.571 --> 02:32:53.091
<v Speaker 4>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hand shit and then if it gets too </v>

3908
02:32:53.091 --> 02:32:53.091
<v Speaker 4>big and we could hire fucking this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that guy that,</v>

3909
02:32:53.091 --> 02:32:54.360
<v Speaker 4>you know what we've done fighting come </v>
<v Speaker 4>work for us,</v>

3910
02:32:54.361 --> 02:32:56.040
<v Speaker 4>it will be trained in the moves that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>could do it.</v>

3911
02:32:56.380 --> 02:32:58.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a smart thing to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's some,</v>

3912
02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:03.240
<v Speaker 1>there's some specialists in like unarmed</v>
<v Speaker 1>combat when it comes to removing guns </v>

3913
02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:04.030
<v Speaker 1>from people and removing knives from </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3914
02:33:04.060 --> 02:33:07.420
<v Speaker 1>There are some specialists but outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

3915
02:33:07.480 --> 02:33:10.150
<v Speaker 1>most of their hand to hand combat shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>is bullshit.</v>

3916
02:33:10.570 --> 02:33:11.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to work.</v>

3917
02:33:11.981 --> 02:33:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Like I was watching the show the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

3918
02:33:13.870 --> 02:33:17.110
<v Speaker 1>I was watching the sportsman's network </v>
<v Speaker 1>at late at night.</v>

3919
02:33:17.111 --> 02:33:19.630
<v Speaker 1>They have like the self defense </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenarios.</v>

3920
02:33:19.631 --> 02:33:24.631
<v Speaker 1>Like a guy got attacked in an elevator </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's controlling this guys arm and </v>

3921
02:33:24.631 --> 02:33:28.411
<v Speaker 1>then he pulls his gun out and shoots the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy after he's controlling this guys </v>

3922
02:33:28.411 --> 02:33:28.411
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3923
02:33:28.411 --> 02:33:31.980
<v Speaker 1>why is that guy just standing there like</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not gonna you not gonna control a </v>

3924
02:33:31.980 --> 02:33:32.260
<v Speaker 1>guy's arm like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a guy knows how to fight,</v>

3925
02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:34.340
<v Speaker 1>what about his other arm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ain't doing shit about this arm.</v>

3926
02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:35.890
<v Speaker 1>You just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many facts.</v>

3927
02:33:35.970 --> 02:33:37.960
<v Speaker 1>What if he moves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if he pulled his arm out?</v>

3928
02:33:38.050 --> 02:33:40.390
<v Speaker 1>What if he kicks you in the dick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of shit going on.</v>

3929
02:33:40.391 --> 02:33:45.391
<v Speaker 1>Like what you should know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I was on opie and </v>

3930
02:33:45.391 --> 02:33:48.451

<v Speaker 1>was talk all this mad stupid shit about </v>

02:33:49.981 --> 02:33:52.270
<v Speaker 1>you know their sport and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what works on the street.</v>

3933
02:33:52.271 --> 02:33:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Like no dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what works.</v>

3934
02:33:54.190 --> 02:33:57.850

3936
02:34:00.700 --> 02:34:02.580
<v Speaker 4>What did that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing is like know I've been at,</v>

3937
02:34:02.980 --> 02:34:03.970
<v Speaker 4>I've been trading a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3938
02:34:03.980 --> 02:34:06.770
<v Speaker 4>like a new gal coming.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3949
02:34:29.971 --> 02:34:33.730
<v Speaker 3>You don't fight through your calf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You try to arm bar but you won't hurt.</v>

3950
02:34:33.790 --> 02:34:36.340
<v Speaker 3>That will break your fucking arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you bite through a steak?</v>

<v Speaker 3>But in that field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

3955

<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

3986
02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Don't shoot the fuck out of you had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand,</v>

3987
02:35:55.260 --> 02:36:00.260
<v Speaker 3>you know that they don't know shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if we can invent a curriculum that </v>

3988
02:36:00.260 --> 02:36:01.090
<v Speaker 3>it's legit because all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're never going to be in a fight,</v>

3989
02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:06.360
<v Speaker 3>but if they're going through a hallway </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a gun and someone don't talk about </v>

3990
02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:09.391
<v Speaker 3>doors grabbed was when the tangled up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need to be able to defend </v>

3991
02:36:09.391 --> 02:36:09.391
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ready real quick.</v>

3992
02:36:09.391 --> 02:36:13.140
<v Speaker 3>You need to know how to do that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's something that for the longest </v>

3993
02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:14.860
<v Speaker 3>time before the ufc came around really </v>
<v Speaker 3>before nma came around,</v>

3994
02:36:15.100 --> 02:36:18.970
<v Speaker 3>people didn't really know what was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that worked because how many times</v>

3995
02:36:18.971 --> 02:36:20.440
<v Speaker 3>do you get in a fight in an elevator?</v>

3996
02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:25.440
<v Speaker 3>We got to pull your gun so dudes would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be inventing a bunch of shit that could </v>

3997
02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:28.531
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then from here I'm controlling his </v>

3998
02:36:28.531 --> 02:36:28.531
<v Speaker 3>arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

3999
02:36:28.531 --> 02:36:31.470
<v Speaker 3>he's in my position for me to land up </v>
<v Speaker 3>devastating elbow and from here he's </v>

4000
02:36:31.470 --> 02:36:31.690
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if there's not,</v>

4001
02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:36.720
<v Speaker 3>that's why I wasn't hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once visiting my family and I trained </v>

4005
02:36:46.210 --> 02:36:48.460
<v Speaker 3>like he was like showing me stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm letting them do it.</v>

4006
02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:49.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

4007
02:36:49.451 --> 02:36:54.451
<v Speaker 3>This shit is bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to maybe said maybe it does </v>

4008
02:36:54.451 --> 02:36:54.451
<v Speaker 3>kind of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

4009
02:36:54.451 --> 02:36:57.340
<v Speaker 3>And we wrestled was fucking never once </v>
<v Speaker 3>was I ever in anything.</v>

4010
02:36:58.260 --> 02:37:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Not one thing I didn't even have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>defend.</v>

4011
02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:03.220
<v Speaker 3>One thing was just it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't fucking work.</v>

4012
02:37:03.250 --> 02:37:05.440
<v Speaker 3>And somebody told me that to quito is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really effective.</v>

4013
02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:07.300
<v Speaker 3>You just have to have a true aikido </v>
<v Speaker 3>master.</v>

4014
02:37:07.301 --> 02:37:07.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4015
02:37:07.631 --> 02:37:09.280
<v Speaker 3>get an aikido master to fight in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>octagon.</v>

4016
02:37:09.281 --> 02:37:11.970
<v Speaker 3>I would love to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to see a guy just stand there.</v>

4017
02:37:11.980 --> 02:37:14.920
<v Speaker 3>Just flip people effortlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have them sore.</v>

4018
02:37:15.100 --> 02:37:16.390
<v Speaker 3>It worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4019
02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:18.860
<v Speaker 3>Like we're kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We watched steven seagal and van damme.</v>

4020
02:37:19.130 --> 02:37:20.540
<v Speaker 3>I wish that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the best?</v>

4021
02:37:20.690 --> 02:37:21.770
<v Speaker 3>That's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun,</v>

4022
02:37:22.010 --> 02:37:23.790
<v Speaker 3>but it just isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

4023
02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:25.770
<v Speaker 3>But that's the most important thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

4024
02:37:25.970 --> 02:37:30.970
<v Speaker 3>about mixed martial arts is that we know</v>
<v Speaker 3>now more about martial arts than people </v>

4025
02:37:30.970 --> 02:37:31.670
<v Speaker 3>did 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 years ago.</v>

4026
02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:33.590
<v Speaker 3>We just know more for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a fact,</v>

4027
02:37:33.591 --> 02:37:37.460
<v Speaker 3>we know what's more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because know back in the old days,</v>

4028
02:37:37.461 --> 02:37:40.040
<v Speaker 3>everyone gets by with like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have to prove it.</v>

4029
02:37:40.370 --> 02:37:41.270
<v Speaker 3>Had the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

4030
02:37:41.390 --> 02:37:42.250
<v Speaker 3>This is the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4031
02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:43.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm the teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You stand still.</v>

4032
02:37:43.401 --> 02:37:45.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they'll move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't spoil the fucking teacher.</v>

4033
02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:46.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4034
02:37:46.590 --> 02:37:46.940
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4035
02:37:46.941 --> 02:37:48.150
<v Speaker 3>I met my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a beer at your sheet.</v>

4036
02:37:48.190 --> 02:37:51.080
<v Speaker 3>Have tried choking me on track and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get him.</v>

4037
02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:53.630
<v Speaker 3>We're fighting all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's my teacher were fighting.</v>

4038
02:37:54.250 --> 02:37:56.250
<v Speaker 3>No other martial art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you really fired teachers?</v>

4039
02:37:57.100 --> 02:37:58.640
<v Speaker 3>Happier teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you know,</v>

4040
02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:01.550
<v Speaker 3>any bravo goes to town with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>students.</v>

4041
02:38:01.700 --> 02:38:04.820
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen him get tapped by guys by </v>
<v Speaker 3>black belts are brown belts or what have</v>

4042
02:38:04.821 --> 02:38:09.821
<v Speaker 3>you because he takes chances and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight five guys in a row and he's </v>

4043
02:38:09.821 --> 02:38:09.821
<v Speaker 3>exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's called training.</v>

4044
02:38:09.821 --> 02:38:10.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it's.</v>

4045
02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:11.490
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Practice.</v>

4046
02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:12.870
<v Speaker 3>That's where you want to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4047
02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:14.510
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're afraid to lose,</v>

4048
02:38:14.511 --> 02:38:17.060
<v Speaker 3>then you're afraid to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're afraid to get better,</v>

4049
02:38:17.061 --> 02:38:18.890
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be stagnant and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>always going to be.</v>

4050
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:22.220
<v Speaker 3>You're always going to shy away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>rolling with anybody that can tap you.</v>

4051
02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:24.530
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference between people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't understand,</v>

4052
02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:28.660
<v Speaker 3>that they've never trained before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've never trained before you,</v>

4053
02:38:28.661 --> 02:38:30.680
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll never understand that the correct</v>

4054
02:38:30.681 --> 02:38:35.681
<v Speaker 3>mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the correct mentality is like marcello </v>

4055
02:38:35.681 --> 02:38:35.681
<v Speaker 3>garcia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like has the best statement about that.</v>

4056
02:38:35.681 --> 02:38:37.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have to open up your game </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the gym.</v>

4057
02:38:37.341 --> 02:38:40.310
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way to get better </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to worry about,</v>

4058
02:38:40.311 --> 02:38:45.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to give yourself the potential </v>

4059
02:38:45.311 --> 02:38:45.311
<v Speaker 3>to get tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

4060
02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:46.520
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be able to type of </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

4061
02:38:46.730 --> 02:38:48.620
<v Speaker 3>But if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you figure just tap,</v>

4062
02:38:48.621 --> 02:38:50.820
<v Speaker 3>just tap and move on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like barrett,</v>

4063
02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:52.190
<v Speaker 3>barrett,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small,</v>

4064
02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:54.610
<v Speaker 3>just fucking 35.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad motherfucker though.</v>

4065
02:38:55.060 --> 02:38:58.690
<v Speaker 3>And he's a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barrett is a fucking dick.</v>

4066
02:38:58.700 --> 02:39:01.410
<v Speaker 3>The personality to the core,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his drug is introduced.</v>

4067
02:39:02.090 --> 02:39:03.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in there three,</v>

4068
02:39:03.530 --> 02:39:04.750
<v Speaker 3>four times a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all day long.</v>

4069
02:39:04.750 --> 02:39:06.000
<v Speaker 3>He's a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

4070
02:39:06.220 --> 02:39:08.690
<v Speaker 3>he gets hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll tapers out onto himself and still</v>

4071
02:39:08.730 --> 02:39:10.330
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a maniac with barrett.</v>

4072
02:39:10.370 --> 02:39:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Take a day off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He won't.</v>

4073
02:39:12.250 --> 02:39:13.950
<v Speaker 3>He'll blindfold ourselves sometimes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>rural.</v>

4074
02:39:14.210 --> 02:39:16.280
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just uses a maniac.</v>

4075
02:39:16.281 --> 02:39:17.430
<v Speaker 3>He's a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

4076
02:39:17.890 --> 02:39:20.740
<v Speaker 3>he always wants to put himself and make </v>
<v Speaker 3>it harder for them,</v>

4077
02:39:20.741 --> 02:39:23.450
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's little and he's like,</v>

4078
02:39:23.451 --> 02:39:24.210
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so small.</v>

4079
02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:29.240
<v Speaker 3>We can just get them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can't because he's a super </v>

4080
02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:29.240
<v Speaker 3>technical though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's really fun to watch too,</v>

4081
02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:30.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she does a good guy to learn from my bed</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4083
02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:32.870
<v Speaker 3>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like one of the most humble guys.</v>

4084
02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:37.090
<v Speaker 3>He'll see a white belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like do something weird.</v>

4085
02:39:37.110 --> 02:39:37.420
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4086
02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:39.170
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you just do?</v>

4087
02:39:39.171 --> 02:39:40.760
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a move,</v>

4088
02:39:40.761 --> 02:39:42.290
<v Speaker 3>but at the bears then it'd be better </v>
<v Speaker 3>with like,</v>

4089
02:39:42.470 --> 02:39:44.530
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't care if he's learned to </v>
<v Speaker 3>brandon.</v>

4090
02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:47.330
<v Speaker 3>We've invented yourself and your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your first day he'll try it.</v>

4091
02:39:47.390 --> 02:39:49.250
<v Speaker 3>He don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has no ego at all.</v>

4092
02:39:49.300 --> 02:39:52.730
<v Speaker 3>That smart guys experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a good attitude man.</v>

4093
02:39:52.731 --> 02:39:57.731
<v Speaker 3>Because you remember there was like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>big resistance to a lot of the </v>

4094
02:39:57.731 --> 02:39:57.731
<v Speaker 3>traditional guys with a lot of new </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

4095
02:39:57.731 --> 02:39:58.550
<v Speaker 3>Was coming along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of guys were saying,</v>

4096
02:39:58.551 --> 02:40:00.470
<v Speaker 3>you don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you need is just straight.</v>

4097
02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:05.700
<v Speaker 3>Great jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was so many new moves and </v>

4098
02:40:05.700 --> 02:40:09.761
<v Speaker 3>people were like dark jokes and all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that people didn't accept for a </v>

4099
02:40:09.761 --> 02:40:09.761
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4101
02:40:10.010 --> 02:40:12.510
<v Speaker 3>You do japanese neck ties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to do japanese neck times.</v>

4102
02:40:13.130 --> 02:40:18.130
<v Speaker 3>It's when you can't get the doors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can't go all the way through and </v>

4103
02:40:18.130 --> 02:40:21.111
<v Speaker 3>get the doors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get it and he's cinch up here and </v>

4104
02:40:21.111 --> 02:40:23.280
<v Speaker 3>you tuck the guy's head into your chest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You roll over them this way and you hook</v>

4105
02:40:23.281 --> 02:40:24.070
<v Speaker 3>a leg and crank.</v>

4106
02:40:24.070 --> 02:40:26.630
<v Speaker 3>It is a nasty neck crack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's obviously not london.</v>

4107
02:40:26.980 --> 02:40:31.180
<v Speaker 3>Bravo's really good at that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>whatever it's called.</v>

4110
02:40:34.351 --> 02:40:37.320
<v Speaker 3>It's a nasty move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of completing the doors,</v>

4111
02:40:37.500 --> 02:40:40.170
<v Speaker 3>instead of getting it all the way and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sinking sensation it like this.</v>

4112
02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's hard to get all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4113
02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:43.100
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's an interesting guy at one 70 </v>

4119
02:40:58.970 --> 02:41:00.380
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy that like,</v>

4120
02:41:00.580 --> 02:41:02.630
<v Speaker 3>I never thought he was gonna be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cut that weight.</v>

4121
02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big dude for 170 pounds.</v>

4122
02:41:06.270 --> 02:41:09.380

<v Speaker 3>I couldn't live with Kuwait.</v>

4123
02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:15.020
<v Speaker 3>He apparently was walking around and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like one 85 when he was fighting at one </v>

4124
02:41:15.020 --> 02:41:15.020
<v Speaker 3>85 or was.</v>

4125
02:41:15.020 --> 02:41:17.160
<v Speaker 3>He looks so big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never seen him personally,</v>

4126
02:41:17.161 --> 02:41:19.180
<v Speaker 3>but he looks huge while he's muscular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

4127
02:41:19.230 --> 02:41:22.260
<v Speaker 3>But apparently he never really cut much </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight at all and fought at one 85.</v>

4128
02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:24.090
<v Speaker 3>That dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4129
02:41:24.091 --> 02:41:29.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people to talk about him from </v>

4130
02:41:29.091 --> 02:41:31.090
<v Speaker 3>the time when he was coming up and enter</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the ufc about how fucking good he </v>

4131
02:41:32.101 --> 02:41:37.101
<v Speaker 3>was before he got into the ufc back when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was fighting in strikeforce or buy </v>

4132
02:41:37.101 --> 02:41:39.720
<v Speaker 3>back even before then that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was always sparring with like big,</v>

4133
02:41:39.721 --> 02:41:42.950
<v Speaker 3>big heavy guys though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he would spar with shane carwyn and</v>

4134
02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:48.000
<v Speaker 3>they came up at the same gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he'd be in there guy fighting at one </v>

4135
02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.090
<v Speaker 3>70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one 85 flight and shane fucking car when</v>

4136
02:41:49.091 --> 02:41:52.590
<v Speaker 3>it to 65 and they'd be going to war with</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other on a regular basis.</v>

4137
02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:54.430
<v Speaker 3>I've been a fight like the waterways.</v>

4138
02:41:54.450 --> 02:41:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4139
02:41:56.200 --> 02:41:58.610
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get hit by a car when everyday and not</v>

4140
02:41:58.870 --> 02:42:03.450
<v Speaker 3>that they mean he's also taking those </v>
<v Speaker 3>shots and like a guys who know him think</v>

4141
02:42:03.451 --> 02:42:06.660
<v Speaker 3>that probably contributed to his demise </v>
<v Speaker 3>all chin.</v>

4142
02:42:06.830 --> 02:42:07.970
<v Speaker 3>He was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4143
02:42:08.010 --> 02:42:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Because you know those dudes that trevor</v>
<v Speaker 3>whitman's dudes,</v>

4144
02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:12.410
<v Speaker 3>you can't spar with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big guys.</v>

4145
02:42:12.810 --> 02:42:14.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean like unless they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really controlled.</v>

4146
02:42:15.270 --> 02:42:16.260
<v Speaker 3>But even like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4147
02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:21.960
<v Speaker 3>I was probably like ray sefo and like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of guys that could towards that </v>

4148
02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:23.250
<v Speaker 3>are big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're going soft.</v>

4149
02:42:23.251 --> 02:42:24.840
<v Speaker 3>But even though I'm going soft dude it </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>

4150
02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:26.580
<v Speaker 3>they hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

4151
02:42:26.820 --> 02:42:31.320
<v Speaker 3>They checked your kik for knees or even </v>
<v Speaker 3>like needs like that wire they kick.</v>

4152
02:42:31.321 --> 02:42:33.270
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even even,</v>

4153
02:42:33.330 --> 02:42:37.960
<v Speaker 3>even a soft heavyweight keeps you in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>leg soft and it lands that weight.</v>

4154
02:42:38.010 --> 02:42:40.800
<v Speaker 3>It's still heavy and it still hurt your </v>
<v Speaker 3>leg more than any wall to where ever,</v>

4155
02:42:40.801 --> 02:42:43.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stay away from the heavyweights unless</v>

4156
02:42:43.381 --> 02:42:44.430
<v Speaker 3>they're super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super controlled.</v>

4157
02:42:44.670 --> 02:42:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's smart.</v>

4158
02:42:45.690 --> 02:42:50.690
<v Speaker 3>That's how it all you guys get back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Injuries to rolling with heavy weights </v>

4159
02:42:50.690 --> 02:42:51.570
<v Speaker 3>to get twisted up and gets sprawled on </v>
<v Speaker 3>rehab.</v>

4160
02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:56.600
<v Speaker 3>One time I fucking shot on gabriel.</v>

4163
02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:06.720
<v Speaker 3>onto the scale when gonzaga is different</v>
<v Speaker 3>than anybody else in the ufc.</v>

4164
02:43:06.721 --> 02:43:11.721
<v Speaker 3>When he gets on the platform,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like the weight of just his.</v>

4165
02:43:13.090 --> 02:43:14.980
<v Speaker 3>He's like dense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like stone,</v>

4166
02:43:14.981 --> 02:43:18.730
<v Speaker 3>like he's mad stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's a dude that trains all the time</v>

<v Speaker 3>guys out there.</v>

4169
02:43:22.660 --> 02:43:24.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We didn't even like you didn't do shit </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

4212
02:45:01.090 --> 02:45:06.090
<v Speaker 3>Not much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He definitely didn't look like the same </v>

4213
02:45:06.090 --> 02:45:06.090
<v Speaker 3>cro cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He never did ever say,</v>

4214
02:45:06.090 --> 02:45:07.090
<v Speaker 3>but it could just be that it was the end</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the run.</v>

4215
02:45:07.091 --> 02:45:07.960
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys,</v>

4216
02:45:07.961 --> 02:45:10.120
<v Speaker 3>just they can only keep it up for so </v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

4217
02:45:10.630 --> 02:45:13.330
<v Speaker 3>Like you want to keep it up for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4218
02:45:13.331 --> 02:45:14.260
<v Speaker 3>he was a great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

4219
02:45:14.261 --> 02:45:19.261
<v Speaker 3>great fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he won the pried open wait grand </v>

4220
02:45:19.261 --> 02:45:21.331
<v Speaker 3>prix man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a motherfucker back then when he </v>

4221
02:45:21.331 --> 02:45:23.221
<v Speaker 3>knocked out vandelay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cro cop that knocked out vandelay </v>

4222
02:45:23.221 --> 02:45:24.130
<v Speaker 3>was one of the baddest motherfuckers </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever because he had like,</v>

4223
02:45:24.370 --> 02:45:29.370
<v Speaker 3>he first fought vandelay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know shit about the ground </v>

4224
02:45:29.370 --> 02:45:30.250
<v Speaker 3>game and they had like a weird first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first fight was like weird rules,</v>

4225
02:45:30.251 --> 02:45:33.910
<v Speaker 3>like they only go to the ground for like</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 seconds or something like tide family</v>

4226
02:45:33.911 --> 02:45:38.911
<v Speaker 3>up and hang out with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hang on but wouldn't even be standing </v>

4227
02:45:38.911 --> 02:45:38.911
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

4228
02:45:38.911 --> 02:45:42.150
<v Speaker 3>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't free to uncork shots because </v>

4229
02:45:42.150 --> 02:45:42.150
<v Speaker 3>he was still worried about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling.</v>

4230
02:45:42.150 --> 02:45:45.130
<v Speaker 3>But the second fight he had his take </v>
<v Speaker 3>down defense down.</v>

4231
02:45:45.131 --> 02:45:48.520
<v Speaker 3>He had a good spa at the end and he lit </v>
<v Speaker 3>vandelay up like a christmas tree.</v>

4232
02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:51.790
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best performances of his career.</v>

4233
02:45:51.791 --> 02:45:54.490
<v Speaker 3>It's the second fight with vandelay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah man,</v>

4234
02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:56.080
<v Speaker 3>who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean every fighter,</v>

4235
02:45:56.610 --> 02:45:59.020
<v Speaker 3>they got a window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a window of time where you could</v>

4236
02:45:59.021 --> 02:46:00.730
<v Speaker 3>perform at that level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4237
02:46:00.731 --> 02:46:03.070
<v Speaker 3>and when you're 37,</v>
<v Speaker 3>38,</v>

4238
02:46:03.100 --> 02:46:08.100
<v Speaker 3>39,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just slowly winding down and then </v>

4239
02:46:08.100 --> 02:46:09.410
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not much left after that.</v>

4240
02:46:09.940 --> 02:46:10.030
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

4241
02:46:10.030 --> 02:46:15.030
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys that did perform at that </v>

4242
02:46:15.030 --> 02:46:16.020
<v Speaker 1>super high level was vandelay and pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about that.</v>

4243
02:46:16.170 --> 02:46:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Vandelay was never the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vandelay</v>

4244
02:46:17.870 --> 02:46:19.370
<v Speaker 4>no was easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

4245
02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:20.160
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was still.</v>

4246
02:46:20.270 --> 02:46:24.100
<v Speaker 4>He was still pretty good though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty good pride.</v>

4247
02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:24.740
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy.</v>

4248
02:46:25.210 --> 02:46:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was dominant and pride.</v>

4249
02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:28.930
<v Speaker 1>that's the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still wild in the ufc.</v>

4250
02:46:28.931 --> 02:46:30.340
<v Speaker 1>like he's still beat kyung lee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4251
02:46:30.430 --> 02:46:32.700
<v Speaker 1>But then he gets knocked out by leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you knoW,</v>

4252
02:46:32.710 --> 02:46:35.140
<v Speaker 1>it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up.</v>

4253
02:46:35.260 --> 02:46:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Each tried to go to war with leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't stay in the pocket believe </v>

4254
02:46:40.260 --> 02:46:40.560
<v Speaker 1>because he can take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave and can take it any.</v>

4255
02:46:40.660 --> 02:46:44.710
<v Speaker 1>The motherfucker hits hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris [inaudible] left hand is a,</v>

4256
02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:49.720
<v Speaker 1>a battering ram and motherfuckers got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real hard lefthand is a matter of him </v>

4257
02:46:49.720 --> 02:46:51.060
<v Speaker 1>being able to hit you like uriah hall </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

4258
02:46:51.061 --> 02:46:53.410
<v Speaker 1>He just couldn't catch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hall hall was just too good,</v>

4259
02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:55.330
<v Speaker 1>but vandelay went chin to chin with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

4260
02:46:55.780 --> 02:46:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theY're the same style.</v>

4261
02:46:56.651 --> 02:46:58.130
<v Speaker 1>That why is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4262
02:46:58.580 --> 02:47:03.580
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like vandelay is still like the brian </v>

4263
02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:06.781
<v Speaker 1>stann fight was a great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still capable of putting on great </v>

4264
02:47:06.781 --> 02:47:10.291
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the same vandelays the </v>

4265
02:47:10.291 --> 02:47:10.291
<v Speaker 1>vandelia beat like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4266
02:47:10.291 --> 02:47:15.270
<v Speaker 1>or like I'm quinten jackson or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vandelay that beat sakuraba or the </v>

4267
02:47:15.270 --> 02:47:19.351
<v Speaker 1>vandelay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beat henderson the first fight and </v>

4268
02:47:19.351 --> 02:47:19.351
<v Speaker 1>he was a destroyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a scary fucker.</v>

4269
02:47:19.351 --> 02:47:24.310
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it might've been a little bit help </v>

4270
02:47:24.310 --> 02:47:24.310
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might have heard a little bit.</v>

4271
02:47:24.310 --> 02:47:24.900
<v Speaker 4>They had to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all know they do,</v>

4272
02:47:24.901 --> 02:47:28.410
<v Speaker 4>but I know they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like what happened?</v>

4273
02:47:28.411 --> 02:47:30.090
<v Speaker 4>What I think happens is that some </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters,</v>

4274
02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:35.160
<v Speaker 4>if your first fight is on juice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you mentally are dependent on it.</v>

4275
02:47:35.410 --> 02:47:40.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the guys that can't perform </v>

4276
02:47:40.410 --> 02:47:42.000
<v Speaker 4>without are those ones that they always </v>
<v Speaker 4>had it,</v>

4277
02:47:42.390 --> 02:47:45.530
<v Speaker 4>but I think the guys that fight a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>times without it and then having,</v>

4278
02:47:45.531 --> 02:47:47.370
<v Speaker 4>having and then have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can do either way.</v>

4279
02:47:47.371 --> 02:47:52.371
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some guys that they've done it from day </v>

4280
02:47:52.371 --> 02:47:52.371
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they rely on the juice.</v>

4281
02:47:52.371 --> 02:47:52.371
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

4282
02:47:52.371 --> 02:47:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only have a couple minutes left,</v>

4283
02:47:53.231 --> 02:47:58.231
<v Speaker 1>but I want to ask you one thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is like the hot topic now </v>

4284
02:47:58.231 --> 02:48:01.171
<v Speaker 1>in mma is testosterone replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys that are like 29 years old </v>

4285
02:48:01.171 --> 02:48:06.031
<v Speaker 1>and replacing that testosterone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real issue now because </v>

4286
02:48:06.031 --> 02:48:06.820
<v Speaker 1>vittorio is going to fight chris </v>
<v Speaker 1>weidman,</v>

4287
02:48:06.890 --> 02:48:11.890
<v Speaker 1>they're going to fight in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States and they're going to fight in </v>

4288
02:48:11.890 --> 02:48:14.251
<v Speaker 1>vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really hard place to get a </v>

4289
02:48:14.251 --> 02:48:16.291
<v Speaker 1>testosterone exemption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you tested positive for </v>

4290
02:48:16.291 --> 02:48:17.290
<v Speaker 1>juice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which tour has in the past,</v>

4291
02:48:17.530 --> 02:48:20.920
<v Speaker 1>so he might not get a testosterone use </v>
<v Speaker 1>exemption,</v>

4292
02:48:20.921 --> 02:48:25.921
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking crazy because he's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting at this insane level for the </v>

4293
02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:27.550
<v Speaker 1>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bisping fight.</v>

4294
02:48:27.610 --> 02:48:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Luke rockhold fight the last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan henderson fight me.</v>

4295
02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:35.200
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a fucking demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean The new veto on testosterone </v>

4296
02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:39.001
<v Speaker 1>replacement looks like a fucking demon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is gonna happen to him if he </v>

4297
02:48:39.001 --> 02:48:39.700
<v Speaker 1>asked to get off of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight weinman.</v>

4298
02:48:39.830 --> 02:48:44.830
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing with testosterone and </v>

4299
02:48:44.830 --> 02:48:46.900
<v Speaker 4>steroids is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so say that guy abused it when he was </v>

4300
02:48:46.900 --> 02:48:49.581
<v Speaker 4>young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which be to probably dig back in the </v>

4301
02:48:49.581 --> 02:48:51.710
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think for sure too long when you're </v>

4302
02:48:51.710 --> 02:48:51.710
<v Speaker 4>young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well guess what?</v>

4303
02:48:51.710 --> 02:48:52.530
<v Speaker 4>You never came off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He never fucking did a right.</v>

4304
02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:54.660
<v Speaker 4>Your balls turn off and they'll turn </v>
<v Speaker 4>back on.</v>

4305
02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:58.860
<v Speaker 4>So now he may be young but his balls </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't work.</v>

4306
02:48:59.010 --> 02:49:01.800
<v Speaker 4>So he now he needs this therapy for </v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

4307
02:49:01.801 --> 02:49:03.810
<v Speaker 4>really does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you don't let them have it,</v>

4308
02:49:04.050 --> 02:49:06.840
<v Speaker 4>you're hurting him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the same time other guys,</v>

4309
02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:07.950
<v Speaker 4>maybe they just</v>

4310
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:13.040
<v Speaker 3>do because they want to juice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then they get a bullshit doctor to </v>

4311
02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:13.040
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

4312
02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:13.040
<v Speaker 3>you're a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me,</v>

4313
02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:13.140
<v Speaker 3>give me this prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4314
02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:15.470
<v Speaker 3>so it's a fucked up thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know like,</v>

4315
02:49:16.010 --> 02:49:18.250
<v Speaker 3>but in the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if a doctor prescribes it,</v>

4316
02:49:18.500 --> 02:49:19.920
<v Speaker 3>dr has a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is supposed to have.</v>

4317
02:49:19.921 --> 02:49:21.990
<v Speaker 3>The last rule was a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

4318
02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:24.540
<v Speaker 3>doctors are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4319
02:49:24.541 --> 02:49:27.660
<v Speaker 3>they're supposed to be infallible and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like honest and stuff and you know,</v>

4320
02:49:27.661 --> 02:49:30.720
<v Speaker 3>we all know that no one is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some guys need a man because some of</v>

4321
02:49:30.721 --> 02:49:35.721
<v Speaker 3>the guys that they abuse steroids and </v>
<v Speaker 3>are younger and now they have to have </v>

4322
02:49:35.721 --> 02:49:35.721
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4323
02:49:35.721 --> 02:49:37.620
<v Speaker 3>But their argument is that those guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be allowed to fight because in</v>

4324
02:49:37.621 --> 02:49:42.621
<v Speaker 3>doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your natural hormone levels drop during </v>

4325
02:49:42.621 --> 02:49:43.260
<v Speaker 3>training camp because you train hard and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you breaking down your body.</v>

4326
02:49:43.410 --> 02:49:45.120
<v Speaker 3>It's natural for your hormone levels to </v>
<v Speaker 3>drop.</v>

4327
02:49:45.120 --> 02:49:50.120
<v Speaker 3>But these guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their hormone levels are not dropping </v>

4328
02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:50.120
<v Speaker 3>because they're keeping them at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consistent level.</v>

4329
02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:53.160
<v Speaker 3>If they have to take twice the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>an unnatural testosterone in order to do</v>

4330
02:49:53.161 --> 02:49:54.630
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still doing that.</v>

4331
02:49:54.750 --> 02:49:57.570
<v Speaker 3>And so they have an unfair advantage and</v>
<v Speaker 3>training camp by taking that.</v>

4332
02:49:57.600 --> 02:50:00.960
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's a good argument man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good argument.</v>

4333
02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:04.860
<v Speaker 3>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think every sport juices period,</v>

4334
02:50:05.730 --> 02:50:08.100
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them do every sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4335
02:50:08.101 --> 02:50:10.280
<v Speaker 3>and not every guy there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably every sport dude's juicing</v>

4336
02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:10.940
<v Speaker 3>football,</v>
<v Speaker 3>baseball.</v>

4337
02:50:10.941 --> 02:50:15.941
<v Speaker 3>He give a shit what works exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people are always going to try to </v>

4338
02:50:15.941 --> 02:50:16.620
<v Speaker 3>find a way to juice and cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know what I mean?</v>

4339
02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:20.340
<v Speaker 3>It's just a fascinating situation when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got veto who's streaking,</v>

4340
02:50:20.550 --> 02:50:25.550
<v Speaker 3>who's looked better than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now he's going to have to fight </v>

4341
02:50:25.550 --> 02:50:28.071
<v Speaker 3>weidman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might not get a testosterone use </v>

4342
02:50:28.071 --> 02:50:28.071
<v Speaker 3>exemption.</v>

4343
02:50:28.071 --> 02:50:28.110
<v Speaker 3>Kids real weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4344
02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:29.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a.</v>

4345
02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:32.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't say yes.</v>

4346
02:50:32.371 --> 02:50:33.720
<v Speaker 3>The one that probably didn't know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>next fight.</v>

4347
02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:35.730
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's not fair either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got to say.</v>

4348
02:50:35.731 --> 02:50:37.110
<v Speaker 3>All right man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're on the sheet,</v>

4349
02:50:37.111 --> 02:50:38.430
<v Speaker 3>you guys can't fight no more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4350
02:50:38.431 --> 02:50:41.030
<v Speaker 3>he's only been fighting in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the craziest way.</v>

4351
02:50:41.270 --> 02:50:42.810
<v Speaker 3>It's been fighting in Brazil for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last.</v>

4352
02:50:42.811 --> 02:50:43.800
<v Speaker 3>Like in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

4353
02:50:43.810 --> 02:50:48.810
<v Speaker 3>They'll let him fight on pcp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will get a new pcp prescription for </v>

4354
02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:50.250
<v Speaker 3>vito.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4355
02:50:50.290 --> 02:50:51.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a.</v>

4356
02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:53.850
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking hero over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

4357
02:50:53.851 --> 02:50:56.040
<v Speaker 3>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a tough subject then.</v>

4358
02:50:56.160 --> 02:50:59.100
<v Speaker 3>It is a tough subject because I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to see him at this level,</v>

4359
02:50:59.101 --> 02:51:00.450
<v Speaker 3>the level that he fought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan henderson.</v>

4360
02:51:00.451 --> 02:51:05.451
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see him fight weidman </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it might very well be that the only </v>

4361
02:51:05.451 --> 02:51:05.670
<v Speaker 3>way he could reach that level is on trt.</v>

4362
02:51:05.670 --> 02:51:07.950
<v Speaker 3>So I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to stop testing.</v>

4363
02:51:07.970 --> 02:51:09.860
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you take lexapro,</v>

4364
02:51:10.410 --> 02:51:12.030
<v Speaker 3>take lexapro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'd take lexapro.</v>

4365
02:51:12.031 --> 02:51:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Why you fighting all throughout your </v>
<v Speaker 3>camp?</v>

4366
02:51:13.860 --> 02:51:18.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well now if they said that there's an </v>

4367
02:51:18.860 --> 02:51:19.290
<v Speaker 3>advantage that you don't get anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 3>where everybody else is freaking out and</v>

4368
02:51:19.291 --> 02:51:20.940
<v Speaker 3>they all get anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think,</v>

4369
02:51:21.010 --> 02:51:24.230
<v Speaker 3>do you think there's anything to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4370
02:51:24.750 --> 02:51:27.050
<v Speaker 3>I still get anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean everyone before the fights.</v>

4371
02:51:27.070 --> 02:51:27.890
<v Speaker 3>Nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4372
02:51:27.900 --> 02:51:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Because you want control your nerves in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some way.</v>

4373
02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:33.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well here's the thing,</v>

4374
02:51:33.690 --> 02:51:37.720
<v Speaker 3>I still get nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but before I was way more interesting,</v>

4375
02:51:37.740 --> 02:51:39.400
<v Speaker 3>I should have been because I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>

4376
02:51:39.540 --> 02:51:43.680
<v Speaker 3>I have anxiety and panic attacks so it </v>
<v Speaker 3>manages my nervousness to where I should</v>

4377
02:51:43.681 --> 02:51:48.681
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a normal nervous instead of a </v>

4378
02:51:48.681 --> 02:51:50.231
<v Speaker 3>retarded nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean by not back there </v>

4379
02:51:50.231 --> 02:51:50.231
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like totally like,</v>

4380
02:51:50.231 --> 02:51:51.990
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still nervous like any other fight,</v>

4381
02:51:51.991 --> 02:51:54.780
<v Speaker 3>but not like I was before my medication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4382
02:51:54.781 --> 02:51:56.610
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make you tailspin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4383
02:51:56.970 --> 02:51:59.330
<v Speaker 3>But in saying tHat most of fighting is </v>
<v Speaker 3>mental,</v>

4384
02:51:59.340 --> 02:52:04.340
<v Speaker 3>big part of it is mental.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that an advantage to take </v>

4385
02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:04.340
<v Speaker 3>something like that?</v>

4386
02:52:06.130 --> 02:52:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

4387
02:52:09.130 --> 02:52:10.930
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I said that they said I can't take it</v>

4388
02:52:10.931 --> 02:52:15.931
<v Speaker 3>no more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was thought it would fit with me </v>

4389
02:52:15.931 --> 02:52:15.931
<v Speaker 3>because I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been relying on it,</v>

4390
02:52:15.931 --> 02:52:16.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4391
02:52:17.180 --> 02:52:18.460
<v Speaker 3>I would not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not for fighting.</v>

4392
02:52:18.461 --> 02:52:20.410
<v Speaker 3>I rely on it for life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

4393
02:52:20.411 --> 02:52:22.870
<v Speaker 3>So it would fit me a lot for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

4394
02:52:22.871 --> 02:52:23.350
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4395
02:52:24.090 --> 02:52:26.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure what it would do too.</v>

4396
02:52:26.110 --> 02:52:27.580
<v Speaker 3>If you're a normal person and he took </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

4397
02:52:27.940 --> 02:52:30.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure how it would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it would affect you,</v>

4398
02:52:30.191 --> 02:52:35.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it would help you </v>

4399
02:52:35.191 --> 02:52:35.191
<v Speaker 3>nervous before the fight or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

4400
02:52:35.191 --> 02:52:35.191
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how that would work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

4401
02:52:35.191 --> 02:52:38.580
<v Speaker 3>because it's an interesting argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>because on one hand I want you to take </v>

4402
02:52:38.580 --> 02:52:40.620
<v Speaker 3>it because I think that if it benefits </v>
<v Speaker 3>you as a person and is a,</v>

4403
02:52:40.630 --> 02:52:45.630
<v Speaker 3>is a drug that someone invented that has</v>
<v Speaker 3>a positive effect on your life and it </v>

4404
02:52:45.630 --> 02:52:46.840
<v Speaker 3>makes your life better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then of course you should be on it.</v>

4405
02:52:47.100 --> 02:52:52.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good thing for some if something </v>

4406
02:52:52.100 --> 02:52:54.541
<v Speaker 3>comes along and gives you less anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you feel good and you're still </v>

4407
02:52:54.541 --> 02:52:54.541
<v Speaker 3>living a healthy life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good thing.</v>

4408
02:52:54.541 --> 02:52:57.280
<v Speaker 3>That's a positive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when it comes to performance,</v>

4409
02:52:57.281 --> 02:52:59.620
<v Speaker 3>like there's certain things like I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

4410
02:52:59.630 --> 02:53:00.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like adderall,</v>

4411
02:53:00.641 --> 02:53:05.641
<v Speaker 3>like fighters aren't allowed to fight on</v>
<v Speaker 3>adderall and some guys have </v>

4412
02:53:05.641 --> 02:53:05.641
<v Speaker 3>prescriptions for adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4413
02:53:05.641 --> 02:53:06.470
<v Speaker 3>But adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adderall is just speed.</v>

4414
02:53:06.610 --> 02:53:11.610
<v Speaker 3>The speed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at the generic it was sold </v>

4415
02:53:11.610 --> 02:53:11.610
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for add guys,</v>

4416
02:53:11.610 --> 02:53:13.930
<v Speaker 3>is there any benefit to it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it actually help them?</v>

4417
02:53:14.120 --> 02:53:16.150
<v Speaker 3>And it helps you study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Add,</v>

4418
02:53:16.520 --> 02:53:19.390
<v Speaker 3>say you add real bad and you just can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrate your spouse.</v>

4419
02:53:19.420 --> 02:53:21.730
<v Speaker 3>You can't read the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will help you study,</v>

4420
02:53:22.060 --> 02:53:24.190
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But dudes,</v>

4421
02:53:24.230 --> 02:53:26.320
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking have a prescription for </v>
<v Speaker 3>adderall that aren't in school,</v>

4422
02:53:26.321 --> 02:53:27.010
<v Speaker 3>are full of shit.</v>

4423
02:53:27.650 --> 02:53:28.450
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4424
02:53:28.790 --> 02:53:31.540
<v Speaker 3>it is not a real doctor will tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not a real fucking thing.</v>

4425
02:53:31.541 --> 02:53:32.320
<v Speaker 3>It's speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

4426
02:53:32.910 --> 02:53:35.960
<v Speaker 3>It giving you energy and you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy because of what happened.</v>

4427
02:53:36.020 --> 02:53:41.020
<v Speaker 3>So like guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that have adult prescriptions </v>

4428
02:53:41.020 --> 02:53:41.440
<v Speaker 3>that did fight mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because they do the train the train</v>

4429
02:53:41.441 --> 02:53:46.441
<v Speaker 3>harder than you're fucking jacked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler invented or does not just affect </v>

4430
02:53:46.441 --> 02:53:50.500
<v Speaker 3>to meth or to make their soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 3>marched better and longer and unless </v>

4431
02:53:50.500 --> 02:53:53.230
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if You could be hopped up on that all</v>

4432
02:53:53.230 --> 02:53:54.010
<v Speaker 3>day long and train,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4433
02:53:54.011 --> 02:53:54.910
<v Speaker 3>it'd probably be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4434
02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:56.060
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4435
02:53:56.070 --> 02:53:59.410
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting man.</v>
