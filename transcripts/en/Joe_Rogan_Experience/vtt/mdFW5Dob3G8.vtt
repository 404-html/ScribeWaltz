00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Try by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing to see someone have that.</v>

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's a,</v>

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>there's an amazing like confidence that you have to have a or like,</v>

5
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:11.904
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>at least you have to get yourself to that place.</v>

7
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>And it took like,</v>

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>compete in MMA like you said,</v>

10
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>without looking at the side of the road.</v>

11
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>And when you see that broken,</v>

12
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I saw that,</v>

13
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>that Ellen interview with Rhonda Rousey,</v>

15
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>That was so crazy to me.</v>

17
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>That really made me go like maybe she shouldn't fight for a little while.</v>

18
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I dunno,</v>

19
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.981
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

20
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>she needs some more time off because this,</v>

21
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>she went from being the like,</v>

22
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kill everyone.</v>

23
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 1>No one has a right to beat me.</v>

24
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:35.701
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a B,</v>

25
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:36.481
<v Speaker 1>nothing bitch.</v>

26
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>And being that chick to being like a,</v>

27
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to kill myself.</v>

28
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I got to just have Travis Brown's babies and I was like,</v>

29
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

30
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>she's gone from being this like untouchable.</v>

31
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

32
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>not even like she was like the best female fighter.</v>

33
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:50.731
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

34
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>don't even,</v>

35
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>she's wrecking chicks in a second and then to seeing her kind of broken,</v>

36
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.721
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

37
00:00:55.721 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting is these themed play themselves out over and over again.</v>

38
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>And the traps are all there,</v>

39
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>but everybody keeps going for the candy and they keep getting caught in the</v>

40
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:06.324
<v Speaker 1>traps.</v>

41
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>The traps of Hollywood are always there for any superstar athlete,</v>

42
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>especially fighters.</v>

43
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:12.331
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

44
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>we've seen it all throughout history with Tommy Morrison gets in the rocky movie</v>

45
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden everybody's looking at him like Tommy Marson is going to be</v>

46
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>the white hub.</v>

47
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>And then Ray Mercer beats the living fuck out of them.</v>

48
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 1>And you just saw like fear and overwhelming anxiety attack him.</v>

49
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's in this movie and he's on the red carpet and everybody's saying,</v>

50
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be the champ one day.</v>

51
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:31.391
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

52
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:31.651
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

53
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:32.484
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

54
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>And then it becomes this whole thing.</v>

55
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>He's hanging with Sylvester Stallone.</v>

56
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>They're probably doing blow and bang and hookers and allegedly allegedly.</v>

57
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.301
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I mean?</v>

58
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like it becomes this Hollywood trap.</v>

59
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>And Rhonda was a g and still is a giant superstar,</v>

60
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

61
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.690
<v Speaker 1>She's this undefeated women's fighter.</v>

62
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>She's crushing all the competition.</v>

63
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>She looks like a destroyer.</v>

64
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>And then the fucking traps this,</v>

65
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>all these movies started coming out,</v>

66
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 1>all this,</v>

67
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>all these deals start getting made.</v>

68
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Books start getting written.</v>

69
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>All these television shows and all this stuff and all the traps and all those</v>

70
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>traps,</v>

71
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>they keep your focus.</v>

72
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 1>They take steal little bits of your focus.</v>

73
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm good enough to get by without all that focus.</v>

74
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>But there's no way,</v>

75
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>because there's another person like you out there,</v>

76
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

77
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people like you out there and they don't have those traps.</v>

78
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>And if they don't have those traps are going to have more attention that's being</v>

79
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:20.641
<v Speaker 1>paid right away.</v>

80
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>They had an advantage because they have their full focused on this.</v>

81
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.780
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also something dangerous to someone like Ron Torres.</v>

82
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>But by the way,</v>

83
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's just incredible.</v>

84
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:28.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

85
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>she's the reason why women's MMA is a huge thing.</v>

86
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.303
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

87
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's something dangerous about being such an amazing grappler,</v>

88
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>getting a couple knockouts and all of a sudden feeling this kind of like,</v>

89
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

90
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>she got the knee to a McMahon and stops it with one knee.</v>

92
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 1>And then what was the other chick who she,</v>

93
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>she hit the overhand who face planted Alexis Davis.</v>

94
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.470
<v Speaker 1>And so now it's kind of going in there and even going in there with like a world</v>

96
00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>

97
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>a boxer,</v>

98
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>like a Holly Holm,</v>

99
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>she kind of goes in there with like,</v>

100
00:02:57.781 --> 00:02:57.901
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

101
00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I can knock people out.</v>

102
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a dangerous,</v>

103
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:01.661
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

105
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.770
<v Speaker 1>you know what is a dangerous combination being a blue belt and you chuck got a</v>

106
00:03:04.771 --> 00:03:06.750
<v Speaker 1>bunch of white belts and you think you're the shit,</v>

107
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.720
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden you're rolling with Damien Maia and he wraps you up</v>

108
00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:10.970
<v Speaker 1>like a Christmas present.</v>

109
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Beats the fuck out of you and chokes you.</v>

110
00:03:12.621 --> 00:03:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Unconscious Z,</v>

111
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

112
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

113
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.560
<v Speaker 1>there's levels of everything.</v>

114
00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:21.210
<v Speaker 1>And to deny those levels because anybody who looked at her fights would see</v>

115
00:03:21.211 --> 00:03:21.391
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

116
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:21.601
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

117
00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:23.490
<v Speaker 1>you have this Rhonda Rousey.</v>

118
00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:28.491
<v Speaker 1>This fierce competitor was one of the best judo examples of judo.</v>

119
00:03:28.651 --> 00:03:29.760
<v Speaker 1>We've ever seen an MMA.</v>

120
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean her judo spectacular reason why she was a medalist in the Olympics.</v>

121
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

122
00:03:34.171 --> 00:03:35.930
<v Speaker 1>she's a sensational competitor.</v>

123
00:03:35.931 --> 00:03:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Her grappling is outstanding.</v>

124
00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Her arm bar technique is amongst the best in the world,</v>

125
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.450
<v Speaker 1>but she's knocking out these girls there.</v>

126
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.230
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

127
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>they're nowhere near Worldclass as far as like kickboxing is striking is</v>

128
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:48.271
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

129
00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

130
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Holly Holm is 100% worldclass.</v>

131
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.940
<v Speaker 1>She is an 18 time world boxing champion.</v>

132
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

133
00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:55.650
<v Speaker 1>she's a kickboxing champion.</v>

134
00:03:55.651 --> 00:04:00.651
<v Speaker 1>She was in a an MMA competitor for a couple of years before she got into the UFC</v>

135
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.440
<v Speaker 1>where she was having these ridiculous head kick.</v>

136
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:05.274
<v Speaker 1>Kaos yeah,</v>

137
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.080
<v Speaker 1>she's a beast and for her to think that she's going to treat this woman,</v>

138
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.340
<v Speaker 1>this Holly Holm woman,</v>

139
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.090
<v Speaker 1>the same way she was able to bully like Batchko Heyah and I say Billy,</v>

140
00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:15.721
<v Speaker 1>not in a negative way.</v>

141
00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean just just attacker and go after [inaudible] hey,</v>

142
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

143
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.130
<v Speaker 1>she's slow and awkward and not that athletic.</v>

144
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Holly Holm bounces around that cage like a fucking kangaroo.</v>

145
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.150
<v Speaker 1>She does all these back flips and shit.</v>

147
00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:30.000
<v Speaker 1>She's spectacular.</v>

148
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:33.720
<v Speaker 1>The athletic and the idea that you're going to have the same approach they used</v>

149
00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>on Batchko go,</v>

150
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.860
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

151
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.880
<v Speaker 1>with someone like Holly Holm,</v>

152
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:36.960
<v Speaker 1>that's just madness.</v>

153
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that happens when people get so absorbed with this idea</v>

154
00:04:40.261 --> 00:04:41.160
<v Speaker 1>that they're special.</v>

155
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.720
<v Speaker 1>So absorbed with this idea that,</v>

156
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:43.950
<v Speaker 1>when you're on top,</v>

158
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.500
<v Speaker 1>you think you are the fucking person.</v>

159
00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:47.101
<v Speaker 1>You're the woman,</v>

160
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:47.880
<v Speaker 1>you're the man,</v>

161
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.780
<v Speaker 1>you're the shit.</v>

162
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to fuck with you.</v>

163
00:04:49.981 --> 00:04:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm just wandering through this bitch.</v>

164
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

165
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.760
<v Speaker 1>And then you get cracked and then you realize,</v>

166
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.061
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

167
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:55.830
<v Speaker 1>this game doesn't give a fuck.</v>

168
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.140
<v Speaker 1>This game doesn't give a fuck about your charisma.</v>

169
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.330
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't give a fuck about the Vegas odds.</v>

170
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't give a fuck about how much money you made or how many times you've</v>

171
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:05.220
<v Speaker 1>been on entourage.</v>

172
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>That's the amazing,</v>

173
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing thing about MMA.</v>

174
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 1>It's why I have so much respect for everybody who competes.</v>

175
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:15.210
<v Speaker 1>But it's like no one can escape this game's wrath.</v>

176
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

177
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean like John Jones still has a lot of his career to go and he does,</v>

178
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 1>he has one loss on his record,</v>

179
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:21.160
<v Speaker 1>but it was not dominant,</v>

180
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

182
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

183
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.381
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

184
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:24.191
<v Speaker 1>you see these guys,</v>

185
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:27.160
<v Speaker 1>like you see Anderson Silva and he's just like,</v>

186
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:27.761
<v Speaker 1>he's a Ninja.</v>

187
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:28.421
<v Speaker 1>He's untouchable.</v>

188
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:29.290
<v Speaker 1>He's the greatest fighter ever.</v>

189
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>And then you see him like crying on the ground with a shattered,</v>

190
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.311
<v Speaker 1>not shattered,</v>

191
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:33.701
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

192
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 1>When he broke his shin.</v>

193
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:36.011
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

194
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:39.040
<v Speaker 1>how about when cried in the ground after he won against Nick Diaz?</v>

195
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 1>He fell to the ground cried ever.</v>

196
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.981
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

197
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:42.814
<v Speaker 1>Nick Dsi just,</v>

198
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty awesome.</v>

199
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

200
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.030
<v Speaker 1>the Diaz brothers are just the greatest fighters of all time.</v>

201
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.923
<v Speaker 1>They certainly are.</v>

202
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

203
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:48.191
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

204
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:48.760
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

205
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

206
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 1>from going full circle then when he comes back and wins in the octagon.</v>

207
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.811
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

208
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:52.961
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

209
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:53.560
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

210
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredible thing.</v>

211
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.241
<v Speaker 1>It makes you look,</v>

212
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:55.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

213
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>when watching chuck owl who I just,</v>

214
00:05:58.011 --> 00:05:58.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:05:58.281 --> 00:05:59.091
<v Speaker 1>at a certain point you were like,</v>

216
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>that guy's just unbeatable.</v>

217
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:01.390
<v Speaker 1>He's like Superman.</v>

218
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 1>And then to see him get knocked out and kind of his chin,</v>

219
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

220
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.103
<v Speaker 1>slowly start to go,</v>

221
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

222
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.323
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

223
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.971
<v Speaker 1>it's like this,</v>

224
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>this game,</v>

225
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.180
<v Speaker 1>this game doesn't give a fuck,</v>

226
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 1>doesn't give a fuck about your opinions.</v>

227
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't give a fuck about what you think when knuckles hit Chin's legs go limp.</v>

228
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's just how it goes.</v>

229
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>And we saw that in the Rockhold Bisping fight,</v>

230
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Rockhold had this look about him that almost like he was bored,</v>

232
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:24.763
<v Speaker 1>that he was just like,</v>

233
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.281
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go.</v>

234
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

235
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>part of that I'm sure as gamesmanship,</v>

236
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to get inside Bisping's head that he's so much better than him,</v>

237
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't even have to be serious and be concerned.</v>

238
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 1>And then Bisbing clips him with his left hook over the shoulder where he's</v>

239
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 1>barely seen it.</v>

240
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

241
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.771
<v Speaker 1>you called it,</v>

242
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:41.330
<v Speaker 1>it was a great cause what you said,</v>

243
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>like a few beats before that we were like,</v>

244
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Luke Rockhold keeping his chin right on up in the air and he's kind of like a</v>

245
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>little lacks of days ago.</v>

246
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

247
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:47.901
<v Speaker 1>I remember you,</v>

248
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

249
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.651
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

250
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:49.484
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

251
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.890
<v Speaker 1>in the Hennen Borow Dillashaw fight.</v>

252
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 1>The first one was like a huge upset.</v>

253
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.920
<v Speaker 1>No one saw that coming.</v>

254
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

255
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 1>and I remember you,</v>

256
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>you sang as it was,</v>

257
00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

258
00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

259
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Dillashaw is really light on his feet too much.</v>

260
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I was really relaxed.</v>

261
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes you could just see a little thing in the way they're moving.</v>

262
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:06.171
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

263
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:06.351
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

264
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of interesting.</v>

265
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.820

<v Speaker 1>it's like one of those days,</v>

291
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.810
<v Speaker 1>it's called a live at Webster hall.</v>

292
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:41.270
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a fucking incredible special look for that.</v>

293
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Jay is like one of the funniest comedians on the planet.</v>

294
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.713
<v Speaker 1>Very funny.</v>

295
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Louis J.</v>

296
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Gomez is just one of the funniest people I've ever met in my life.</v>

297
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:49.671
<v Speaker 1>He's a great comedian.</v>

298
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>He's like bigger than a standup comedian.</v>

299
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 1>He's like the Bert Kreischer of the east coast.</v>

300
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>He's just a hilarious person.</v>

301
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

302
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>but so he's doing a show with Michael Bisbing.</v>

303
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 1>They do a show called the countdown on Sirius Radio and he started doing the</v>

304
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

305
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is before Bisbing has the Anderson Silva fight and it did almost</v>

306
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:08.290
<v Speaker 1>seem kind of like Brisbane was a great fighter,</v>

307
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.140
<v Speaker 1>a big name,</v>

308
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 1>but seemed like he was kind of going toward the end of his career.</v>

309
00:08:12.111 --> 00:08:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Like it had a couple injuries,</v>

310
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 1>had the eye thing and you're kinda like,</v>

311
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.740
<v Speaker 1>oh he was,</v>

312
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.790
<v Speaker 1>he was a contender.</v>

313
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Well explain the,</v>

314
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.051
<v Speaker 1>I think cause the,</v>

315
00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 1>I think is pretty bad.</v>

316
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

317
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:22.790
<v Speaker 1>You probably know better than he has a detached retina and he has oil in his</v>

318
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:23.624
<v Speaker 1>eye.</v>

319
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.020
<v Speaker 1>They had to inject oil into where his,</v>

320
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I sit so that his retina won't tear again.</v>

321
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 1>So he has one eye that looks almost like cross side and it's kind of black like</v>

322
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>is like he's on ecstasy,</v>

323
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:37.490
<v Speaker 1>like one pupils dilated.</v>

324
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.510
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird and he doesn't give a fuck.</v>

325
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 1>He's got that one I fucked up and he doesn't give a shit.</v>

326
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.470
<v Speaker 1>He's still going in there and soloing and then is born for this.</v>

327
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

328
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.770
<v Speaker 1>this mother fucker went out and fought Anderson Silva won one of the gutsiest</v>

329
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 1>performances I've ever,</v>

330
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.363
<v Speaker 1>and I mean he,</v>

331
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:56.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

332
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 1>the first two rounds that he beat Anderson were just incredible.</v>

333
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 1>And then the fact that he got almost put out in the third round and came back</v>

334
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 1>and won the fourth round and it was a fucked up for him because he was trying to</v>

335
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 1>say that his mouthpiece was out and he tried to circle to,</v>

336
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who the referee was.</v>

337
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:12.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it was herb.</v>

338
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.943
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

340
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.641
<v Speaker 1>but Herb's like,</v>

341
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

342
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.541
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

343
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to,</v>

344
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.951
<v Speaker 1>I'm not stopping that.</v>

345
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:17.161
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

346
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 1>you can't call when to stop the action.</v>

347
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Cause you could say that the mouthpieces out or you could just spit your</v>

348
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:23.150
<v Speaker 1>mouthpiece that whenever someone's,</v>

349
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:23.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

350
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>like landed a big show,</v>

351
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.120
<v Speaker 1>people do time and people do do that.</v>

352
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.051
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

353
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:28.561
<v Speaker 1>herb was like,</v>

354
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:28.711
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

355
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:31.260
<v Speaker 1>you can't say to me that your mouthpiece out,</v>

356
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I know your mouth pieces out but you've got to keep fighting.</v>

357
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Then boom,</v>

358
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Anderson lands off flying me on the jot and then Anderson walks away with his</v>

359
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>hands up.</v>

360
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy as if he won so crazy.</v>

361
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Herb didn't call the fight yet.</v>

362
00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:43.290
<v Speaker 1>So then the bell rings.</v>

363
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.900
<v Speaker 1>So then Bisping has to get up and recover in a minute from getting k Oud.</v>

364
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 1>It was madness.</v>

365
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.340
<v Speaker 1>He got a little bit of extra time because Anderson Silva celebrated.</v>

366
00:09:53.341 --> 00:09:53.671
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

367
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:55.800
<v Speaker 1>So I think he got like an extra 30 seconds or so.</v>

368
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

369
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.271
<v Speaker 1>but then right.</v>

370
00:09:57.271 --> 00:09:57.391
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

371
00:09:57.391 --> 00:09:58.224
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

372
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 1>that's got to fuck Anderson up to cause Anderson's,</v>

373
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:01.980
<v Speaker 1>now I've got this like adrenaline dump and then he's,</v>

374
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:02.880
<v Speaker 1>and then you saw on his face,</v>

375
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:03.121
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

376
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

377
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:03.871
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

378
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:04.870
<v Speaker 1>we're back to fighting it.</v>

379
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.330
<v Speaker 1>But Bisbing man,</v>

380
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:07.320
<v Speaker 1>that fourth round,</v>

381
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.510
<v Speaker 1>he just bit down on his mouthpiece and walked him down.</v>

382
00:10:10.511 --> 00:10:10.950
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

383
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:11.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was incredible.</v>

384
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

385
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 1>And then after that being the greatest ever to come and,</v>

386
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:16.351
<v Speaker 1>and you get on a,</v>

387
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:17.250
<v Speaker 1>on an injury,</v>

388
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.130
<v Speaker 1>you get a title shot with 10 days' notice.</v>

389
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.630
<v Speaker 1>He fights the greatest ever.</v>

390
00:10:21.631 --> 00:10:21.901
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

391
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:25.200
<v Speaker 1>arguably Anderson's on the downslide but definitely,</v>

392
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.190
<v Speaker 1>let's not say arguably,</v>

393
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean losing twice to Weidman and it just didn't look the same when he fought</v>

394
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz suspended for steroids,</v>

395
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:34.620
<v Speaker 1>comes back and you know,</v>

396
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.630
<v Speaker 1>but he's still Anderson Silva.</v>

397
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.300
<v Speaker 1>So that victory gets that victory over the greatest of all time.</v>

398
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 1>And then first round knockout over Luke Rockhold,</v>

399
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

400
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:42.271
<v Speaker 1>it's fucked up.</v>

401
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:42.660
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

402
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I was literally considering saying that Luke Rockhold looks overconfident and</v>

403
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 1>when you're overconfident you can get knocked out.</v>

404
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.021
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

405
00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:49.854
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be a deck.</v>

406
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 1>And then boom,</v>

407
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:52.014
<v Speaker 1>he gets knocked out.</v>

408
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.840
<v Speaker 1>But you did make the comment about him holding a,</v>

409
00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 1>about him not having his head right there on the center line of sort of relaxed.</v>

410
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.120
<v Speaker 1>It was super relaxed with his chin straight up.</v>

411
00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:02.400
<v Speaker 1>He was pulling out of things with his chin straight up.</v>

412
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:04.050
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like there was no danger.</v>

413
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

414
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.900
<v Speaker 1>And that was one of the things that he was saying that,</v>

415
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:07.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

416
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:08.400
<v Speaker 1>he was in no danger.</v>

417
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.700
<v Speaker 1>And it was also one of the same things that your Riaa Faber was saying.</v>

418
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Like the difference between me and cruises,</v>

419
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I can hurt him,</v>

420
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:15.390
<v Speaker 1>I can take him out.</v>

421
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.520
<v Speaker 1>And then when you see your riot got caught,</v>

422
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.570
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a second round,</v>

423
00:11:18.571 --> 00:11:20.940
<v Speaker 1>he got dropped and you realize he's in deep trouble.</v>

424
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.661
<v Speaker 1>Like you realize,</v>

425
00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

426
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I can get knocked out too.</v>

427
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.730
<v Speaker 1>And all those guys in,</v>

428
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:25.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

429
00:11:25.981 --> 00:11:26.111
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

430
00:11:26.111 --> 00:11:26.790
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

431
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.750
<v Speaker 1>it's funny when you get it,</v>

432
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:28.950
<v Speaker 1>like Michael Bisman is a guy who,</v>

433
00:11:28.951 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 1>the knock on him,</v>

434
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I guess was that he didn't have knockout power or whatever.</v>

435
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:36.540
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about like a a 200 I mean fighting at two oh five I got it cuts</v>

436
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>down probably,</v>

437
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:37.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

438
00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:41.790
<v Speaker 1>one 85 so probably something someone who weighs close to 200 pounds.</v>

439
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a 200 pound guy who specializes in,</v>

440
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.301
<v Speaker 1>in striking.</v>

441
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

442
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean he can fucking knock you out of course.</v>

443
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.260
<v Speaker 1>And he proved it.</v>

444
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.040
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't,</v>

445
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.690
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't fight like a,</v>

446
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 1>like a brawler like he fights like a technician and when you fight like a</v>

447
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:56.764
<v Speaker 1>technician,</v>

448
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 1>you don't swing wild crazy ass punches with everything on them with your,</v>

449
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

450
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Vandelay Silva style,</v>

451
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

452
00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:06.520
<v Speaker 1>you try to find openings and that's what he did.</v>

453
00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:08.890
<v Speaker 1>He found the opening with that left hook was really sneaky.</v>

454
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.210
<v Speaker 1>He had missed it before.</v>

455
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.230
<v Speaker 1>He was like stepping in and throwing the left took over the shoulder and kind of</v>

456
00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:15.610
<v Speaker 1>like stepping into the punch.</v>

457
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.710
<v Speaker 1>And boy when he caught Luke,</v>

458
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 1>he caught him at the end of the chin,</v>

459
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.790
<v Speaker 1>which really like fucking spins your head.</v>

460
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.010
<v Speaker 1>All the Torque is perfectly placed.</v>

461
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.520
<v Speaker 1>And then he caught him with another brilliant one right afterwards.</v>

462
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Followed up.</v>

463
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

464
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

465
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:28.691
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

466
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:31.360
<v Speaker 1>he's had like all sorts of fucking crazy injuries.</v>

467
00:12:31.361 --> 00:12:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Back injuries,</v>

468
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:34.310
<v Speaker 1>neck injuries is fucking army.</v>

469
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

470
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 1>he's just tough man.</v>

471
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:37.300
<v Speaker 1>He just keeps going.</v>

472
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 1>It just keeps going.</v>

473
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.210
<v Speaker 1>She has no question about that.</v>

474
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:41.710
<v Speaker 1>That dude's as tough as they come in.</v>

475
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:42.181
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

476
00:12:42.181 --> 00:12:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I've never fixed him just because he's one of those guys who's like been around</v>

477
00:12:45.491 --> 00:12:47.410
<v Speaker 1>forever and always kind of been knocking at the door.</v>

478
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.550
<v Speaker 1>So it's nice to see him,</v>

479
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:48.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

480
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:50.950
<v Speaker 1>get his moment was crazy to see.</v>

481
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Well you see like there's knockout power,</v>

482
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:53.051
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

483
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:56.600
<v Speaker 1>And then there's like Dan Henderson kind of knock out power that was just like,</v>

484
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.130
<v Speaker 1>she's fucking cry.</v>

485
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Like 10 Anderson feels like this table when you put your arm on him,</v>

486
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 1>he's not flexing.</v>

487
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.133
<v Speaker 1>He's like the,</v>

488
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.550
<v Speaker 1>like Ryan Parsons,</v>

489
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.420
<v Speaker 1>who's a buddy of mine,</v>

490
00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:08.950
<v Speaker 1>who was his manager for a long time,</v>

491
00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:11.980
<v Speaker 1>said that he would do massage on him and he would be exhausted.</v>

492
00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:12.221
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

493
00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 1>he's would you guys made out of wood?</v>

494
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.880
<v Speaker 1>So like when you look at him,</v>

495
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:16.271
<v Speaker 1>you'll get him,</v>

496
00:13:16.271 --> 00:13:16.421
<v Speaker 1>he go,</v>

497
00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:17.380
<v Speaker 1>well it looks like a,</v>

498
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:17.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

499
00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:19.180
<v Speaker 1>strong athletic guy.</v>

500
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 1>But if you felt him,</v>

501
00:13:20.741 --> 00:13:22.380
<v Speaker 1>you realize where all this power comes from.</v>

502
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.140
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

503
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 1>he's built different,</v>

504
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.680
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on with him and he does.</v>

505
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:28.940
<v Speaker 1>When you were saying people who don't put everything into one punch,</v>

506
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.840
<v Speaker 1>he puts everything into it.</v>

507
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like coming at Ya and it's so weird the way he moves to moves in a</v>

508
00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:37.420
<v Speaker 1>weird way because he's very stiff.</v>

509
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.070
<v Speaker 1>He's not fluid like John Jones or like Anderson is very fluid in his movements.</v>

510
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Dan is like very stiff,</v>

511
00:13:43.751 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 1>but when he uncorked those bombs on you,</v>

512
00:13:46.811 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 1>they just detonate and you're just like,</v>

513
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:50.890
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck hit me?</v>

514
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.361
<v Speaker 1>Like heck.</v>

515
00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:54.790
<v Speaker 1>The lombards never been knocked out to see Hector Lombard get knocked out by,</v>

516
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.380
<v Speaker 1>well he got head kicked.</v>

517
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.830
<v Speaker 1>He's probably stunned by that head kick and then he got blasted with that back</v>

518
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.450
<v Speaker 1>elbow and he was out cold.</v>

519
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.170
<v Speaker 1>He was out cold when he hit the ground and then Henderson blast them again.</v>

520
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.131
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

521
00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

522
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.580
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>

523
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:07.871
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

524
00:14:07.871 --> 00:14:08.920
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck hits?</v>

525
00:14:08.921 --> 00:14:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy is like,</v>

526
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.990
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like you want him to hit you.</v>

527
00:14:11.991 --> 00:14:12.910
<v Speaker 1>It just so he could feel it</v>

528
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:14.891
<v Speaker 1>harder.</v>

529
00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Is that the normal like what it,</v>

530
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:17.440
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

531
00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I want to start by like standing next to a guy who he had hit him real close to</v>

532
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:21.341
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

533
00:14:21.341 --> 00:14:22.174
<v Speaker 1>I want to feel it.</v>

534
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:22.970
<v Speaker 1>His Kale,</v>

535
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.400
<v Speaker 1>if Bisping UFC 100 was one of the most brutal one punch shots and the history of</v>

536
00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:28.240
<v Speaker 1>combat sports,</v>

537
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.660
<v Speaker 1>it was just boom Bisping's dead stiff,</v>

538
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:36.130
<v Speaker 1>and then Henderson's airborne long before the referee can get to them and just</v>

539
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.710
<v Speaker 1>slams him in the face on the way down.</v>

540
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.210
<v Speaker 1>And then from there out,</v>

541
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:45.600
<v Speaker 1>one of his logos was the silhouette of him flying through the air and knocking</v>

542
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:46.443
<v Speaker 1>out Bisping.</v>

543
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:47.840
<v Speaker 1>So imagine being best bang.</v>

544
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Not only do you have to deal with the fact this guy fucking knocked you out in</v>

545
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.920
<v Speaker 1>spectacular fashion,</v>

546
00:14:51.921 --> 00:14:56.921
<v Speaker 1>but his logo is flying to the air,</v>

547
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.780
<v Speaker 1>hitting you after you're already unconscious.</v>

548
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:00.200
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

549
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.033
<v Speaker 1>I would just say,</v>

550
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.121
<v Speaker 1>hang on.</v>

551
00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:06.470
<v Speaker 1>In a few years you'll be champ and you'll have a show with Lewis Jake Omens and</v>

552
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 1>everything will be good.</v>

553
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.160
<v Speaker 1>What year was UFC 100 it's a wild man.</v>

559
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.411
<v Speaker 2>earlier than that,</v>

560
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:18.980
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

561
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.180
<v Speaker 2>What year was that Jamie?</v>

562
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.150

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

575
00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:44.481
<v Speaker 1>that was fucking weird.</v>

576
00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:46.790
<v Speaker 1>It's been a long fucking longer than I would've thought.</v>

577
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

578
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:47.781
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

579
00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:49.520
<v Speaker 1>I guess it is like a hundred UFC is later.</v>

580
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

581
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

582
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.520
<v Speaker 1>So seven years later he wins a title.</v>

583
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:53.893
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

584
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:54.921
<v Speaker 1>You're a look.</v>

585
00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:56.600
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be the same,</v>

586
00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.520
<v Speaker 1>same card on the same card,</v>

587
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:59.181
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

588
00:15:59.181 --> 00:15:59.420
<v Speaker 1>You guys,</v>

589
00:15:59.420 --> 00:15:59.571
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

590
00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:00.800
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna be some ups and downs.</v>

591
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Your retina is going to get all types of fucked up,</v>

592
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.170
<v Speaker 1>but you will be champion one day and no one takes that away from him ever.</v>

593
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine if him and Henderson had a rematch for the title?</v>

594
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>

595
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Can that be made?</v>

596
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that could be made ethically,</v>

597
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.490
<v Speaker 1>because if you look at all the other contenders,</v>

598
00:16:18.491 --> 00:16:19.510
<v Speaker 1>all the people waiting in line,</v>

599
00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:19.781
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>

600
00:16:19.781 --> 00:16:21.140
<v Speaker 1>while you're in Morocco,</v>

601
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Jacques Perrey Vittorio,</v>

602
00:16:23.261 --> 00:16:24.094
<v Speaker 1>there's just too many.</v>

603
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

604
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.541
<v Speaker 1>there's too many,</v>

605
00:16:25.541 --> 00:16:26.330
<v Speaker 1>but two who,</v>

606
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.163
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

607
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:28.090
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

608
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:32.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard sell because Vito or just knocked out Henderson the first round,</v>

609
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.760
<v Speaker 1>you know it's handy.</v>

610
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:35.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

611
00:16:35.171 --> 00:16:39.760
<v Speaker 1>It's just man vitro knocked out Bisbing and Brazil and here knocked out Rockhold</v>

612
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.960
<v Speaker 1>but he just got smashed by Jacques Perrey.</v>

613
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Everything in the middleweight division is just completely up in the air and</v>

614
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.680
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

615
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.520
<v Speaker 1>it's all turned up to that.</v>

616
00:16:48.521 --> 00:16:49.331
<v Speaker 1>So weird in MMA,</v>

617
00:16:49.331 --> 00:16:49.901
<v Speaker 1>will it happen?</v>

618
00:16:49.901 --> 00:16:50.734
<v Speaker 1>Like you're kind of like,</v>

619
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:50.921
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

620
00:16:50.921 --> 00:16:51.221
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

621
00:16:51.221 --> 00:16:52.770
<v Speaker 1>I think I know where everything's sounds,</v>

622
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.340
<v Speaker 1>and then one thing changes and I'm like,</v>

623
00:16:54.341 --> 00:16:54.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

624
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything.</v>

625
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
