<v Speaker 1>Can't hang out.</v>

79
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 1>It seems like nowadays with Instagram,</v>

80
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.240
<v Speaker 1>the way it's set up in Facebook,</v>

81
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.930
<v Speaker 1>you can't fucking talk as much shit as you could like eight years ago.</v>

82
00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.400
<v Speaker 1>On the Internet when it was like,</v>

83
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.190
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

84
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.430
<v Speaker 1>it was cool to have like some stupid screen name,</v>

85
00:02:15.431 --> 00:02:16.360
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

86
00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:19.750
<v Speaker 1>red dog two 83 or something like that and you're just anonymous.</v>

87
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.390
<v Speaker 1>There's still some of that like on the underground,</v>

88
00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:22.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>a lot of anonymous dudes,</v>

90
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:24.710
<v Speaker 1>they're there like secret.</v>

91
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.860
<v Speaker 1>You see there's sort of anonymous,</v>

92
00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is their Ip addresses are known like you.</v>

93
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Not really that it's your only anonymous.</v>

94
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>If someone doesn't look,</v>

95
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.840
<v Speaker 1>no one's anonymous anymore.</v>

96
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.840
<v Speaker 1>If you're posting things,</v>

97
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:35.931
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

98
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:36.850
<v Speaker 1>you might think you are,</v>

99
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 1>but even if you're going behind a couple of proxies,</v>

100
00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:39.931
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

101
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:41.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not hard to find you.</v>

102
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.611
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird world.</v>

103
00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy that was a troll on Reddit's a famous story because he was a</v>

104
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.310
<v Speaker 1>like a real nasty guy.</v>

105
00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they found out where he worked.</v>

106
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.640
<v Speaker 1>These people went after him.</v>

107
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:52.660
<v Speaker 1>They found out where he worked,</v>

108
00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:55.120
<v Speaker 1>they found out who the guy is and they got him fired,</v>

109
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.340
<v Speaker 1>fired from his job because his,</v>

110
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.540
<v Speaker 1>his fun shit.</v>

111
00:02:58.541 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>What he would to do is he,</v>

112
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you looked at it from a psychologic as a psychological point of view,</v>

114
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:04.774
<v Speaker 2>you would say,</v>

115
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.991
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

116
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:09.991
<v Speaker 2>this guy's like all bent up and like held back at work and he has some anger</v>

117
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 2>issues and he gets online and through this anonymous account,</v>

118
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 2>he does a lot of mean shit and it goes after people in the morgue.</v>

119
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

120
00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:18.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

121
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:18.521
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

122
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>

123
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the rest story that shoot up the place.</v>

124
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

125
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean who knows what level of,</v>

126
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 2>so I mean it might not,</v>

127
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 2>that might not be the choice.</v>

128
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.990
<v Speaker 2>It might be just he's an asshole.</v>

129
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 2>But my point is they found this guy,</v>

130
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 2>they found this guy and they got him fired and that's going to,</v>

131
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 2>that's just like what they can do today.</v>

132
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that'd be able to do what happened with a nine year old from getting</v>

133
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 2>bullied at school and on the line committed suicide.</v>

134
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Nine kids fucking Nice.</v>

135
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.630
<v Speaker 2>That is so crazy.</v>

136
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Was smart enough at nine to how to figure out how to hang it.</v>

137
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.883
<v Speaker 2>So you don't want to see,</v>

138
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I should go after those people instead of fucking terrorists.</v>

139
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.481
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

140
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 2>They are terrorist.</v>

141
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean the hormone after some people they,</v>

142
00:03:55.641 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 2>they went after that one kid.</v>

143
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.550
<v Speaker 2>There was a kid who was a roommate in college with a kid who is gay and he knew</v>

144
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:04.301
<v Speaker 2>his friend was gay.</v>

145
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 2>So he set up a camera and filmed his friend having sex with a guy.</v>

146
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if he blackmailed him or said something and the guy wound up</v>

147
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 2>killing himself.</v>

148
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 2>So now he's on trial for,</v>

149
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:15.154
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

150
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they're saying.</v>

151
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Manslaughter may be or new shit.</v>

152
00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Some something,</v>

153
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 2>something awful.</v>

154
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 2>There was a similar case where this girl was,</v>

155
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.553
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

156
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.610
<v Speaker 2>that she knew her friend was like manic depressive,</v>

157
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:28.980
<v Speaker 2>bipolar and she,</v>

158
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 2>and he would reach out to for like help and she was like,</v>

159
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 2>you just need to kill yourself,</v>

160
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.873
<v Speaker 2>kill yourself.</v>

161
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 2>And then they have all this,</v>

162
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 2>the texting history and then she would send them links on how to do it.</v>

163
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 2>And then he finally did it.</v>

164
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 2>And he texted goes,</v>

165
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 2>I think it would do it tomorrow night.</v>

166
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

167
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 2>you're so full of shit.</v>

168
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to do it.</v>

169
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.721
<v Speaker 2>Let me know if you do.</v>

170
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 2>And they end up doing it.</v>

171
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 2>So now she's being charged with it and she's really young.</v>

172
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 2>And here's the problem with that.</v>

173
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 2>When you're real young,</v>

174
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.500
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

175
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 2>they say your brain isn't even really fully formed.</v>

176
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even like your,</v>

177
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts don't come and like the most logical manner until you're like deep</v>

178
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:04.440
<v Speaker 2>into your twenties I think they say your,</v>

179
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 2>your frontal cortex is,</v>

180
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 2>I probably shouldn't be talking at all about like science,</v>

181
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.950
<v Speaker 2>but I think what the term was about,</v>

182
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 2>it was about decision making and impulsive decision making,</v>

183
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 2>particularly in young men experiencing texts.</v>

184
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 2>Testosterone for the first time.</v>

185
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.713
<v Speaker 2>Thinking about this,</v>

186
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 2>think about you're young,</v>

187
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.101
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

188
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.060
<v Speaker 2>You're experiencing testosterone when you're 1314 years old.</v>

189
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 2>So you've got 13 years of confusing life.</v>

190
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.400
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden you got raging boner.</v>

191
00:05:28.401 --> 00:05:29.400
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just get sign.</v>

192
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.640
<v Speaker 2>And you're so baffled because you're so horny all the time.</v>

193
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:33.800
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

194
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.130
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

195
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 2>and sex is everything.</v>

196
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 2>It's [inaudible] TV show,</v>

197
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.370
<v Speaker 2>TV shows and selling cars and it's all over the fucking little boards.</v>

198
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.110
<v Speaker 2>I used to jack up the covers a city,</v>

199
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 2>those fucking girls in the volleyball games.</v>

200
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

201
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 2>And we were talking about that.</v>

202
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about the other day,</v>

203
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 2>like how can they,</v>

204
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 2>they're wearing thongs,</v>

205
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 2>but the point is when you're young,</v>

206
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 2>you do shit.</v>

207
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.650
<v Speaker 2>He might not even understand the consequences of what you're doing.</v>

208
00:05:56.651 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea that this girl knew that this guy was going to kill himself and</v>

209
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 2>that being mean,</v>

210
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 2>it was anything other than for her.</v>

211
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Just a fun game of being mean.</v>

212
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Magnitude of it.</v>

213
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you can really say that they know.</v>

214
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:07.491
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

215
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 2>it's awful that it got done and I'm not exonerating her,</v>

216
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if you could really treat that person.</v>

217
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Should adults and then add in head trauma if they played football or did martial</v>

218
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:17.421
<v Speaker 2>arts.</v>

219
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:18.254
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

220
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

221
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 2>Try playing football since you were six.</v>

222
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Does that you?</v>

223
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>

224
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

225
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 2>keep it together very well.</v>

226
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.041
<v Speaker 2>You'd be surprised.</v>

227
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:26.050
<v Speaker 2>When I leave the students</v>

228
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.670
<v Speaker 2>I get online and you see the new CTE study that they just released as an article</v>

229
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 2>that was out today where they were saying that it is not the amount of</v>

230
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 2>concussions,</v>

231
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 2>it's the amount of time you've been in the head.</v>

232
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 2>So it's subconcussive trauma,</v>

233
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.570
<v Speaker 2>like just jabs to the face that don't even knock you out way,</v>

234
00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 2>way over long periods of time can be worse.</v>

235
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.371
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

236
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 2>here's like I was watching Hbo boxing the other night and a when uh,</v>

237
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Gennady Golovkin fought a Kell Brook Brook,</v>

238
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 2>amazing,</v>

239
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.720
<v Speaker 2>amazing fight for as long as it lasted.</v>

240
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 2>I understand why Brooks corner threw in the towel.</v>

241
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I was bummed out that they did,</v>

242
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:04.390
<v Speaker 2>but he was going to get marked.</v>

243
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Hundred percent was getting Mercked they were smart.</v>

244
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.581
<v Speaker 2>They were smart.</v>

245
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:09.050
<v Speaker 2>But I was upset because I was like,</v>

246
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:09.651
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

247
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:10.281
<v Speaker 2>this is a good fight.</v>

248
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:10.900
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

249
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.050
<v Speaker 2>I Kid Kell Brook is very good.</v>

250
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

251
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 2>point being Bernard Hopkins is doing the commentary and I'm listening to him</v>

252
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.050
<v Speaker 2>doing a commentary and I'm like,</v>

253
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.200
<v Speaker 2>when you see a guy who's that great of a boxer like Bernard Hopkins and has been</v>

254
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 2>involved in boxing like pretty much his whole life and he's almost,</v>

255
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 2>he might be 50 now.</v>

256
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.170
<v Speaker 2>He's right around right before he is 50 and the last time he fought he fought</v>

257
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Kovalev and got boxed up.</v>

258
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.631
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

259
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 2>it was a tough fight to watch cause you're watching really an older Bernard</v>

260
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Hopkins getting hit hard by a murderer.</v>

261
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean Kovalev is so good too in the world.</v>

262
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

263
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 2>But I was listening to him commentary.</v>

264
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 2>When you listen to a guy like that commentate,</v>

265
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:47.721
<v Speaker 2>he like,</v>

266
00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 2>well he talks pretty good now,</v>

267
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.930
<v Speaker 2>but what's it going to be like in 10 years?</v>

268
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 2>You know like when you,</v>

269
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.410
<v Speaker 2>when you hear a guy that talks really well,</v>

270
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:57.020
<v Speaker 2>like deep in his fifties and sixties like George Foreman,</v>

271
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.700
<v Speaker 2>like how did he pull that off?</v>

272
00:07:58.701 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Some guys keep it together though,</v>

273
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:00.824
<v Speaker 2>don't they?</v>

274
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Like Roy Nelson should be drooling out of his mouth and shitting his pants.</v>

275
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:06.783
<v Speaker 2>Just</v>

276
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 2>did a maximal Blanco on maximum Blanco.</v>

277
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Now young have got gay teen,</v>

278
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.020
<v Speaker 2>no son [inaudible] he switched it up.</v>

279
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.210
<v Speaker 2>He has the dark cells.</v>

280
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.193
<v Speaker 2>It's over.</v>

281
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:21.681
<v Speaker 2>He's out,</v>

282
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:22.101

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.301

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Heather referee not knowing he was out right there on the edge.</v>

289
00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Kid.</v>

290
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like Tony Ferguson.</v>

291
00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:30.224
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

292
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Herb.</v>

293
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.750
<v Speaker 2>That's her best of the world.</v>

294
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.403
<v Speaker 2>You know what man,</v>

295
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.160
<v Speaker 2>we is even an opportunity,</v>

296
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:36.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

297
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.310
<v Speaker 2>be and the angle sometimes her,</v>

298
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:38.700
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

299
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.100
<v Speaker 2>I usually give the benefit of the doubt cause he's one of the best and it's not,</v>

300
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.690
<v Speaker 2>I think he is wrong with going out to him and John Out.</v>

301
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I agree with the tap.</v>

302
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 2>It's you're right.</v>

303
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.083
<v Speaker 2>Well it's a fight.</v>

304
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.660
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

305
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I agree too because going out doesn't hurt anybody.</v>

306
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it hurts you.</v>

307
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:51.780
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't do anything bad.</v>

308
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Even if you do lose some brain cells,</v>

309
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:54.431
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing?</v>

310
00:08:54.431 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>And we're trying to brain cells here.</v>

311
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.720
<v Speaker 1>It'd be nice.</v>

312
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't,</v>

313
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 1>that's not what this is about.</v>

314
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:02.190
<v Speaker 1>It's about the guys who are sacrificing their brains for us.</v>

315
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:02.620
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

316
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.453
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>

317
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>I like to think.</v>

318
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.450
<v Speaker 1>I think herb dean and John McCarthy are equal.</v>

319
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 1>I think they're equal at the very top,</v>

320
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I think to the best and that.</v>

321
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:09.744
<v Speaker 1>What cars do you mean?</v>

322
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Numero uno?</v>

323
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Numero Uno.</v>

324
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 1>As far as dealing with them personally,</v>

325
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>when they come in the back and just the way I felt if John McCarthy was in,</v>

326
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.290
<v Speaker 1>was working my fight.</v>

327
00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I felt so much better.</v>

328
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 1>This is a beautiful dark man.</v>

329
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.780
<v Speaker 1>He didn't quite get the guillotine so it just perfectly because as maximum rolls</v>

330
00:09:27.781 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 1>out of the guillotine rolls right into the dark and transition.</v>

331
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:31.501
<v Speaker 1>It was beautiful.</v>

332
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I Bet Chaz is hit that transition a hundred times.</v>

333
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 1>He just tell right away you can sell that this was his shit and his arms are</v>

334
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 1>long and it was in deep and he ain't going nowhere.</v>

335
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.863
<v Speaker 1>He's fresh.</v>

336
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.400
<v Speaker 1>It's over and by the look at the guy's face to defending,</v>

337
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

338
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 1>He should have went.</v>

339
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

340
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 1>he should have grabbed the inside of his thigh immediately when when he put that</v>

341
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

342
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I would like to hear what him and herb were just saying to each other term was</v>

343
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:55.890
<v Speaker 1>asking him a question about how he set that up.</v>

344
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:56.161
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

345
00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:57.870

<v Speaker 1>but he loves it.</v>

349
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Like when he's asking there,</v>

350
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:01.711
<v Speaker 1>he wants to know,</v>

351

352
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:05.490
<v Speaker 1>They both start off cause that's what Maxima always does.</v>

353
00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:10.491
<v Speaker 1>He got a tight perfect look how he set it up for doom though.</v>

354
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Don't get it twisted.</v>

355
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.031
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

356

<v Speaker 1>That was beautiful.</v>

357
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

360
00:10:14.231 --> 00:10:15.064
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at</v>

361
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.270
<v Speaker 1>building chill,</v>

362

<v Speaker 1>How dare your ball so hard.</v>

364
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.290

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a couple of Goldie's over.</v>

368
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I was a girl.</v>

369
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I would be attracted to you just because of that watch.</v>

370
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.961
<v Speaker 1>It's fancy.</v>

371
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:34.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

372
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 1>I would say something about him.</v>

373
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 1>He's all tattooed up.</v>

374
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:38.250
<v Speaker 1>You look scruffy and dangerous.</v>

375
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 1>He's got scar tissue.</v>

376
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Sky's the deal.</v>

377
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:41.761
<v Speaker 1>Closer.</v>

378
00:10:41.761 --> 00:10:43.330
<v Speaker 1>They look at the watch and go Bam.</v>

379
00:10:43.331 --> 00:10:44.164
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

380
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:46.920
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're saying.</v>

381
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of cash patch.</v>

382
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.310
<v Speaker 1>He's still balling in that crazy corvette.</v>

383
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.031
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

384
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:51.270
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

385
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:51.840
<v Speaker 1>not anymore.</v>

386
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.673
<v Speaker 1>When you driving now?</v>

387
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:54.361
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

388
00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:55.260
<v Speaker 1>just a range rover.</v>

389
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Just safe and comfortable motor sports though.</v>

390
00:10:58.511 --> 00:10:59.730
<v Speaker 1>It should be something else coming soon.</v>

391
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.690
<v Speaker 1>What corvette was it?</v>

392
00:11:00.691 --> 00:11:02.360
<v Speaker 1>A Z zero six counterparts.</v>

393
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Never mad at Czi convert to dope.</v>

394
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Dope car man.</v>

395
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

396
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

397
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.240
<v Speaker 1>you know what man?</v>

398
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:09.600
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

399
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.600
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to see how far they've taken performance cars and how far they</v>

400
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:16.680
<v Speaker 1>have left to go cause there's nowhere left to go.</v>

401
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Like those was insane Teslas.</v>

402
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Then when you put them on ludicrous mode and they're zero to 60 in like less</v>

403
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:22.770
<v Speaker 1>than three seconds.</v>

404
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't fuck like the electric does nothing for the very fast.</v>

405
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.341
<v Speaker 1>My Dick Goes,</v>

406
00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

407
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.563
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

408
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:34.550
<v Speaker 1>but you bring up fucking nasty ass split windows sting ray or something like</v>

409
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:35.440
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

410
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.273
<v Speaker 1>Yes sir.</v>

411
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

412
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.920
<v Speaker 1>but what about the environment?</v>

413
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we'll figure it out at least of our worries.</v>

414
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I just can't believe they haven't figured it out yet.</v>

415
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like there's gotta be a way,</v>

416
00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:47.040
<v Speaker 1>like I read something about China.</v>

417
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I might,</v>

418
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know even know if it was a real article,</v>

419
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:54.260
<v Speaker 1>but they had developed a thing that was like a large and it was an air filter.</v>

420
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:55.810
<v Speaker 1>It would,</v>

421
00:11:55.810 --> 00:12:00.100
<v Speaker 1>it actually would pull the pollution out of the city air and they build</v>

422
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:00.934
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

423
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:01.610
<v Speaker 1>a guy,</v>

424
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 1>giant powered filter.</v>

425
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.470
<v Speaker 1>It's all sides of the building.</v>

426
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.191
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>

427
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:07.024
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

428
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.240
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you could completely clean the air,</v>

429
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.110
<v Speaker 1>but then the real trick would be to get it to run on pollution.</v>

430
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.800
<v Speaker 1>If you add a filter that actually use the carbons in the air as it's fuel and</v>

431
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:24.250
<v Speaker 1>then sucked all that shitty air in and pumped out clean air.</v>

432
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.400
<v Speaker 1>There are some smart ass people can for sure work on that.</v>

433
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

434
00:12:27.651 --> 00:12:30.570
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough money in it after the scuffle problem.</v>

435
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 1>The car companies like it floats up after the last podcast we did.</v>

436
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 1>I remember we were leaving the conversation we had,</v>

437
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 1>we got into solar panels.</v>

438
00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

439
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.873
<v Speaker 1>and like I'm,</v>

440
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

441
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm confused as to how they work.</v>

442
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:43.690
<v Speaker 1>You are super confused.</v>

443
00:12:43.691 --> 00:12:44.524
<v Speaker 1>Are there,</v>

444
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:49.000
<v Speaker 1>are there guys out there that have solar panels and they're just completely cut</v>

445
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:52.000
<v Speaker 1>off the grid and they're just using all their energy is from them.</v>

446
00:12:52.001 --> 00:12:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Solar panel hundred percent seems like every time you hear about the solar</v>

447
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:55.570
<v Speaker 1>panels,</v>

448
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.720
<v Speaker 1>the way it works is you sent the energy back to the city.</v>

449
00:12:58.721 --> 00:12:58.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

450
00:12:58.930 --> 00:12:59.080
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

451
00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.221
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

452
00:12:59.221 --> 00:12:59.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

453
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

454
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:00.610
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

455
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Discounted rent.</v>

456
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.573
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>

457
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>

458
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:03.881
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

459
00:13:03.881 --> 00:13:05.020
<v Speaker 1>if you see someone who was like,</v>

460
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend was a house that's in Colorado,</v>

461
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.950
<v Speaker 1>that's completely off the grid,</v>

462
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.000
<v Speaker 1>never been on the grid.</v>

463
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.420
<v Speaker 1>It's all solar panels,</v>

464
00:13:11.421 --> 00:13:12.160
<v Speaker 1>solar panels,</v>

465
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.870
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and solar panels and they have a propane backup in case something goes</v>

466
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:21.140
<v Speaker 1>wrong with the solar system or it goes down that cause it gets so fucking cold,</v>

467
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.510
<v Speaker 1>it gets so cold.</v>

468
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker [inaudible] solar system shuts down.</v>

469
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.641
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

470
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Solar power system.</v>

471
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

472
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:40.933
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

473
00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.830
<v Speaker 1>dead on the report.</v>

474
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:46.760
<v Speaker 1>The fucking earth boiler.</v>

475
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Mars is headed</v>

476
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:56.623
<v Speaker 1>one light.</v>

477
00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.043
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

478
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.230
<v Speaker 1>What they try to do,</v>

479
00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:01.270
<v Speaker 1>and this is what happens most of the time in la,</v>

480
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:04.240
<v Speaker 1>like if you see someone set up a solar power system,</v>

481
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.200
<v Speaker 1>it's tricky because it's not really independent.</v>

482
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 1>You get your power from the sun,</v>

483
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.120
<v Speaker 1>but it pumps right back into the grid.</v>

484
00:14:13.121 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Your Po connected to the grid.</v>

485
00:14:14.561 --> 00:14:15.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm talking about.</v>

486
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:16.720
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be,</v>

487
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.890
<v Speaker 1>it's just cheaper.</v>

488
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

489
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.101
<v Speaker 1>Pushing,</v>

490
00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:22.030
<v Speaker 1>not pushing that they're going,</v>

491
00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:22.630
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

492
00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:23.060
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

493
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like why does the city need,</v>

494
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.000
<v Speaker 1>oh we need some space and we need your roof.</v>

495
00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:28.271
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

496
00:14:28.271 --> 00:14:28.900
<v Speaker 1>just get,</v>

497
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.870
<v Speaker 1>why are they to,</v>

498
00:14:29.871 --> 00:14:32.230
<v Speaker 1>you keep saying you keep saying this and you're wrong about that.</v>

499
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:32.511
<v Speaker 1>You keep,</v>

500
00:14:32.511 --> 00:14:34.050
<v Speaker 1>you keep using that analogy.</v>

501
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:34.811
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

502
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:35.230
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

503
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.160
<v Speaker 1>they don't need the power from these people that have solar power.</v>

504
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Now what it is,</v>

505
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.790
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is they don't want to disconnect from the grid because they</v>

506
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 1>don't want to lose money.</v>

507
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.501
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

508
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:45.670
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard.</v>

509
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.770
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to get off that grid.</v>

510
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.750
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to just get on electricity.</v>

511
00:14:49.751 --> 00:14:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Callins been trying for how many months now?</v>

512
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>He's</v>

513
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.330
<v Speaker 2>been doing it for like four months.</v>

514
00:14:53.331 --> 00:14:54.350
<v Speaker 2>Going back and forth.</v>

515
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:55.184
<v Speaker 2>So what they do,</v>

516
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:56.211
<v Speaker 2>one foot in,</v>

517
00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:56.841
<v Speaker 2>one foot out,</v>

518
00:14:56.841 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be all in.</v>

519
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Well doesn't have a contractor who's doing it.</v>

520
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.980
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you never know.</v>

521
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:04.881
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>

522
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:05.541
<v Speaker 2>He's your friend.</v>

523
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:06.374
<v Speaker 2>You would know.</v>

524
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:06.741
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

525
00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:07.760
<v Speaker 2>I know he's my friend too,</v>

526
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.833
<v Speaker 2>my friend first</v>

527
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:10.960
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

528
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.793
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

529
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.690
<v Speaker 2>You're basically saying I was being sarcastic.</v>

530
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.510
<v Speaker 2>What you're saying is you,</v>

531
00:15:16.511 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking that somehow or the grid needs the power.</v>

532
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.480
<v Speaker 2>That's definitely not what it is.</v>

533
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.790
<v Speaker 2>More expensive.</v>

534
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.420
<v Speaker 2>It's more generative when you just get solar power.</v>

535
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:26.931
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

536
00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:27.950
<v Speaker 2>You don't need this.</v>

537
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Just Massive Bank of batteries.</v>

538
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.940
<v Speaker 2>You don't need a lot of equipment.</v>

539
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:36.620
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of shit when you go completely off the grid so that when you cut</v>

540
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:37.490
<v Speaker 2>your power off,</v>

541
00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 2>you're not connected to anything.</v>

542
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.400
<v Speaker 2>If you cut your solar off,</v>

543
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.240
<v Speaker 2>you're still connected to the regular power grid and you still get regular power</v>

544
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:45.350
<v Speaker 2>if you're solar goes down.</v>

545
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.740
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the advantages that people like about staying connected to the grid.</v>

546
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 2>You say [inaudible] to the other part is you definitely save money and get 100%</v>

547
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.330
<v Speaker 2>you get a taxi,</v>

548
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.070
<v Speaker 2>but you also can,</v>

549
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:55.760
<v Speaker 2>if you don't,</v>

550
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.770
<v Speaker 2>if you make more power than you use,</v>

551
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.890
<v Speaker 2>it actually goes back into the grid and you can get money from it.</v>

552
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

553
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.061
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is,</v>

554
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:03.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like they need it.</v>

555
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.060
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of an incentive.</v>

556
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.970
<v Speaker 2>It's an incentive in a way to stay connected to the grid,</v>

557
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 2>which I think for them is like a survival technique because if everybody in</v>

558
00:16:12.411 --> 00:16:12.951
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>

559
00:16:12.951 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 2>you've got solar and if solar keeps getting better the way everything gets</v>

560
00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:16.100
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

561
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.340
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a soul that's as big as this fucking table and it's going</v>

562
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:21.200
<v Speaker 2>to be able to power j Lo's house.</v>

563
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.950
<v Speaker 2>That'd be so expensive.</v>

564
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.600
<v Speaker 2>It has comments and that's why people bring better and better.</v>

565
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.990
<v Speaker 2>It's just really expensive now,</v>

566
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's battery technology needs to improve.</v>

567
00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:30.471
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of issues.</v>

568
00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Elan Musk is on the ball with that shit.</v>

569
00:16:32.151 --> 00:16:35.300
<v Speaker 2>He's created these batteries that sit on your wall.</v>

570
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.590
<v Speaker 2>It's hanging on the wall and there's much smaller profile than the standard shit</v>

571
00:16:39.591 --> 00:16:40.940
<v Speaker 2>that most people have in their houses.</v>

572
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:41.803
<v Speaker 2>So what does it do?</v>

573
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.231
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

574
00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:42.650
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

575
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.100
<v Speaker 2>they're just large batteries that store the electricity from the solar power</v>

576
00:16:46.101 --> 00:16:46.934
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

577
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.410
<v Speaker 2>You can use them.</v>

578
00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:48.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

579
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.693
<v Speaker 2>And you just need,</v>

580
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:50.621
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

581
00:16:50.621 --> 00:16:51.454
<v Speaker 2>you need whore.</v>

582
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

583
00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.270
<v Speaker 2>The Bat.</v>

584
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

585
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.810
<v Speaker 2>It has to be collected.</v>

586
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like you,</v>

587
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 2>have you ever seen those solar things that you can use to charge your phone?</v>

588
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.183
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty dope.</v>

589
00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.053
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

590
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.160
<v Speaker 2>like a laptop.</v>

591
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.600
<v Speaker 2>Like you open it up and you lay it,</v>

592
00:17:02.601 --> 00:17:06.200
<v Speaker 2>you can just let it sit on a rock and it'll soak up enough energy from the sun</v>

593
00:17:06.201 --> 00:17:06.920
<v Speaker 2>to power your phone.</v>

594
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.753
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day.</v>

595
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:09.800
<v Speaker 2>If my friend who backpack heights,</v>

596
00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:10.610
<v Speaker 2>my friend Adam,</v>

597
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:12.290
<v Speaker 2>he's actually in Montana right now,</v>

598
00:17:12.291 --> 00:17:16.430
<v Speaker 2>he uses that to send these updates from the top of the fucking mountain.</v>

599
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.990
<v Speaker 2>That's what he's using for his power.</v>

600
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:20.090
<v Speaker 2>He's got this solar thing and he'd just unfold.</v>

601
00:17:20.091 --> 00:17:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Makes sense if you do all that shit.</v>

602
00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:22.790
<v Speaker 2>But if you live in La,</v>

603
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:24.740
<v Speaker 2>don't bring that shit out.</v>

604
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Well just charge it in your car.</v>

605
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.130
<v Speaker 2>But if you have a card that's yeah,</v>

606
00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:28.690
<v Speaker 2>that's probably good.</v>

607
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:29.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

608
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.980
<v Speaker 2>but if you're an Uber all the time or something like that,</v>

609
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:35.390
<v Speaker 2>what if you're responsible and can look at that book and thing?</v>

610
00:17:35.391 --> 00:17:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Just charge your cell phone.</v>

611
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

612
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.180
<v Speaker 2>let me just get up it.</v>

613
00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Fucking backpack full of solar panels.</v>

614
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.261
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

615
00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:42.951
<v Speaker 2>it folds up.</v>

616
00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:43.161
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

617
00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:44.480
<v Speaker 2>it folds up in three panels.</v>

618
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.231
<v Speaker 2>Collapse together.</v>

619
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a laptop,</v>

620
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:48.321
<v Speaker 2>iPad.</v>

621
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:49.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that much bigger than you fucking,</v>

622
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.360
<v Speaker 2>I'd a solar panel on the back.</v>

623
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.171
<v Speaker 2>Your goddamn damn phone.</v>

624
00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Just like God ain't going like that.</v>

625
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.470
<v Speaker 2>That's under Lou Fisker,</v>

626
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Flipkart this,</v>

627
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.083
<v Speaker 2>check this out.</v>

628
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Fisker.</v>

629
00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.160
<v Speaker 2>They've got a new one.</v>

630
00:17:59.161 --> 00:17:59.341
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

631
00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:01.880
<v Speaker 2>they blew up and they kind of went out of business or wanted one.</v>

632
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.620
<v Speaker 2>They only think it went well.</v>

633
00:18:04.621 --> 00:18:05.100
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

634
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.360
<v Speaker 2>these apparently won't blow up.</v>

635
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.800
<v Speaker 2>What happened was if you don't know the story,</v>

636
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:09.060
<v Speaker 2>there was a hurricane came,</v>

637
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 2>all the ones around the dock in North Carolina exploded when the water hit them.</v>

638
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I was about to get one too for steel.</v>

639
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.550
<v Speaker 2>So now they have one that has a roof.</v>

640
00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Check it out.</v>

641
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>

642
00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.051
<v Speaker 2>look behind you.</v>

643
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:20.160
<v Speaker 2>That's a Fisker thing.</v>

644
00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Sick.</v>

645
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.130
<v Speaker 2>So the roof on these things is solar powered.</v>

646
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.890
<v Speaker 2>The roof can actually power the car,</v>

647
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.903
<v Speaker 2>allegedly.</v>

648
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.050
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

649
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.441
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

650
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:30.210
<v Speaker 2>in somewhere like la totally makes sense,</v>

651
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:30.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

652
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.830
<v Speaker 2>He just as we have so much sun,</v>

653
00:18:31.831 --> 00:18:32.311
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix,</v>

654
00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:32.820
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

655
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Seattle and Seattle,</v>

656
00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:35.671
<v Speaker 2>you're going to,</v>

657
00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 2>you'll starve to death and parts of the country.</v>

658
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.733
<v Speaker 2>You would think that,</v>

659
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could use it.</v>

660
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.510
<v Speaker 2>There's enough heat to power everything that car.</v>

661
00:18:45.511 --> 00:18:45.961
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

662
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:46.794
<v Speaker 2>what does it say?</v>

663
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.311
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

664
00:18:47.311 --> 00:18:51.870
<v Speaker 2>does it say it will hold the whole car guarantees about a mile and a half a</v>

665
00:18:51.871 --> 00:18:53.190
<v Speaker 2>propulsion per day.</v>

666
00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:58.800
<v Speaker 2>So we're roof feeds the main battery and generates about a mile and a half of</v>

667
00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.101
<v Speaker 2>propulsion per day.</v>

668
00:18:59.101 --> 00:18:59.940
<v Speaker 2>That ain't shit.</v>

669
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:00.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

670
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:02.400
<v Speaker 2>That's a waste of my fucking time.</v>

671
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:03.720
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean</v>

672
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.293
<v Speaker 2>today?</v>

673
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:07.051
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

674
00:19:07.051 --> 00:19:07.431
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

675
00:19:07.431 --> 00:19:08.011
<v Speaker 2>this is that.</v>

676
00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Park your car at the airport for a week and get home on the power of his son and</v>

677
00:19:11.941 --> 00:19:12.460
<v Speaker 2>the son.</v>

678
00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if you live seven miles away,</v>

679
00:19:14.701 --> 00:19:15.331
<v Speaker 2>but God damn,</v>

680
00:19:15.331 --> 00:19:16.710
<v Speaker 2>you're pushing it and god,</v>

681
00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:18.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just pushing us.</v>

682
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

683
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.820
<v Speaker 2>What did you hit traffic and you see that meter going down your turn,</v>

684
00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:21.654
<v Speaker 2>your radio off.</v>

685
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 2>You want that gas can right there.</v>

686
00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:31.731
<v Speaker 2>I had like gas to the old school I the electricity is a is a fascinating future</v>

687
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:33.961
<v Speaker 2>for sure,</v>

688
00:19:33.961 --> 00:19:36.540
<v Speaker 2>but Maine early adopters that you,</v>

689
00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:40.440
<v Speaker 2>you're right now you're not really early adopter like a mid time adopter,</v>

690
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's a pain in the ass.</v>

691
00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:42.510
<v Speaker 2>When I rented one,</v>

692
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.710
<v Speaker 2>they don't last that long.</v>

693
00:19:43.711 --> 00:19:44.041
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

694
00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:48.630
<v Speaker 2>I went to the Improv and back home and it was more than a half of a battery.</v>

695
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.860
<v Speaker 2>They're just not fun either.</v>

696
00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Like I enjoy driving,</v>

697
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.650

698
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Let me sit in traffic.</v>

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.123
<v Speaker 2>The Fisker.</v>

723
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Fisker looks like a Maserati or a Tesla.</v>

724
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.293
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

725
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Finally they look better than a Prius.</v>

726
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

727
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.111
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

728
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:38.130
<v Speaker 2>They've definitely look cool.</v>

729
00:20:38.131 --> 00:20:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Like Brian's that white one.</v>

730
00:20:39.331 --> 00:20:40.950
<v Speaker 2>That looks pretty serious of bummed me out.</v>

731
00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah Chris.</v>

732
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.110
<v Speaker 2>So fuck your day up.</v>

733
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.430
<v Speaker 2>It's transportation though.</v>

734
00:20:44.431 --> 00:20:45.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what it is.</v>

735
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:45.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

736
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference between a vehicle</v>

737
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.430
<v Speaker 1>and like a that corvette that you were driving at zero six convertible.</v>

738
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.980
<v Speaker 1>That thing is just a rollercoaster ride.</v>

739
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.620
<v Speaker 1>It's stressful to drive it to like,</v>

740
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.020
<v Speaker 1>is this kind of stressful to drive it too much power,</v>

741
00:20:59.380 --> 00:20:59.951
<v Speaker 1>too much power.</v>

742
00:20:59.951 --> 00:21:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Like the Ferrari.</v>

743
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I like the friary better but they're about the same like speed wise.</v>

744
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're about as fast.</v>

745
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.060
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell really if I raced one or the other it'd be just as fast.</v>

746
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:11.350
<v Speaker 1>But like the Ferrari,</v>

747
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:12.990
<v Speaker 1>the passengers terrified.</v>

748
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:14.950
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're in total control and the corvette,</v>

749
00:21:14.951 --> 00:21:15.830
<v Speaker 1>you're both fucking tear.</v>

750
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.230
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

751
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 1>you have no control and like the ass and just go.</v>

752
00:21:19.481 --> 00:21:23.740
<v Speaker 1>It's six 50 horsepower and six 50 torque and it's fucking crazy.</v>

753
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Many dodge vipers when they first came out was the first car really?</v>

754
00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:29.010
<v Speaker 1>That was on mass production.</v>

755
00:21:29.011 --> 00:21:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I was a 500 horsepower,</v>

756
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:32.140
<v Speaker 1>500 pounds of Torque and guides.</v>

757
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.360
<v Speaker 1>It was just like crazy eyes off Mr deeds,</v>

758
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:34.631
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

759
00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:37.690
<v Speaker 1>these things are fast and just to run into walls and shit.</v>

760
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.530
<v Speaker 1>They have a new bunch stick to do.</v>

761
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that new viper that they have built just for the race track but</v>

762
00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:45.130
<v Speaker 1>you could drive it around the street.</v>

763
00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.540
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

764
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:47.650
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

765
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 1>It is like the closest thing you can get to a dick on wheels.</v>

766
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I was like a giant space ship date.</v>

767
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh they bring it up right now.</v>

768
00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:56.920
<v Speaker 1>We all get a car guy every hole.</v>

769
00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Pull the,</v>

770
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.181
<v Speaker 1>pull that thing up.</v>

771
00:21:58.181 --> 00:21:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Look at this thing down.</v>

772
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:04.410
<v Speaker 1>The fucking thing is so God damn fast to 12 Donnie fast.</v>

773
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:05.981

<v Speaker 1>I want that 1993 old school,</v>

777
00:22:13.121 --> 00:22:14.890
<v Speaker 1>that 40 g's viper.</v>

778
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.580
<v Speaker 1>They keep taking these things to race tracks and breaking the track record over</v>

779
00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:19.414
<v Speaker 1>and over and over again.</v>

780
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.400
<v Speaker 1>It's just a monstrous car,</v>

781
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.460
<v Speaker 1>but ridiculous to dry UCR.</v>

782
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

783
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

788
00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:32.704
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the other ones.</v>

789
00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.200
<v Speaker 1>12 getting away from B12 12 feet.</v>

796
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.601
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just remember the pro,</v>

798
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:50.260
<v Speaker 1>like the old one.</v>

799
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.820
<v Speaker 1>The Gt just looked like a door.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was just ugly door was goofy.</v>

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.691
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

803
00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:56.524

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:57.403
<v Speaker 1>What's the,</v>

805
00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.760
<v Speaker 1>the Nissan Gtr,</v>

806
00:23:00.761 --> 00:23:02.770
<v Speaker 1>they have one of the fastest cars ever accurate.</v>

807
00:23:02.771 --> 00:23:03.371
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't really have,</v>

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Then sex is,</v>

811
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.850
<v Speaker 1>they'd make a new one,</v>

812
00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:11.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like the old one.</v>

813
00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.880
<v Speaker 1>The old one was like a stick shift.</v>

814
00:23:12.881 --> 00:23:13.661
<v Speaker 1>Light car,</v>

815

<v Speaker 1>The new one is four wheel drive turbo audit.</v>

817
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.793
<v Speaker 1>It's automatic.</v>

818
00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.300

<v Speaker 1>Who gives a fuck what anybody else thinks.</v>

844
00:23:50.001 --> 00:23:51.720
<v Speaker 1>When you show a hundred horsepower or something,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Big Difference.</v>

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad for what I thought when I pulled up and parked outside,</v>

852
00:24:05.331 --> 00:24:05.541

<v Speaker 1>they're trying to have unlimited growth in performance cars.</v>

887
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.790
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get to some weird place where,</v>

888
00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is already,</v>

889
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 1>if you can go and buy one of those z I o six is you could be an 18 year old kid</v>

00:25:11.661 --> 00:25:12.410
<v Speaker 1>it's cheap.</v>

<v Speaker 1>sort of affordable housing dog car cars though.</v>

899
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.660
<v Speaker 1>It seems like every year the zero to 60 gets a B.</v>

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1020
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:21.870
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing when you think that someone should can give you a car when you're</v>

1021
00:28:21.871 --> 00:28:22.770
<v Speaker 1>17 years old,</v>

1022
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.633
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

1023
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:24.690

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1025

1026
00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:29.420
<v Speaker 1>but I was so stupid.</v>

1027
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I was so dumb.</v>

1028
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I was so dumb and completely reckless.</v>

1029
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:39.260
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that someone just gave me a 2000 pound plus thing with an engine</v>

1030
00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:42.040
<v Speaker 1>and not smash ball.</v>

1054
00:29:18.181 --> 00:29:20.070
<v Speaker 1>And you gotta be kind of fresh to pull it off.</v>

1055
00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.830
<v Speaker 1>It all depends on where your opponent's hands are.</v>

1056
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Generally guys,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was a escrip.</v>

1064
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like this instead of just don't have to be fully closed.</v>

1065
00:29:38.491 --> 00:29:38.881
<v Speaker 1>What you say.</v>

1066
00:29:38.881 --> 00:29:40.920
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be fully close to actually go all the way up to the,</v>

1067
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 1>and he's wrapping</v>

1070
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:49.504
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1071
00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to sleep with that shit?</v>

1072
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.380
<v Speaker 3>It works well.</v>

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:56.951
<v Speaker 3>he's got to pull.</v>

1078

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:01.600
<v Speaker 3>This guy's going to keep throwing punches at him.</v>

1080
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:03.640
<v Speaker 3>You got a block isn't he's going to go out?</v>

1081
00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1082
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.650
<v Speaker 3>That shit is terrible.</v>

1083
00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:09.383
<v Speaker 3>He's in trouble.</v>

1086
00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:14.790
<v Speaker 3>He's about to test ride.</v>

1087
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:15.511
<v Speaker 3>This guy is tough.</v>

1088
00:30:15.511 --> 00:30:16.040
<v Speaker 3>It's tough arc,</v>

1089
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.220
<v Speaker 3>but as some good he's adjusting.</v>

1090
00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

1091
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:19.481
<v Speaker 3>he lost it.</v>

1092
00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:20.020
<v Speaker 3>He lost it.</v>

1093
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.853
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1096
00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:23.854
<v Speaker 3>it really is.</v>

1097
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 3>But he doesn't have it anymore.</v>

1098
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1099
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:26.500
<v Speaker 3>He's out.</v>

1100
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.850
<v Speaker 3>Can I help him with the shoulder?</v>

1101
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.680
<v Speaker 3>The cage is helping them to,</v>

1102
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:30.603
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

1103
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:32.463
<v Speaker 3>Endurance.</v>

1104
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:33.910
<v Speaker 3>So much of a factor.</v>

1105
00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:34.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1106
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm starting to listen to nick curse on shilling.</v>

1107
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:37.401
<v Speaker 3>I know you.</v>

1108
00:30:37.401 --> 00:30:38.320
<v Speaker 3>You're training with him.</v>

1109
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.011
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

1110
00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:40.300
<v Speaker 3>I listened to him more and more.</v>

1111
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.250
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that he said that I was like,</v>

1112
00:30:42.251 --> 00:30:42.491
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1113
00:30:42.491 --> 00:30:44.020
<v Speaker 3>that's such a controversial thing to say.</v>

1114
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:44.591
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1115
00:30:44.591 --> 00:30:47.470
<v Speaker 3>when you're in camp for a fight you should be doing all strength and</v>

1116
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:48.190
<v Speaker 3>conditioning.</v>

1117
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.431
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1118
00:30:48.431 --> 00:30:49.300
<v Speaker 3>you already know how to fight.</v>

1119
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:50.141
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1120
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:53.410
<v Speaker 3>you should be literally concentrating almost entirely on your gas tank.</v>

1121
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.161
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1122
00:30:54.161 --> 00:30:54.994
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1123
00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.690
<v Speaker 3>Like think about that like skill work up until fight camp,</v>

1124
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.010
<v Speaker 3>preparing for fight camp.</v>

1125
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.080
<v Speaker 3>How long has your mass of strength and conditioning,</v>

1126
00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:05.180
<v Speaker 3>how long would the Kashi in his book shut that too.</v>

1127
00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:05.830
<v Speaker 3>And I never,</v>

1128
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.000
<v Speaker 3>I never understood it really.</v>

1129
00:31:07.001 --> 00:31:08.020
<v Speaker 3>It was like God,</v>

1130
00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Jill is the most important.</v>

1131
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>

1132
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.280
<v Speaker 3>How's your car car Joe Carter?</v>

1133
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:12.143
<v Speaker 3>Joe?</v>

1134
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:14.730
<v Speaker 3>I think it makes sense.</v>

1135
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:15.810
<v Speaker 3>Depends what level yet.</v>

1136
00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:16.300
<v Speaker 3>If you're,</v>

1137
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:19.790
<v Speaker 3>if your cm punk ahead and just kind of mix everything that was,</v>

1138
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:20.350
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

1139
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:21.460
<v Speaker 3>that didn't matter.</v>

1140
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:22.420
<v Speaker 3>That didn't matter.</v>

1141
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:24.040
<v Speaker 3>You know this same from experiencing,</v>

1142
00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:24.670
<v Speaker 3>cause he doesn't have,</v>

1143
00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:24.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1144
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:25.480
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1145
00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:25.940
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

1146
00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.480
<v Speaker 3>if you're a Joe Schilling if,</v>

1147
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:27.851
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1148
00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 3>But if you're a Joe Schilling,</v>

1149
00:31:28.961 --> 00:31:32.860
<v Speaker 3>you have worldclass striking and you're in a striking contest for sure.</v>

1150
00:31:32.861 --> 00:31:33.581
<v Speaker 3>Getting shaped,</v>

1151
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:36.700
<v Speaker 3>cause you're not gonna learn how to throw a jab or a right high kick any better.</v>

1152
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.750
<v Speaker 3>It's just repetitions,</v>

1153
00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:37.931
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1154
00:31:37.931 --> 00:31:38.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1155
00:31:38.121 --> 00:31:42.130
<v Speaker 3>So your cardio and strength condition makes sense if you're a young guy,</v>

1156
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:43.220
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1157
00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.340
<v Speaker 3>I disagree.</v>

1158
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Well I just think that that's is,</v>

1159
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:48.491
<v Speaker 3>it's accurate,</v>

1160
00:31:48.491 --> 00:31:49.420
<v Speaker 3>but it's like he's uh,</v>

1161
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.053
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1162
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.680
<v Speaker 3>you should do nothing but work on your Jujitsu.</v>

1163
00:31:53.681 --> 00:31:55.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say you should do anything to work on.</v>

1164
00:31:55.211 --> 00:31:57.520
<v Speaker 3>Your fucking striking coach is going to work.</v>

1165
00:31:57.521 --> 00:31:57.700
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1166
00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.010
<v Speaker 3>cause you're boxing coach to go in and say you need to work on your skill,</v>

1167
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.320
<v Speaker 3>your strength conditioning coach is going to say the same thing.</v>

1168
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.220
<v Speaker 3>And the truth is you guys work on everything all the time.</v>

1169
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:10.360
<v Speaker 3>It's all the [inaudible] because,</v>

1170
00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:10.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1171
00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.770
<v Speaker 3>But here's the other thought,</v>

1172
00:32:11.771 --> 00:32:12.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1173
00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.440
<v Speaker 3>When you see a guy like Damien Maia,</v>

1174
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:19.630
<v Speaker 3>it like it's a one trick pony with one fucking amazing trick.</v>

1175
00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.130
<v Speaker 3>His standup is pretty good,</v>

1176
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1177
00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.450
<v Speaker 3>that's also why he's comparing for sure.</v>

1178
00:32:25.451 --> 00:32:26.690
<v Speaker 3>But it's just the wonder blood.</v>

1179
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:26.951
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>

1180
00:32:26.951 --> 00:32:28.840
<v Speaker 3>but his game is very,</v>

1181
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.710
<v Speaker 3>it's very obvious what he's gonna do.</v>

1182
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.760
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's not like he's mixing up things you don't know he's going to high kick</v>

1183
00:32:33.761 --> 00:32:34.121
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1184
00:32:34.121 --> 00:32:39.121
<v Speaker 3>Or for a while there he was trying to kick ass and then he changed his whole,</v>

1185
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.450
<v Speaker 1>he changed the whole,</v>

1186
00:32:41.451 --> 00:32:41.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1187
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1188
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.350
<v Speaker 1>same thing with the soccer Robert towards the end of his career.</v>

1189
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.160
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1190
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.840
<v Speaker 1>his strategy was always like,</v>

1191
00:32:47.841 --> 00:32:50.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to like stand with dudes and but maybe,</v>

1192
00:32:50.761 --> 00:32:51.500
<v Speaker 1>maybe take them down.</v>

1193
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Then at the end of soccer,</v>

1194
00:32:52.411 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 1>rob his career,</v>

1195
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:53.691
<v Speaker 1>he decided,</v>

1196
00:32:53.691 --> 00:32:54.500
<v Speaker 1>holy Shit,</v>

1197
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I'd better take dudes down and choked them out because I've been knocked out way</v>

1198
00:32:58.401 --> 00:32:59.060
<v Speaker 1>too many times.</v>

1199
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.190
<v Speaker 1>But we had mine did that too.</v>

1200
00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:01.700
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1201
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.121
<v Speaker 1>but if it,</v>

1202
00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:04.460
<v Speaker 1>but if my fights one Wonderboy,</v>

1203
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.050
<v Speaker 1>he's sure it's fucking orchestra.</v>

1204
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.910
<v Speaker 1>There's what we know that game plants from both guys team got better at his</v>

1205
00:33:10.911 --> 00:33:11.744
<v Speaker 1>ground game.</v>

1206
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean he got better at is overall mixed martial arts came once a standup got</v>

1207
00:33:14.811 --> 00:33:16.480
<v Speaker 1>good enough where it wasn't nervous about it anymore.</v>

1208
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Like if you watch him fight,</v>

1209
00:33:17.451 --> 00:33:21.200
<v Speaker 1>his timing is excellent and his standup defense is very good because he's,</v>

1210
00:33:21.201 --> 00:33:21.400
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1211
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.150
<v Speaker 1>he's knowledge of when he's in trouble,</v>

1212
00:33:23.151 --> 00:33:23.890
<v Speaker 1>when he's not thinking,</v>

1213
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:24.711
<v Speaker 1>he knows who he is.</v>

1214
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

1215
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:29.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big part of winning in that part of that dusty,</v>

1216
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1217
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.430
<v Speaker 1>wanting to be a kickboxer for a few fights.</v>

1218
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.930
<v Speaker 1>That attitude,</v>

1219
00:33:32.931 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I think you needed to go through that.</v>

1220
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.600
<v Speaker 1>He needed to get through the,</v>

1221
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.340
<v Speaker 1>because every Jujitsu guys,</v>

1222
00:33:37.341 --> 00:33:41.420
<v Speaker 1>biggest fear standing with someone in the octagon and having the whole world</v>

1223
00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:42.770
<v Speaker 1>watched you get knocked out.</v>

1224
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Then they got,</v>

1225
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1226
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:47.070
<v Speaker 1>generally it takes a while to get to that.</v>

1227
00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:49.250
<v Speaker 1>That's where he's going to pass.</v>

1228
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1229
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:50.290
<v Speaker 1>but he's a mountain.</v>

1230
00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Look at them hanging onto it.</v>

1231
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:53.091
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1232
00:33:53.091 --> 00:33:53.924
<v Speaker 1>That's tight.</v>

1233
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 1>But it looks pretty God damn tight.</v>

1234
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.113
<v Speaker 1>He's all right.</v>

1235
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:02.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1236
00:34:02.361 --> 00:34:03.590
<v Speaker 1>He could have got that stop right there.</v>

1237
00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:04.424
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1238
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:09.550
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell what he has member that when fucking was it to Cada,</v>

1239
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.840
<v Speaker 1>lied and said that her voice was choked out.</v>

1240
00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Remember that shit to in line.</v>

1241
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Was it to cost?</v>

1242
00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.093
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1243
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.850
<v Speaker 1>Was it him wasn't to,</v>

1244
00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.940
<v Speaker 1>to Kinda is the guy who was Yoshida.</v>

1245
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Yoshida?</v>

1246
00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:22.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1247
00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:23.310
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1248
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:25.120
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean kind of a ship?</v>

1249
00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:25.910
<v Speaker 1>And people were like,</v>

1250
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:26.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1251
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.800
<v Speaker 1>they put a post that little Gif of him going like,</v>

1252
00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:29.631
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1253
00:34:29.631 --> 00:34:30.710
<v Speaker 1>it was Yoshida.</v>

1254
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1255
00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:32.180
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1256
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:32.631
<v Speaker 1>Yoshida.</v>

1257
00:34:32.631 --> 00:34:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Who was,</v>

1258
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:35.060
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't an Olympic gold medalist in judo,</v>

1259
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:36.920
<v Speaker 1>some high level.</v>

1260
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:38.570
<v Speaker 1>So it was a gold medalist.</v>

1261
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:40.760
<v Speaker 1>He goes for the Zeke,</v>

1262
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:41.540
<v Speaker 1>you'll choke.</v>

1263
00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Hoist is fine.</v>

1264
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Hoist never,</v>

1265
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:44.450
<v Speaker 1>never taps out.</v>

1266
00:34:44.451 --> 00:34:45.081
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

1267
00:34:45.081 --> 00:34:47.100
<v Speaker 1>hoist would have just gone unconscious 100%.</v>

1268
00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:47.930
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>

1269
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:49.160
<v Speaker 1>And he did go unconscious.</v>

1270
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a fight where he fought a Waleed ish looking at his hand.</v>

1271
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1272
00:34:55.401 --> 00:34:56.234
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

1273
00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.313
<v Speaker 1>he's fine.</v>

1274
00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.360
<v Speaker 1>They pull him off and he's right.</v>

1275
00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:00.200
<v Speaker 1>He's wide awake.</v>

1276
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1277
00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.250
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell right there.</v>

1278
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Kenya,</v>

1279
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:05.520
<v Speaker 1>the rest of fucked up fucked up pieces.</v>

1280
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Well like in the Verdun and Travis Brown fight,</v>

1281
00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.660
<v Speaker 1>the Ref fucked up,</v>

1282
00:35:08.661 --> 00:35:09.110
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

1283
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1284
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:10.243
<v Speaker 1>Pretty bad.</v>

1285
00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't have timeouts.</v>

1286
00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:12.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1287
00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I wish I got timeouts.</v>

1288
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:15.860
<v Speaker 1>The referee definitely fucked up there.</v>

1289
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.970
<v Speaker 1>That was well played though.</v>

1290
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1291
00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:17.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1292
00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:18.740
<v Speaker 1>of course you're going to do that.</v>

1293
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:18.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1294
00:35:18.951 --> 00:35:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I think he was probably thinking about stopping.</v>

1295
00:35:21.021 --> 00:35:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean his finger was snapped in half,</v>

1296
00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:24.260
<v Speaker 1>but we couldn't tell what was going on.</v>

1297
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Hunch though.</v>

1298
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1299
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.440
<v Speaker 1>For like from that Rep's perspective,</v>

1300
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:28.080
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

1301
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.650
<v Speaker 1>cause sometimes your finger does and you're going to grapple or whatever.</v>

1302
00:35:30.651 --> 00:35:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Your figure comes out of the glove and you're like,</v>

1303
00:35:32.331 --> 00:35:32.781
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1304
00:35:32.781 --> 00:35:34.150
<v Speaker 1>fixed my glove and the glove.</v>

1305
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.410
<v Speaker 1>So like the ref didn't know until he looked at it.</v>

1306
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Do the x,</v>

1307
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 1>the rep actually</v>

1308
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:38.671
<v Speaker 2>stopped it,</v>

1309
00:35:38.671 --> 00:35:39.504
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1310
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:40.410
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

1311
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:42.480
<v Speaker 2>It was good because everyone was cool with that.</v>

1312
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.980
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1313
00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if he would've stopped the fight?</v>

1314
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:45.743
<v Speaker 2>That would have sucked.</v>

1315
00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:47.820
<v Speaker 2>Who came and wanted to see the fight?</v>

1316
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.871
<v Speaker 2>Like I let it go.</v>

1317
00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:49.231
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

1318
00:35:49.231 --> 00:35:49.291
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1319
00:35:49.291 --> 00:35:49.411
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1320
00:35:49.411 --> 00:35:49.861
<v Speaker 2>We're good.</v>

1321
00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:50.694
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's good.</v>

1322
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Who cares what the,</v>

1323
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:54.270
<v Speaker 2>what the rule is?</v>

1324
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:55.163
<v Speaker 2>We got to have rules.</v>

1325
00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:57.510
<v Speaker 2>If he had a dislocated finger,</v>

1326
00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.310
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody would agree really quick.</v>

1327
00:35:59.311 --> 00:36:00.430
<v Speaker 2>If there was a button to vote,</v>

1328
00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.321
<v Speaker 2>say do we let,</v>

1329
00:36:01.321 --> 00:36:03.300
<v Speaker 2>do we give them a cup of fucking seconds?</v>

1330
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:05.200
<v Speaker 2>His fucking finger is all,</v>

1331
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:07.321
<v Speaker 2>where do you stop it?</v>

1332
00:36:07.321 --> 00:36:07.711
<v Speaker 2>I fuck,</v>

1333
00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to come around my joint.</v>

1334
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:10.340
<v Speaker 2>You on timeout.</v>

1335
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:11.040
<v Speaker 2>Let's restart.</v>

1336
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 2>She wished you would have stopped it.</v>

1337
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:13.981
<v Speaker 2>You have to have rules.</v>

1338
00:36:13.981 --> 00:36:15.090
<v Speaker 2>There's no exceptions.</v>

1339
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to have rules for how you wanted it to stop?</v>

1340
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1341
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.430
<v Speaker 2>The rest of that fight was complete shit.</v>

1342
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:20.920
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't money.</v>

1343
00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.753
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>

1344
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.091
<v Speaker 2>Here's the deal though.</v>

1345
00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:28.050
<v Speaker 2>According to the rules for breezy over doom was well within his rights to keep</v>

1346
00:36:28.051 --> 00:36:32.370
<v Speaker 2>punching a hundred percent so when he punched him and referee hadn't stopped and</v>

1347
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:33.980
<v Speaker 2>he was saying he was calling timeout,</v>

1348
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.190
<v Speaker 2>but you can't really do that.</v>

1349
00:36:35.191 --> 00:36:35.930
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

1350
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:36.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1351
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.880
<v Speaker 2>And then the fact that they just kept going afterwards,</v>

1352
00:36:38.881 --> 00:36:39.331
<v Speaker 2>he decided,</v>

1353
00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:40.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to fight with a broken finger,</v>

1354
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.030
<v Speaker 2>which is admirable.</v>

1355
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1356
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.320
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>

1357
00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:43.591
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1358
00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:43.890
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1359
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:47.040
<v Speaker 2>but what would have happened if you didn't stop?</v>

1360
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:47.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1361
00:36:47.641 --> 00:36:49.440
<v Speaker 2>when he broke your finger with that punch,</v>

1362
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:49.861
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1363
00:36:49.861 --> 00:36:50.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1364
00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:53.970
<v Speaker 2>how much different is that than breaking someone's thigh with a leg kick?</v>

1365
00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.530
<v Speaker 2>When when they get hurt,</v>

1366
00:36:55.531 --> 00:36:56.250
<v Speaker 2>you don't stop.</v>

1367
00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.000
<v Speaker 2>You keep going.</v>

1368
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Then if they stopped with the leg,</v>

1369
00:36:58.001 --> 00:36:59.270
<v Speaker 2>kick me like hold on to Holland.</v>

1370
00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

1371
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:01.021
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1372
00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:01.854
<v Speaker 2>how bad is it?</v>

1373
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:02.561
<v Speaker 2>That's not bro.</v>

1374
00:37:02.561 --> 00:37:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Keep going on.</v>

1375
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.110
<v Speaker 2>Someone breaks your forum.</v>

1376
00:37:04.111 --> 00:37:05.700
<v Speaker 2>That happens all the time.</v>

1377
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 2>It happens all the time.</v>

1378
00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Some blocks the kick and they get their forum broken.</v>

1379
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.560
<v Speaker 2>They stopped the fight.</v>

1380
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1381
00:37:11.281 --> 00:37:15.000
<v Speaker 2>they stopped the fight every time you went into that fight with broken foot too.</v>

1382
00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.380
<v Speaker 2>But so when you're,</v>

1383
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:16.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1384
00:37:16.681 --> 00:37:19.050
<v Speaker 2>you catch a punch and it was one of those weird chocolate dials,</v>

1385
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:19.621
<v Speaker 2>chocolate,</v>

1386
00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Dell style overhand rights to kind of literally comes down.</v>

1387
00:37:22.921 --> 00:37:24.570
<v Speaker 2>The phytic came down on his finger.</v>

1388
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:25.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1389
00:37:25.511 --> 00:37:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Was that is a freak accident?</v>

1390
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Is it your legal,</v>

1391
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:32.620
<v Speaker 2>is it illegal to break a,</v>

1392
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.600
<v Speaker 2>your opponent's fingers?</v>

1393
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.961
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1394
00:37:33.961 --> 00:37:34.471
<v Speaker 2>not like that.</v>

1395
00:37:34.471 --> 00:37:36.030
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to leave or get small joints,</v>

1396
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.130
<v Speaker 2>joint manipulation of the fingers,</v>

1397
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.460
<v Speaker 2>but since it wasn't on purpose,</v>

1398
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:42.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1399
00:37:42.061 --> 00:37:43.080
<v Speaker 2>just like an eye poke.</v>

1400
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not legal.</v>

1401
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:45.660
<v Speaker 2>But if it happens,</v>

1402
00:37:45.661 --> 00:37:46.650
<v Speaker 2>you don't stop the fight.</v>

1403
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.981
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1404
00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:47.814
<v Speaker 2>you're just like,</v>

1405
00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:48.990
<v Speaker 2>did you see the eyebrows?</v>

1406
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.420
<v Speaker 2>It was an accident.</v>

1407
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I post accident finger,</v>

1408
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:54.540
<v Speaker 2>snap off.</v>

1409
00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:57.083
<v Speaker 2>Look at this,</v>

1410
00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:57.751
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

1411
00:37:57.751 --> 00:37:59.880
<v Speaker 2>He'll look nowhere to go.</v>

1412
00:37:59.881 --> 00:38:01.460
<v Speaker 2>He's got no left leg here to left.</v>

1413
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.720
<v Speaker 2>If he could kick them in the face right now.</v>

1414
00:38:03.721 --> 00:38:04.554
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1415
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.210
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a different story.</v>

1416
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:07.200
<v Speaker 2>He should be able to,</v>

1417
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.810
<v Speaker 2>you should be didn't one FC chain.</v>

1418
00:38:09.811 --> 00:38:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Didn't they go back to no kicks to the head?</v>

1419
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1420
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:15.270

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:32.090
<v Speaker 2>he fought one 70 and Roger for one 55 in the UFC.</v>

1429
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.960
<v Speaker 2>He fought a big Brazilian dude.</v>

1430
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:34.771
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't his last fight,</v>

1441
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:52.450
<v Speaker 2>cage because you can't get your head out of the way.</v>

1442
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:53.560
<v Speaker 2>If it's ropes,</v>

1443
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.530
<v Speaker 2>you can get your head under the ropes and you can kind of move and get away from</v>

1444
00:38:56.531 --> 00:38:56.681
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1445
00:38:56.681 --> 00:38:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

1446
00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

1447
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I didn't show that.</v>

1448
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Show that again Jane.</v>

1449
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.493
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1450
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:03.850
<v Speaker 2>that'll do it.</v>

1451
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:05.050
<v Speaker 2>But that's a fight though.</v>

1452
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:05.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1453
00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Well he was already,</v>

1454
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.230
<v Speaker 2>he was already hurt and in bad.</v>

1455
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Some places call it a bad place to you.</v>

1456
00:39:10.571 --> 00:39:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Brendan,</v>

1457
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:13.810
<v Speaker 2>would you allow that and do you have UFC or keep it?</v>

1458
00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.310
<v Speaker 2>I would not keep it the way it is unless you hate Bradington sponsors.</v>

1459
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.181
<v Speaker 2>I totally allowed.</v>

1460
00:39:19.181 --> 00:39:19.391
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1461
00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:19.930
<v Speaker 2>totally lost.</v>

1462
00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:22.790
<v Speaker 2>The dude's bent over heroin.</v>

1463
00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.900
<v Speaker 2>A this guy used to drop knees from north south all the time.</v>

1464
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1465
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1466
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:27.930
<v Speaker 2>that was the best and it changed.</v>

1467
00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.540
<v Speaker 2>It changed the way that that occurred.</v>

1468
00:39:31.541 --> 00:39:32.650
<v Speaker 2>It changes it completely.</v>

1469
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1470
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.833
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

1471
00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Well the new rule is a down fighter is four points on the ground.</v>

1472
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.970
<v Speaker 2>Not Three points in there like that.</v>

1473
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a guy on the ground and he is covering,</v>

1474
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:44.830
<v Speaker 2>covering up and the turtle,</v>

1475
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:47.800
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do is hold onto one of his arms.</v>

1476
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:52.360
<v Speaker 2>You pick one of his arms off the ground and at least by my definition,</v>

1477
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.610
<v Speaker 2>you could start kicking them and need them in the face.</v>

1478
00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1479
00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:56.800
<v Speaker 2>If you can't,</v>

1480
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.600
<v Speaker 2>if you can't hit a down deponent because of Tylenol polar.</v>

1481
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1482
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.700
<v Speaker 2>You just take one off,</v>

1483
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.550
<v Speaker 2>pick one up and you start blasting him.</v>

1484
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Or if you guys were fucking knees now 22 feet or like too,</v>

1485
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:08.771
<v Speaker 2>is that for,</v>

1486
00:40:08.771 --> 00:40:09.610
<v Speaker 2>cause it's got two feet.</v>

1487
00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:10.360
<v Speaker 2>Two knees.</v>

1488
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:10.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1489
00:40:10.601 --> 00:40:11.350
<v Speaker 2>he is it,</v>

1490
00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:12.420
<v Speaker 2>is that a downed opponent?</v>

1491
00:40:12.421 --> 00:40:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>

1492
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:13.150
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1493
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:16.110
<v Speaker 2>what do you can send me a knee is the death count,</v>

1494
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.480
<v Speaker 2>but two knees if you're on your knees like,</v>

1495
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.900
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1496
00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:20.460
<v Speaker 2>so if a,</v>

1497
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.000
<v Speaker 2>if a guy's down,</v>

1498
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.391
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1499
00:40:22.391 --> 00:40:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Once his handcuffs off the ground,</v>

1500
00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.020
<v Speaker 2>that's when it's legal.</v>

1501
00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:27.100
<v Speaker 2>But his knees are on the ground.</v>

1502
00:40:27.101 --> 00:40:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Still not legal.</v>

1503
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:28.091
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1504
00:40:28.091 --> 00:40:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Is that how you're still not legal?</v>

1505
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1506
00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1507
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:30.880
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1508
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.451
<v Speaker 2>But if a guy,</v>

1509
00:40:31.451 --> 00:40:33.160
<v Speaker 2>so if a guy with the new rules,</v>

1510
00:40:33.161 --> 00:40:36.130
<v Speaker 2>if a guy had his feet flat on the ground and he was touching the ground with two</v>

1511
00:40:36.131 --> 00:40:38.110
<v Speaker 2>hands and you just pulled one of those arms,</v>

1512
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:39.700
<v Speaker 2>you can do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

1513
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1514
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:40.743
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1515
00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1516
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:41.500
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1517
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:45.220
<v Speaker 2>that'd be some new training or on your knees down opponent.</v>

1518
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.350
<v Speaker 2>I think when both fighters are on the ground,</v>

1519
00:40:47.351 --> 00:40:50.690
<v Speaker 2>you should be allowed to kick to the head because I think if a guy can upkick</v>

1520
00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.290
<v Speaker 2>you for the bottom bullshit,</v>

1521
00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:53.741
<v Speaker 2>you should totally,</v>

1522
00:40:53.741 --> 00:40:55.090
<v Speaker 2>like when someone's going for an arm bar,</v>

1523
00:40:55.091 --> 00:40:55.771
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to,</v>

1524
00:40:55.771 --> 00:40:58.480
<v Speaker 2>I'll kick the fuck out of their face like,</v>

1525
00:40:58.481 --> 00:41:00.280
<v Speaker 2>why are you allowed to defend yourself?</v>

1526
00:41:00.281 --> 00:41:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1527
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Bottom or me coming at you,</v>

1528
00:41:02.201 --> 00:41:04.300
<v Speaker 2>but I can't strike you at the end.</v>

1529
00:41:04.301 --> 00:41:05.720
<v Speaker 2>It gives you all this other bullshit.</v>

1530
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:09.430
<v Speaker 2>It gives you an unrealistic sense of what's real and not real on the ground</v>

1531
00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.950
<v Speaker 2>because there's a lot of stuff that goes on the ground and the ground.</v>

1532
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:14.240
<v Speaker 2>That wouldn't happen if the guy could just kick you in the face,</v>

1533
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:14.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1534
00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're lying in a weird position,</v>

1535
00:41:16.061 --> 00:41:18.160
<v Speaker 2>the guy just blasting shins to your face,</v>

1536
00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.830
<v Speaker 2>you're going to stop what you're doing and have to readjust and you're going to</v>

1537
00:41:20.831 --> 00:41:21.900
<v Speaker 2>have to make that,</v>

1538
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:24.310
<v Speaker 2>make that a part of the equation.</v>

1539
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.360
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to prepare for that totally downward elbows,</v>

1540
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:27.990
<v Speaker 2>shit on the ground,</v>

1541
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.823
<v Speaker 2>a stupid whore.</v>

1542
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.070
<v Speaker 2>It's total bullshit.</v>

1543
00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:32.670
<v Speaker 2>It makes no sense on the ground.</v>

1544
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:35.690
<v Speaker 2>You may think they brought it up if they were going to make that rule about the</v>

1545
00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:37.820
<v Speaker 2>ice breaking or whatever the fuck their reasoning was.</v>

1546
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:39.740
<v Speaker 2>If I'm standing up and when I do that,</v>

1547
00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:40.221
<v Speaker 2>then okay,</v>

1548
00:41:40.221 --> 00:41:40.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1549
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:41.331
<v Speaker 2>on your knees,</v>

1550
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:42.780
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to have any power to like,</v>

1551
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you're a dangerous and it's fighting.</v>

1552
00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:47.560
<v Speaker 2>It's no more dangerous than anything else.</v>

1553
00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>

1554
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:49.363
<v Speaker 2>it's a weapon.</v>

1555
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.730
<v Speaker 2>If there was an argument allow,</v>

1556
00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:55.730
<v Speaker 2>but if everyone collectively says hell fucking no,</v>

1557
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:56.331
<v Speaker 2>then yes.</v>

1558
00:41:56.331 --> 00:41:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Those are the ones that you,</v>

1559
00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:57.741
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1560
00:41:57.741 --> 00:41:58.281
<v Speaker 2>it's fighting.</v>

1561
00:41:58.281 --> 00:41:58.661
<v Speaker 2>We want to,</v>

1562
00:41:58.661 --> 00:41:58.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1563
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1564
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.720
<v Speaker 2>don't you think the UFC represents or is,</v>

1565
00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:03.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1566
00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.213
<v Speaker 2>represents what,</v>

1567
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.500
<v Speaker 2>what true fighting really is 100%.</v>

1568
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:07.120
<v Speaker 2>It should,</v>

1569
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:07.560
<v Speaker 2>it should.</v>

1570
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:07.881
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

1571
00:42:07.881 --> 00:42:09.710
<v Speaker 2>should the should be that still,</v>

1572
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:09.981
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1573
00:42:09.981 --> 00:42:11.870
<v Speaker 2>I think we should get rid of the cage.</v>

1574
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.200
<v Speaker 2>I think they should hold it in a space the size of a basketball arena.</v>

1575
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Goddammit.</v>

1576
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.640
<v Speaker 2>And she'd be like a basketball floor and there should be no fucking cage and I,</v>

1577
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:22.350
<v Speaker 2>and they just run for what I think.</v>

1578
00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:22.791
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1579
00:42:22.791 --> 00:42:24.470
<v Speaker 2>If I'm the king of the world and uh,</v>

1580
00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I get to make the news DFC,</v>

1581
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.110
<v Speaker 2>we get rid of the gloves,</v>

1582
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:27.980
<v Speaker 2>no gloves,</v>

1583
00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:28.970
<v Speaker 2>no hand tapes.</v>

1584
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:29.923
<v Speaker 2>That's all bullshit.</v>

1585
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:31.970
<v Speaker 2>And to my show and an Indian reservation,</v>

1586
00:42:31.971 --> 00:42:32.870
<v Speaker 2>you could do anything you want.</v>

1587
00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1588
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:34.060
<v Speaker 2>What about,</v>

1589
00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.050
<v Speaker 2>what about gloves?</v>

1590
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.681
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1591
00:42:36.681 --> 00:42:37.520
<v Speaker 2>you eye gouge.</v>

1592
00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Immediate deduction of 1.1 immediate too.</v>

1593
00:42:40.461 --> 00:42:42.920
<v Speaker 2>I gouges you're out Ted budding wait is over.</v>

1594
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:47.360
<v Speaker 2>If you did that on the Indian reservation budding should be in an arm bar.</v>

1595
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Can I bite your ankle to get it off by</v>

1596
00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.180
<v Speaker 2>writing an eye poking.</v>

1597
00:42:53.181 --> 00:42:56.120
<v Speaker 2>And the only thing is the thing about buying about ball sheets,</v>

1598
00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.150
<v Speaker 2>the biting is super dangerous as far as bacteria and stuff like that.</v>

1599
00:42:59.151 --> 00:43:00.660
<v Speaker 2>I want dude's dying on my show staff</v>

1600
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.320
<v Speaker 2>and but,</v>

1601
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.050
<v Speaker 2>but blinding and shit.</v>

1602
00:43:06.051 --> 00:43:06.231
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1603
00:43:06.231 --> 00:43:07.720
<v Speaker 2>we know we can poke each other in the eyes.</v>

1604
00:43:07.721 --> 00:43:08.121
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

1605
00:43:08.121 --> 00:43:08.830
<v Speaker 2>this is not fighting.</v>

1606
00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.250
<v Speaker 2>That's just a green can't hit the,</v>

1607
00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.350
<v Speaker 2>can't reach into my package and grabbed my hockey and Dick.</v>

1608
00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Dick don't touch the hot grill.</v>

1609
00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.930
<v Speaker 2>No pet kicks to the back of the head.</v>

1610
00:43:17.931 --> 00:43:19.640
<v Speaker 2>Legal elbows to the back of head,</v>

1611
00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:23.500
<v Speaker 2>elbows to the back of the head when you don't even need rear naked choke.</v>

1612
00:43:23.501 --> 00:43:24.650
<v Speaker 2>So once they allow the elbows,</v>

1613
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:26.263
<v Speaker 2>legal,</v>

1614
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.961
<v Speaker 2>legal,</v>

1615
00:43:26.961 --> 00:43:29.000
<v Speaker 2>all that past soccer kicks,</v>

1616
00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:30.440

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:30.861

1618
00:43:30.861 --> 00:43:31.640
<v Speaker 2>kicks legal,</v>

1619
00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.210
<v Speaker 2>we'll do it.</v>

1620
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:33.890
<v Speaker 2>No cage fighting.</v>

1621
00:43:33.891 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Chip RF,</v>

1622
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 2>start start young league,</v>

1623
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.190
<v Speaker 2>that basketball,</v>

1624
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.730
<v Speaker 2>this fucking thing.</v>

1625
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.290
<v Speaker 2>And you have a basketball court for basketball and basketball is boring as fuck.</v>

1626
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.511
<v Speaker 2>How about that Ben?</v>

1627
00:43:43.511 --> 00:43:45.290
<v Speaker 2>So he got that big ass place for football.</v>

1628
00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Look at giant space.</v>

1629
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.130
<v Speaker 2>How about two dudes meet in the middle of a fucking football arena?</v>

1630
00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:52.460
<v Speaker 2>How about that site and go crazy.</v>

1631
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.760
<v Speaker 2>No problem with the basketball arena.</v>

1632
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.240
<v Speaker 2>The problem with the basketball arena is you're going to have to like change all</v>

1633
00:43:59.241 --> 00:44:01.040
<v Speaker 2>these other rules to force them to fight.</v>

1634
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:01.611
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1635
00:44:01.611 --> 00:44:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Going to have to make yellow cards.</v>

1636
00:44:02.811 --> 00:44:07.190
<v Speaker 2>You have to make all that shit because you let the public decide even sparring</v>

1637
00:44:07.191 --> 00:44:08.030
<v Speaker 2>and an open room.</v>

1638
00:44:08.031 --> 00:44:08.381
<v Speaker 2>Where does it?</v>

1639
00:44:08.381 --> 00:44:09.214
<v Speaker 2>Big Mat.</v>

1640
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.800
<v Speaker 2>One guy doesn't want to fucking spar and just walking around the room chasing</v>

1641
00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:13.430
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1642
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Let the 50,000 people that would come to my shows is boom.</v>

1643
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Here's another thing I'm doing.</v>

1644
00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.670
<v Speaker 2>This is another thing I do and if I'm king of the world,</v>

1645
00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.000
<v Speaker 2>I bring Ben her into the UFC immediately.</v>

1646
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.600
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1647
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.240
<v Speaker 2>That's a disgrace.</v>

1648
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Everybody in the car golf,</v>

1649
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:32.400
<v Speaker 2>he's sunned him.</v>

1650
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Took him down,</v>

1651
00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:34.283
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1652
00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:35.690
<v Speaker 2>The fuck you wanted let,</v>

1653
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:36.563
<v Speaker 2>let's just go,</v>

1654
00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 2>let's just cover this real quick.</v>

1655
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.550
<v Speaker 2>You'll have cm punk fight,</v>

1656
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.670
<v Speaker 2>but not Ben asked.</v>

1657
00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1658
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.570
<v Speaker 2>the UFC world.</v>

1659
00:44:45.571 --> 00:44:46.404
<v Speaker 2>Are we living?</v>

1660
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:47.760
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

1661
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.380
<v Speaker 2>Point.</v>

1662
00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Very good point.</v>

1663
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.790
<v Speaker 2>That's a headline right there.</v>

1664
00:44:49.791 --> 00:44:51.300
<v Speaker 2>1 billion people watch him.</v>

1665
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:54.990
<v Speaker 2>See what was day 100,000 star.</v>

1666
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.450

1667
00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:00.120
<v Speaker 2>made a half a million dollars on paper that would they what they show and people</v>

1668
00:45:00.121 --> 00:45:01.200
<v Speaker 2>were complaining about it and like,</v>

1669
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.360
<v Speaker 2>do you have any eyes that guy brought to that show?</v>

1670
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.751
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1671
00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:04.411
<v Speaker 2>he's worth it.</v>

1672
00:45:04.411 --> 00:45:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Money.</v>

1673
00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.401

1674
00:45:05.401 --> 00:45:08.820
<v Speaker 2>very famous guy and I think he handled it really well.</v>

1675
00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Like as far as like his post fight speech is interview the way,</v>

1676
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:13.944
<v Speaker 2>talked about it.</v>

1677
00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:14.910
<v Speaker 2>He handled it really.</v>

1678
00:45:14.911 --> 00:45:19.470
<v Speaker 2>He gave Micky Gall we're a weird speech to him after it was over.</v>

1679
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.650
<v Speaker 2>But you've also got a bailout.</v>

1680
00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:25.530
<v Speaker 2>You gotta believe in yourself the way I believe in myself,</v>

1681
00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:26.640

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:36.601

1689
00:45:36.601 --> 00:45:40.410
<v Speaker 2>this is really his first venture into reality and you know what I mean?</v>

1690
00:45:40.411 --> 00:45:43.140
<v Speaker 2>You go out there and you think everything's gonna go great cause it's gone great</v>

1691
00:45:43.141 --> 00:45:45.840
<v Speaker 2>your whole life with no competition and then all of a sudden your first</v>

1692
00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:47.430
<v Speaker 2>competition is in the UFC.</v>

1693
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1694
00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Was he going to go any other way?</v>

1695
00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:50.150
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

1696
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:51.300
<v Speaker 2>How's it going to be liked it.</v>

1697
00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he was.</v>

1698
00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:52.813
<v Speaker 2>He says he did.</v>

1699
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:53.600
<v Speaker 2>He says he did.</v>

1700
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1701
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.470
<v Speaker 2>there's no way they live to fight again.</v>

1702
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 2>There's no way hit.</v>

1703
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:58.261
<v Speaker 2>People were like,</v>

1704
00:45:58.261 --> 00:45:58.891
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

1705
00:45:58.891 --> 00:46:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go through them with my family there and he could fight again.</v>

1706
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:03.730
<v Speaker 2>He could totally find a seat.</v>

1707
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:04.723
<v Speaker 2>Not In the UFC.</v>

1708
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:06.360
<v Speaker 2>He's got to fight as an amateur show.</v>

1709
00:46:06.361 --> 00:46:07.410
<v Speaker 2>He just got to learn.</v>

1710
00:46:07.411 --> 00:46:08.340
<v Speaker 2>He ruined that shot.</v>

1711
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:09.870
<v Speaker 2>You can't find them once you fight pro,</v>

1712
00:46:09.871 --> 00:46:10.800
<v Speaker 2>you can't fight amateur.</v>

1713
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:11.401
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1714
00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:12.234
<v Speaker 2>is that how it works?</v>

1715
00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.373
<v Speaker 2>There's no Glenn,</v>

1716
00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:14.700
<v Speaker 2>you can fight pro,</v>

1717
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:15.511
<v Speaker 2>but listen,</v>

1718
00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:18.810
<v Speaker 2>you just got to fight people that are of the same ability as you.</v>

1719
00:46:18.811 --> 00:46:19.740
<v Speaker 2>People that are learning,</v>

1720
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.863
<v Speaker 2>you know what they should do.</v>

1721
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.150
<v Speaker 2>You should go on like a regional circuit and fight fight.</v>

1722
00:46:24.151 --> 00:46:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Guys with similar experience have a whole documentary like getting back to the</v>

1723
00:46:28.021 --> 00:46:29.350

1726
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.593
<v Speaker 2>Phil Brooks.</v>

1727
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:35.270
<v Speaker 2>You're Phil Brooks.</v>

1728
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:36.720
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker dropped the cm punk.</v>

1729
00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:37.780
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1730
00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I like keeping it because he had that name before he came to WWE.</v>

1731
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:42.721
<v Speaker 2>That was his name.</v>

1732
00:46:42.721 --> 00:46:43.560
<v Speaker 2>That's why he owns it.</v>

1733
00:46:43.561 --> 00:46:46.800
<v Speaker 2>That's why he's allowed to use it still and everybody knows him as that like</v>

1734
00:46:46.801 --> 00:46:47.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a smart move.</v>

1735
00:46:47.641 --> 00:46:48.690
<v Speaker 2>As far as like marketing,</v>

1736
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:52.470
<v Speaker 2>I think that guy could still go on the regional shirt circuit and fight.</v>

1737
00:46:52.471 --> 00:46:53.760
<v Speaker 2>People that are just starting out,</v>

1738
00:46:53.761 --> 00:46:58.050
<v Speaker 2>they're just starting out just like him and he could probably become like a</v>

1739
00:46:58.051 --> 00:46:59.050
<v Speaker 2>competent fighter,</v>

1740
00:46:59.051 --> 00:47:00.240
<v Speaker 2>a competent professional fighter,</v>

1741
00:47:00.241 --> 00:47:02.250
<v Speaker 2>but that's something that takes a long time.</v>

1742
00:47:02.251 --> 00:47:03.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not like he has any handicaps.</v>

1743
00:47:03.661 --> 00:47:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I love he his will if he has a will and he has the desire because he enjoys it.</v>

1744
00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Apparently if he has a will and he has a desire and he wants to test himself,</v>

1745
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:16.560
<v Speaker 2>I firmly believe that that guy could go and become a competent professional</v>

1746
00:47:16.561 --> 00:47:17.100
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>

1747
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:17.311
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1748
00:47:17.311 --> 00:47:18.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that.</v>

1749
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.100
<v Speaker 2>I said a competent professional fighter.</v>

1750
00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:21.660
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a smart guy.</v>

1751
00:47:21.661 --> 00:47:22.860
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a tough guy.</v>

1752
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:27.270
<v Speaker 2>I just think this was his first real combat sports experience and I don't think,</v>

1753
00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:28.283
<v Speaker 2>I think that's it.</v>

1754
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.490
<v Speaker 2>I think they did them a disservice.</v>

1755
00:47:30.491 --> 00:47:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Granted he made whatever,</v>

1756
00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:33.040
<v Speaker 2>some figures after paper you bonus.</v>

1757
00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.220
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think a day did them a disservice if he actually wanted to pursue</v>

1758
00:47:36.221 --> 00:47:37.180
<v Speaker 2>this as a career.</v>

1759
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:38.051
<v Speaker 2>Dana,</v>

1760
00:47:38.051 --> 00:47:40.270
<v Speaker 2>the commission has coaches Swintt listen man,</v>

1761
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.650
<v Speaker 2>you got to take the necessary steps like ruin else did because there's no</v>

1762
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:45.221
<v Speaker 2>turning back.</v>

1763
00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Once you go to the UFC man,</v>

1764
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.280
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of you're in and out brother.</v>

1765
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Well you know guys have come back.</v>

1766
00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:53.610
<v Speaker 2>They've gone to other organizations had combat 38 with no skills transfer 10</v>

1767
00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:53.921
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1768
00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:54.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not likely.</v>

1769
00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:55.691
<v Speaker 2>It's not likely,</v>

1770
00:47:55.691 --> 00:47:59.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's also not likely that you become a professional fighter at 37 as well.</v>

1771
00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.940
<v Speaker 2>These none of these things are likely,</v>

1772
00:48:00.941 --> 00:48:02.080
<v Speaker 2>but there's no worries about that though,</v>

1773
00:48:02.081 --> 00:48:02.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1774
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:03.483
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1775
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.670
<v Speaker 2>most people were doing something else by the time the 38 and it's not their</v>

1776
00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:07.390
<v Speaker 2>career path.</v>

1777
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.571
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1778
00:48:07.571 --> 00:48:07.701
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1779
00:48:07.701 --> 00:48:10.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a very rare that someone decides to go into that at such a late stage of</v>

1780
00:48:10.691 --> 00:48:11.524
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1781
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.041
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>

1782
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:14.050
<v Speaker 2>if he's in good shape and he's a healthy guy,</v>

1783
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:17.500
<v Speaker 2>what what he needs to do is if he wants to learn,</v>

1784
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:18.790
<v Speaker 2>just train all the time,</v>

1785
00:48:18.791 --> 00:48:22.420
<v Speaker 2>train all the time and take your time in getting involved in competition again</v>

1786
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:23.250
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>

1787
00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:23.580
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1788
00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:23.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1789
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.710
<v Speaker 2>you can't get an argument with someone when you only know four words.</v>

1790
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1791
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:27.571
<v Speaker 2>I liked the guest.</v>

1792
00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:28.241
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to work.</v>

1793
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1794
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:29.980
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same thing as a fight.</v>

1795
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.910
<v Speaker 2>He's a fighting this kid who I watched Mickey Golf fight in the UFC,</v>

1796
00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:34.430
<v Speaker 2>his first five.</v>

1797
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.631
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1798
00:48:34.631 --> 00:48:36.040
<v Speaker 2>this fucking kid is good.</v>

1799
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.600
<v Speaker 2>What can we take that guy's back,</v>

1800
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.401
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

1801
00:48:38.401 --> 00:48:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

1802
00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:42.760
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] like Micky Gall has some serious work to do as well in that division</v>

1803
00:48:42.761 --> 00:48:43.990
<v Speaker 2>is a long ways to go.</v>

1804
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:44.321
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1805
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:46.870
<v Speaker 2>and he dismantled cm punk,</v>

1806
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.640
<v Speaker 2>these other jet brown belt,</v>

1807
00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:49.811
<v Speaker 2>Brown belt.</v>

1808
00:48:49.811 --> 00:48:50.630
<v Speaker 2>But he still has,</v>

1809
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:53.380
<v Speaker 2>if you look the the spectrum of that division at me,</v>

1810
00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:56.030
<v Speaker 2>he has a lot of work that of course it's an insane division,</v>

1811
00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.450
<v Speaker 2>but he's still very new.</v>

1812
00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Well that was kind of what cm punk was saying to him.</v>

1813
00:49:00.611 --> 00:49:03.040
<v Speaker 2>Cause he was saying that he didn't belong in the UFC and the only reason why he</v>

1814
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:05.440
<v Speaker 2>was in the UFC was to fight a cm punk.</v>

1815
00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:06.730
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of saying that,</v>

1816
00:49:06.731 --> 00:49:08.530
<v Speaker 2>but what the kid's doing is being smart.</v>

1817
00:49:08.531 --> 00:49:09.670
<v Speaker 2>He's just self deprecating.</v>

1818
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:11.110
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart fucking kid.</v>

1819
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:11.681
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

1820
00:49:11.681 --> 00:49:12.431
<v Speaker 2>I would call about sage.</v>

1821

1868
00:50:09.311 --> 00:50:09.521
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1869
00:50:09.521 --> 00:50:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember how he hit it.</v>

1870
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:12.180
<v Speaker 2>He hit about a,</v>

1871
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:14.170
<v Speaker 2>he thought Ben Saunders.</v>

1872
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck is that?</v>

1873
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:16.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1874
00:50:16.961 --> 00:50:18.310
<v Speaker 2>that's just Kenny Robinson talking.</v>

1875
00:50:18.311 --> 00:50:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Why did they have a solid rustler good Jujitsu?</v>

1876
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.970
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1877
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:24.791
<v Speaker 2>he's no joke,</v>

1878
00:50:24.791 --> 00:50:25.031
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1879
00:50:25.031 --> 00:50:26.740
<v Speaker 2>Kenny Kenny Roberts is very smart.</v>

1880
00:50:26.741 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 2>I'll fight him and Ben Saunders.</v>

1881
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.720
<v Speaker 1>That was tough.</v>

1882
00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1883
00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Three hard rounds do hop out.</v>

1884
00:50:32.061 --> 00:50:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1885
00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.141
<v Speaker 1>how about your boy?</v>

1886
00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:33.441
<v Speaker 1>Chill.</v>

1887
00:50:33.441 --> 00:50:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Sewn in Sanibel tour.</v>

1888
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:35.683
<v Speaker 1>Good move.</v>

1889
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:36.171
<v Speaker 1>Good move.</v>

1890
00:50:36.171 --> 00:50:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Right move for him.</v>

1891
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.881
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>

1892
00:50:37.881 --> 00:50:39.290
<v Speaker 1>I hope Shane Carwyn does it too.</v>

1893
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.281
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily that.</v>

1894
00:50:40.281 --> 00:50:41.600
<v Speaker 1>I hope Shane doesn't sign with the UFC.</v>

1895
00:50:41.601 --> 00:50:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I hope you signs where he gets the best deal.</v>

1896
00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:47.240
<v Speaker 1>100% but I think it's good to have guys like Rory.</v>

1897
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.540
<v Speaker 1>It's good to have like legit worldclass fighters over there.</v>

1898
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:51.260
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

1899
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I think competition is good for everything.</v>

1900
00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:54.200
<v Speaker 1>It's good for everybody.</v>

1901
00:50:54.201 --> 00:50:56.180
<v Speaker 1>It elevates everybody everywhere.</v>

1902
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Like with,</v>

1903
00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:57.780
<v Speaker 1>with jail.</v>

1904
00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:01.220
<v Speaker 1>It was a little like last night I was watching a Bella torn that child.</v>

1905
00:51:01.221 --> 00:51:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you know he does his whole gangster shit talking.</v>

1906
00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Remember he hasn't been around in a while.</v>

1907
00:51:05.841 --> 00:51:10.100
<v Speaker 1>So when you used to like a fricking Conor McGregor shit talking [inaudible] it</v>

1908
00:51:10.101 --> 00:51:11.510
<v Speaker 1>was like hot tub time machine.</v>

1909
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Like we like it.</v>

1910
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:15.210
<v Speaker 1>It was a little old school and I talked to,</v>

1911
00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:16.820
<v Speaker 1>I love chili like a bro.</v>

1912
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:18.380
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love jail,</v>

1913
00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.560
<v Speaker 1>but I was like [inaudible] this is Tom.</v>

1914
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:22.520
<v Speaker 1>This is old school.</v>

1915
00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:24.560
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly seemed prepared.</v>

1916
00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:26.123
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1917
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:27.380
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

1918
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:28.213
<v Speaker 1>It was always like,</v>

1919
00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.093
<v Speaker 1>it was more,</v>

1920
00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.220
<v Speaker 1>it was natural,</v>

1921
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:31.370
<v Speaker 1>but also there's no,</v>

1922
00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.230
<v Speaker 1>like he's calling out teat or tease,</v>

1923
00:51:33.231 --> 00:51:33.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1924
00:51:33.501 --> 00:51:35.100
<v Speaker 1>and there's like no real animosity.</v>

1925
00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:36.680
<v Speaker 1>And then Tito tweet back like,</v>

1926
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

1927
00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you the bad guy's girl.</v>

1928
00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:41.990
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

1929
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.360
<v Speaker 1>We got to 40 year olds talking shit on Twitter,</v>

1930
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:46.993
<v Speaker 1>silence.</v>

1931
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.200
<v Speaker 1>And I looked and I fucking love Jen and I,</v>

1932
00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:49.401
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1933
00:51:49.401 --> 00:51:52.700
<v Speaker 1>I love to see him fight but seeing his shit talking compared to Connor's,</v>

1934
00:51:52.701 --> 00:51:53.240
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1935
00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.550
<v Speaker 1>well Connor took that torch and ran with it.</v>

1936
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:55.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1937
00:51:55.761 --> 00:51:56.571
<v Speaker 1>I had dinner the other night.</v>

1938
00:51:56.571 --> 00:51:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Would Maynard from tool?</v>

1939
00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Mainer Keenan is a buddy of mine and uh,</v>

1940
00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:00.650
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>

1941
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:01.483
<v Speaker 1>he's in Jujitsu,</v>

1942
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:02.270
<v Speaker 1>he's a purple belt,</v>

1943
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.960
<v Speaker 1>loves Jujitsu,</v>

1944
00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:03.610
<v Speaker 1>loves MMA.</v>

1945
00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:05.090
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking about the UFC and he goes,</v>

1946
00:52:05.091 --> 00:52:05.690
<v Speaker 1>God damn it,</v>

1947
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:07.610
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck is it becoming a WWE?</v>

1948
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:08.331
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1949
00:52:08.331 --> 00:52:09.350
<v Speaker 1>this is making me sad.</v>

1950
00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's like everybody's trying to be Connor Mcgregor and they're coming up</v>

1951
00:52:12.021 --> 00:52:14.680
<v Speaker 1>with these corny fucking pre-fight promos.</v>

1952
00:52:14.681 --> 00:52:15.060
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

1953
00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:15.410
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1954
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:16.101
<v Speaker 1>aw,</v>

1955
00:52:16.101 --> 00:52:18.680
<v Speaker 1>it makes me just cause he's,</v>

1956
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:19.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1957
00:52:19.371 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 1>he's just a fucking super smart genius dude here.</v>

1958
00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Stuff doesn't he loves,</v>

1959
00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.010
<v Speaker 1>he loves martial arts.</v>

1960
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:28.640
<v Speaker 1>So when he sees non martial artists type behavior,</v>

1961
00:52:28.641 --> 00:52:30.990
<v Speaker 1>like pro wrestling type behavior and my,</v>

1962
00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:32.300
<v Speaker 1>if they just trying to sell themselves,</v>

1963
00:52:32.301 --> 00:52:33.710
<v Speaker 1>he should tell Shawn was talking about,</v>

1964
00:52:33.711 --> 00:52:33.921
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1965
00:52:33.921 --> 00:52:35.840
<v Speaker 1>I just beat the fucking number two container.</v>

1966
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm ranked number one.</v>

1967
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Give me the fucking rematch.</v>

1968
00:52:38.811 --> 00:52:39.740
<v Speaker 1>What do I gotta do?</v>

1969
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:40.071
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1970
00:52:40.071 --> 00:52:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a shit talker.</v>

1971
00:52:41.021 --> 00:52:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that.</v>

1972
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.130
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you I'm not finding one.</v>

1973
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:43.700
<v Speaker 1>But then I went,</v>

1974
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's enough.</v>

1975
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Is there any way can watch like ric flair or some shit and just pick up a couple</v>

1976
00:52:47.991 --> 00:52:48.101
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1977
00:52:48.101 --> 00:52:48.490
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1978
00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:52.310
<v Speaker 1>You just pick up a few things like watch macho man and just start spitting some</v>

1979
00:52:52.311 --> 00:52:53.144
<v Speaker 1>game online.</v>

1980
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.590
<v Speaker 1>It's sports entertainment,</v>

1981
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:56.300
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is you can't,</v>

1982
00:52:56.301 --> 00:52:58.220
<v Speaker 1>like Connor is that guy.</v>

1983
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.940
<v Speaker 1>That's him.</v>

1984
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.470
<v Speaker 1>That's how he talks all the time.</v>

1985
00:53:00.471 --> 00:53:05.360
<v Speaker 1>He's a sharp shit talker from Ireland and he knows how to fight and he knows how</v>

1986
00:53:05.361 --> 00:53:05.931
<v Speaker 1>to talk.</v>

1987
00:53:05.931 --> 00:53:07.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's an unusual combination.</v>

1988
00:53:07.611 --> 00:53:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1989
00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Most guys don't know how to talk that know how to fight.</v>

1990
00:53:11.241 --> 00:53:13.460
<v Speaker 1>And most guys who know how to talk don't know how to fight.</v>

1991
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1992
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:14.721
<v Speaker 1>When do,</v>

1993
00:53:14.721 --> 00:53:16.850
<v Speaker 1>you could talk that much shit and fight that.</v>

1994
00:53:16.851 --> 00:53:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1995
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:18.230
<v Speaker 1>you're a unicorn.</v>

1996
00:53:18.231 --> 00:53:18.381
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1997
00:53:18.381 --> 00:53:19.520
<v Speaker 1>he's a unicorn also.</v>

1998
00:53:19.521 --> 00:53:19.790
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1999
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:20.990
<v Speaker 1>he can fight the mind,</v>

2000
00:53:20.991 --> 00:53:24.530
<v Speaker 1>fucking see puts on dudes because he can talk so much shit.</v>

2001
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:26.640
<v Speaker 1>The love of all those people that are behind them,</v>

2002
00:53:26.641 --> 00:53:31.110
<v Speaker 1>all those Irish people and then the mind fucking from them screaming at you all</v>

2003
00:53:31.111 --> 00:53:31.501
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

2004
00:53:31.501 --> 00:53:32.070
<v Speaker 1>the entire,</v>

2005
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:32.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2006
00:53:32.431 --> 00:53:36.090
<v Speaker 1>six weeks up until the fight and then the shit that he says about you and the</v>

2007
00:53:36.091 --> 00:53:37.890
<v Speaker 1>fact that he might very well sleep.</v>

2008
00:53:37.891 --> 00:53:42.640
<v Speaker 1>You could mine my very well dropped out nuclear left hand on your face route.</v>

2009

2015
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.010

2020
00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:01.080
<v Speaker 1>He took it from the back.</v>

2021
00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:01.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

2042
00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Very nasty.</v>

2043
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2044
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:24.330
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2045
00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:25.290
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting fight,</v>

2046
00:54:25.291 --> 00:54:26.124
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2047
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:27.970
<v Speaker 1>That's all with the headhunter Connor.</v>

2048
00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2049
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:29.543
<v Speaker 1>If it happens,</v>

2050
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:31.650
<v Speaker 1>if allegedly acid square garden,</v>

2051
00:54:31.651 --> 00:54:33.330
<v Speaker 1>if it happens in a couple of months,</v>

2052
00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:34.770
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's gonna happen.</v>

2053
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.491
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna happen.</v>

2054
00:54:35.491 --> 00:54:36.510
<v Speaker 1>But if it does happen,</v>

2055
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.593
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2056
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:38.731
<v Speaker 1>that might happen.</v>

2057
00:54:38.731 --> 00:54:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Joe and he can grapple for freaking graphical,</v>

2058
00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:42.853
<v Speaker 1>forgetting I'm a can.</v>

2059
00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Russell's a fucking grinder and whatever endurance issues,</v>

2060
00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Connor,</v>

2061
00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:51.090
<v Speaker 1>it may have he better eye on those fuckers out before you go to town with that</v>

2062
00:54:51.091 --> 00:54:51.330
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2063
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:51.661
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2064
00:54:51.661 --> 00:54:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm the biggest Conor McGregor fan on the planet.</v>

2065
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:54.570
<v Speaker 1>I love that guy.</v>

2066
00:54:54.571 --> 00:54:58.950
<v Speaker 1>But looking at his potential opponents at one 55 and it's 70,</v>

2067
00:54:58.951 --> 00:54:59.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2068
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:00.240
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

2069
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:00.660
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2070
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:01.620
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look pretty.</v>

2071
00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.930
<v Speaker 1>And Eddies of rough matchup for him,</v>

2072
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:05.170
<v Speaker 1>it's probably easiest,</v>

2073
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:07.230
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's an easy one at all.</v>

2074
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>

2075
00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:09.423
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>

2076
00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:10.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that 55,</v>

2077
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:12.210
<v Speaker 1>they're all fucking tough.</v>

2078
00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.860
<v Speaker 1>They are all top stylistically.</v>

2079
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:15.000
<v Speaker 1>If you know you're like,</v>

2080
00:55:15.001 --> 00:55:15.571
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

2081
00:55:15.571 --> 00:55:17.120
<v Speaker 1>I Guess Eddie's the best matchup.</v>

2082
00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it a lot because he's on a fucking nightmare,</v>

2083
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think is the best match up at all.</v>

2084
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:22.471
<v Speaker 1>Who would you say is,</v>

2085
00:55:22.471 --> 00:55:22.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2086
00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:23.130
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2087
00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:24.810
<v Speaker 1>any Eddie's known for having a chat.</v>

2088
00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.870
<v Speaker 1>It's known for having a Chin and known for being able to bounce back from</v>

2089
00:55:27.871 --> 00:55:28.470
<v Speaker 1>getting hurt.</v>

2090
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:32.250
<v Speaker 1>He's got massive heart and he fights at his best.</v>

2091
00:55:32.251 --> 00:55:33.360
<v Speaker 1>When the chips were on the line,</v>

2092
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:34.710
<v Speaker 1>like in the dos Anjos fight,</v>

2093
00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:35.940
<v Speaker 1>nobody gave him a shot and that fight,</v>

2094
00:55:35.941 --> 00:55:36.840
<v Speaker 1>who gave him the shot in that fight?</v>

2095
00:55:36.841 --> 00:55:37.321
<v Speaker 1>He was probably like,</v>

2096
00:55:37.321 --> 00:55:37.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2097
00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:38.970
<v Speaker 1>at least two to one underdog.</v>

2098
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2099
00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:39.680
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

2100
00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Going into that fight with a dominant champion at Hoffeld Dosantos so just got</v>

2101
00:55:42.901 --> 00:55:46.410
<v Speaker 1>done stop and cowboys Serone in the first round working Nate Diaz,</v>

2102
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:47.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2103
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.170
<v Speaker 1>beating the shit out at pedes for five rounds.</v>

2104
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:50.030
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at dos sign,</v>

2105
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.341
<v Speaker 1>just going,</v>

2106
00:55:50.341 --> 00:55:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

2107
00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:53.490
<v Speaker 1>this guy might be able to run this division for a long time.</v>

2108
00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:57.540
<v Speaker 1>And Alvarez clips him and he looked real good before he clipped him.</v>

2109
00:55:57.541 --> 00:56:00.090
<v Speaker 1>He had some sleepless nights before.</v>

2110
00:56:00.091 --> 00:56:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Then we had real Eddie Alvarez for until that fight.</v>

2111
00:56:03.921 --> 00:56:04.170
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2112
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:05.390
<v Speaker 1>that's the fucking belt door.</v>

2113
00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:07.310
<v Speaker 1>That's the fucking free agent that we want.</v>

2114
00:56:07.311 --> 00:56:11.010
<v Speaker 1>And See Melendez fight and the Pettis fight you like Jesus.</v>

2115
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Scott's better.</v>

2116
00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:13.800
<v Speaker 1>You know it's part of it is he's gotten better.</v>

2117
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Well the UFC jitters or are real.</v>

2118
00:56:15.421 --> 00:56:17.520
<v Speaker 1>So no matter if you have 30 fights are apparently,</v>

2119
00:56:17.521 --> 00:56:18.630
<v Speaker 1>if you have zero cm punk,</v>

2120
00:56:18.631 --> 00:56:19.620
<v Speaker 1>those jitters are real.</v>

2121
00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Where is he training now?</v>

2122
00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:21.481
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

2123
00:56:21.481 --> 00:56:22.101
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Alvarez.</v>

2124
00:56:22.101 --> 00:56:22.621
<v Speaker 1>He with your board?</v>

2125
00:56:22.621 --> 00:56:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Mark Henry with Mark Henry.</v>

2126
00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:26.650
<v Speaker 1>That's a big Frankie Edgar and he's wrestling at Rutgers.</v>

2127
00:56:26.651 --> 00:56:28.570
<v Speaker 1>He's a monster man telling you.</v>

2128
00:56:28.571 --> 00:56:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Mark Henry is a mother there.</v>

2129
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Barboza they've all those guys.</v>

2130
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:34.000
<v Speaker 1>But you look at the top five and for Connor.</v>

2131
00:56:34.001 --> 00:56:35.050
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking tough man.</v>

2132
00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:35.891
<v Speaker 1>It is tough.</v>

2133
00:56:35.891 --> 00:56:40.090
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's part of the reason why Eddie looks so good now.</v>

2134
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:41.800
<v Speaker 1>He looks so fucking sharp.</v>

2135
00:56:41.801 --> 00:56:44.440
<v Speaker 1>You can't discount the fact he's trained with Barboza.</v>

2136
00:56:44.441 --> 00:56:45.190
<v Speaker 1>He's tranquil.</v>

2137
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Frankie Edgar and he's absorbing from Henry is the mastermind of Mark Henry.</v>

2138
00:56:49.661 --> 00:56:50.760
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker,</v>

2139
00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:50.951
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2140
00:56:50.951 --> 00:56:53.970
<v Speaker 1>He's the the most slept on trainer marketing.</v>

2141
00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I know most slept on street doesn't want to be in the limelight and he hates</v>

2142
00:56:57.071 --> 00:56:57.581
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

2143
00:56:57.581 --> 00:56:59.590
<v Speaker 1>But if he was more outspoken,</v>

2144
00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean Jesus Christ.</v>

2145
00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2146
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:01.901
<v Speaker 1>it'd be all over.</v>

2147
00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Rashad pulled me aside at one of the umcs and was just going on and on about</v>

2148
00:57:06.671 --> 00:57:07.720
<v Speaker 1>what a bad mother fucker.</v>

2149
00:57:07.721 --> 00:57:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Never seen anything like him.</v>

2150
00:57:08.671 --> 00:57:10.420
<v Speaker 1>And he still checks in on me all the time.</v>

2151
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't fight anymore.</v>

2152
00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I worked with him for May two or three weeks and he would have,</v>

2153
00:57:15.281 --> 00:57:15.941
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you man,</v>

2154
00:57:15.941 --> 00:57:17.830
<v Speaker 1>like a path like this in his basement.</v>

2155
00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I had sores on my feet because I was barefoot and in his basement doing footwork</v>

2156
00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:22.190
<v Speaker 1>nonstop.</v>

2157
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:25.090
<v Speaker 1>He had notes for fucking days like,</v>

2158
00:57:25.091 --> 00:57:25.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2159
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:26.650
<v Speaker 1>like he's obsessed with it.</v>

2160
00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:27.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2161
00:57:27.131 --> 00:57:27.381
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2162
00:57:27.381 --> 00:57:28.370
<v Speaker 1>he's brilliant.</v>

2163
00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Clearly on the spectrum makes the best pizza in fucking New Jersey in the world</v>

2164
00:57:32.171 --> 00:57:32.410
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2165
00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:33.101
<v Speaker 1>I heard heard,</v>

2166
00:57:33.101 --> 00:57:34.200
<v Speaker 1>is this a silly cook?</v>

2167
00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:35.613
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2168
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.300
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2169
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fungus pizzas off and that,</v>

2170
00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:41.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a place where pizzas like highly praise.</v>

2171
00:57:41.681 --> 00:57:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Like you gotta you gotta come with some real pizza if you want to make a living</v>

2172
00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:45.341
<v Speaker 1>in New Jersey.</v>

2173
00:57:45.341 --> 00:57:46.174
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2174
00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Catching up world champions and making mean espe pizzas.</v>

2175
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:49.833
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Eddie's,</v>

2176
00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:50.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2177
00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's an easy fight.</v>

2178
00:57:51.641 --> 00:57:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think [inaudible] at one 50 that's what I'm saying.</v>

2179
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying if you looked at those top five,</v>

2180
00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:58.480
<v Speaker 1>none of them are easy at all.</v>

2181
00:57:58.570 --> 00:57:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Like it.</v>

2182
00:57:58.910 --> 00:58:02.170
<v Speaker 1>The future doesn't look great at 55 I don't want to see,</v>

2183
00:58:02.171 --> 00:58:02.371
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2184
00:58:02.371 --> 00:58:05.500
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that either because you don't get that til five.</v>

2185
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Tell me,</v>

2186
00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:06.890
<v Speaker 1>tell me the best match.</v>

2187
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.270
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>

2188
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Nate is clearly one of the best.</v>

2189
00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Nate's clearly one of the best 155 pounds.</v>

2190
00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Diaz.</v>

2191
00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2192
00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:12.760
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2193
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.410
<v Speaker 1>he's better at 55 and [inaudible] 70.</v>

2194
00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:15.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2195
00:58:15.011 --> 00:58:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Well seventies not really fighting at 70 mean he fought Rory at 70.</v>

2196
00:58:18.491 --> 00:58:19.120
<v Speaker 1>He fought.</v>

2197
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.820
<v Speaker 1>So I'm saying fuck Conor at 70 and that was a tough out.</v>

2198
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.940
<v Speaker 1>They did that because that's what they did the first time when he took the fight</v>

2199
00:58:24.941 --> 00:58:25.601
<v Speaker 1>last minute notice,</v>

2200
00:58:25.601 --> 00:58:27.390
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to have the exact same corrections.</v>

2201
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.170
<v Speaker 1>That's why Conor did it at 70 again,</v>

2202
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:33.040
<v Speaker 1>but Nate's of one 50 fiver and at one 55 like when he fought Michael Johnson,</v>

2203
00:58:33.041 --> 00:58:33.880
<v Speaker 1>when he's shredded,</v>

2204
00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:35.050
<v Speaker 1>he looked at its best.</v>

2205
00:58:35.051 --> 00:58:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2206
00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:36.011
<v Speaker 1>He's up better.</v>

2207
00:58:36.011 --> 00:58:36.611
<v Speaker 1>Nate Dhea.</v>

2208
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:38.650
<v Speaker 1>And if you see the Nate Diaz that beat,</v>

2209
00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:43.030
<v Speaker 1>you know Michael Johnson if 55 he's one of the best fighters in that division</v>

2210
00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:43.780
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2211
00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:44.351
<v Speaker 1>Hands Down,</v>

2212
00:58:44.351 --> 00:58:44.950
<v Speaker 1>not even close.</v>

2213
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:46.510
<v Speaker 1>So Connor just beat him.</v>

2214
00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously a very close fight,</v>

2215
00:58:48.311 --> 00:58:49.390
<v Speaker 1>very close decision.</v>

2216
00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:51.340
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

2217
00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:52.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it was probably a fair decision.</v>

2218
00:58:52.931 --> 00:58:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I have to go over it and score it.</v>

2219
00:58:54.071 --> 00:58:55.640
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gone over it and scored it.</v>

2220
00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:55.940
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2221
00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:56.191
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2222
00:58:56.191 --> 00:58:57.370
<v Speaker 1>it was a fair decision.</v>

2223
00:58:57.371 --> 00:58:58.204
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>

2224
00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:00.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone lost in that fight.</v>

2225
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.000
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2226
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.110
<v Speaker 1>going to the judges.</v>

2227
00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.230
<v Speaker 1>I did have Connor slightly edging that fight.</v>

2228
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:05.901
<v Speaker 1>I think you,</v>

2229
00:59:05.901 --> 00:59:07.150
<v Speaker 1>you look at the damage done,</v>

2230
00:59:07.151 --> 00:59:08.050
<v Speaker 1>he did more damage,</v>

2231
00:59:08.051 --> 00:59:08.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2232
00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:09.370
<v Speaker 1>he dropped Nate.</v>

2233
00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:10.570
<v Speaker 1>You know what makes sense about that?</v>

2234
00:59:10.571 --> 00:59:15.571
<v Speaker 1>I saw at the grocery store randomly and he was saying that he was falling on</v>

2235
00:59:16.151 --> 00:59:17.890
<v Speaker 1>purpose to dupe Connor and he goes,</v>

2236
00:59:17.891 --> 00:59:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I knew the first two rounds,</v>

2237
00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:20.050
<v Speaker 1>three rounds are going to be,</v>

2238
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:21.590
<v Speaker 1>he's so fast as me,</v>

2239
00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 1>tough.</v>

2240
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.851
<v Speaker 1>So when he hit me,</v>

2241
00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:25.580
<v Speaker 1>the plan was to fall down to get him to false down,</v>

2242
00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:26.630
<v Speaker 1>to follow me down.</v>

2243
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:27.021
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2244
00:59:27.021 --> 00:59:28.130
<v Speaker 1>cause I couldn't take him down.</v>

2245
00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.500
<v Speaker 1>So the plan was given to follow me down there.</v>

2246
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2247
00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:31.850
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

2248
00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:33.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a risky game plan.</v>

2249
00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:34.100
<v Speaker 1>That's what that,</v>

2250
00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:35.450
<v Speaker 1>that's from the horse's mouth,</v>

2251
00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:36.350
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2252
00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:37.160
<v Speaker 1>that's one of those,</v>

2253
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.850
<v Speaker 1>is that one of those I meant to do that things.</v>

2254
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.153
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2255
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:41.533
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2256
00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Nate.</v>

2257
00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:46.400
<v Speaker 1>He has enough to be like you serious as the pee wee Herman defense.</v>

2258
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>

2259
00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I meant to do that,</v>

2260
00:59:48.690 --> 00:59:49.340
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

2261
00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2262
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2263
00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:50.781
<v Speaker 1>me either way.</v>

2264
00:59:50.781 --> 00:59:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Nate's one of the best in the world and there's a more of a nightmare at 55 is</v>

2265
00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:55.143
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get to,</v>

2266
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:55.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2267
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:56.330
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2268
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:58.370
<v Speaker 1>He's a tougher fight at 55 I mean,</v>

2269
00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:00.020
<v Speaker 1>I think you fight better when he's lighter.</v>

2270
01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:00.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2271
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.970
<v Speaker 1>it's probably sucks to get down there,</v>

2272
01:00:01.971 --> 01:00:03.770
<v Speaker 1>but your lighter and you move faster is better.</v>

2273
01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Cardio is going to be a good fight,</v>

2274
01:00:05.691 --> 01:00:05.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2275
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:06.740
<v Speaker 1>This will be a good fight.</v>

2276
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Kenny Robertson and Hong Kong narrow.</v>

2277
01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:11.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to watch 30 seconds with a nice knee to the body there.</v>

2278
01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.610
<v Speaker 1>So I think what I love about Connor is it,</v>

2279
01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:16.510
<v Speaker 1>that's what he wants to do.</v>

2280
01:00:16.511 --> 01:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he could make 45 anymore.</v>

2281
01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean either there's camp says he can either.</v>

2282
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.360
<v Speaker 1>It's just too hard to match so bad.</v>

2283
01:00:22.361 --> 01:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>He has the 45 belt.</v>

2284
01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>He just beat Nate at 70 then let's say he Merck's Eddie Alvarez,</v>

2285
01:00:27.481 --> 01:00:29.530
<v Speaker 1>so he's the one 45 one 55 champ.</v>

2286
01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.180
<v Speaker 1>What then what do you do?</v>

2287
01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I kind of want to see him rematch.</v>

2288
01:00:32.681 --> 01:00:35.050
<v Speaker 1>All though though I kind of do a kind of honesty.</v>

2289
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Don't fight again at 45 it nothing that when they say it's too tough for him now</v>

2290
01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:41.230
<v Speaker 1>and stuff,</v>

2291
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>corneal got their back.</v>

2292
01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:43.750
<v Speaker 1>This is no good.</v>

2293
01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:43.961
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2294
01:00:43.961 --> 01:00:44.771
<v Speaker 1>I like high butterflies.</v>

2295
01:00:44.771 --> 01:00:49.771
<v Speaker 1>That back leg on Max took it that way to the back.</v>

2296
01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:51.251
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2297
01:00:51.251 --> 01:00:51.581
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

2298
01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Squeeze.</v>

2299
01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.470
<v Speaker 1>That's nice control.</v>

2300
01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I think there's better fight at 45 when you think of all though.</v>

2301
01:00:56.441 --> 01:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Max Holloway Shit.</v>

2302
01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:58.361
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2303
01:00:58.361 --> 01:00:58.691
<v Speaker 1>Kenny.</v>

2304
01:00:58.691 --> 01:00:59.321
<v Speaker 1>Good job.</v>

2305
01:00:59.321 --> 01:01:00.154
<v Speaker 1>Recovering.</v>

2306
01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Still still babbling.</v>

2307
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2308
01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>he goes deep half.</v>

2309
01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:05.733
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

2310
01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Go narrow.</v>

2311
01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2312
01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Kimmy Robertson with that wrestling.</v>

2313
01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:10.383
<v Speaker 1>Very nice.</v>

2314
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Nice escape.</v>

2315
01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Kenny Roberts has got some weird hand movements.</v>

2316
01:01:14.351 --> 01:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>He does right before he punches.</v>

2317
01:01:15.701 --> 01:01:16.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2318
01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:17.730
<v Speaker 1>he like key let's Danish.</v>

2319
01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:18.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2320
01:01:18.221 --> 01:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>He lets his hands go limp and her around.</v>

2321
01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he does that on purpose.</v>

2322
01:01:22.061 --> 01:01:23.590
<v Speaker 1>So when there's a strategy behind that,</v>

2323
01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>like maybe to remind himself to fight loose.</v>

2324
01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:29.933
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2325
01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it's just a tick.</v>

2326
01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2327
01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:32.791
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was like,</v>

2328
01:01:32.791 --> 01:01:32.881
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2329
01:01:32.881 --> 01:01:33.714
<v Speaker 1>this twitches</v>

2330
01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>on his hands when he was fun.</v>

2331
01:01:38.101 --> 01:01:38.934
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2332
01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:40.733
<v Speaker 1>For relax.</v>

2333
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I can relax.</v>

2334
01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:42.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2335
01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.473
<v Speaker 1>Pancreas.</v>

2336
01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>That's so easy said than done.</v>

2337
01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're finding someone that just constantly puts pressure on</v>

2338
01:01:50.401 --> 01:01:51.234
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2339
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:55.340
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2340
01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:55.690
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>

2341
01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>going back to that cardio thing,</v>

2342
01:01:57.111 --> 01:01:57.740
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2343
01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:01.970
<v Speaker 1>when two guys are skillfully like very similar,</v>

2344
01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:07.090
<v Speaker 1>but one guy's just got some stupendous Marv Marinovich style gas tank and he</v>

2345
01:02:08.721 --> 01:02:09.560
<v Speaker 1>knows how to fight,</v>

2346
01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:13.880
<v Speaker 1>but now he's just got this unbelievable gas tank talking about that Cain</v>

2347
01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Velasquez.</v>

2348
01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:14.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2349
01:02:14.421 --> 01:02:14.631
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2350
01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:14.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2351
01:02:14.811 --> 01:02:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Kane knows how to fight obviously,</v>

2352
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:20.210
<v Speaker 1>but with the scariest thing about Kane is the volume he puts</v>

2353
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.510
<v Speaker 2>cardio's at heavyweight.</v>

2354
01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:22.523
<v Speaker 2>It's insane,</v>

2355
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:23.671

2358
01:02:29.401 --> 01:02:30.510
<v Speaker 2>steep avers Kane.</v>

2359
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the fucking fight of the century,</v>

2360
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:33.450
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>

2361

<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2362
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Besides a roid to the Dick Overeem versa judge juiced up Brock,</v>

2363
01:02:40.441 --> 01:02:41.520

2364
01:02:41.521 --> 01:02:41.791

2365
01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:42.624

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:50.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a great fight.</v>

2373
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.110
<v Speaker 2>They're very similar man.</v>

2374
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.691
<v Speaker 2>Steve Bay.</v>

2375
01:02:52.691 --> 01:02:54.330
<v Speaker 2>So gangster out of the two,</v>

2376
01:02:54.331 --> 01:02:57.570
<v Speaker 2>which was rather see the to city to city.</v>

2377
01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:01.523
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying,</v>

2378
01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:02.720
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2379
01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:02.821
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2380
01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:03.001
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2381
01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:03.221
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2382
01:03:03.221 --> 01:03:05.300
<v Speaker 2>not in 2016 or 2017.</v>

2383
01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:08.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to see juiced up rain verse juiced up Brock.</v>

2384
01:03:08.191 --> 01:03:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

2385
01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:08.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2386
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:09.880
<v Speaker 2>if they hadn't had that first fight,</v>

2387
01:03:09.881 --> 01:03:12.930
<v Speaker 2>I would you bring them back to the same place they were.</v>

2388
01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Same place they were at the time.</v>

2389
01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:15.160
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2390
01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.740
<v Speaker 2>That first fight in the UFC,</v>

2391
01:03:16.741 --> 01:03:17.150
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2392
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Brock making a comeback after losing his title.</v>

2393
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:19.921
<v Speaker 2>I disagree.</v>

2394
01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Steve Avers Keynes,</v>

2395
01:03:20.911 --> 01:03:21.691
<v Speaker 2>the fucking fine.</v>

2396
01:03:21.691 --> 01:03:22.740
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to disagree.</v>

2397
01:03:22.741 --> 01:03:23.574
<v Speaker 2>We just have,</v>

2398
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.820
<v Speaker 2>we want different things out of this world would be a disagreement.</v>

2399
01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:28.020
<v Speaker 2>I want nothing wrong with that.</v>

2400
01:03:28.021 --> 01:03:28.860
<v Speaker 2>I want you city</v>

2401
01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.190
<v Speaker 2>to city on a football field.</v>

2402
01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.053
<v Speaker 2>How I'm to</v>

2403
01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:36.870
<v Speaker 2>on a football field,</v>

2404
01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.740
<v Speaker 2>I think the cage is an artificial boundary and I think it plays a big factor in</v>

2405
01:03:43.741 --> 01:03:45.840
<v Speaker 2>movement and a big factor in the fight.</v>

2406
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:48.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean how much fucking foot work do you need?</v>

2407
01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.070
<v Speaker 2>25 foot or 30 foot came as if they have 30 feats.</v>

2408
01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:52.970
<v Speaker 2>A big case</v>

2409
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:56.310
<v Speaker 2>you could have the cage the way it is.</v>

2410
01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Where did they start to have a border where if you pass that border you've got</v>

2411
01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.840
<v Speaker 2>to get back inside.</v>

2412
01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:03.990
<v Speaker 2>So the cage never becomes a factor.</v>

2413
01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:08.460
<v Speaker 2>So like if you're fighting and you take a guy down and he know his ass scoots</v>

2414
01:04:08.461 --> 01:04:09.330
<v Speaker 2>outside of the,</v>

2415
01:04:09.331 --> 01:04:09.530
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2416
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:10.620
<v Speaker 2>the boundary line,</v>

2417
01:04:10.621 --> 01:04:11.454
<v Speaker 2>but there's still,</v>

2418
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2419
01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:13.290
<v Speaker 2>50 feet in any one direction.</v>

2420
01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:14.550
<v Speaker 2>If someone's driving forward,</v>

2421
01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:15.420
<v Speaker 2>you take that guy,</v>

2422
01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.440
<v Speaker 2>you move into the middle of the cage or the middle of the mat and you assume the</v>

2423
01:04:19.441 --> 01:04:20.274
<v Speaker 2>same position.</v>

2424
01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:21.653
<v Speaker 2>That's not hard to do.</v>

2425
01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:23.160
<v Speaker 2>They did that in pride all day long.</v>

2426
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:24.001
<v Speaker 2>They could do that.</v>

2427
01:04:24.001 --> 01:04:24.780
<v Speaker 2>They have replaced,</v>

2428
01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:26.460
<v Speaker 2>they can see exactly where it guy was set up.</v>

2429
01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:27.510
<v Speaker 2>The referee holds on,</v>

2430
01:04:27.511 --> 01:04:27.991
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready,</v>

2431
01:04:27.991 --> 01:04:28.441
<v Speaker 2>set,</v>

2432
01:04:28.441 --> 01:04:28.980
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

2433
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.270
<v Speaker 2>and you go back to fighting again.</v>

2434
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:34.590
<v Speaker 2>That way there's never any artificial cage that's in the way that helps you get</v>

2435
01:04:34.591 --> 01:04:35.550
<v Speaker 2>back up to your feet.</v>

2436
01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Everybody would have way harder,</v>

2437
01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.950
<v Speaker 2>way harder time getting back up to their feet if there was no cage.</v>

2438
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.120
<v Speaker 2>If you couldn't wall walk,</v>

2439
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:43.980
<v Speaker 2>it's a big guy that take Tatum.</v>

2440
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:45.293
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2441
01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:46.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2442
01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:47.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2443
01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.210
<v Speaker 2>The dropdown.</v>

2444
01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Scoop your hands together because the guy can't move.</v>

2445
01:04:50.131 --> 01:04:51.990
<v Speaker 2>He can't keep backing up and pummeling under,</v>

2446
01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:55.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard to take guys down when they're against the fence and they're just</v>

2447
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.360
<v Speaker 2>her at the fence.</v>

2448
01:04:56.570 --> 01:04:57.660
<v Speaker 2>The two part to that,</v>

2449
01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.200
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2450
01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.220
<v Speaker 2>If the fence wasn't there,</v>

2451
01:04:59.221 --> 01:05:00.580
<v Speaker 2>they'd get you down.</v>

2452
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Easy a check.</v>

2453
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.790
<v Speaker 2>It's a factor.</v>

2454
01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:04.170
<v Speaker 2>The cage is a fact.</v>

2455
01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I liked that factor.</v>

2456
01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.053
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the game.</v>

2457
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2458
01:05:06.311 --> 01:05:07.144
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>

2459
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:09.390
<v Speaker 2>There needs to be board fence,</v>

2460
01:05:09.391 --> 01:05:10.260
<v Speaker 2>wrestling sport.</v>

2461
01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't watch Nascar Elevator,</v>

2462
01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>funny guy down and the guys got to use</v>

2463
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.300
<v Speaker 3>the fence.</v>

2464
01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.100
<v Speaker 3>I have to get taken down.</v>

2465
01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.100
<v Speaker 3>You got to like a minute to take him down or something.</v>

2466
01:05:21.101 --> 01:05:24.430
<v Speaker 3>The guys that get really good at that translate to MMA a lot better.</v>

2467
01:05:24.431 --> 01:05:24.910
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2468
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:25.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2469
01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:25.990
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2470
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I think that we would be better off though if it wasn't a factor,</v>

2471
01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.730
<v Speaker 3>but just think that's not going to happen.</v>

2472
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.050
<v Speaker 3>We just think it's too late for that.</v>

2473
01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:32.891
<v Speaker 3>Thinks what I think.</v>

2474
01:05:32.891 --> 01:05:37.891
<v Speaker 3>I think fighting as a sport should be as pure as possible and it's not as pure</v>

2475
01:05:38.441 --> 01:05:39.430
<v Speaker 3>as possible.</v>

2476
01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:42.100
<v Speaker 3>I think kicks on the ground soccer kick stomps.</v>

2477
01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.053
<v Speaker 3>No cage,</v>

2478
01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:44.430
<v Speaker 3>no gloves about mouthpiece.</v>

2479
01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:44.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2480
01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2481
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:47.740
<v Speaker 3>Mouthpieces didn't have you get punched.</v>

2482
01:05:47.741 --> 01:05:49.570
<v Speaker 3>It's going to go straight through your fucking lips,</v>

2483
01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.930
<v Speaker 3>your teeth go through your and stuff.</v>

2484
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Bacteria [inaudible] staff.</v>

2485
01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:57.370
<v Speaker 3>I could see it coming now.</v>

2486
01:05:57.450 --> 01:05:58.570
<v Speaker 3>He could get staff on your knuckles.</v>

2487
01:05:58.571 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 3>So that is a good point because when guys punch guys with bare teeth,</v>

2488
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:02.441
<v Speaker 3>like in street fights,</v>

2489
01:06:02.441 --> 01:06:04.160
<v Speaker 3>they get staff all the times.</v>

2490
01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:05.270
<v Speaker 3>More common than you'd think.</v>

2491
01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:07.590
<v Speaker 3>It's real dangerous if you don't treat it just broke.</v>

2492
01:06:07.591 --> 01:06:09.460
<v Speaker 3>My hand falls off gang green and shit.</v>

2493
01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

2494
01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:10.593
<v Speaker 3>that's nasty.</v>

2495
01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Human mouth is gross,</v>

2496
01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:15.070
<v Speaker 3>but just between the cage and the soccer kicks on the ground,</v>

2497
01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:17.500
<v Speaker 3>how the different the sport would evolve in five years.</v>

2498
01:06:17.501 --> 01:06:20.830
<v Speaker 3>It would change how different kicks in the ground techniques you guys would be</v>

2499
01:06:20.831 --> 01:06:21.131
<v Speaker 3>using.</v>

2500
01:06:21.131 --> 01:06:23.230
<v Speaker 3>Everything that you'd be doing kicks on the ground to the face.</v>

2501
01:06:23.231 --> 01:06:27.010
<v Speaker 3>They should already do combos where a guy's mounted like Vander light used to</v>

2502
01:06:27.011 --> 01:06:27.530
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2503
01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:28.363
<v Speaker 3>He'd get them out,</v>

2504
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:29.740
<v Speaker 3>throw a couple punches,</v>

2505
01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:32.050
<v Speaker 3>then stand up and just stop and walk away.</v>

2506
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:33.401
<v Speaker 3>That's a combo,</v>

2507
01:06:33.401 --> 01:06:33.551
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2508
01:06:33.551 --> 01:06:35.560
<v Speaker 3>If a guy should can upkick you,</v>

2509
01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:36.730
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to stomp him.</v>

2510
01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:37.853
<v Speaker 3>Hundred percent,</v>

2511
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:41.140
<v Speaker 3>hundred percent changes the game of Jujitsu,</v>

2512
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:44.620
<v Speaker 3>like tremendously elbows to the back of the head.</v>

2513
01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:45.641
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2514
01:06:45.641 --> 01:06:46.780
<v Speaker 3>you better make a move quick.</v>

2515
01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.100
<v Speaker 3>You can't date turtled up.</v>

2516
01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:49.423
<v Speaker 3>Turn on was,</v>

2517
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:51.810
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to fuck a dude up for Tertullian.</v>

2518
01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:54.550
<v Speaker 3>How many dudes just get broken by that though.</v>

2519
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:56.880
<v Speaker 3>How many careers get caught short?</v>

2520
01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.770
<v Speaker 3>You see it coming and like after a while the rep would go,</v>

2521
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.260
<v Speaker 3>you know if you do this can hold it for three seconds.</v>

2522
01:07:02.261 --> 01:07:03.100
<v Speaker 3>And the guy didn't move.</v>

2523
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:04.241
<v Speaker 3>He stopped the fight.</v>

2524
01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:04.451
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2525
01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:05.630
<v Speaker 3>I have to connect</v>

2526
01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:10.330
<v Speaker 3>Gary Goodrich and that was that one of his page or fights.</v>

2527
01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:11.640
<v Speaker 3>He got them in the fucking crucifix.</v>

2528
01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:12.483
<v Speaker 3>Just doubled.</v>

2529
01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.490
<v Speaker 3>That was probably the worst Nacada version.</v>

2530
01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:20.520
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking when Gary Goodrich grabbed the guy's Dick crushed the Pedro dude</v>

2531
01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.200
<v Speaker 3>in Brazil.</v>

2532
01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.820
<v Speaker 3>He reached into his pants and grabbed his dick and balls and crushed,</v>

2533
01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.713
<v Speaker 3>crushed</v>

2534
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:28.900
<v Speaker 3>peanut butter them.</v>

2535
01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:30.040
<v Speaker 3>They actually happen.</v>

2536
01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:30.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2537
01:07:30.161 --> 01:07:30.994
<v Speaker 3>there's no rules.</v>

2538
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:31.810
<v Speaker 3>There's no rules.</v>

2539
01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:33.130
<v Speaker 3>Zero sweaty and shit.</v>

2540
01:07:33.131 --> 01:07:34.770
<v Speaker 3>Just put it's rest of nuts.</v>

2541
01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Brazilians like wearing those pro wrestling briefs.</v>

2542
01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Gary.</v>

2543
01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.473
<v Speaker 3>Good</v>

2544
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:43.060
<v Speaker 3>vicious growing attacks.</v>

2545
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2546
01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>

2547
01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:45.503
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's good.</v>

2548
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.540
<v Speaker 3>That's after the fight is trying to,</v>

2549
01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:46.961
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

2550
01:07:46.961 --> 01:07:47.890
<v Speaker 3>you know I'm just doing my phone.</v>

2551
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:50.910
<v Speaker 3>Sorry about that thing.</v>

2552
01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:54.790
<v Speaker 3>Crabs are like the squoze your balls and Dick.</v>

2553
01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2554
01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:57.723
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>

2555
01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:00.910
<v Speaker 3>So Kenny Robertson on top horn Carnero on the bottom,</v>

2556
01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:02.140
<v Speaker 3>looking for the arm triangle,</v>

2557
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:03.070
<v Speaker 3>not pulling it off.</v>

2558
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:06.520
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be hard to do anything excited for Uriah Hall Brunson.</v>

2559
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:07.130
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>

2560
01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:09.010
<v Speaker 3>He's coming after Eddie in this position.</v>

2561
01:08:09.011 --> 01:08:09.251
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2562
01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:09.471
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2563
01:08:09.471 --> 01:08:10.031
<v Speaker 3>you want to,</v>

2564
01:08:10.031 --> 01:08:12.140
<v Speaker 3>you want an under hook on that side right there on the bottom.</v>

2565
01:08:12.141 --> 01:08:14.590
<v Speaker 3>It has the half guard bottom wants to get the under hook.</v>

2566
01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Obviously the guy on top on her</v>

2567
01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>to keep that under hook and keep that head and arm and Cornell went right to us.</v>

2568
01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:20.301
<v Speaker 1>He knows what he's doing.</v>

2569
01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2570
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:21.350
<v Speaker 1>you went right to it.</v>

2571
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:22.201
<v Speaker 1>Went right to that again.</v>

2572
01:08:22.201 --> 01:08:22.610
<v Speaker 1>The Cook,</v>

2573
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:23.221
<v Speaker 1>he's not planned.</v>

2574
01:08:23.221 --> 01:08:24.054
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty definitely.</v>

2575
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2576
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:26.150
<v Speaker 1>He's super talented.</v>

2577
01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Super talented.</v>

2578
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.340

01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:29.510
<v Speaker 1>guard for guys that have no flexibility.</v>

2652
01:10:29.511 --> 01:10:30.770

<v Speaker 1>I was going to try and go for a on now,</v>

2667
01:10:47.791 --> 01:10:49.190
<v Speaker 1>but I got it right there.</v>

2668
01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the master rat.</v>

2669
01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Jamie needs a raise.</v>

2670
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:55.010
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Jamie is on the ball.</v>

2672
01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Coffee Son.</v>

2673
01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.390
<v Speaker 1>But now he turns it off.</v>

2674
01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Now I take back what I said.</v>

2675
01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:06.030
<v Speaker 1>So this is a,</v>

2676
01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:09.590
<v Speaker 1>this is rat guard so that it's second round has got the grip down.</v>

2677
01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Hi Rat was,</v>

2678
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:15.240
<v Speaker 1>it sounds very rat.</v>

2679
01:11:15.241 --> 01:11:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Like listen.</v>

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.070

2682
01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:22.710
<v Speaker 5>So you notice I had certain angles I can't play in this.</v>

2683
01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:27.890
<v Speaker 5>I developed the light guard as an alternative to the rubber guard because I have</v>

2684
01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:30.890
<v Speaker 5>paralysis in my life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but fuck it seems like an interesting option.</v>

2723
01:12:31.711 --> 01:12:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Sold.</v>

2724
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.570
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2725
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2726
01:12:32.970 --> 01:12:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm all over it now.</v>

2727
01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:37.260
<v Speaker 1>I see Cornell is going to be super nervous now.</v>

2728
01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:43.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean Robertson's gotta be super nervous now being reversed in a position like</v>

2729
01:12:43.411 --> 01:12:43.680
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2730
01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Put it in a bag is really good and he's got good wrestling so,</v>

2731
01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:48.050
<v Speaker 1>oh that was all kind of,</v>

2732
01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:50.170
<v Speaker 1>oh Riverside,</v>

2733
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:52.890
<v Speaker 1>thank goodness.</v>

2734
01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Nice exchange.</v>

2735
01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Mice Robertson is,</v>

2736
01:12:55.860 --> 01:13:00.860
<v Speaker 1>oh see this verdict by get that cardio ups.</v>

2737
01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.440
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know like what is the barrier?</v>

2738
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Very best method to prepare.</v>

2739
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I would really like to know,</v>

2740
01:13:09.901 --> 01:13:14.850
<v Speaker 1>like is it possible that Hong Carnero could have done something different and</v>

2741
01:13:14.851 --> 01:13:18.990
<v Speaker 1>could be like mighty mouse here in this third round or is it simply a function</v>

2742
01:13:18.991 --> 01:13:21.480
<v Speaker 1>of being 170 pounds being a bigger man,</v>

2743
01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:22.314
<v Speaker 1>cutting the way down.</v>

2744
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Is it I,</v>

2745
01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

2746
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.271
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2747
01:13:24.271 --> 01:13:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure genetics or something to do with it for sure.</v>

2748
01:13:26.311 --> 01:13:26.980
<v Speaker 1>I just want to,</v>

2749
01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I always want you to tell your body to gas and I mean that's what real sprinting</v>

2750
01:13:30.691 --> 01:13:33.780
<v Speaker 1>is to train your body to gas and recovering gas recovery on a clock.</v>

2751
01:13:33.781 --> 01:13:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Gas Recovery,</v>

2752
01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.580
<v Speaker 1>gas recover.</v>

2753
01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:39.450
<v Speaker 1>So you do it so much so you could be fucking dead tired and the match and you're</v>

2754
01:13:39.451 --> 01:13:39.631
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2755
01:13:39.631 --> 01:13:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to recover in about 20 seconds.</v>

2756
01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.920
<v Speaker 1>The fights are so train your body,</v>

2757
01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:43.650
<v Speaker 1>the nerve,</v>

2758
01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:43.981
<v Speaker 1>she can't.</v>

2759
01:13:43.981 --> 01:13:46.200
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to train it to a t.</v>

2760
01:13:46.201 --> 01:13:47.100
<v Speaker 1>It is little things.</v>

2761
01:13:47.101 --> 01:13:48.240
<v Speaker 1>It was a perfect answer.</v>

2762
01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.260
<v Speaker 1>It's there's,</v>

2763
01:13:49.650 --> 01:13:50.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean there may be,</v>

2764
01:13:50.401 --> 01:13:52.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's about optimization like right.</v>

2765
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:54.390
<v Speaker 1>How could you take a guy,</v>

2766
01:13:54.391 --> 01:13:55.920
<v Speaker 1>like whether it's Carnero Oh shit,</v>

2767
01:13:55.921 --> 01:13:58.080
<v Speaker 1>beautiful left hook or anybody,</v>

2768
01:13:58.081 --> 01:14:03.081
<v Speaker 1>any fighter for that matter and train them physically to like a perfect state,</v>

2769
01:14:03.211 --> 01:14:05.760
<v Speaker 1>like turn Woodley and a fucking Demetrius Johnson.</v>

2770
01:14:05.761 --> 01:14:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2771
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:07.380
<v Speaker 1>but will you wouldn't,</v>

2772
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously Johnson doesn't have the kind of horsepower the Woodley has</v>

2773
01:14:10.081 --> 01:14:10.680
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

2774
01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.513
<v Speaker 1>When you have</v>

2775
01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.410
<v Speaker 6>a huge part of it,</v>

2776
01:14:14.411 --> 01:14:15.161
<v Speaker 6>like the vehicle,</v>

2777
01:14:15.161 --> 01:14:16.400
<v Speaker 6>the vessel you're messing with,</v>

2778
01:14:16.401 --> 01:14:17.770
<v Speaker 6>you can only do so much.</v>

2779
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.630
<v Speaker 6>What I did was swim sprints.</v>

2780
01:14:19.631 --> 01:14:21.820
<v Speaker 6>And what I liked about that is first of all,</v>

2781
01:14:21.821 --> 01:14:22.654
<v Speaker 6>I hate running,</v>

2782
01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:24.730
<v Speaker 6>but when you're doing swim sprints,</v>

2783
01:14:24.850 --> 01:14:27.070
<v Speaker 6>no matter how exhausted you get,</v>

2784
01:14:27.071 --> 01:14:28.210
<v Speaker 6>like give you 20 of them or whatever,</v>

2785
01:14:28.211 --> 01:14:29.044
<v Speaker 6>that's what I was doing.</v>

2786
01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:29.590
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2787
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.510
<v Speaker 6>no matter how exhausted you get at 14,</v>

2788
01:14:31.511 --> 01:14:32.410
<v Speaker 6>15 and 16,</v>

2789
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.420
<v Speaker 6>when you're sprinting across the pool,</v>

2790
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:34.920
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

2791
01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.340
<v Speaker 6>your breathing has to be perfect.</v>

2792
01:14:36.341 --> 01:14:39.210
<v Speaker 6>So there's all this chaos going on in your head and you're sprinting.</v>

2793
01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:42.220
<v Speaker 6>You're breathing has to be perfectly swallow water.</v>

2794
01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.620
<v Speaker 6>So that,</v>

2795
01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:44.411
<v Speaker 6>that's the beauty.</v>

2796
01:14:44.411 --> 01:14:44.801
<v Speaker 6>And then there's,</v>

2797
01:14:44.801 --> 01:14:45.001
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2798
01:14:45.001 --> 01:14:45.791
<v Speaker 6>the impact,</v>

2799
01:14:45.791 --> 01:14:46.601
<v Speaker 6>there's no impact.</v>

2800
01:14:46.601 --> 01:14:47.830
<v Speaker 6>It's a natural movement.</v>

2801
01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:48.810
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2802
01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:49.150
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2803
01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:49.370
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2804
01:14:49.370 --> 01:14:49.650
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2805
01:14:49.650 --> 01:14:53.200
<v Speaker 6>it makes you focus when you focus on your breathing,</v>

2806
01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:55.390
<v Speaker 6>when you know you're your worst possible.</v>

2807
01:14:55.850 --> 01:15:00.460
<v Speaker 6>I think also for Jujitsu it's really good because it's not just leg dependent</v>

2808
01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:01.900
<v Speaker 6>because when you're running,</v>

2809
01:15:01.901 --> 01:15:04.000
<v Speaker 6>it's your arms rarely get tired.</v>

2810
01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.300
<v Speaker 6>What's getting tired or your legs like almost only your legs,</v>

2811
01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:08.680
<v Speaker 6>your lungs and your legs.</v>

2812
01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:11.680
<v Speaker 6>Your arms are obviously playing a park because you're pumping,</v>

2813
01:15:11.681 --> 01:15:12.490
<v Speaker 6>your arms are moving,</v>

2814
01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:14.680
<v Speaker 6>but they're not getting nearly as tired as your fucking legs.</v>

2815
01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:16.043
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2816
01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:16.781
<v Speaker 6>When you're swimming,</v>

2817
01:15:16.781 --> 01:15:17.980
<v Speaker 6>your arms get tired as fuck.</v>

2818
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:19.623
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2819
01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.490
<v Speaker 6>Tiredness to me.</v>

2820
01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:22.750
<v Speaker 6>And if you wear flippers,</v>

2821
01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:24.520
<v Speaker 6>I bet your legs get even more work.</v>

2822
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.950
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2823
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:28.400
<v Speaker 6>Because all the resistance to do flippers on the hands to their hands.</v>

2824
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.430
<v Speaker 6>Maurice doggy paddle.</v>

2825
01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:31.600
<v Speaker 6>You don't even have to swim.</v>

2826
01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:32.560
<v Speaker 6>You just have to sprint,</v>

2827
01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:33.041
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2828
01:15:33.041 --> 01:15:33.860
<v Speaker 6>and yeah.</v>

2829
01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:34.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2830
01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:34.990
<v Speaker 6>That's some bullshit.</v>

2831
01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:35.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2832
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:36.423
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2833
01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:37.420
<v Speaker 6>You really,</v>

2834
01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:38.340
<v Speaker 6>you really need to get,</v>

2835
01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:38.740
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

2836
01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:41.650
<v Speaker 6>if you want to do it right and get it with a swim coach so he can get efficient</v>

2837
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.690
<v Speaker 6>and learn how to really do it.</v>

2838
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:45.550
<v Speaker 6>Ken Robinson coming on strong here.</v>

2839
01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:47.371
<v Speaker 6>Nice Jab my car.</v>

2840
01:15:47.371 --> 01:15:47.661
<v Speaker 6>Narrow.</v>

2841
01:15:47.661 --> 01:15:48.520
<v Speaker 6>You can do it on your own.</v>

2842
01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:49.360
<v Speaker 6>You don't need a trainer.</v>

2843
01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:52.180
<v Speaker 6>The cool thing about swimming is if,</v>

2844
01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:57.020
<v Speaker 6>if you do it on a clock where every time the clock hits 12 you sprint and</v>

2845
01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:00.550
<v Speaker 6>however it takes you to a long to get it across the pool could be 25% gains.</v>

2846
01:16:00.551 --> 01:16:01.600
<v Speaker 6>It can be 23 seconds,</v>

2847
01:16:01.601 --> 01:16:02.440
<v Speaker 6>27 seconds.</v>

2848
01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.530
<v Speaker 6>You rest until that clock hits 12 again.</v>

2849
01:16:05.531 --> 01:16:05.990
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

2850
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:09.490
<v Speaker 6>so you ended up doing is you don't need anybody to tell you to push your</v>

2851
01:16:09.491 --> 01:16:11.140
<v Speaker 6>sprinting for that rest time.</v>

2852
01:16:11.141 --> 01:16:11.470
<v Speaker 6>It's an,</v>

2853
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:12.370
<v Speaker 6>it's a mind fuck.</v>

2854
01:16:12.670 --> 01:16:17.260
<v Speaker 6>That's the beauty of the sprints and the water to you're sprinting to rest.</v>

2855
01:16:17.261 --> 01:16:17.741
<v Speaker 6>Cause you know,</v>

2856
01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:19.990
<v Speaker 6>if you fuck up and you just like kind of give up halfway through,</v>

2857
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.640
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna fuck up the rotation.</v>

2858
01:16:21.641 --> 01:16:22.091
<v Speaker 6>The clock.</v>

2859
01:16:22.091 --> 01:16:23.390
<v Speaker 6>Now you fucked your whole system up there.</v>

2860
01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:23.960
<v Speaker 6>I love swimming.</v>

2861
01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.710
<v Speaker 6>You got to do that 20 times across like,</v>

2862
01:16:26.711 --> 01:16:26.921
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2863
01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:28.840
<v Speaker 6>pulled it like you got a 24 hour fitness.</v>

2864
01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:29.620
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2865
01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:30.940
<v Speaker 6>it's like a 20 yard pool.</v>

2866
01:16:30.941 --> 01:16:31.630
<v Speaker 6>20 I dunno,</v>

2867
01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:32.890
<v Speaker 6>maybe 39 the ocean.</v>

2868
01:16:32.891 --> 01:16:33.551
<v Speaker 6>If you're gangster,</v>

2869
01:16:33.551 --> 01:16:34.384
<v Speaker 6>son,</v>

2870
01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:34.810
<v Speaker 6>barn,</v>

2871
01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:37.720
<v Speaker 6>Carneros running out of gas here in the heart and the ocean.</v>

2872
01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.400
<v Speaker 6>Like where do you stop and where do you go?</v>

2873
01:16:39.401 --> 01:16:40.234
<v Speaker 6>I'm stopping.</v>

2874
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:44.620
<v Speaker 6>You got to have a clear start and stop points.</v>

2875
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:46.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2876
01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:48.190
<v Speaker 6>Or You just doing it for time.</v>

2877
01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:48.940
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

2878
01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.570
<v Speaker 6>Do it different.</v>

2879
01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:52.480
<v Speaker 6>That's a whole different scenario.</v>

2880
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:54.070
<v Speaker 6>This is just for pure sprinting.</v>

2881
01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:54.531
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2882
01:16:54.531 --> 01:16:55.730
<v Speaker 6>but you're doing off time to,</v>

2883
01:16:55.731 --> 01:16:56.710
<v Speaker 6>it's the 12 right?</v>

2884
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:59.020
<v Speaker 6>Did they make heart rate monitors that work in the ocean?</v>

2885
01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:00.090
<v Speaker 6>I Dunno.</v>

2886
01:17:00.090 --> 01:17:02.670
<v Speaker 6>I I bought the new fucking iPhone seven because I thought it could go to the</v>

2887
01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.790
<v Speaker 6>ocean for this reason.</v>

2888
01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:07.390
<v Speaker 6>Then I find out you can't go in the ocean with the iPhone seven doesn't go in</v>

2889
01:17:07.391 --> 01:17:07.780
<v Speaker 6>the ocean.</v>

2890
01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:08.710
<v Speaker 6>Well that's assault though.</v>

2891
01:17:08.711 --> 01:17:09.200
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2892
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.033
<v Speaker 6>Salt is</v>

2893
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:10.581
<v Speaker 3>really bad.</v>

2894
01:17:10.581 --> 01:17:11.630
<v Speaker 3>Now they say the water,</v>

2895
01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:13.130
<v Speaker 3>like even if you drop in fresh water,</v>

2896
01:17:13.131 --> 01:17:17.690
<v Speaker 3>you have like a couple minutes to flux are below 30 minutes.</v>

2897
01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:21.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like 30 minutes at nine feet before cardio.</v>

2898
01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:22.880
<v Speaker 3>Cardio must be nuts.</v>

2899
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Punch people in the face.</v>

2900
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Smoked cigarettes.</v>

2901
01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.590
<v Speaker 3>You got a big,</v>

2902
01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.010
<v Speaker 3>you got a big fight coming up</v>

2903
01:17:31.650 --> 01:17:32.270
<v Speaker 3>with a,</v>

2904
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:34.260
<v Speaker 3>I do a lot of running and then we expect,</v>

2905
01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:34.700
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2906
01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2907
01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.320
<v Speaker 3>how do you set it up?</v>

2908
01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:37.580
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't just go jog,</v>

2909
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:42.080
<v Speaker 3>I'll jog at least like three days a week and I'm like three to five miles and</v>

2910
01:17:42.081 --> 01:17:42.890
<v Speaker 3>then uh,</v>

2911
01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:44.840
<v Speaker 3>I'll do sprints like I used to do.</v>

2912
01:17:44.841 --> 01:17:48.650
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you do your sprint one mile sprint twice a week.</v>

2913
01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:49.543
<v Speaker 3>A full mile.</v>

2914
01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.770
<v Speaker 3>It's hard as you can go and I would try to keep track of that.</v>

2915
01:17:51.771 --> 01:17:52.401
<v Speaker 3>Touch your time.</v>

2916
01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:54.110
<v Speaker 3>So my fastest time ever,</v>

2917
01:17:54.111 --> 01:17:58.370
<v Speaker 3>which I think is still on my Instagram was like a five 28 or something like</v>

2918
01:17:58.371 --> 01:17:59.150
<v Speaker 3>that's rolling.</v>

2919
01:17:59.150 --> 01:18:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had somebody in the car like next to me yelling at me and like</v>

2920
01:18:03.201 --> 01:18:07.310
<v Speaker 3>keeping me motivated all the time and just going to have every gas been a fight</v>

2921
01:18:07.311 --> 01:18:09.020
<v Speaker 3>where you lost because you were just gassed,</v>

2922
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:10.130
<v Speaker 3>you didn't do proper cardiac.</v>

2923
01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:11.163
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2924
01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:13.513
<v Speaker 3>Number of times.</v>

2925
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:14.420
<v Speaker 3>And then after that you're like,</v>

2926
01:18:14.421 --> 01:18:14.941
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>

2927
01:18:14.941 --> 01:18:15.711
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get on with your car.</v>

2928
01:18:15.711 --> 01:18:16.610
<v Speaker 3>Who was probably on point,</v>

2929
01:18:16.611 --> 01:18:17.180
<v Speaker 3>next fight.</v>

2930
01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:17.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2931
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.901
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2932
01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:18.590
<v Speaker 3>That next fight.</v>

2933
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:19.041
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2934
01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:19.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2935
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:20.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2936
01:18:20.091 --> 01:18:20.990
<v Speaker 3>there's so many,</v>

2937
01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.390
<v Speaker 3>there's so many aspects of your,</v>

2938
01:18:23.391 --> 01:18:24.710
<v Speaker 3>just your daily life,</v>

2939
01:18:24.711 --> 01:18:27.770
<v Speaker 3>they'll fuck up your cardio or fuck up your training camp where it's like you,</v>

2940
01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:28.431
<v Speaker 3>he was saying like,</v>

2941
01:18:28.431 --> 01:18:28.760
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2942
01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:32.360
<v Speaker 3>if Cornell would have done something slightly different and it was like maybe</v>

2943
01:18:32.361 --> 01:18:35.560
<v Speaker 3>his girlfriend was pissed off at him and you know,</v>

2944
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:36.300
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what,</v>

2945
01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:37.520
<v Speaker 3>what else happened in his life.</v>

2946
01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:38.373
<v Speaker 3>It's just that just be crazy.</v>

2947
01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:39.021
<v Speaker 3>And then you're like,</v>

2948
01:18:39.021 --> 01:18:39.171
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2949
01:18:39.171 --> 01:18:43.250
<v Speaker 3>did I fuck this up because I didn't train properly or because my fucking car</v>

2950
01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:44.061
<v Speaker 3>broke down and they couldn't,</v>

2951
01:18:44.061 --> 01:18:44.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2952
01:18:44.421 --> 01:18:45.650
<v Speaker 3>whatever else happened in her life.</v>

2953
01:18:45.651 --> 01:18:46.930
<v Speaker 3>So interesting.</v>

2954
01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.880
<v Speaker 3>I like keeping peace in your life with anything you're trying to do.</v>

2955
01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:51.680
<v Speaker 3>If he can keep peace in your personal life,</v>

2956
01:18:51.681 --> 01:18:52.514
<v Speaker 3>the home life,</v>

2957
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:54.600
<v Speaker 3>everything man to hit for each,</v>

2958
01:18:54.601 --> 01:18:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell are you get you get sick or you broke your fucking toe and now you</v>

2959
01:18:58.791 --> 01:19:00.410
<v Speaker 3>can't run for that last bit.</v>

2960
01:19:00.411 --> 01:19:02.600
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of guys who were seeing me so,</v>

2961
01:19:02.601 --> 01:19:04.340
<v Speaker 3>or your shoulder joint was fucked up.</v>

2962
01:19:04.341 --> 01:19:05.840
<v Speaker 3>Now I can't do my sperm sprints.</v>

2963
01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:09.800
<v Speaker 3>And like all the shit that goes along behind the scenes with fighters is it's</v>

2964
01:19:09.801 --> 01:19:10.041
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2965
01:19:10.041 --> 01:19:10.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2966
01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:11.443
<v Speaker 3>how many guys do,</v>

2967
01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.400
<v Speaker 3>especially in entertainment,</v>

2968
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:17.600
<v Speaker 3>being comedians who were out chasing tail all the time and they're distracted.</v>

2969
01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:18.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2970
01:19:18.051 --> 01:19:18.740
<v Speaker 3>That'll do it.</v>

2971
01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:19.970
<v Speaker 3>That'll do look at athletes too.</v>

2972
01:19:19.971 --> 01:19:20.271
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2973
01:19:20.271 --> 01:19:22.700
<v Speaker 3>I know athletes who do the same thing gets in your way.</v>

2974
01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:23.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2975
01:19:23.331 --> 01:19:24.110
<v Speaker 3>It gets in your way,</v>

2976
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:25.340
<v Speaker 3>the trip over your own Dick and it all,</v>

2977
01:19:25.341 --> 01:19:26.930
<v Speaker 3>people also use it as an excuse.</v>

2978
01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:27.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2979
01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.020
<v Speaker 3>they don't do everything they could do.</v>

2980
01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.690
<v Speaker 3>So they always have that thing in the back of their head that there's room for</v>

2981
01:19:32.691 --> 01:19:34.160
<v Speaker 3>improvement and uh,</v>

2982
01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:34.431
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2983
01:19:34.431 --> 01:19:35.060
<v Speaker 3>next time,</v>

2984
01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:36.200
<v Speaker 3>next time I'll get it together.</v>

2985
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:37.130
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2986
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:38.900
<v Speaker 3>most of the time that next time never comes.</v>

2987
01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:42.600
<v Speaker 3>Your brain will give you these sort of escape routes and that,</v>

2988
01:19:42.601 --> 01:19:44.720
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the ones that unfortunately,</v>

2989
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:45.300
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2990
01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:46.660
<v Speaker 3>it seems so counterintuitive,</v>

2991
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:47.231
<v Speaker 3>but it happened.</v>

2992
01:19:47.231 --> 01:19:47.961
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people,</v>

2993
01:19:47.961 --> 01:19:50.930
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen more of it till I came to La Carnero one</v>

2994
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.570
<v Speaker 3>last,</v>

2995
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:54.403
<v Speaker 3>that last round.</v>

2996
01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:57.650
<v Speaker 3>Lucy looked like it for what we're seeing,</v>

2997
01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.540
<v Speaker 3>because Kenny Robinson was coming on strong,</v>

2998
01:19:59.541 --> 01:20:01.550
<v Speaker 3>but to take down,</v>

2999
01:20:01.551 --> 01:20:03.820
<v Speaker 3>obviously virtually didn't mission attempts.</v>

3000
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3001
01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:05.480
<v Speaker 3>Obviously we didn't score it.</v>

3002
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 3>The 30 I thought saw</v>

3003
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:09.083
<v Speaker 1>I would give to Camaro.</v>

3004
01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:12.420
<v Speaker 1>One of the last round was what was interesting to me.</v>

3005
01:20:12.421 --> 01:20:16.320
<v Speaker 1>It was because Kenny kept charging after him and this is where it reversed him.</v>

3006
01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Does this on the last round?</v>

3015
01:20:26.101 --> 01:20:29.210
<v Speaker 1>we're talking shit while we're watching these things get barely stuck.</v>

3016
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:29.731

3022
01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm fucking cheated a little bit.</v>

3031
01:20:49.951 --> 01:20:50.080
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3032

3196
01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.430
<v Speaker 3>Jason Wellness and Simon Marcus here the night she didn't fight.</v>

3197
01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:21.670
<v Speaker 3>I did crazy.</v>

3198
01:25:21.671 --> 01:25:22.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3199
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:23.110
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

3200
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.831
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>

3201
01:25:23.831 --> 01:25:24.460
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

3202
01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:25.060
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

3203
01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:25.480
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

3204
01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:28.150
<v Speaker 3>not weird that wellness knocked him out cause he can knock anybody out.</v>

3205
01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.490
<v Speaker 3>But we're that Simon at the end of that round,</v>

3206
01:25:30.491 --> 01:25:31.600
<v Speaker 3>when he was letting him punch him,</v>

3207
01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.190
<v Speaker 3>was that odd to you?</v>

3208
01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:35.373
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3209
01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:36.280
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3210
01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean Kinda,</v>

3211
01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:38.620
<v Speaker 3>I uh,</v>

3212
01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:39.453
<v Speaker 3>I think Simon,</v>

3213
01:25:40.690 --> 01:25:44.070
<v Speaker 3>I think Simon and his coach had like a falling out recently and I think it might</v>

3214
01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:46.060
<v Speaker 3>have something to do with him losing.</v>

3215
01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:46.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3216
01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:47.673
<v Speaker 3>That's always</v>

3217
01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.780
<v Speaker 3>been like that kind of weight when you fight Simon is,</v>

3218
01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:54.550
<v Speaker 3>it's like a very like ego based,</v>

3219
01:25:54.551 --> 01:25:55.060
<v Speaker 3>like very,</v>

3220
01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:55.271
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3221
01:25:55.271 --> 01:25:55.900
<v Speaker 3>ego based,</v>

3222
01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:56.321
<v Speaker 3>the right word.</v>

3223
01:25:56.321 --> 01:25:57.190
<v Speaker 3>He's like tough guy.</v>

3224
01:25:57.740 --> 01:25:58.330
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3225
01:25:58.330 --> 01:25:59.141
<v Speaker 3>So even in that fight,</v>

3226
01:25:59.141 --> 01:26:01.320
<v Speaker 3>like when Jason would do well against him,</v>

3227
01:26:01.321 --> 01:26:02.051
<v Speaker 3>wetland shots,</v>

3228
01:26:02.051 --> 01:26:03.970
<v Speaker 3>you would see Simon like blah,</v>

3229
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.440
<v Speaker 3>and then come back with like this big like a thing.</v>

3230
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:07.303
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3231
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:08.300
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what it was,</v>

3232
01:26:08.301 --> 01:26:09.530
<v Speaker 3>was I'm gonna drop my hands,</v>

3233
01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:10.251
<v Speaker 3>let this guy hit me.</v>

3234
01:26:10.251 --> 01:26:13.080
<v Speaker 3>And it also looked like it was slowing down and we're a little tired.</v>

3235
01:26:13.090 --> 01:26:13.923
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

01:31:05.010 --> 01:31:06.720
<v Speaker 1>he will be booed out of the fucking arena.</v>

3439
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:07.890
<v Speaker 1>So he's going to surprise.</v>

3440
01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:09.060
<v Speaker 1>He's going to have to do his own shit.</v>

3441
01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:10.050
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd be surprised.</v>

3442
01:31:10.190 --> 01:31:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Cause range.</v>

3443
01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Then there's Bruce buffer that was Michael Bumper.</v>

3444
01:31:12.421 --> 01:31:13.380
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>

3459
01:31:36.610 --> 01:31:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3460
01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.640

3468
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:54.270
<v Speaker 1>It's hard not to root friend Evan Dunham.</v>

3469
01:31:54.271 --> 01:31:55.320
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing it for so long.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's got a training goal now.</v>

3506
01:32:57.010 --> 01:32:58.180
<v Speaker 1>You see how he freed his leg?</v>

3507
01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:00.470
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was all about right there.</v>

3508
01:33:00.471 --> 01:33:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3509
01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Getting that leg free and he pulled it off.</v>

3510
01:33:03.341 --> 01:33:04.680
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the first deep,</v>

3511
01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:07.990
<v Speaker 1>deep shit that was on a first Japanese neckties ever in the UFC.</v>

3512
01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It was perfect.</v>

3513
01:33:09.610 --> 01:33:11.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what I meant by tournament Joe.</v>

3514
01:33:11.111 --> 01:33:11.651
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3515
01:33:11.651 --> 01:33:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Like real tournament,</v>

3516
01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:14.040
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3517
01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.610
<v Speaker 1>I told Joe Joe squared,</v>

3518
01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:16.440
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3519
01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3520
01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I totally real tournament.</v>

3521
01:33:17.741 --> 01:33:18.640
<v Speaker 1>But in my mind I was like,</v>

3522
01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:23.320
<v Speaker 1>we got our shelves with Metal Weight turn him well Jack Array versus Rockhold</v>

3523
01:33:23.321 --> 01:33:24.490
<v Speaker 1>too is very interesting.</v>

3524
01:33:24.650 --> 01:33:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

3525
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Chris looks at me getting all that model pussy.</v>

3526
01:33:27.161 --> 01:33:28.830
<v Speaker 1>He might be exhausted their Egan,</v>

3527
01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:30.130
<v Speaker 1>that Demi Lovato,</v>

3528
01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.420
<v Speaker 1>New York model.</v>

3529
01:33:31.421 --> 01:33:33.550
<v Speaker 1>That shit will fuck your life up son,</v>

3530
01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:34.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3531
01:33:34.330 --> 01:33:37.030
<v Speaker 1>or take your take your next level.</v>

3532
01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:39.320
<v Speaker 1>I just am shocked that uh,</v>

3533
01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:42.460
<v Speaker 1>that he's not fighting Weidman again.</v>

3534
01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I felt like that would be the fight to make.</v>

3535
01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Like the fight to make would be Weidman versus Rockhold to not jocker rave what</v>

3536
01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:51.030
<v Speaker 1>you do with joc.</v>

3537
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.863
<v Speaker 1>Romiro there</v>

3538
01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:53.330
<v Speaker 7>one more time.</v>

3539
01:33:53.331 --> 01:33:54.810
<v Speaker 7>We had a little problem with the dry,</v>

3540
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:59.510
<v Speaker 7>let's see what happens.</v>

3541
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Let's run this shit back.</v>

3542
01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:04.920
<v Speaker 1>He'd both gotta be clean.</v>

3543
01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:06.500
<v Speaker 1>So likewise members room.</v>

3544
01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:07.430
<v Speaker 1>So Weidman the,</v>

3545
01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:08.101
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>

3546
01:34:08.101 --> 01:34:11.160
<v Speaker 1>I was under the impression that Shakuri won that fight for some strange reason,</v>

3547
01:34:11.161 --> 01:34:12.620
<v Speaker 1>but I guess who wide,</v>

3548
01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I guess y'all were marijuana decision.</v>

3549
01:34:14.701 --> 01:34:18.570
<v Speaker 1>But then it turned out that he tested positive for some peptide or something</v>

3550
01:34:18.571 --> 01:34:18.961
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

3551
01:34:18.961 --> 01:34:20.850
<v Speaker 1>And then they found the supplement that he said he took.</v>

3552
01:34:20.851 --> 01:34:21.630
<v Speaker 1>They tested it.</v>

3553
01:34:21.630 --> 01:34:22.470
<v Speaker 1>It was positive.</v>

3554
01:34:22.770 --> 01:34:24.180
<v Speaker 1>So he gets a shorter break.</v>

3555
01:34:24.450 --> 01:34:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Check this out man there.</v>

3556
01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of time left.</v>

3557
01:34:27.031 --> 01:34:27.930
<v Speaker 1>And he's on his back.</v>

3558
01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:30.060
<v Speaker 1>We still have a finisher.</v>

3559
01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.070
<v Speaker 1>We still don't have any info on John.</v>

3560
01:34:32.071 --> 01:34:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3561
01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:35.700
<v Speaker 1>So this is a spot where Kenny Robertson caught that knee bar is right here.</v>

3562
01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:36.930
<v Speaker 1>He very similar.</v>

3563
01:34:36.931 --> 01:34:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3564
01:34:37.410 --> 01:34:37.980
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>

3565
01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:39.360
<v Speaker 1>And you do it with the head as well,</v>

3566
01:34:39.361 --> 01:34:39.601
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3567
01:34:39.601 --> 01:34:41.760
<v Speaker 1>So the guy can't lean back to be honest with you.</v>

3568
01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh you got the church should be talking about digit two.</v>

3569
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:47.183
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

3570
01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:47.970

<v Speaker 2>Go to sleep.</v>

3581
01:35:01.521 --> 01:35:02.354
<v Speaker 2>Sweet prints.</v>

3582
01:35:03.250 --> 01:35:04.083

<v Speaker 2>brilliant defense.</v>

01:35:11.781 --> 01:35:12.591
<v Speaker 2>Do you go for it again?</v>

3587
01:35:12.591 --> 01:35:13.510
<v Speaker 2>58 seconds ago.</v>

3588
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:15.770
<v Speaker 2>100% go for it.</v>

3589
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:17.390
<v Speaker 2>He might go for an arm bar right here.</v>

3590
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:21.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3591
01:35:21.141 --> 01:35:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done them looking good.</v>

3592
01:35:22.401 --> 01:35:24.140
<v Speaker 2>It's been fighting for ever.</v>

3593
01:35:24.170 --> 01:35:26.140
<v Speaker 2>So this is a position he's looking for an arm bar.</v>

3594
01:35:26.141 --> 01:35:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

3595
01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:26.811
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

3596
01:35:26.811 --> 01:35:27.180
<v Speaker 2>He's ready.</v>

3597
01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3598
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.823
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

3599
01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:30.013
<v Speaker 2>Shifted the hips</v>

3600
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:33.583
<v Speaker 2>right back to this.</v>

3601
01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:34.873
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3602
01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:35.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3603
01:35:35.241 --> 01:35:37.210
<v Speaker 2>He's attacking 30 seconds.</v>

3604
01:35:37.230 --> 01:35:38.240
<v Speaker 2>That much time left.</v>

3605
01:35:41.770 --> 01:35:44.620
<v Speaker 2>It's so rare that you see someone hit that arm bar from the back when they're</v>

3606
01:35:44.621 --> 01:35:47.770
<v Speaker 2>going for the choke or even can take him to the truck and hit him with the calf</v>

3607
01:35:47.771 --> 01:35:49.440
<v Speaker 2>slicer or a twister.</v>

3608
01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:50.080
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>

3609
01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:50.913
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to try.</v>

3610
01:35:51.150 --> 01:35:51.983
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

3611
01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.010
<v Speaker 2>lost it.</v>

3612
01:35:54.010 --> 01:35:54.491
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3613
01:35:54.491 --> 01:35:56.050
<v Speaker 2>she didn't get the hips up in time.</v>

3614
01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:59.010
<v Speaker 2>She had a pillow out of Greece going on in a Gracie style.</v>

3615
01:35:59.570 --> 01:36:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3616
01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:00.993
<v Speaker 2>one more time.</v>

3617
01:36:01.150 --> 01:36:01.871
<v Speaker 2>Flatten them out.</v>

3618
01:36:01.871 --> 01:36:02.704

01:36:29.731 --> 01:36:33.520
<v Speaker 2>his mother board message board has been hit a bunch of times.</v>

3640
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:34.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3641
01:36:34.061 --> 01:36:36.040
<v Speaker 2>well that's why after the fight I said,</v>

3642
01:36:36.041 --> 01:36:38.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do interviews with fighters after they got knocked out again.</v>

3643
01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:40.800
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it all.</v>

3644
01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Appreciate that.</v>

3645
01:36:41.770 --> 01:36:42.850
<v Speaker 2>When he said that,</v>

3646
01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:43.980
<v Speaker 2>when he said that,</v>

3647
01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking talk.</v>

3648
01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:47.650
<v Speaker 2>When he said the guy tapped,</v>

3649
01:36:47.651 --> 01:36:48.220
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3650
01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:48.671
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

3651
01:36:48.671 --> 01:36:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if he tapped like,</v>

3652
01:36:49.901 --> 01:36:52.270
<v Speaker 2>are we going to see a task like I had no idea.</v>

3653
01:36:52.271 --> 01:36:52.930
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

3654
01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:56.290
<v Speaker 2>You don't know if you miss something during the actual calling of a fight</v>

3655
01:36:56.291 --> 01:36:59.410
<v Speaker 2>because it's happening live and it's so chaotic and it's right after Alister</v>

3656
01:36:59.411 --> 01:36:59.921
<v Speaker 2>dropped him,</v>

3657
01:36:59.921 --> 01:37:01.150
<v Speaker 2>then he went for the guillotine.</v>

3658
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Then also they're on their feet again.</v>

3659
01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:05.230
<v Speaker 2>It happened so fast when he said it.</v>

3660
01:37:05.231 --> 01:37:06.250
<v Speaker 2>He was so adamant.</v>

3661
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3662
01:37:06.610 --> 01:37:07.443
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

3663
01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3664
01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:09.750
<v Speaker 2>What about the truck in the back though,</v>

3665
01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:10.653
<v Speaker 2>Joe?</v>

3666
01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.100
<v Speaker 2>Aren't they going Joe,</v>

3667
01:37:12.101 --> 01:37:12.881
<v Speaker 2>he didn't tap.</v>

3668
01:37:12.881 --> 01:37:13.810
<v Speaker 2>Do you really want to show them?</v>

3669
01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:14.590
<v Speaker 2>They don't know.</v>

3670
01:37:14.590 --> 01:37:16.800
<v Speaker 2>They don't know the fight live.</v>

3671
01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:17.830
<v Speaker 2>They watched the fight live.</v>

3672
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Find a way.</v>

3673
01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Find out it's entertaining.</v>

3674
01:37:22.290 --> 01:37:22.780
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

3675
01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:27.780
<v Speaker 2>It's totally possible that if he did tap that someone saw it in the truck,</v>

3676
01:37:28.330 --> 01:37:29.163
<v Speaker 2>they would have said it,</v>

3677
01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:30.280
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't say it.</v>

3678
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.970
<v Speaker 2>But they're like,</v>

3679
01:37:30.970 --> 01:37:31.421
<v Speaker 2>we're going to,</v>

3680
01:37:31.421 --> 01:37:32.171
<v Speaker 2>we'll play it for you.</v>

3681
01:37:32.171 --> 01:37:32.561
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

3682
01:37:32.561 --> 01:37:32.810
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3683
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:33.161
<v Speaker 2>we're going to,</v>

3684
01:37:33.161 --> 01:37:33.994
<v Speaker 2>we're going to play it.</v>

3685
01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:35.560
<v Speaker 2>And so they had a cute up,</v>

3686
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:37.800
<v Speaker 2>they played it and then he was still insistent.</v>

3687
01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:38.021
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3688
01:37:38.021 --> 01:37:38.201
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3689
01:37:38.201 --> 01:37:39.370
<v Speaker 2>well maybe it's the other hand,</v>

3690
01:37:39.850 --> 01:37:40.571
<v Speaker 2>but I was thinking,</v>

3691
01:37:40.571 --> 01:37:40.781
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3692
01:37:40.781 --> 01:37:41.710
<v Speaker 2>this is not look good,</v>

3693
01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:45.040
<v Speaker 2>but it has to be solved.</v>

3694
01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:46.330
<v Speaker 2>It has to be resolved.</v>

3695
01:37:46.450 --> 01:37:49.510
<v Speaker 2>You know when the guy says the guy tapped him and handled to show champion part</v>

3696
01:37:49.511 --> 01:37:49.961
<v Speaker 2>of the game,</v>

3697
01:37:49.961 --> 01:37:50.410
<v Speaker 2>if you check it,</v>

3698
01:37:50.410 --> 01:37:51.160
<v Speaker 2>you have to show it.</v>

3699
01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3700
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:52.690
<v Speaker 2>they have to show him those.</v>

3701
01:37:53.230 --> 01:37:55.590
<v Speaker 2>But I wish we didn't interview him at all.</v>

3702
01:37:55.650 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 2>I wish,</v>

3703
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:56.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3704
01:37:56.371 --> 01:37:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I think you guys did have a chance to,</v>

3705
01:37:58.051 --> 01:38:01.710
<v Speaker 2>he was completely unconscious and it took them a while to get back to his feet</v>

3706
01:38:02.130 --> 01:38:05.730
<v Speaker 2>and to have a conversation with him about the strategy,</v>

3707
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:06.990
<v Speaker 2>about where it went wrong.</v>

3708
01:38:06.991 --> 01:38:08.460
<v Speaker 2>And it's crazy.</v>

3709
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:11.960
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense that</v>

3710
01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:14.713
<v Speaker 2>one more time,</v>

3711
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:17.440
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't have the leg it all right there at dark.</v>

3712
01:38:17.490 --> 01:38:22.490
<v Speaker 2>This is a serious shit and got a guy get loses and gets submitted it or</v>

3713
01:38:22.561 --> 01:38:23.150
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3714
01:38:23.150 --> 01:38:25.500
<v Speaker 2>But even in other sports or this sucks.</v>

3715
01:38:25.501 --> 01:38:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I wish I would have one.</v>

3716
01:38:26.230 --> 01:38:26.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3717
01:38:26.471 --> 01:38:29.220
<v Speaker 2>he even in other sports like the NFL for God's concussion,</v>

3718
01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:29.520
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3719

3720
01:38:30.511 --> 01:38:30.691
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3721
01:38:30.691 --> 01:38:31.710
<v Speaker 2>He's not right in the head.</v>

3722
01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:33.020
<v Speaker 2>The guy breaks his leg,</v>

3723
01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:33.691
<v Speaker 2>ours a need.</v>

3724
01:38:33.691 --> 01:38:37.200
<v Speaker 2>They're not interviewing him because what the fuck's again is you don't kind of</v>

3725
01:38:37.201 --> 01:38:40.280
<v Speaker 2>fucking frame a mind that guys in dark nuts.</v>

3726
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.040
<v Speaker 2>So you're 100% right Joe.</v>

3727
01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

3728
01:38:42.690 --> 01:38:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3729
01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:43.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3730
01:38:43.681 --> 01:38:48.681
<v Speaker 2>it's something I had suggested a long time ago back when we interviewed Mirko</v>

3731
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:50.760
<v Speaker 2>Cro cop after Gonzaga knocked him out.</v>

3732
01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:52.880
<v Speaker 2>I was looking in his eyes that night.</v>

3733
01:38:52.890 --> 01:38:53.723
<v Speaker 2>You guys interviewed,</v>

3734
01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:57.240
<v Speaker 2>interviewed no more right after the fight.</v>

3735
01:38:57.690 --> 01:38:58.441
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3736
01:38:58.441 --> 01:38:59.400
<v Speaker 2>we can't do that anymore.</v>

3737
01:38:59.401 --> 01:39:01.230
<v Speaker 2>And I said it to him and we just kept dealing it.</v>

3738
01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:02.490
<v Speaker 2>What if it's good for ratings?</v>

3739
01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Like they do it.</v>

3740
01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:03.841
<v Speaker 2>They get knocked out.</v>

3741
01:39:03.841 --> 01:39:04.860
<v Speaker 2>Guaranteed interview.</v>

3742
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:06.420
<v Speaker 2>You want to be good though.</v>

3743
01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.433
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing anything.</v>

3744
01:39:07.670 --> 01:39:09.150
<v Speaker 2>They'll even show him on the ground anymore.</v>

3745
01:39:09.151 --> 01:39:10.380
<v Speaker 2>They pan away on the camera.</v>

3746
01:39:10.381 --> 01:39:12.420
<v Speaker 2>They tell you a yes or no Joe or they don't care.</v>

3747
01:39:12.710 --> 01:39:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing anymore.</v>

3748
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:15.143
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it.</v>

3749
01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.650
<v Speaker 2>When you guys getting shut the fuck,</v>

3750
01:39:16.651 --> 01:39:21.480
<v Speaker 2>you're going to find out if guys get knocked the fuck out.</v>

3751
01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:24.060
<v Speaker 2>So if someone really wants to talk to them,</v>

3752
01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:25.260
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have to talk to him.</v>

3753
01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:25.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

3754
01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:27.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking to above was going to jump in that bitch.</v>

3755
01:39:27.601 --> 01:39:29.000
<v Speaker 2>How do you fail?</v>

3756
01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Take it from here.</v>

3757
01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:34.740
<v Speaker 2>It's time for me to interview you,</v>

3758
01:39:35.130 --> 01:39:35.491
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

3759
01:39:35.491 --> 01:39:36.324
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it from here.</v>

3760
01:39:36.450 --> 01:39:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Thank you sir.</v>

3761
01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.220
<v Speaker 2>I know you hate this part.</v>

3762
01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:39.450
<v Speaker 2>I got a raise.</v>

3763
01:39:39.450 --> 01:39:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it out of respect for the game.</v>

3764
01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3765
01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3766
01:39:44.670 --> 01:39:45.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we need to and I don't think,</v>

3767
01:39:45.961 --> 01:39:47.470
<v Speaker 2>I think the UFC agrees there.</v>

3768
01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:48.360
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

3769
01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:49.320
<v Speaker 2>it's better for the sport.</v>

3770
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:51.090
<v Speaker 2>What made Allister look bad?</v>

3771
01:39:51.210 --> 01:39:55.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you gave him a few hours or even a day to talk about it,</v>

3772
01:39:55.501 --> 01:39:57.480
<v Speaker 2>he probably would realize that that never happened.</v>

3773
01:39:57.481 --> 01:39:57.991
<v Speaker 2>And it was just,</v>

3774
01:39:57.991 --> 01:39:59.040
<v Speaker 2>his brain was scrambled.</v>

3775
01:39:59.160 --> 01:39:59.341
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3776
01:39:59.341 --> 01:40:00.780
<v Speaker 2>even steepen when you're talking to me,</v>

3777
01:40:00.781 --> 01:40:01.021
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

3778
01:40:01.021 --> 01:40:01.201
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3779
01:40:01.201 --> 01:40:02.011
<v Speaker 2>hit me with a kick.</v>

3780
01:40:02.011 --> 01:40:02.521
<v Speaker 2>No Sir,</v>

3781
01:40:02.521 --> 01:40:03.470
<v Speaker 2>that was a boy.</v>

3782
01:40:03.471 --> 01:40:04.820
<v Speaker 2>He said the guy kicks hard.</v>

3783
01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:06.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3784
01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:09.240
<v Speaker 2>he did get kicked hard and the body and he did.</v>

3785
01:40:09.690 --> 01:40:10.290
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3786
01:40:10.290 --> 01:40:11.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean he could have been mentioning that,</v>

3787
01:40:11.971 --> 01:40:14.070
<v Speaker 2>but he probably didn't realize what knocked him down was,</v>

3788
01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:14.913
<v Speaker 2>can cuss too.</v>

3789
01:40:15.330 --> 01:40:16.163
<v Speaker 2>Most likely.</v>

3790
01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3791
01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3792
01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:18.313
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

3793
01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:19.620
<v Speaker 2>The way he got dropped,</v>

3794
01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:23.790
<v Speaker 2>flatland drop and he got staggered more than once a hundred stagger twice,</v>

3795
01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:25.560
<v Speaker 2>at least twice in that first round.</v>

3796
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:26.630
<v Speaker 2>So much pressure on seaweed.</v>

3797
01:40:26.631 --> 01:40:27.211
<v Speaker 2>Hometown.</v>

3798
01:40:27.211 --> 01:40:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I was so happy for him,</v>

3799
01:40:28.771 --> 01:40:29.220
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3800
01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:32.400
<v Speaker 2>You ain't heard roars like the Cleveland crowd for Steve Bay.</v>

3801
01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like Dublin for Connor.</v>

3802
01:40:34.291 --> 01:40:34.951
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

3803
01:40:34.951 --> 01:40:35.784
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3804
01:40:35.850 --> 01:40:39.090
<v Speaker 2>Cleveland is maybe or Cleveland,</v>

3805
01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:43.253
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3806
01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:45.180
<v Speaker 2>but they love him man.</v>

3807
01:40:45.181 --> 01:40:47.430
<v Speaker 2>And Cleveland is a bad ass town.</v>

3808
01:40:47.431 --> 01:40:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Man heard that it was experiencing like this resurgence.</v>

3809
01:40:50.730 --> 01:40:51.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a fun town.</v>

3810
01:40:51.931 --> 01:40:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Those people were fun,</v>

3811
01:40:54.230 --> 01:40:55.063
<v Speaker 6>joy,</v>

3812
01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:55.520
<v Speaker 6>joy,</v>

3813
01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:56.353
<v Speaker 6>browns fan.</v>

3814
01:40:57.180 --> 01:40:58.540
<v Speaker 6>So it's terrible.</v>

3815
01:40:59.310 --> 01:40:59.561
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3816
01:40:59.561 --> 01:41:01.240
<v Speaker 6>I'm not really into football that much anymore,</v>

3817
01:41:01.241 --> 01:41:02.530
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>

3818
01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:05.110
<v Speaker 6>I did watch last week's Brown's game.</v>

3819
01:41:05.111 --> 01:41:06.570
<v Speaker 6>I'm so proud on Dvr.</v>

3820
01:41:06.571 --> 01:41:07.030
<v Speaker 6>I've Wah,</v>

3821
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:08.530
<v Speaker 6>I didn't even watch their defense.</v>

3822
01:41:08.531 --> 01:41:12.580
<v Speaker 6>I just fast forward to the offense and they played like shit and I usually you</v>

3823
01:41:12.581 --> 01:41:16.480
<v Speaker 6>feel like garbage after spending three hours watching football by feeling your</v>

3824
01:41:16.610 --> 01:41:18.430
<v Speaker 6>team scores one touchdown,</v>

3825
01:41:18.610 --> 01:41:18.911
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>

3826
01:41:18.911 --> 01:41:20.500
<v Speaker 6>I fucking wasted my whole day.</v>

3827
01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:23.830
<v Speaker 6>Sat through all these fucking commercials for this bullshit ass performance.</v>

3828
01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:24.753
<v Speaker 6>You feel like shit.</v>

3829
01:41:24.910 --> 01:41:26.910
<v Speaker 6>But when you fast forward through it all and they realize,</v>

3830
01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:27.341
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3831
01:41:27.341 --> 01:41:28.390
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't have wasted my time.</v>

3832
01:41:28.450 --> 01:41:29.950
<v Speaker 6>I went through the whole game in 20 minutes.</v>

3833
01:41:30.010 --> 01:41:30.820
<v Speaker 6>I felt great.</v>

3834
01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:31.750
<v Speaker 6>They look like shit.</v>

3835
01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:33.850
<v Speaker 6>That's not how you watch it.</v>

3836
01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:39.250
<v Speaker 6>So that's so fucking wrong.</v>

3837
01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.060
<v Speaker 6>Three hours for me,</v>

3838
01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:45.600
<v Speaker 6>if I would've just sat through this shit is,</v>

3839
01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:46.493
<v Speaker 6>it's beautiful.</v>

3840
01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:49.360
<v Speaker 6>You didn't want to do that back in the day because there's too many spoilers.</v>

3841
01:41:49.361 --> 01:41:51.610
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's watching TV and there's a spoiler is everywhere,</v>

3842
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:52.690
<v Speaker 6>but now you're like,</v>

3843
01:41:52.691 --> 01:41:55.060
<v Speaker 6>everyone's like in their own little compartment on the Internet.</v>

3844
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.601
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

3845
01:41:55.601 --> 01:41:59.080
<v Speaker 6>I never know the god damn scores so you can DVR at game.</v>

3846
01:41:59.081 --> 01:41:59.950
<v Speaker 6>That's what I'm going to do tomorrow.</v>

3847
01:41:59.951 --> 01:42:04.720
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to spend a kill a Sunday watching football and wasted my time with</v>

3848
01:42:04.721 --> 01:42:05.201
<v Speaker 6>my son.</v>

3849
01:42:05.201 --> 01:42:07.140
<v Speaker 6>I forced them to watch it at six months old.</v>

3850
01:42:07.141 --> 01:42:09.760
<v Speaker 6>It's a lot to the two in the morning on fast forward.</v>

3851
01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:11.080
<v Speaker 6>It's the greatest.</v>

3852
01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:13.480
<v Speaker 6>Well now we know that you don't,</v>

3853
01:42:13.481 --> 01:42:13.840
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3854
01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:16.140

<v Speaker 6>two of them are going to be world champions.</v>

3863
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.380
<v Speaker 6>All four pro boxers.</v>

01:44:09.741 --> 01:44:10.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3916

01:44:10.881 --> 01:44:11.870
<v Speaker 3>like it was over and I thought,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that was quick.</v>

3920
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:15.020
<v Speaker 3>We're not paying attention.</v>

3921
01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:15.913
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3923
01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:21.520
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the craziest thing about kickboxing is that when you go to the</v>

3924
01:44:21.521 --> 01:44:22.180
<v Speaker 3>third round,</v>

3925
01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:23.013
<v Speaker 3>those tournaments,</v>

3926
01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:24.400
<v Speaker 3>if it's a draw,</v>

3927
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:26.080
<v Speaker 3>they'd make you guys fight a fourth round.</v>

3928
01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:28.750
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is that feeling like?</v>

3929
01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:29.600

3931
01:44:31.450 --> 01:44:32.081
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to lie.</v>

3932
01:44:32.081 --> 01:44:34.240
<v Speaker 3>It sucks because going into that third round you're like,</v>

3933
01:44:34.241 --> 01:44:35.290
<v Speaker 3>fuck this is it all?</v>

3934
01:44:35.950 --> 01:44:36.360
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:37.420
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker had to do this.</v>

3936
01:44:37.421 --> 01:44:38.290
<v Speaker 3>And then you're like,</v>

3937
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:40.170
<v Speaker 3>you go back into your coach and like,</v>

3938
01:44:40.171 --> 01:44:41.590
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be the next you're out and you're like,</v>

3939
01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:42.381
<v Speaker 3>fuck no,</v>

3940
01:44:42.381 --> 01:44:43.550
<v Speaker 3>like that Simon fire.</v>

3941
01:44:43.551 --> 01:44:44.160
<v Speaker 3>I remember like thinking,</v>

3942
01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:44.950
<v Speaker 3>think I don't want to,</v>

3943
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:45.761
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking one,</v>

3944
01:44:45.761 --> 01:44:45.961
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>

3945
01:44:45.961 --> 01:44:48.610
<v Speaker 3>And then we had to go another round and then ended up working out great for me,</v>

3946
01:44:48.611 --> 01:44:49.900
<v Speaker 3>but I was not happy about it.</v>

3947
01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:50.800
<v Speaker 3>You guys should,</v>

3948
01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:52.840
<v Speaker 3>if you guys both agree to flip a coin at the end,</v>

3949
01:44:52.841 --> 01:44:53.051
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3950
01:44:53.051 --> 01:44:53.884
<v Speaker 3>do you want to fight?</v>

3951
01:44:54.190 --> 01:44:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to find,</v>

3952
01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:55.001
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3953
01:44:55.001 --> 01:44:55.580
<v Speaker 3>let's just flip it.</v>

3954
01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:57.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he felt the same way too.</v>

3955
01:44:57.101 --> 01:44:57.910
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to go.</v>

3956
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:58.810
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to do it either.</v>

3957
01:44:58.840 --> 01:44:58.961
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3958
01:44:58.961 --> 01:45:00.760
<v Speaker 3>he kept spit his mouthpiece out.</v>

3959
01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:03.070
<v Speaker 3>I think his nose was shattered at broken,</v>

3960
01:45:03.071 --> 01:45:05.530
<v Speaker 3>so he couldn't close his mouth because he couldn't breathe</v>

3961
01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:07.901
<v Speaker 3>and shit and you're like,</v>

01:45:08.190 --> 01:45:08.800
<v Speaker 3>can't breathe.</v>

3964
01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:09.633
<v Speaker 3>And then his mouthpiece,</v>

3965
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:10.623

<v Speaker 3>like crazy.</v>

3969
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:18.310
<v Speaker 3>It's usually when you'll see the mouthpiece start falling out because he just</v>

3970
01:45:18.311 --> 01:45:19.144
<v Speaker 3>can't breathe.</v>

3971

01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:09.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4021
01:46:09.010 --> 01:46:09.843
<v Speaker 3>apparently,</v>

4022
01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:11.103
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4023
01:46:11.710 --> 01:46:13.060
<v Speaker 3>she's not looking to Gut Hillary.</v>

4024
01:46:13.090 --> 01:46:14.170
<v Speaker 3>She's super sick.</v>

4025
01:46:14.171 --> 01:46:15.070
<v Speaker 3>That's what people are saying.</v>

4026
01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:16.930
<v Speaker 3>Well like a September 11th,</v>

4027
01:46:16.931 --> 01:46:19.600
<v Speaker 3>she left the event early and like passed out,</v>

4028
01:46:19.601 --> 01:46:21.670
<v Speaker 3>like collapsed and fainted.</v>

4029
01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:25.460
<v Speaker 3>Cops got like a fucking shit bag in her and Manhattan.</v>

4030
01:46:26.110 --> 01:46:30.460
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones had some position on and he said he shot at showing signs of some</v>

4031
01:46:30.461 --> 01:46:31.470
<v Speaker 3>kind of brain tumor.</v>

4032
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:36.680
<v Speaker 3>But Alex Jones is so far like he used to come across like he had like good ship</v>

4033
01:46:36.681 --> 01:46:37.570
<v Speaker 3>and he's just kinda crazy.</v>

4034
01:46:37.571 --> 01:46:41.230
<v Speaker 3>And now he's like so far the other way that I just can't take him seriously.</v>

4035
01:46:41.231 --> 01:46:42.820
<v Speaker 3>Like even if this shit is true,</v>

4036
01:46:42.821 --> 01:46:43.420
<v Speaker 3>like he just,</v>

4037
01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:44.170
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

4038
01:46:44.170 --> 01:46:44.650
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4039
01:46:44.650 --> 01:46:46.770
<v Speaker 3>the globalists,</v>

4040
01:46:46.810 --> 01:46:47.643
<v Speaker 3>the elite.</v>

4041
01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:49.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm not giving you my God mother.</v>

4042
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4043
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 3>you just get</v>

4044
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.480
<v Speaker 6>so far as the explosion.</v>

4045
01:46:51.481 --> 01:46:52.201
<v Speaker 6>Was it terrorism?</v>

4046
01:46:52.201 --> 01:46:53.310
<v Speaker 6>But it was done intentionally.</v>

4047
01:46:53.311 --> 01:46:55.110
<v Speaker 6>So that means someone from here would do it,</v>

4048
01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:56.401
<v Speaker 6>but isn't terrorism,</v>

4049
01:46:56.401 --> 01:46:57.060
<v Speaker 6>terrorism?</v>

4050
01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.830
<v Speaker 6>Maybe someone just wanted to get rid of their building,</v>

4051
01:46:59.910 --> 01:47:00.870
<v Speaker 6>got a shitty building.</v>

4053
01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:04.920
<v Speaker 6>I ain't got a calendar with all this Hillary shit going on.</v>

4054
01:47:04.921 --> 01:47:05.471
<v Speaker 6>They're panicking.</v>

4055
01:47:05.471 --> 01:47:08.700
<v Speaker 6>They don't know if they're gonna stick Bernie Sanders in or they going to put</v>

4056
01:47:08.701 --> 01:47:09.540
<v Speaker 6>Biden in.</v>

4057
01:47:09.570 --> 01:47:10.300
<v Speaker 6>How can they do this?</v>

4058
01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:11.250

<v Speaker 6>it's just so fuck dude.</v>

4154
01:49:39.401 --> 01:49:40.820
<v Speaker 6>It fucking wobbled transplant.</v>

4155
01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:42.910
<v Speaker 6>Oh Shit.</v>

4156
01:49:43.930 --> 01:49:44.763
<v Speaker 6>The jaw.</v>

4157
01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:46.120
<v Speaker 6>It was a lot of wheel kicks,</v>

4158
01:49:46.121 --> 01:49:46.301
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

4160
01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:47.771
<v Speaker 6>we're doomed.</v>

4161
01:49:47.771 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 6>Said,</v>

01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.791
<v Speaker 3>check this out,</v>

4163
01:49:48.791 --> 01:49:50.290
<v Speaker 3>flying fucking psychic.</v>

01:49:50.291 --> 01:49:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Own your coach.</v>

4165
01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:53.740
<v Speaker 3>This is Sparta front kick.</v>

4166
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:55.510
<v Speaker 3>Get Your Bullshit Jim out here.</v>

4167
01:49:55.511 --> 01:49:56.344
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4168
01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:57.520
<v Speaker 3>That was real weird.</v>

4169
01:49:57.521 --> 01:49:58.354
<v Speaker 3>After the fight,</v>

4170
01:49:58.600 --> 01:49:59.770
<v Speaker 3>Edmund was screaming at them.</v>

4171
01:49:59.790 --> 01:50:00.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4172
01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:01.720
<v Speaker 3>what do you think is going to happen here?</v>

4173
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:02.890
<v Speaker 3>I think watching it,</v>

4174
01:50:02.891 --> 01:50:05.950
<v Speaker 3>I thought that he thought that when he was fucking,</v>

4175
01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:09.520
<v Speaker 3>I think admin at some point thought that Travis actually won that fight and then</v>

4176
01:50:09.521 --> 01:50:12.520
<v Speaker 3>he got robbed in the decision which they were doing.</v>

4177
01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:13.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was,</v>

4178
01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:14.240
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4179
01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:14.710
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

4180
01:50:14.710 --> 01:50:16.190
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of pressure on it,</v>

4181
01:50:16.191 --> 01:50:17.730
<v Speaker 3>so I'm doing this shit and was like,</v>

4182
01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:18.910
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>

4183
01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:21.550
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of pressure on ed mean because you know it's like,</v>

4184
01:50:21.551 --> 01:50:21.971
<v Speaker 3>fuck man.</v>

4185
01:50:21.971 --> 01:50:22.721
<v Speaker 3>He gotta win a fight.</v>

4186
01:50:22.721 --> 01:50:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Traffic moved his whole camp there.</v>

4187
01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:26.590
<v Speaker 3>He's looked like pure Kaka.</v>

4188
01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:28.000
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot riding on this fight.</v>

4189
01:50:28.001 --> 01:50:29.140
<v Speaker 3>He just lost the cane,</v>

4190
01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:30.520
<v Speaker 3>so if you hear him in the corner,</v>

4191
01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:31.570
<v Speaker 3>there's desperation.</v>

4192
01:50:31.570 --> 01:50:34.000
<v Speaker 3>He's losing his voice and then when that shit happens,</v>

4193
01:50:34.001 --> 01:50:35.410
<v Speaker 3>when your fighter fights like that,</v>

4194
01:50:35.411 --> 01:50:38.560
<v Speaker 3>I think he was just so furious and he's an emotional guy,</v>

4195
01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:42.580
<v Speaker 3>but you're talking to the number when heavyweight in the world and he's going to</v>

4196
01:50:42.581 --> 01:50:45.230
<v Speaker 3>twist your fucking face off when you talked to him like that.</v>

4197
01:50:45.250 --> 01:50:48.850
<v Speaker 3>He's Brazilian and then in Brazil they'll just fucking smack you for no reason</v>

4198
01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:50.170
<v Speaker 3>was a nice guy too,</v>

4199
01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:53.500
<v Speaker 3>for dooms a fucking grand human being.</v>

4200
01:50:53.501 --> 01:50:54.730
<v Speaker 3>One of the nice guys in the world.</v>

4201
01:50:54.731 --> 01:50:57.130
<v Speaker 3>You're lucky that was an over him or someone like that.</v>

4202
01:50:57.230 --> 01:50:57.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4203
01:50:57.760 --> 01:50:59.050
<v Speaker 3>it was all very weird.</v>

4204
01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:01.420
<v Speaker 3>It was very weird because I didn't see it until afterwards.</v>

4205
01:51:01.421 --> 01:51:05.770
<v Speaker 3>I was climbing into the cage to do the post fight interviews when he kicked him,</v>

4206
01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:07.300
<v Speaker 3>so I didn't see him kick him,</v>

4207
01:51:07.450 --> 01:51:11.120
<v Speaker 3>but all of a sudden Edmund went flying a bunch of people in there and Hofeld</v>

4208
01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Cordura was trying to kick Edmonds ass hot fucker.</v>

4209
01:51:13.130 --> 01:51:17.140
<v Speaker 3>Daryl was fucking fear and Edmond was screaming at Hockfield Cordero and Hofeld</v>

4210
01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:19.150
<v Speaker 3>Codero was ready to throw.</v>

4211
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.661
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4212
01:51:19.661 --> 01:51:20.520
<v Speaker 3>they cut all that off.</v>

4213
01:51:20.521 --> 01:51:23.210
<v Speaker 3>I was really considering what he should or shouldn't.</v>

4214
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:25.870
<v Speaker 3>Don't standing right back.</v>

4215
01:51:25.871 --> 01:51:28.480
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad mother fucker and Hofeld Cordell was right in front of them</v>

4216
01:51:28.481 --> 01:51:30.190
<v Speaker 3>considering what he should or shouldn't do.</v>

4217
01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:32.590
<v Speaker 3>And they were trying to move Edmund away from him.</v>

4218
01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:34.000
<v Speaker 3>But he had said some nasty shit.</v>

4219
01:51:34.001 --> 01:51:34.361
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4220
01:51:34.361 --> 01:51:35.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who said what or what,</v>

4221
01:51:36.010 --> 01:51:40.470
<v Speaker 3>but there was a lot of like extremities when you see Dana didn't see any of that</v>

4222
01:51:40.471 --> 01:51:41.291
<v Speaker 3>came in and was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>They don't take any shit on the street.</v>

4244
01:52:20.290 --> 01:52:20.830
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4245
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:21.940
<v Speaker 3>But one can fight better than the other.</v>

4246
01:52:21.941 --> 01:52:22.970
<v Speaker 3>That's where you got it all.</v>

4247
01:52:23.070 --> 01:52:23.903
<v Speaker 3>Now that's up.</v>

01:52:46.341 --> 01:52:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Best heavyweights of all time.</v>

4262
01:52:48.010 --> 01:52:50.000
<v Speaker 3>He just happens to be one of the greatest guys in the world.</v>

4263
01:52:50.001 --> 01:52:50.540

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4266
01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:55.310
<v Speaker 3>So we showed him that he should have kept his mouth shut.</v>

4267
01:52:56.120 --> 01:52:56.953

4272
01:53:01.370 --> 01:53:04.310
<v Speaker 3>I know what you shouldn't do is approach a fighter and try and fight him as a</v>

4273
01:53:04.311 --> 01:53:04.671
<v Speaker 3>coach.</v>

01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:22.263
<v Speaker 3>don't fucking talk.</v>

4286
01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:22.960

4288
01:53:24.351 --> 01:53:26.510
<v Speaker 3>cause I could tell in his eyes he was going to throw a punch at me.</v>

4289
01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:27.170
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

4290
01:53:27.170 --> 01:53:27.471
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

4291
01:53:27.471 --> 01:53:28.820
<v Speaker 3>I could have done something a lot worse.</v>

4292
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.570
<v Speaker 3>He's right.</v>

4293
01:53:29.570 --> 01:53:31.040
<v Speaker 3>Did we don't flip off the audience.</v>

4294
01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:36.233
<v Speaker 3>They were weren't.</v>

4295
01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:37.910
<v Speaker 3>They weren't booing the fact that he won,</v>

4296
01:53:37.911 --> 01:53:39.770
<v Speaker 3>they were booing that the fight was lack luster.</v>

4297
01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:40.633
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

4298
01:53:41.050 --> 01:53:42.050
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>

4299
01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:42.500
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

4300
01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:44.120
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't blowing that like off.</v>

4301
01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:44.751
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>

4302
01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:45.230
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

4303
01:53:45.230 --> 01:53:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh crap was right at the top for doom was like,</v>

4304
01:53:47.841 --> 01:53:50.090
<v Speaker 3>we just fought her fucking ass off.</v>

4305
01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:51.140
<v Speaker 3>We're doing some shit.</v>

4306
01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:53.660
<v Speaker 3>They're there in the fucking kids throwing down.</v>

4307
01:53:53.661 --> 01:53:54.950
<v Speaker 3>So no matter how it goes down,</v>

4308
01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:57.050
<v Speaker 3>the audience should never hold on.</v>

4309
01:53:57.051 --> 01:53:58.490
<v Speaker 3>You got to take this into consideration.</v>

4310
01:53:58.491 --> 01:53:59.690
<v Speaker 3>The audience is there.</v>

4311
01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:00.680
<v Speaker 3>It's in Cleveland,</v>

4312
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:01.341
<v Speaker 3>steep,</v>

4313
01:54:01.341 --> 01:54:03.170
<v Speaker 3>a beat for doom for the belt.</v>

4314
01:54:03.230 --> 01:54:04.820
<v Speaker 3>They all know that they're there for Steve Bay.</v>

4315
01:54:04.821 --> 01:54:07.910
<v Speaker 3>They know that for doom was the guy Steve a beat for the belts.</v>

4316
01:54:07.911 --> 01:54:09.020
<v Speaker 3>So they're against VRE.</v>

4317
01:54:09.021 --> 01:54:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Do them anyway cause he's like the,</v>

4318
01:54:10.730 --> 01:54:12.500
<v Speaker 3>he's like the invading team.</v>

4319
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:13.400
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

4320
01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:13.760
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

4321
01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:14.130
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

4322
01:54:14.130 --> 01:54:14.963
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

4323
01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:16.710
<v Speaker 3>It was a was,</v>

4324
01:54:16.730 --> 01:54:17.481
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a good fight,</v>

4325
01:54:17.481 --> 01:54:22.220
<v Speaker 3>but I was amazed that Travis was able to recover when Fabrizio got his back that</v>

4326
01:54:22.221 --> 01:54:22.760
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

4327
01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:23.271
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4328
01:54:23.271 --> 01:54:23.950
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

4329
01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:24.740
<v Speaker 3>I dude,</v>

4330
01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:25.460
<v Speaker 3>dude's got heart.</v>

4331
01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:26.060
<v Speaker 3>He's got some,</v>

4332
01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:27.880
<v Speaker 3>he's got some very good defense to cause.</v>

4333
01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:28.671
<v Speaker 3>Fabrizio had him,</v>

4334
01:54:28.671 --> 01:54:31.880
<v Speaker 3>dad had him hurt and then had them down and then took his back and I was,</v>

4335
01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:33.320
<v Speaker 3>I was shocked that he didn't finish them.</v>

4336
01:54:33.410 --> 01:54:33.621
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4337
01:54:33.621 --> 01:54:34.610
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty impressive.</v>

4338
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:37.850
<v Speaker 3>Especially considering the Travis had a broken finger.</v>

4339
01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:39.590
<v Speaker 3>His fingers fucked up.</v>

4340
01:54:39.591 --> 01:54:40.520
<v Speaker 3>You see the pictures of it?</v>

4341
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.911
<v Speaker 3>I did too.</v>

4342
01:54:40.911 --> 01:54:41.331
<v Speaker 3>The pictures.</v>

4343
01:54:41.331 --> 01:54:45.560
<v Speaker 3>What's more impressive though is for doom fighting and thrown a spinning or</v>

4344
01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:49.100
<v Speaker 3>kicks and the fucking flying kick with a broken foot.</v>

4345
01:54:49.101 --> 01:54:49.251
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4346
01:54:49.251 --> 01:54:50.660
<v Speaker 3>he went into the fight with broken foot.</v>

4347
01:54:50.930 --> 01:54:51.763
<v Speaker 3>Which foot?</v>

4348
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:52.783
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

4349
01:54:52.970 --> 01:54:53.840
<v Speaker 3>That is impressive though.</v>

4350
01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:55.910
<v Speaker 3>That was impressive because how impressive is that?</v>

4351
01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:57.770
<v Speaker 3>Wonder if it was the broken when he kicked him with,</v>

4352
01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:59.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure ridiculous gangsters that,</v>

4353
01:54:59.930 --> 01:55:02.720
<v Speaker 3>well I thought that it was like a mental warfare thing that I thought was kind</v>

4354
01:55:02.721 --> 01:55:04.340
<v Speaker 3>of awesome was that if,</v>

4355
01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:05.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the situation,</v>

4356
01:55:05.931 --> 01:55:09.110
<v Speaker 3>but saver doom wasn't in the best shape and needed it to be a slower paced fight</v>

4357
01:55:09.111 --> 01:55:12.560
<v Speaker 3>and you come out and you do that flying fucking push cake with a fractured site</v>

4358
01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:16.430
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden you're doing fucking cartwheel kicks cause you don't</v>

4359
01:55:16.431 --> 01:55:18.510
<v Speaker 3>give a fuck if he gets on top of you and you're underground.</v>

4360
01:55:18.650 --> 01:55:19.011
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4361
01:55:19.011 --> 01:55:21.670
<v Speaker 3>And then next thing you know is a slow paced fight and you get to win on,</v>

4362
01:55:21.970 --> 01:55:22.630
<v Speaker 3>you know I,</v>

4363
01:55:22.630 --> 01:55:22.960
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

4364
01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:26.420
<v Speaker 3>it was cool that that fights topman cause both guys were in the show much</v>

4365
01:55:26.421 --> 01:55:29.090
<v Speaker 3>pressure because if we're doing loses he goes to the back of the line.</v>

4366
01:55:29.091 --> 01:55:32.180
<v Speaker 3>He's older and this is this fucking second time in the UFC.</v>

4367
01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:33.290
<v Speaker 3>Trash Brown.</v>

4368
01:55:33.290 --> 01:55:35.030
<v Speaker 3>He's one out of his last five.</v>

4369
01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:37.040
<v Speaker 3>He admin all this pressure.</v>

4370
01:55:37.130 --> 01:55:37.551
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

4371
01:55:37.551 --> 01:55:39.660
<v Speaker 3>so there's just high tension man,</v>

4372
01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:41.001
<v Speaker 3>very high tension.</v>

4373
01:55:41.001 --> 01:55:42.740
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot going on for of us for them.</v>

4374
01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:44.610
<v Speaker 3>Now he's like 49</v>

4375
01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:45.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4376
01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:45.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4377
01:55:45.301 --> 01:55:47.220
<v Speaker 2>he's 39 you know,</v>

4378
01:55:47.221 --> 01:55:52.080
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because the als to fight like the way ouster was avoiding</v>

4379
01:55:52.110 --> 01:55:54.120
<v Speaker 2>exchanges and getting out of the way.</v>

4380
01:55:54.450 --> 01:55:57.240
<v Speaker 2>It's so like you're watching a totally different fighter now.</v>

4381
01:55:57.241 --> 01:55:58.530
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting.</v>

4382
01:55:58.710 --> 01:56:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Like you remember his fight with Todd Duffy when he was the destroyer and he's</v>

4383
01:56:02.371 --> 01:56:03.204
<v Speaker 2>just</v>

4384
01:56:04.150 --> 01:56:04.620
<v Speaker 2>pants.</v>

4385
01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4386
01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:05.401
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

4387
01:56:05.401 --> 01:56:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4388
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:07.080
<v Speaker 2>And then with Brock,</v>

4389
01:56:07.081 --> 01:56:08.370
<v Speaker 2>same thing pre Usada.</v>

4390
01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:09.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

4391
01:56:09.570 --> 01:56:12.480
<v Speaker 2>that Alister had such a different style.</v>

4392
01:56:12.481 --> 01:56:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Now he's moving around a lot.</v>

4393
01:56:14.881 --> 01:56:16.040
<v Speaker 2>He's got his hands out,</v>

4394
01:56:16.230 --> 01:56:20.310
<v Speaker 2>he's running away from exchanges and picking his spots and trying to fight at a</v>

4395
01:56:20.311 --> 01:56:21.630
<v Speaker 2>really reserved pace.</v>

4396
01:56:21.631 --> 01:56:25.320
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to like preserve his energy and pace himself.</v>

4397
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.890
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4398
01:56:25.890 --> 01:56:26.970
<v Speaker 2>but what technique,</v>

4399
01:56:26.971 --> 01:56:29.130
<v Speaker 2>and I mean maybe you would know better job.</v>

4400
01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:33.990
<v Speaker 2>What technique did they ever teach in any martial art where you run like that?</v>

4401
01:56:34.170 --> 01:56:34.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4402
01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:36.820
<v Speaker 2>I was called get the fuck away from steep bank.</v>

4403
01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4404
01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:41.460
<v Speaker 2>A lot of talk about it after Connor did the tonight and other negative positive,</v>

4405
01:56:41.461 --> 01:56:41.681
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

4406
01:56:41.681 --> 01:56:43.330
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about fatigue and stuff like that.</v>

4407
01:56:43.331 --> 01:56:46.260
<v Speaker 2>And then I looked exactly like that,</v>

4408
01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:46.711
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4409
01:56:46.711 --> 01:56:49.470
<v Speaker 2>but Conor did it later in the rounds when he doing the first run.</v>

4410
01:56:49.471 --> 01:56:50.370
<v Speaker 2>When you're not tired,</v>

4411
01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:52.820
<v Speaker 2>that's just that mean that's your straight technique son.</v>

4412
01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:52.981
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4413
01:56:52.981 --> 01:56:56.130
<v Speaker 2>I think if we do it on a football field by Joe wants to have those</v>

4414
01:56:56.190 --> 01:56:56.800
<v Speaker 2>opportunities,</v>

4415
01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:57.361
<v Speaker 2>people are gonna be like,</v>

4416
01:56:57.361 --> 01:56:57.751
<v Speaker 2>Hey man,</v>

4417
01:56:57.751 --> 01:57:00.540
<v Speaker 2>this is too close to fucking run away from the threat shop.</v>

4418
01:57:00.570 --> 01:57:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Metamorris running and get their shit together.</v>

4419
01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:03.240
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] field.</v>

4420
01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:07.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm out time to run or get down some duties to down.</v>

4421
01:57:07.530 --> 01:57:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Remember when Max Holloway and Ricardo Lamas to each other and pointed at the</v>

4422
01:57:10.981 --> 01:57:11.401
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>

4423
01:57:11.401 --> 01:57:12.121
<v Speaker 2>so let's do this.</v>

4424
01:57:12.121 --> 01:57:15.750
<v Speaker 2>And they just swung through the last 10 seconds of the fight.</v>

4425
01:57:15.751 --> 01:57:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Just one.</v>

4426
01:57:17.730 --> 01:57:20.070
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be guys that do that too and there's going to be guided that</v>

4427
01:57:20.071 --> 01:57:20.710
<v Speaker 2>Alister it,</v>

4428
01:57:20.710 --> 01:57:21.543
<v Speaker 2>God bless them,</v>

4429
01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:23.640
<v Speaker 2>but I've never seen him.</v>

4430
01:57:23.670 --> 01:57:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen Allister like that?</v>

4431
01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Ever?</v>

4432
01:57:25.770 --> 01:57:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Not asked her.</v>

4433
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.823
<v Speaker 2>Never seen it.</v>

4434
01:57:28.170 --> 01:57:29.510
<v Speaker 2>But you also have a straight left.</v>

4435
01:57:29.511 --> 01:57:30.660
<v Speaker 2>It drove to all of this beautiful though.</v>

4436
01:57:30.690 --> 01:57:32.670
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing and it was off of that runaway.</v>

4437
01:57:32.671 --> 01:57:34.050
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that I was thinking is like,</v>

4438
01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:37.550
<v Speaker 2>and even in nature when Nate and Connor,</v>

4439
01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:38.220
<v Speaker 2>when it happened,</v>

4440
01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:39.300
<v Speaker 2>when you do that,</v>

4441
01:57:39.301 --> 01:57:40.170
<v Speaker 2>like runaway thing,</v>

4442
01:57:40.171 --> 01:57:41.280
<v Speaker 2>you're getting a reset.</v>

4443
01:57:41.370 --> 01:57:44.430
<v Speaker 2>And then like for example with a Nate,</v>

4444
01:57:44.670 --> 01:57:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Nate's began kicking the leg a lot.</v>

4445
01:57:45.931 --> 01:57:48.240
<v Speaker 2>You're walking around the the fucking ring,</v>

4446
01:57:48.241 --> 01:57:48.901
<v Speaker 2>he runs away,</v>

4447
01:57:48.901 --> 01:57:50.280
<v Speaker 2>you're walking to him walking to him.</v>

4448
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:52.170
<v Speaker 2>He set now and he's waiting for you.</v>

4449
01:57:52.171 --> 01:57:53.370
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you come into distance,</v>

4450
01:57:53.371 --> 01:57:54.660
<v Speaker 2>like I gets like the jump on,</v>

4451
01:57:54.770 --> 01:57:55.561
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

4452
01:57:55.561 --> 01:57:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Which is a,</v>

4453
01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:57.510
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

4454
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:58.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a thing.</v>

4455
01:57:58.140 --> 01:57:58.973
<v Speaker 2>Well it's a thing.</v>

4456
01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't have to move forward.</v>

4457
01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:02.010
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to advance right for him.</v>

4458
01:58:02.010 --> 01:58:03.480
<v Speaker 2>That'd be kind of interesting if you just stood there.</v>

4459
01:58:03.481 --> 01:58:03.601
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

4460
01:58:03.601 --> 01:58:04.440
<v Speaker 2>it never went away.</v>

4461
01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:06.450
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen one over him stealing ever.</v>

4462
01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Well you know what man?</v>

4463
01:58:07.651 --> 01:58:11.190
<v Speaker 2>He got tagged a couple of times and I think he also realizes that steep bay is a</v>

4464
01:58:11.191 --> 01:58:12.420
<v Speaker 2>fucking dangerous guy.</v>

4465
01:58:12.690 --> 01:58:14.490
<v Speaker 2>And at this stage of his life,</v>

4466
01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:16.320
<v Speaker 2>he's not that good at taking a shot.</v>

4467
01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:17.311
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4468
01:58:17.311 --> 01:58:18.144
<v Speaker 2>He's just not.</v>

4469
01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:19.081
<v Speaker 2>And then what?</v>

4470
01:58:19.081 --> 01:58:22.470
<v Speaker 2>What scenario would have been better for him to do in that moment than to do</v>

4471
01:58:22.471 --> 01:58:22.741
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

4472
01:58:22.741 --> 01:58:24.180
<v Speaker 2>That was the fucking right thing to do.</v>

4473
01:58:24.181 --> 01:58:25.560
<v Speaker 2>I think self defense right there,</v>

4474
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:26.940
<v Speaker 2>you're in a bad position.</v>

4475
01:58:26.941 --> 01:58:27.181
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

4476
01:58:27.181 --> 01:58:27.591
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>

4477
01:58:27.591 --> 01:58:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I got to get back to where I'm set.</v>

4478
01:58:29.131 --> 01:58:30.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to recitals.</v>

4479
01:58:30.930 --> 01:58:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Then why don't more guys run?</v>

4480
01:58:33.150 --> 01:58:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4481
01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:35.630
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's the best forms.</v>

4482
01:58:35.650 --> 01:58:37.030
<v Speaker 2>A five round fight for heavyweight.</v>

4483
01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:37.770
<v Speaker 2>You're going to,</v>

4484
01:58:37.770 --> 01:58:38.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's the best.</v>

4485
01:58:39.090 --> 01:58:39.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4486
01:58:39.570 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 2>but if that's he had at that</v>

4487
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:42.640
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

4488
01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:42.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4489
01:58:42.911 --> 01:58:43.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4490
01:58:43.121 --> 01:58:43.781
<v Speaker 1>it's not the best.</v>

4491
01:58:43.781 --> 01:58:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Like there's guys that fight like maybe not in that division,</v>

4492
01:58:47.831 --> 01:58:48.680
<v Speaker 1>but there's guys that felt,</v>

4493
01:58:48.690 --> 01:58:48.941
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4494
01:58:48.941 --> 01:58:49.810
<v Speaker 1>here's a perfect example.</v>

4495
01:58:49.811 --> 01:58:50.471
<v Speaker 1>Kane came,</v>

4496
01:58:50.471 --> 01:58:51.304
<v Speaker 1>we never do that.</v>

4497
01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:52.121
<v Speaker 1>Never seen it.</v>

4498
01:58:52.121 --> 01:58:53.590
<v Speaker 1>That you'd never gonna sit that over.</v>

4499
01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4500
01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:56.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not even in their brain to run.</v>

4501
01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:58.180
<v Speaker 1>They don't have that pain's going to turn,</v>

4502
01:58:58.181 --> 01:58:58.991
<v Speaker 1>plant himself,</v>

4503
01:58:58.991 --> 01:58:59.611
<v Speaker 1>fire back,</v>

4504
01:58:59.611 --> 01:59:01.240
<v Speaker 1>try to take you down and try to crack on you,</v>

4505
01:59:01.241 --> 01:59:02.074
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

4506
01:59:02.290 --> 01:59:02.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4507
01:59:02.591 --> 01:59:04.960
<v Speaker 1>and probably for doom is not going to run like that.</v>

4508
01:59:04.961 --> 01:59:05.231
<v Speaker 1>Either.</v>

4509
01:59:05.231 --> 01:59:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Renew we're doing is going to look for the clinch or he's going to try to take</v>

4510
01:59:07.481 --> 01:59:08.670
<v Speaker 1>you down as you move in like that.</v>

4511
01:59:08.671 --> 01:59:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm another heavyweight that run like that.</v>

4512
01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:11.253
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>

4513
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:12.310
<v Speaker 1>nobody currently,</v>

4514
01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:12.790
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

4515
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Nobody currently,</v>

4516
01:59:13.870 --> 01:59:15.040
<v Speaker 1>and there won't be a trend of it.</v>

4517
01:59:15.041 --> 01:59:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I would no guaranteed.</v>

4518
01:59:16.171 --> 01:59:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a high pressure situation and he thought that was his best move</v>

4519
01:59:19.571 --> 01:59:20.350
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>

4520
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:22.360
<v Speaker 1>But if you looked at what he did with junior dos Santos,</v>

4521
01:59:22.361 --> 01:59:24.400
<v Speaker 1>he did a less extreme version of that.</v>

4522
01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:25.750
<v Speaker 1>He did a lot of moving away,</v>

4523
01:59:25.751 --> 01:59:29.140
<v Speaker 1>but he landed hard shots then ultimately knocked junior outs.</v>

4524
01:59:29.141 --> 01:59:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Everybody forgave him for it.</v>

4525
01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

4526
01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:34.950
<v Speaker 1>But it's that kind of movement moving away from the conflict and ticking it's</v>

4527
01:59:35.250 --> 01:59:36.041
<v Speaker 1>best chance to win.</v>

4528
01:59:36.041 --> 01:59:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Two is if you look at Steve Bay's,</v>

4529
01:59:37.571 --> 01:59:37.931
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>

4530
01:59:37.931 --> 01:59:39.190
<v Speaker 1>when he gets a guy against the cage,</v>

4531
01:59:39.191 --> 01:59:40.540
<v Speaker 1>he goes to work.</v>

4532
01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:41.351
<v Speaker 1>So maybe he was like,</v>

4533
01:59:41.351 --> 01:59:41.621
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

4534
01:59:41.621 --> 01:59:42.281
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna Reset.</v>

4535
01:59:42.281 --> 01:59:42.851
<v Speaker 1>Go the center,</v>

4536
01:59:42.851 --> 01:59:43.220
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>

4537
01:59:43.220 --> 01:59:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Recentering cause we know how good steep is with his game plan and back me up to</v>

4538
01:59:46.871 --> 01:59:47.470
<v Speaker 1>the cage.</v>

4539
01:59:47.470 --> 01:59:49.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about his grappling.</v>

4540
01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Tell me,</v>

4541
01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:52.360
<v Speaker 1>tell me who's Steve Bay is a really good wrestler.</v>

4542
01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Recent College.</v>

4543
01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I heard he was a wrestler.</v>

4544
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:56.141
<v Speaker 1>Let's pull it up.</v>

4545
01:59:56.141 --> 01:59:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Pull it all dress right.</v>

4546
01:59:57.100 --> 01:59:57.933
<v Speaker 1>Cleveland state.</v>

4547
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.870
<v Speaker 1>So Division One.</v>

4548
01:59:58.871 --> 01:59:59.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4549
01:59:59.021 --> 02:00:00.820
<v Speaker 1>And then so real good athlete and others.</v>

4550
02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:01.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4551
02:00:01.601 --> 02:00:02.081
<v Speaker 1>baseball,</v>

4552
02:00:02.081 --> 02:00:02.770
<v Speaker 1>he's base plate.</v>

4553
02:00:02.770 --> 02:00:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Went wanted to play professional baseball.</v>

4554
02:00:04.630 --> 02:00:06.010
<v Speaker 1>His jujitsu's very good.</v>

4555
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:07.450
<v Speaker 1>What Bell's not offensively.</v>

4556
02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:08.673
<v Speaker 1>Defensively.</v>

4557
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4558
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's not high level train,</v>

4559
02:00:11.081 --> 02:00:13.180
<v Speaker 1>but his defense is amazing.</v>

4560
02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:15.940
<v Speaker 1>He's like Rashad Evans has defense.</v>

4561
02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:16.591
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

4562
02:00:16.591 --> 02:00:17.950
<v Speaker 1>I no submission wins.</v>

4563
02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:18.201
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4564
02:00:18.201 --> 02:00:18.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4565
02:00:18.610 --> 02:00:19.990
<v Speaker 1>not a big disguise.</v>

4566
02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:23.080
<v Speaker 1>What about his striking specifically blocks and golden gloves?</v>

4567
02:00:23.081 --> 02:00:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Champ from Cleveland.</v>

4568
02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Very good technique.</v>

4569
02:00:25.541 --> 02:00:28.690
<v Speaker 1>You see what he had going house to her college wrestler,</v>

4570
02:00:28.691 --> 02:00:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Division One College Wrestler,</v>

4571
02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:31.660
<v Speaker 1>a college baseball player.</v>

4572
02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Do you see when he had a Alster against the ropes or against the cage and just</v>

4573
02:00:35.770 --> 02:00:37.450
<v Speaker 1>hit crisp combinations?</v>

4574
02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4575
02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:38.591
<v Speaker 1>Top,</v>

4576
02:00:38.591 --> 02:00:38.801
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>

4577
02:00:38.801 --> 02:00:38.981
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>

4578
02:00:38.981 --> 02:00:39.161
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>

4579
02:00:39.161 --> 02:00:39.341
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>

4580
02:00:39.341 --> 02:00:39.850
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>

4581
02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:41.980
<v Speaker 1>This fight is a motherfucker head like a pit bull.</v>

4582
02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:42.940
<v Speaker 1>You can take a shot.</v>

4583
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:47.440
<v Speaker 1>This fights going to be fun.</v>

4584
02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:49.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited for this,</v>

4585
02:00:50.150 --> 02:00:51.460
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

4586
02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:52.353
<v Speaker 1>she'd be a good one.</v>

4587
02:00:52.650 --> 02:00:54.220
<v Speaker 1>You have the heavyweight divisions in a,</v>

4588
02:00:54.221 --> 02:00:55.990
<v Speaker 1>in an unusual position right now.</v>

4589
02:00:56.020 --> 02:00:56.411
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4590
02:00:56.411 --> 02:00:58.030
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting to see what happens.</v>

4591
02:00:58.330 --> 02:00:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting to see.</v>

4592
02:00:59.610 --> 02:01:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4593
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:02.920
<v Speaker 1>how well Keynes recovered from surgery.</v>

4594
02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he looked like a monster again against Travis.</v>

4595
02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:07.090
<v Speaker 1>That looks like the cane of old,</v>

4596
02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:09.530
<v Speaker 1>you know Cain steep based the flight.</v>

4597
02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:10.373
<v Speaker 1>It's the only fight.</v>

4598
02:01:10.810 --> 02:01:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4599
02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:14.000
<v Speaker 1>that's what you guys think about Tony Ferguson versus dos Anjos.</v>

4600
02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:17.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a mother fucking fight and it's in Mexico City.</v>

4601
02:01:17.531 --> 02:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Kids dog.</v>

4602
02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:19.601
<v Speaker 1>Tony.</v>

4603
02:01:19.601 --> 02:01:21.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be in big bear for four weeks.</v>

4604
02:01:21.570 --> 02:01:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I instagrammed a picture from big barriers.</v>

4605
02:01:23.590 --> 02:01:24.880
<v Speaker 1>He at Tito's hold joint.</v>

4606
02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:25.631
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4607
02:01:25.631 --> 02:01:29.390
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna run his own house and Geo Chai compel out.</v>

4608
02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>We're all going to go up there and wrote a great fight man.</v>

4609
02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:34.750
<v Speaker 1>When Tito was in his prime,</v>

4610
02:01:34.751 --> 02:01:36.130
<v Speaker 1>he bought Oscar de la Hoya,</v>

4611
02:01:36.131 --> 02:01:37.180
<v Speaker 1>his training camp up there.</v>

4612
02:01:37.181 --> 02:01:38.440
<v Speaker 1>It's dope as fuck man.</v>

4613
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:39.303
<v Speaker 1>I heard it's,</v>

4614
02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>he had the cage</v>

4615
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:42.100
<v Speaker 3>set up there and he would do all his training.</v>

4616
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:43.460
<v Speaker 3>He still owns it,</v>

4617
02:01:43.690 --> 02:01:44.290
<v Speaker 3>does he?</v>

4618
02:01:44.290 --> 02:01:46.700
<v Speaker 3>He was on our show and I think you said he's still owns it.</v>

4619
02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:48.130
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Mosley has one too.</v>

4620
02:01:48.131 --> 02:01:50.060
<v Speaker 3>And he was out to uh,</v>

4621
02:01:50.150 --> 02:01:50.950
<v Speaker 3>to Canelo.</v>

4622
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:53.210
<v Speaker 3>Canelo has a spot in San Diego.</v>

4623
02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:56.390
<v Speaker 3>We got to talking about how um,</v>

4624
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:59.470
<v Speaker 3>being at an altitude or being a big barrier,</v>

4625
02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:02.960
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't work as far as l two wise because it was still do it to get like away</v>

4626
02:02:02.961 --> 02:02:04.770
<v Speaker 3>from the world and get like focused on it.</v>

4627
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.110
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by it doesn't work?</v>

4628
02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:08.390
<v Speaker 3>Certainly there's arguments about um,</v>

4629
02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:13.660
<v Speaker 3>it's better to sleep low or to train low and then see Pi and then people go up</v>

4630
02:02:14.121 --> 02:02:14.781
<v Speaker 3>there to big bear,</v>

4631
02:02:14.781 --> 02:02:15.561
<v Speaker 3>which if you're not there,</v>

4632
02:02:15.561 --> 02:02:18.200
<v Speaker 3>I guess the argument is free not there for a long enough period of time.</v>

4633
02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:21.380
<v Speaker 3>They are actually getting less out of your workouts because it's harder because</v>

4634
02:02:21.381 --> 02:02:23.020
<v Speaker 3>you can't breathe and then it links it actually,</v>

4635
02:02:23.090 --> 02:02:24.570
<v Speaker 3>which is the whole concept behind it.</v>

4636
02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:25.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4637
02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:26.030
<v Speaker 3>I do like the,</v>

4638
02:02:26.090 --> 02:02:28.040
<v Speaker 3>when you were asking what I do for cardio,</v>

4639
02:02:28.041 --> 02:02:28.820
<v Speaker 3>like I'll do a,</v>

4640
02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:30.950
<v Speaker 3>and I've been doing it for fucking years and years now.</v>

4641
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Probably since I really took off my career was a high altitude training with</v>

4642
02:02:35.271 --> 02:02:35.940
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4643
02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:39.230
<v Speaker 3>I have like a machine that pumps nitrogen so you're actually getting less.</v>

4644
02:02:39.710 --> 02:02:42.020
<v Speaker 3>It's simulates whatever altitude that you want and what do you do?</v>

4645
02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:44.750
<v Speaker 3>Like a sprints on a treadmill I'll do like a,</v>

4646
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:46.270
<v Speaker 3>I'll as soon as I signed the papers,</v>

4647
02:02:46.300 --> 02:02:47.420
<v Speaker 3>if I have six weeks,</v>

4648
02:02:47.421 --> 02:02:47.811
<v Speaker 3>eight weeks,</v>

4649
02:02:47.811 --> 02:02:48.860
<v Speaker 3>however long it is for the fight,</v>

4650
02:02:48.861 --> 02:02:52.520
<v Speaker 3>like I just started sleeping and using it when I sleep and then as I had my</v>

4651
02:02:52.521 --> 02:02:55.010
<v Speaker 3>cardio gets good and I'm starting to feel confident in my cardio and I need to</v>

4652
02:02:55.011 --> 02:02:56.270
<v Speaker 3>start working it and testing it.</v>

4653
02:02:56.690 --> 02:03:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Then I'll start doing like a tabata sprints with the fucking the mask at 10,000</v>

4654
02:03:01.551 --> 02:03:02.800
<v Speaker 3>feet on the trek.</v>

4655
02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:05.820
<v Speaker 3>Kirsten has been doing it on like a treadmill a lot or not tribal,</v>

4656
02:03:05.821 --> 02:03:06.654
<v Speaker 3>a rowing machine.</v>

4657
02:03:07.190 --> 02:03:08.450
<v Speaker 3>But then I live in do pad work.</v>

4658
02:03:08.451 --> 02:03:10.820
<v Speaker 3>I do bag work or to do all kinds of shit with that fucking thing.</v>

4659
02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.660
<v Speaker 3>You're not just a device.</v>

4660
02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Are you talking about that training mass thing?</v>

4661
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:16.680
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that mass and that that was going to say,</v>

4662
02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:21.440
<v Speaker 3>actually I'd say a hypoxic co is the brand and it's this big machine and it</v>

4663
02:03:21.441 --> 02:03:22.490
<v Speaker 3>pumps nitrogen.</v>

4664
02:03:22.491 --> 02:03:26.870
<v Speaker 3>And so as the same you're taking the same breasts but like volume wise of those</v>

4665
02:03:26.871 --> 02:03:31.871
<v Speaker 3>same breasts where I'm breathing oxygen now it would be 80% oxygen at 20%</v>

4666
02:03:32.871 --> 02:03:33.350
<v Speaker 3>nitrogen,</v>

4667
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:35.330
<v Speaker 3>which lowers the amount of oxygen that you're breathing.</v>

4668
02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:39.950
<v Speaker 3>And what that does is it tricks your attends this makes your body golf.</v>

4669
02:03:39.951 --> 02:03:40.161
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

4670
02:03:40.161 --> 02:03:42.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm not getting enough air out of edge.</v>

4671
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:43.670
<v Speaker 3>Each breath I need to be more,</v>

4672
02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:45.313
<v Speaker 3>more uh,</v>

4673
02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:45.950
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

4674
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:49.500
<v Speaker 3>So you'll body will release e uh,</v>

4675
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:53.870
<v Speaker 3>red blood cells from your bone marrow and that's how you increase your red blood</v>

4676
02:03:53.871 --> 02:03:54.704
<v Speaker 3>cell or home.</v>

4677
02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:55.340
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

4678
02:03:55.340 --> 02:03:56.173
<v Speaker 3>That's like safe.</v>

4679
02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Which is,</v>

4680
02:03:56.540 --> 02:03:57.151
<v Speaker 3>which is what the,</v>

4681
02:03:57.151 --> 02:04:02.151
<v Speaker 3>it's like that's blood doping but it's like on like a way lower scale Ganguly</v>

4682
02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:03.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4683
02:04:03.230 --> 02:04:04.880
<v Speaker 3>My coach notices it right away.</v>

4684
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:09.110
<v Speaker 3>When I started using it like the a year lytec acid buildup and like your,</v>

4685
02:04:09.111 --> 02:04:11.120
<v Speaker 3>your cardio will increase every time you do it.</v>

4686
02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:12.201
<v Speaker 3>And you do.</v>

4687
02:04:12.201 --> 02:04:14.690
<v Speaker 3>How many of those a week peak training?</v>

4688
02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:17.150
<v Speaker 3>When I'm like peak it and like it depends on every,</v>

4689
02:04:17.180 --> 02:04:17.571
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

4690
02:04:17.571 --> 02:04:18.321
<v Speaker 3>every camp is different,</v>

4691
02:04:18.321 --> 02:04:20.450
<v Speaker 3>but like I'll try and I'll at least twice,</v>

4692
02:04:20.451 --> 02:04:20.890
<v Speaker 3>three times.</v>

4693
02:04:20.890 --> 02:04:21.360
<v Speaker 3>But you're seeing it.</v>

4694
02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:22.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm sleeping in at night.</v>

4695
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:23.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4696
02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:24.260
<v Speaker 3>It was one of those tests.</v>

4697
02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:28.400
<v Speaker 3>I had the big tent and by chick didn't like it and the tent was like,</v>

4698
02:04:28.401 --> 02:04:33.080
<v Speaker 3>to say it was like too big because it was like a room and the room it gets hot</v>

4699
02:04:33.110 --> 02:04:35.120
<v Speaker 3>and then it smells like you're sleeping on the fucking tent.</v>

4700
02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.140
<v Speaker 3>I had one of my son,</v>

4701
02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 3>I was like awesome.</v>

4702
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:38.933
<v Speaker 3>Like soup.</v>

4703
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:39.883
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4704
02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:40.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4705
02:04:40.770 --> 02:04:41.100
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4706
02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:43.290
<v Speaker 3>Well it's a big ass fucked your whole night up.</v>

4707
02:04:43.540 --> 02:04:47.490
<v Speaker 3>It's a big ass tenant has like my fucking dressers and like it's a fucking room</v>

4708
02:04:47.491 --> 02:04:48.324
<v Speaker 3>in the room.</v>

4709
02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:49.770
<v Speaker 3>So then I ended up getting a,</v>

4710
02:04:49.771 --> 02:04:50.604
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4711
02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:51.360
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

4712
02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:52.140
<v Speaker 3>a pod.</v>

4713
02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:52.411
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4714
02:04:52.411 --> 02:04:53.430
<v Speaker 3>like I fucking made it.</v>

4715
02:04:53.431 --> 02:04:53.890
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

4716
02:04:53.890 --> 02:04:54.691
<v Speaker 3>it's actually really,</v>

4717
02:04:54.691 --> 02:04:54.771
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4718
02:04:54.771 --> 02:04:56.630
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if I have a picture oppressive.</v>

4719
02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:00.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the air that we got like these plastic bins at home depot,</v>

4720
02:05:00.871 --> 02:05:02.160
<v Speaker 3>the biggest plastic bin and could find,</v>

4721
02:05:02.161 --> 02:05:04.310
<v Speaker 3>I cut like one wall off of it.</v>

4722
02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:04.741
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4723
02:05:04.741 --> 02:05:06.810
<v Speaker 3>kidding thing in the back.</v>

4724
02:05:06.811 --> 02:05:07.644
<v Speaker 3>And then I got a,</v>

4725
02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:08.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4726
02:05:08.190 --> 02:05:13.190
<v Speaker 3>a sheet like a tarp and I ain't get so it's inside of the inside.</v>

4727
02:05:13.531 --> 02:05:14.580
<v Speaker 3>Like when I lay in,</v>

4728
02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:17.160
<v Speaker 3>there's like a fucking plastic bin over my head.</v>

4729
02:05:17.250 --> 02:05:17.470
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

4730
02:05:17.470 --> 02:05:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Hema Gaiman is out plastic tarp was lays over the sheets or whatever and it was</v>

4731
02:05:21.481 --> 02:05:23.430
<v Speaker 3>pumping the how you sleep.</v>

4732
02:05:23.470 --> 02:05:24.380
<v Speaker 3>I love that word.</v>

4733
02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:25.740
<v Speaker 3>So it definitely works.</v>

4734
02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:27.093
<v Speaker 3>Definitely works</v>

4735
02:05:29.250 --> 02:05:29.550
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

4736
02:05:29.550 --> 02:05:30.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna see if I find them on the phone.</v>

4737
02:05:30.661 --> 02:05:31.494
<v Speaker 3>Bless you man.</v>

4738
02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:35.400
<v Speaker 3>It can't be like paranoid of close spaces when you're in a spot like that.</v>

4739
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.700
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4740
02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:37.020
<v Speaker 3>You chick sleep with you two in there.</v>

4741
02:05:37.290 --> 02:05:40.320
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way that she would like do it cause she didn't want the biggest</v>

4742
02:05:40.321 --> 02:05:41.154
<v Speaker 3>10 anymore.</v>

4743
02:05:41.790 --> 02:05:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Now I have like sometimes like she'll get in there but like she didn't like it</v>

4744
02:05:44.471 --> 02:05:45.840
<v Speaker 3>and then it's really way too close.</v>

4745
02:05:46.290 --> 02:05:47.123
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

4746
02:05:47.150 --> 02:05:47.983
<v Speaker 3>She should do.</v>

4747
02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:49.270
<v Speaker 3>But that a,</v>

4748
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:50.370
<v Speaker 3>it does really increase your,</v>

4749
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4750
02:05:50.980 --> 02:05:51.741
<v Speaker 3>like your,</v>

4751
02:05:51.741 --> 02:05:52.770
<v Speaker 3>your car do it this way.</v>

4752
02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:54.150
<v Speaker 3>Have you been one of those Joe?</v>

4753
02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:54.611
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4754
02:05:54.611 --> 02:05:54.781
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4755
02:05:54.781 --> 02:05:56.370
<v Speaker 3>I never slept one of the nice home one.</v>

4756
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4757
02:05:57.571 --> 02:05:58.800
<v Speaker 3>the soup thinks hilarious.</v>

4758
02:05:58.810 --> 02:06:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Would you own chamber?</v>

4759
02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:01.951
<v Speaker 3>Hyperbolic.</v>

4760
02:06:01.951 --> 02:06:02.820
<v Speaker 3>A hyperbolic.</v>

4761
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:03.990
<v Speaker 3>A hyperbolic,</v>

4762
02:06:04.110 --> 02:06:05.040
<v Speaker 3>so it was less oxygen.</v>

4763
02:06:05.041 --> 02:06:08.960
<v Speaker 3>Like when I was talking to us and it was one of those like pods and Barrick.</v>

4764
02:06:09.370 --> 02:06:10.500
<v Speaker 3>I watched all these things.</v>

4765
02:06:10.510 --> 02:06:12.180
<v Speaker 3>You see that one on the top left?</v>

4766
02:06:12.181 --> 02:06:13.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like just over his head.</v>

4767
02:06:13.650 --> 02:06:13.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4768
02:06:13.831 --> 02:06:14.770
<v Speaker 3>It looks like that's what I,</v>

4769
02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:15.613
<v Speaker 3>that's what I</v>

4770
02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:21.210
<v Speaker 3>click one gentlemen is try and take your rod hall down.</v>

4771
02:06:21.211 --> 02:06:23.550
<v Speaker 3>You write all props to Joe making your own shit.</v>

4772
02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:24.420
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

4773
02:06:24.590 --> 02:06:25.423
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4774
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Slang those dogs,</v>

4775
02:06:27.211 --> 02:06:28.170
<v Speaker 3>hyperbaric chambers,</v>

4776
02:06:28.171 --> 02:06:31.260
<v Speaker 3>that's or hypo barrack or hyperbaric different things.</v>

4777
02:06:31.261 --> 02:06:31.471
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4778
02:06:31.471 --> 02:06:32.730
<v Speaker 3>One of them was his pumps.</v>

4779
02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Tons of oxygen.</v>

4780
02:06:33.721 --> 02:06:36.060
<v Speaker 3>Right to you and that's just supposed to be really good for like knock out</v>

4781
02:06:36.061 --> 02:06:39.090
<v Speaker 3>recovery and stuff like that and then what I have is to,</v>

4782
02:06:39.150 --> 02:06:39.931
<v Speaker 3>it decreases,</v>

4783
02:06:39.931 --> 02:06:40.210
<v Speaker 3>your honor.</v>

4784
02:06:40.210 --> 02:06:42.870
<v Speaker 3>You're basically suffocating yourself all night long.</v>

4785
02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:43.830
<v Speaker 3>Which one were you saying?</v>

4786
02:06:44.030 --> 02:06:44.641
<v Speaker 3>Your body's like,</v>

4787
02:06:44.641 --> 02:06:45.061
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck,</v>

4788
02:06:45.061 --> 02:06:47.220
<v Speaker 3>you need to be more red blood cells because you're dark,</v>

4789
02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:48.270
<v Speaker 3>which when Shan't Shanda pumps the,</v>

4790
02:06:48.271 --> 02:06:49.320
<v Speaker 3>all the pure oxygen.</v>

4791
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:51.640
<v Speaker 3>That's the hyper is it?</v>

4792
02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it?</v>

4793
02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:53.790
<v Speaker 3>That's what I had.</v>

4794
02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:54.980
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was hyperbaric.</v>

4795
02:06:55.540 --> 02:06:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Hyperbaric.</v>

4796
02:06:56.210 --> 02:06:56.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4797
02:06:56.370 --> 02:06:56.931
<v Speaker 3>hyper bag.</v>

4798
02:06:56.931 --> 02:06:57.391
<v Speaker 3>That's all I had,</v>

4799
02:06:57.391 --> 02:06:59.460
<v Speaker 3>but it was soft,</v>

4800
02:06:59.461 --> 02:07:00.990
<v Speaker 3>so I guess it wasn't working as well.</v>

4801
02:07:00.991 --> 02:07:03.630
<v Speaker 3>So then I went to a guy in la that had a hard one.</v>

4802
02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:05.190
<v Speaker 3>It was like this thick glass.</v>

4803
02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:06.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4804
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:09.720
<v Speaker 3>I know why you're Ryan Faber used that after the Aldo fight,</v>

4805
02:07:09.721 --> 02:07:12.390
<v Speaker 3>their repairs leg after he got leg kicked.</v>

4806
02:07:12.410 --> 02:07:13.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4807
02:07:13.110 --> 02:07:13.681
<v Speaker 3>Which is a PR.</v>

4808
02:07:13.681 --> 02:07:16.200
<v Speaker 3>It was a brutal fight to watch his leg swole up.</v>

4809
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:18.720
<v Speaker 3>Derek Brunson with a good knee to the body.</v>

4810
02:07:19.710 --> 02:07:21.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't see this fight last long.</v>

4811
02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4812
02:07:23.730 --> 02:07:25.740
<v Speaker 3>Bronson was able to stop the bum rush,</v>

4813
02:07:25.770 --> 02:07:26.603
<v Speaker 3>which is big.</v>

4814
02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:26.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4815
02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:27.780
<v Speaker 3>you got a lot of time though.</v>

4816
02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:29.610
<v Speaker 3>See that spinning kick,</v>

4817
02:07:30.210 --> 02:07:32.140
<v Speaker 3>powerful Jamison shorts when you're at home.</v>

4818
02:07:32.460 --> 02:07:33.121
<v Speaker 3>Just spinning.</v>

4819
02:07:33.121 --> 02:07:33.691
<v Speaker 3>Kick man.</v>

4820
02:07:33.691 --> 02:07:34.920
<v Speaker 3>It's his straight shots.</v>

4821
02:07:34.930 --> 02:07:35.201
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

4822
02:07:35.201 --> 02:07:36.550
<v Speaker 3>he's so efficient</v>

4823
02:07:36.550 --> 02:07:37.301
<v Speaker 1>with his movements.</v>

4824
02:07:37.301 --> 02:07:38.134
<v Speaker 1>When he's striking,</v>

4825
02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:39.430
<v Speaker 1>he's tough to take down,</v>

4826
02:07:39.431 --> 02:07:39.611
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4827
02:07:39.611 --> 02:07:40.660
<v Speaker 1>He was with us at rain.</v>

4828
02:07:40.661 --> 02:07:42.310
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking freak athlete.</v>

4829
02:07:43.090 --> 02:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I think his distance is really hard to read to this movement patterns.</v>

4830
02:07:46.881 --> 02:07:49.500
<v Speaker 1>And then the distance that your highest strikes from is</v>

4831
02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Bronson banks at Danforth shelling.</v>

4832
02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:54.971
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4833
02:07:54.971 --> 02:07:56.140
<v Speaker 1>that is a wrap.</v>

4834
02:07:56.620 --> 02:07:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

4835
02:07:58.240 --> 02:07:58.541
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4836
02:07:58.541 --> 02:07:59.080
<v Speaker 1>dance it.</v>

4837
02:07:59.080 --> 02:07:59.913
<v Speaker 1>Dance it.</v>

4838
02:08:01.090 --> 02:08:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mad at that dance.</v>

4839
02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:03.873
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4840
02:08:04.170 --> 02:08:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Just can't get on track.</v>

4841
02:08:05.530 --> 02:08:06.640
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about that stuff?</v>

4842
02:08:06.650 --> 02:08:07.400
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

4843
02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:08.233
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4844
02:08:09.250 --> 02:08:09.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4845
02:08:09.611 --> 02:08:10.710
<v Speaker 1>me and what he needs to sell.</v>

4846
02:08:11.130 --> 02:08:11.610
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

4847
02:08:11.610 --> 02:08:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I think was way pretty much mature.</v>

4848
02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Let's see the replay.</v>

4849
02:08:16.810 --> 02:08:17.800
<v Speaker 1>It's herb dean again.</v>

4850
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:18.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4851
02:08:18.011 --> 02:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>herb dean is a bad motherfucker.</v>

4852
02:08:19.570 --> 02:08:19.931
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

4853
02:08:19.931 --> 02:08:21.430
<v Speaker 1>If herb thought it was premature,</v>

4854
02:08:21.431 --> 02:08:22.264
<v Speaker 1>he might've been.</v>

4855
02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Herb thought it was time.</v>

4856
02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:24.930
<v Speaker 1>He might've been able to see something.</v>

4857
02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:26.130
<v Speaker 1>You know what you,</v>

4858
02:08:26.130 --> 02:08:29.980
<v Speaker 1>what kind of triggers a little bit is Uriah went for a single leg on herb dean.</v>

4859
02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:33.640
<v Speaker 1>That's usually a bad sign he did after.</v>

4860
02:08:33.641 --> 02:08:36.380
<v Speaker 1>The fact he should have did is after he stopped it,</v>

4861
02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:37.840
<v Speaker 1>he went for a single again.</v>

4862
02:08:37.841 --> 02:08:38.674
<v Speaker 1>Herb,</v>

4863
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:42.400
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to put up a clock to sync this up.</v>

4864
02:08:42.401 --> 02:08:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a clock that syncs up Jamie?</v>

4865
02:08:45.070 --> 02:08:45.903
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4866
02:08:46.210 --> 02:08:46.750
<v Speaker 1>So far.</v>

4867
02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I was almost thinking about rewinding it.</v>

4868
02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:50.110
<v Speaker 1>That'll fuck up our clock,</v>

4869
02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:50.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4870
02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Brunton st title shot.</v>

4871
02:08:51.550 --> 02:08:52.460
<v Speaker 1>He got a relationship.</v>

4872
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Same title shot.</v>

4873
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:55.150
<v Speaker 1>You gotta relax.</v>

4874
02:08:55.151 --> 02:08:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Let's check this out here to see what God,</v>

4875
02:08:58.380 --> 02:08:59.213
<v Speaker 1>I've been there myself.</v>

4876
02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:00.673
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

4877
02:09:01.150 --> 02:09:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Left Hook.</v>

4878
02:09:01.810 --> 02:09:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

4879
02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:03.100
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

4880
02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:04.000
<v Speaker 1>he's pounded them.</v>

4881
02:09:04.001 --> 02:09:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

4882
02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:05.190
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

4883
02:09:05.190 --> 02:09:05.561
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4884
02:09:05.561 --> 02:09:06.920
<v Speaker 1>he's not really doing much there.</v>

4885
02:09:07.210 --> 02:09:08.740
<v Speaker 1>He get his lifted his arms up.</v>

4886
02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Now watch this.</v>

4887
02:09:10.690 --> 02:09:11.740
<v Speaker 1>This how you know he's fucked up.</v>

4888
02:09:11.741 --> 02:09:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Watch him shoot this beautiful single leg on her.</v>

4889
02:09:14.050 --> 02:09:14.231
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4890
02:09:14.231 --> 02:09:15.064
<v Speaker 1>what a left.</v>

4891
02:09:16.030 --> 02:09:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

4892
02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4893
02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:21.160
<v Speaker 1>he his head him.</v>

4894
02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:22.601
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4895
02:09:22.601 --> 02:09:22.841
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4896
02:09:22.841 --> 02:09:23.051
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4897
02:09:23.051 --> 02:09:24.520
<v Speaker 1>You've got to give a guy a chance to recover.</v>

4898
02:09:24.530 --> 02:09:25.363
<v Speaker 1>Who wasn't even hitting him.</v>

4899
02:09:25.390 --> 02:09:26.320
<v Speaker 1>That's a little premature.</v>

4900
02:09:26.321 --> 02:09:27.430
<v Speaker 1>He was fucked up though.</v>

4901
02:09:27.610 --> 02:09:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean he definitely got tacked up.</v>

4902
02:09:29.001 --> 02:09:29.610
<v Speaker 1>We're getting dropped.</v>

4903
02:09:29.610 --> 02:09:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

4904
02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with that.</v>

4905
02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:33.130
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to move Herb's a little off tonight.</v>

4906
02:09:33.131 --> 02:09:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Can we all agree on that?</v>

4907
02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:34.841
<v Speaker 1>We're all friends.</v>

4908
02:09:34.841 --> 02:09:35.380
<v Speaker 1>We all love him.</v>

4909
02:09:35.380 --> 02:09:35.711
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4910
02:09:35.711 --> 02:09:36.544
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely,</v>

4911
02:09:37.770 --> 02:09:38.603
<v Speaker 1>I think this,</v>

4912
02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:39.700
<v Speaker 1>this was off.</v>

4913
02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Cut Him some slack.</v>

4914
02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:41.381
<v Speaker 1>This was off.</v>

4915
02:09:41.381 --> 02:09:42.520
<v Speaker 1>That's such a great job.</v>

4916
02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4917
02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Herb's having an off night.</v>

4918
02:09:44.951 --> 02:09:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has an offline in the office sometimes.</v>

4919
02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:49.151
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

4920
02:09:49.151 --> 02:09:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

4921
02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:53.770
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because I would like to see Brunson actually finish it.</v>

4922
02:09:53.771 --> 02:09:54.251
<v Speaker 1>Finish it.</v>

4923
02:09:54.251 --> 02:09:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think maybe if you gave him more time he would have been able to finish</v>

4924
02:09:56.891 --> 02:10:00.340
<v Speaker 1>it conclusively and we wouldn't be sitting here doing this and it would still</v>

4925
02:10:00.670 --> 02:10:02.800
<v Speaker 1>cause you don't want to take anything away from that left hook.</v>

4926
02:10:02.801 --> 02:10:04.180
<v Speaker 1>That was beautiful that you know what?</v>

4927
02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:05.080
<v Speaker 1>That was a little premature.</v>

4928
02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:05.740
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

4929
02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:05.870
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

4930
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:06.340
<v Speaker 1>this time,</v>

4931
02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:08.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it was premature and tears money,</v>

4932
02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:08.961
<v Speaker 1>they'll left.</v>

4933
02:10:08.961 --> 02:10:10.450
<v Speaker 1>The other ones didn't get it cause you know what?</v>

4934
02:10:10.451 --> 02:10:13.180
<v Speaker 1>When he shot that single leg to get up on her right away,</v>

4935
02:10:13.181 --> 02:10:13.430
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

4936
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

4937
02:10:13.870 --> 02:10:14.703
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

4938
02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:15.730
<v Speaker 1>He also grabbed him.</v>

4939
02:10:15.731 --> 02:10:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4940
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:16.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

4941
02:10:16.661 --> 02:10:17.101
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

4942
02:10:17.101 --> 02:10:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Why is your leg here?</v>

4943
02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have pants on?</v>

4944
02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:20.343
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>

4945
02:10:20.710 --> 02:10:23.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was turned up and probably closing his eyes,</v>

4946
02:10:23.861 --> 02:10:27.550
<v Speaker 1>you know turtled up trying to avoid the punches that were coming in his face.</v>

4947
02:10:27.790 --> 02:10:28.870
<v Speaker 1>But who knows?</v>

4948
02:10:29.140 --> 02:10:30.760
<v Speaker 1>It just seemed like they didn't land.</v>

4949
02:10:30.970 --> 02:10:32.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like he got hit with that one big shot.</v>

4950
02:10:32.741 --> 02:10:33.260
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4951
02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 1>but then the two</v>

4952
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:34.880
<v Speaker 3>afterwards,</v>

4953
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:36.500
<v Speaker 3>they were kind of deflect his head.</v>

4954
02:10:36.501 --> 02:10:37.040
<v Speaker 3>Was it?</v>

4955
02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:37.460
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

4956
02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:41.480
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't doing what a guy who was conscious with do with his head or neck.</v>

4957
02:10:41.481 --> 02:10:43.130
<v Speaker 3>I feel like he was certainly conscious.</v>

4958
02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:45.170
<v Speaker 3>It's a matter of how compromised he was.</v>

4959
02:10:45.190 --> 02:10:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4960
02:10:45.550 --> 02:10:47.030
<v Speaker 3>Well cause if you look at it,</v>

4961
02:10:47.031 --> 02:10:48.170
<v Speaker 3>the head's not moving at all.</v>

4962
02:10:48.171 --> 02:10:48.741
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4963
02:10:48.741 --> 02:10:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Like he's,</v>

4964
02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:50.810
<v Speaker 3>it says not reacting to anything.</v>

4965
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:53.330
<v Speaker 3>His arms are up stiff and it's not moving,</v>

4966
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:57.110
<v Speaker 3>but it was enough to stop the two punches that he was trying to throw at him</v>

4967
02:10:57.111 --> 02:10:58.260
<v Speaker 3>from hitting them all is,</v>

4968
02:10:58.270 --> 02:10:59.750
<v Speaker 3>is that him or is that bad?</v>

4969
02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:00.793
<v Speaker 3>Is it a shot?</v>

4970
02:11:01.310 --> 02:11:01.561
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4971
02:11:01.561 --> 02:11:02.900
<v Speaker 3>We're on the fence about that.</v>

4972
02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:04.010
<v Speaker 3>I think you let it go.</v>

4973
02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:05.090
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you on this one.</v>

4974
02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:05.661
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

4975
02:11:05.661 --> 02:11:07.130
<v Speaker 3>Here's where you give the herb dean.</v>

4976
02:11:07.131 --> 02:11:10.440
<v Speaker 3>The benefit of the doubt though said herb was looking in his eyes while all the</v>

4977
02:11:10.441 --> 02:11:12.800
<v Speaker 3>shit was going down and he might've not been there.</v>

4978
02:11:12.850 --> 02:11:13.340
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

4979
02:11:13.340 --> 02:11:18.340
<v Speaker 3>He might've been off in the dark lands or wrangle from different from the camera</v>

4980
02:11:19.650 --> 02:11:21.290
<v Speaker 3>is it actually looks like he's getting hit.</v>

4981
02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:21.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4982
02:11:21.591 --> 02:11:23.120
<v Speaker 3>horses are angle just as better.</v>

4983
02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:24.693
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

4984
02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:25.593
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4985
02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:28.370
<v Speaker 3>I would say that herb has the best view ever though.</v>

4986
02:11:28.371 --> 02:11:29.204
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4987
02:11:29.250 --> 02:11:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Top of them ever.</v>

4988
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:31.663
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

4989
02:11:31.670 --> 02:11:32.503
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to,</v>

4990
02:11:32.990 --> 02:11:34.880
<v Speaker 3>hard to really predict.</v>

4991
02:11:35.570 --> 02:11:36.500
<v Speaker 3>Where are they tonight?</v>

4992
02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Hildago where the hell is that?</v>

4993
02:11:39.290 --> 02:11:41.450
<v Speaker 3>South Texas near the border of Mexico.</v>

4994
02:11:41.451 --> 02:11:46.451
<v Speaker 3>Cause I put Hashtag where the fuck is Hilton and then Pique some guys like I'm</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm from their asshole.</v>

4997
02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:53.470
<v Speaker 3>If you're from Hildago closest major city to rattle dog Max.</v>

02:11:56.420 --> 02:11:57.350
<v Speaker 3>I actually don't know.</v>

5001
02:11:57.351 --> 02:11:58.184
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

5002
02:11:58.880 --> 02:11:59.713
<v Speaker 3>Don't quote me on that.</v>

5003
02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:00.501
<v Speaker 3>If you want to fly in,</v>

5004
02:12:00.501 --> 02:12:04.240
<v Speaker 3>you got to fly to Mexico and they take you over on some sort of a shot.</v>

5005
02:12:04.241 --> 02:12:04.700
<v Speaker 3>Am I right?</v>

5006
02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:05.533
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5007
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:06.980
<v Speaker 3>No it isn't right on the border.</v>

5008
02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Public schools paying off son.</v>

5009
02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:09.561

<v Speaker 3>that's really right on the border.</v>

5012
02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:13.040
<v Speaker 3>How many miles is it from the border of Mexico?</v>

5013
02:12:13.530 --> 02:12:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Let's just do it in Mexico.</v>

5014
02:12:14.631 --> 02:12:15.410
<v Speaker 3>Hong Yossi.</v>

02:12:16.410 --> 02:12:17.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

5017
02:12:17.721 --> 02:12:20.030
<v Speaker 3>It's right there at about wars.</v>

5018
02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:23.150
<v Speaker 3>They should've just brought an all Mexican fighters and treat it like a Mexico</v>

5019
02:12:23.151 --> 02:12:23.810
<v Speaker 3>City card.</v>

5020
02:12:23.810 --> 02:12:26.570

5021
02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:28.221
<v Speaker 3>fucking sick,</v>

5022
02:12:28.221 --> 02:12:31.100
<v Speaker 3>and then they all come out to Mariachi bands and narco songs.</v>

5023
02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:31.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5024
02:12:31.670 --> 02:12:32.750
<v Speaker 3>They're all at the Canelo fight.</v>

5025
02:12:32.751 --> 02:12:33.000
<v Speaker 3>But you,</v>

5026
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:33.440
<v Speaker 3>it'd be,</v>

5027
02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:33.890
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

5028
02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5029
02:12:34.190 --> 02:12:36.430
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do in the Dallas Stadium Son.</v>

5030
02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:37.670
<v Speaker 3>How about Liam Smith?</v>

5031
02:12:37.670 --> 02:12:40.310
<v Speaker 3>He's never fought outside the UK and like,</v>

5032
02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:40.551
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5033
02:12:40.551 --> 02:12:40.940
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

5034
02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Here's Canelo in Dallas stadium sold out.</v>

5035
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Get you somehow.</v>

5036
02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Was it the 50,000 people?</v>

5037
02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:49.120
<v Speaker 3>60 something.</v>

5038
02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:51.860
<v Speaker 3>60,000 can.</v>

5039
02:12:51.861 --> 02:12:53.810
<v Speaker 3>Nelson's can sell some fucking tickets.</v>

5040
02:12:54.260 --> 02:12:56.420
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting is Gennady Golovkin can't.</v>

5041
02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:57.350
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

5042
02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:58.880
<v Speaker 3>It's weird like he does pay per views.</v>

5043
02:12:58.881 --> 02:12:59.840
<v Speaker 3>They don't do well.</v>

5044
02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:01.010
<v Speaker 3>They really don't know.</v>

5045
02:13:01.011 --> 02:13:02.750
<v Speaker 3>That's why he fought an HBO last week.</v>

5046
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:03.681
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5047
02:13:03.681 --> 02:13:04.220
<v Speaker 3>he's not,</v>

5048
02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:04.521
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

5049
02:13:04.521 --> 02:13:06.650
<v Speaker 3>he's not really a paper view fighter,</v>

5050
02:13:06.651 --> 02:13:07.101
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

5051
02:13:07.101 --> 02:13:07.934
<v Speaker 3>in my eyes,</v>

5052
02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:10.280
<v Speaker 3>there's no more exciting fight or maybe ever,</v>

5053
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:12.950
<v Speaker 3>he's blood and guts nasty.</v>

5054
02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:14.210
<v Speaker 3>He's up there.</v>

5055
02:13:14.210 --> 02:13:15.650
<v Speaker 3>He's got nasty boxing,</v>

5056
02:13:15.651 --> 02:13:16.610
<v Speaker 3>beautiful movement.</v>

5057
02:13:16.611 --> 02:13:17.211
<v Speaker 3>He gets on the mic,</v>

5058
02:13:17.211 --> 02:13:18.500
<v Speaker 3>goes big drama show.</v>

5059
02:13:18.710 --> 02:13:20.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to try big drama show.</v>

5060
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:21.141
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

5061
02:13:21.141 --> 02:13:21.411
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5062
02:13:21.411 --> 02:13:24.400
<v Speaker 3>We need something else on crank.</v>

5063
02:13:24.590 --> 02:13:25.423
<v Speaker 3>Here it goes.</v>

5064
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:26.300
<v Speaker 3>So he's down.</v>

5065
02:13:26.810 --> 02:13:27.590
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>

5066
02:13:27.590 --> 02:13:28.160
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

5067
02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:31.070
<v Speaker 3>See the limp left hand and you see the limp lefthand though.</v>

5068
02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 3>Not doing</v>

5069
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:32.790
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

5070
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:33.990
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to see from there.</v>

5071
02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Let's see it from here.</v>

5072
02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:36.840
<v Speaker 1>We can all agree on this.</v>

5073
02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:39.601
<v Speaker 1>How's it beautiful?</v>

5074
02:13:39.601 --> 02:13:40.434
<v Speaker 1>Left Hook.</v>

5075
02:13:42.510 --> 02:13:42.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5076
02:13:42.810 --> 02:13:43.531
<v Speaker 1>those don't land,</v>

5077
02:13:43.531 --> 02:13:44.310
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5078
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Here's my thing is that he loves,</v>

5079
02:13:46.141 --> 02:13:48.690
<v Speaker 1>he's probably still fucked up from that shot while he's down there,</v>

5080
02:13:48.691 --> 02:13:53.070
<v Speaker 1>but none that you didn't stop him from the shot and then those three things that</v>

5081
02:13:53.071 --> 02:13:54.360
<v Speaker 1>he threw all miss.</v>

5082
02:13:54.370 --> 02:13:54.700
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

5083
02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:55.700
<v Speaker 1>What changed?</v>

5084
02:13:55.710 --> 02:13:56.543
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

5085
02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5086
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:58.890
<v Speaker 1>He's certainly controversial.</v>

5087
02:13:59.070 --> 02:14:00.840
<v Speaker 1>He was definitely fucked up on the ground there,</v>

5088
02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:03.150
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't getting more fucked up when he stopped in.</v>

5089
02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:04.141
<v Speaker 1>It's too bad.</v>

5090
02:14:04.141 --> 02:14:07.140
<v Speaker 1>It's controversial because Bronson landed that perfect letters.</v>

5091
02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:10.260
<v Speaker 1>The last shot would never want to take anything away from that moment.</v>

5092
02:14:10.290 --> 02:14:10.710
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

5093
02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:11.760
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing on Bronson.</v>

5094
02:14:11.761 --> 02:14:12.001
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5095
02:14:12.001 --> 02:14:12.451
<v Speaker 1>But it is.</v>

5096
02:14:12.451 --> 02:14:14.410
<v Speaker 1>If everybody could says it's a bullshit stop.</v>

5097
02:14:14.411 --> 02:14:15.600
<v Speaker 1>It just makes you feel bad.</v>

5098
02:14:15.601 --> 02:14:17.120
<v Speaker 1>But people are going to clean.</v>

5099
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:18.030
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

5100
02:14:18.030 --> 02:14:19.950
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to give your eye a half your paycheck.</v>

5101
02:14:19.951 --> 02:14:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

5102
02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I hate to be shitty about it,</v>

5103
02:14:21.450 --> 02:14:26.450
<v Speaker 1>but could they fucking please put a 145 pound weight class in instead of having</v>

5104
02:14:26.551 --> 02:14:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Cyborg starve herself every time they let her fight?</v>

5105
02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:30.930
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't make any sense.</v>

5106
02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5107
02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:32.640
<v Speaker 1>because at one 45,</v>

5108
02:14:32.641 --> 02:14:33.890
<v Speaker 1>she didn't kill a bitch at least.</v>

5109
02:14:33.891 --> 02:14:34.441
<v Speaker 1>So one 40,</v>

5110
02:14:34.441 --> 02:14:35.460
<v Speaker 1>she was dehydrated.</v>

5111
02:14:36.010 --> 02:14:38.560
<v Speaker 1>What poor soul is going in there to fight this girl?</v>

5112
02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Could there be a scarier fighter and Cyborg?</v>

5113
02:14:41.470 --> 02:14:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5121
02:14:55.230 --> 02:14:56.790

5145
02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:32.340
<v Speaker 1>She's terrifying.</v>

5146
02:15:32.550 --> 02:15:33.690
<v Speaker 1>She beats the shit out of checks,</v>

5147
02:15:34.110 --> 02:15:36.450
<v Speaker 1>but she lost two surely.</v>

5148
02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Gonna feed your lost two jury in a barge in a fight.</v>

5149
02:15:38.971 --> 02:15:39.490
<v Speaker 1>We're bars.</v>

5150
02:15:39.490 --> 02:15:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Dominator.</v>

5151
02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:40.680
<v Speaker 1>There's land.</v>

5152
02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Lina Lansburgh.</v>

5153
02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:44.010
<v Speaker 1>She's good dude.</v>

5154
02:15:44.490 --> 02:15:45.660
<v Speaker 1>She's a good kickboxer.</v>

5155
02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:48.160
<v Speaker 1>She's got good striking good movement.</v>

5156
02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:49.290
<v Speaker 1>She's good man.</v>

5157
02:15:49.290 --> 02:15:49.891
<v Speaker 1>That's your shit,</v>

5158
02:15:49.891 --> 02:15:50.071
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5159
02:15:50.071 --> 02:15:50.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5160
02:15:50.241 --> 02:15:53.970
<v Speaker 1>The Front Kick Jab while she throws a round kick and then she comes from behind</v>

5161
02:15:53.971 --> 02:15:55.590
<v Speaker 1>it when you were recovering with a right hand,</v>

5162
02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:57.990
<v Speaker 1>but she's got good elbows in the clinch too.</v>

5163
02:15:58.040 --> 02:15:58.831
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

5164
02:15:58.831 --> 02:16:01.050
<v Speaker 1>is she going to be strong enough to keep cyborg off of her?</v>

5165
02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:03.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the real real question.</v>

5166
02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Is she going to keep her head enough to use our movement?</v>

5167
02:16:06.410 --> 02:16:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Kunar technique.</v>

5168
02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:08.790
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking good dude.</v>

5169
02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:09.930
<v Speaker 1>She's a good striker.</v>

5170
02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't go past two rounds.</v>

5171
02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:13.793
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

5172
02:16:14.190 --> 02:16:14.521
<v Speaker 1>Too Bad.</v>

5173
02:16:14.521 --> 02:16:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Brian counts on here to bet you in a way where he would 12 fucking grant.</v>

5174
02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Those guys say if you let me cross side rails going to hunt.</v>

5175
02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:25.500

5180
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.420
<v Speaker 3>second you look just go double or nothing.</v>

5186
02:16:37.540 --> 02:16:38.380
<v Speaker 3>I haven't heard from him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I guess where I'm going to pay.</v>

5249
02:17:56.860 --> 02:17:57.790
<v Speaker 3>The thing is like,</v>

5250
02:17:58.090 --> 02:17:58.390

5256
02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:04.450
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

5257
02:18:04.450 --> 02:18:07.810
<v Speaker 3>I could just not paying for merchandise or are you just going to accept the fact</v>

5258
02:18:07.811 --> 02:18:10.450
<v Speaker 3>that everything with him is sort of theater?</v>

5259
02:18:10.630 --> 02:18:13.410
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm going to accept that I would never take money from.</v>

5260
02:18:13.930 --> 02:18:14.081
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5261
02:18:14.081 --> 02:18:14.681
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

5262
02:18:14.681 --> 02:18:14.891
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5263
02:18:14.891 --> 02:18:15.790
<v Speaker 3>if he gave me a check,</v>

5264
02:18:16.060 --> 02:18:17.020
<v Speaker 3>here's a lot of money,</v>

5265
02:18:17.021 --> 02:18:17.200
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5266
02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:22.200
<v Speaker 3>If you lost $12,000 and came to him with $12,000 in a bag and just handed it to</v>

5267
02:18:25.301 --> 02:18:25.421
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

5268
02:18:25.421 --> 02:18:26.380
<v Speaker 3>pushed it over to him,</v>

5269
02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:26.831
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

5270
02:18:26.831 --> 02:18:27.161
<v Speaker 3>are you sure?</v>

5271
02:18:27.161 --> 02:18:27.461
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

5272
02:18:27.461 --> 02:18:27.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5273
02:18:27.670 --> 02:18:28.503
<v Speaker 3>you won.</v>

5274
02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:29.980
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he'd give it back to you?</v>

5275
02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:31.390
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

5276
02:18:31.390 --> 02:18:31.750
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

5277
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:32.180
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

5278
02:18:32.180 --> 02:18:32.801
<v Speaker 3>Just keep going.</v>

5279
02:18:32.801 --> 02:18:33.760
<v Speaker 3>No Brian better than me,</v>

5280
02:18:33.761 --> 02:18:34.660
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like you would.</v>

5281
02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:39.760
<v Speaker 3>I just keep going double or nothing until he wins and then there you go.</v>

5282
02:18:39.790 --> 02:18:40.690
<v Speaker 3>That's what he was hoping.</v>

5283
02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:45.230
<v Speaker 3>But now I won't bet on that cause it because the bits that you can't make a bid,</v>

5284
02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:47.220
<v Speaker 3>it can go before he,</v>

5285
02:18:47.221 --> 02:18:48.340
<v Speaker 3>he's eventually going to win.</v>

5286
02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:53.910
<v Speaker 3>You'd be surprised how</v>

<v Speaker 1>football and kids coming to Vegas.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5376
02:21:41.540 --> 02:21:44.270
<v Speaker 1>This is from guys dealing with them since the sale.</v>

5377
02:21:44.330 --> 02:21:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Everyone says Dana is so much better to deal with on negotiations was from I.</v>

5378
02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:52.820
<v Speaker 1>There's I guess in sales he's just way cooler to deal with now for whatever</v>

5379
02:21:52.821 --> 02:21:53.330
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

5380
02:21:53.330 --> 02:21:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

5381
02:21:54.050 --> 02:21:54.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5382

02:21:55.161 --> 02:21:56.030
<v Speaker 1>But they say just wait.</v>

5384
02:21:56.210 --> 02:21:56.511
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5385
02:21:56.511 --> 02:21:59.330
<v Speaker 1>not that he wasn't impossible to deal with.</v>

5386
02:21:59.331 --> 02:21:59.661
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

5387
02:21:59.661 --> 02:21:59.901
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

5388
02:21:59.901 --> 02:22:03.020
<v Speaker 1>his demeanor is completely different in a positive way.</v>

5389
02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

5390
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Which was cool to hear.</v>

5391
02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5392
02:22:05.330 --> 02:22:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was already,</v>

5393
02:22:06.980 --> 02:22:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Dan has been super rich for a long time,</v>

5394
02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:12.890
<v Speaker 1>but there's super rich and then there's like how many hundreds of millions of</v>

5395
02:22:12.890 --> 02:22:14.020
<v Speaker 1>dollars did he make from their Cheddar?</v>

5396
02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:15.630
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't got all of it yet.</v>

5397
02:22:15.631 --> 02:22:15.880
<v Speaker 1>They have to,</v>

5398
02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:16.730
<v Speaker 1>it's like over years,</v>

5399
02:22:16.731 --> 02:22:17.301
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

5400
02:22:17.301 --> 02:22:18.134
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

5401
02:22:18.260 --> 02:22:18.710
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

5402
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:22.820
<v Speaker 1>there's like a level up from what I've heard from people that are going through</v>

5403
02:22:22.821 --> 02:22:23.990
<v Speaker 1>negotiations right now that like,</v>

02:23:00.210 --> 02:23:03.660
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about buying a network at one point in time and it was like</v>

5429
02:23:03.661 --> 02:23:08.040
<v Speaker 1>right before the economy collapsed and if they wound up buying that network,</v>

5430
02:23:08.041 --> 02:23:10.590
<v Speaker 1>who knows where the fucking spoiled I think's going to happen.</v>

5431
02:23:10.591 --> 02:23:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I think once the Fox deal is up,</v>

5432
02:23:12.750 --> 02:23:13.470
<v Speaker 1>and I may have,</v>

5433
02:23:13.470 --> 02:23:15.060
<v Speaker 1>may not have heard this from some smart,</v>

5434
02:23:15.061 --> 02:23:16.140
<v Speaker 1>smart people involved in it,</v>

5435
02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:18.300
<v Speaker 1>you know how the NFL and NBA,</v>

5436
02:23:18.301 --> 02:23:19.500
<v Speaker 1>it's just not on Fox,</v>

5437
02:23:19.501 --> 02:23:20.430
<v Speaker 1>on CBS,</v>

5438
02:23:20.431 --> 02:23:21.264
<v Speaker 1>NBC,</v>

5439
02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:23.880
<v Speaker 1>they think Espn Fox,</v>

5440
02:23:23.881 --> 02:23:27.060
<v Speaker 1>like they're not going to just be on one network with just Fox.</v>

5441
02:23:27.120 --> 02:23:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Have the lightweights in the West on NBC,</v>

5442
02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:32.130
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see like ESPN promoting UFC fights,</v>

5443
02:23:32.131 --> 02:23:32.711
<v Speaker 1>big time.</v>

5444
02:23:32.711 --> 02:23:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Some fights.</v>

5445
02:23:34.021 --> 02:23:37.170
<v Speaker 1>You can see Fox doing it similar how the NBA and NFL,</v>

5446
02:23:37.171 --> 02:23:38.280
<v Speaker 1>this does make sense.</v>

5447
02:23:38.340 --> 02:23:39.960
<v Speaker 1>They just did a NFL game this week,</v>

5448
02:23:39.961 --> 02:23:42.180
<v Speaker 1>broadcast that on Twitter live on Thursday night.</v>

5449
02:23:42.210 --> 02:23:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Like it was on the actual app like on the website or on your phone?</v>

5450
02:23:46.350 --> 02:23:47.400
<v Speaker 1>It was on Twitter.</v>

5451
02:23:47.530 --> 02:23:48.363
<v Speaker 1>I just whoa.</v>

5452
02:23:48.390 --> 02:23:51.270
<v Speaker 1>So he could watch the game on Twitter.</v>

5453
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Trending was trending and then next to a little live button or,</v>

5454
02:23:54.451 --> 02:23:55.050
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

5455
02:23:55.050 --> 02:23:56.090
<v Speaker 1>That's intense.</v>

5456
02:23:56.670 --> 02:23:57.600
<v Speaker 1>That's intense.</v>

5457
02:23:57.780 --> 02:23:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys have those things?</v>

5458
02:23:58.771 --> 02:24:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Those are less scans that you put in your bed and you clip your phone where you</v>

5459
02:24:02.671 --> 02:24:04.200
<v Speaker 1>could just watch your phone like shit.</v>

5460
02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:05.153
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

5461
02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Cause generally if for the longest time I'd have to hold it,</v>

5462
02:24:08.450 --> 02:24:09.300
<v Speaker 1>kind of set it,</v>

5463
02:24:09.570 --> 02:24:09.751

5469

<v Speaker 1>Why don't you get an iPad?</v>

5470
02:24:20.850 --> 02:24:21.070

02:24:24.541 --> 02:24:27.960

<v Speaker 1>Will they had those,</v>

5569
02:27:05.710 --> 02:27:06.950
<v Speaker 1>would that be oh,</v>

5570
02:27:06.970 --> 02:27:07.990
<v Speaker 1>you kind of sell the,</v>

5571
02:27:07.991 --> 02:27:09.070
<v Speaker 1>told him all this energy.</v>

5572
02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5573
02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:10.121
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

5574
02:27:10.121 --> 02:27:13.800
<v Speaker 1>You'd want to put that in the back shed light on the other side of the backyard.</v>

5575
02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:14.673
<v Speaker 1>It's a good point.</v>

5576
02:27:14.860 --> 02:27:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Blows up like the Samsung phones,</v>

5577
02:27:16.751 --> 02:27:17.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5578
02:27:17.410 --> 02:27:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Bill.</v>

5580
02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

5581
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Because think about how small the phone is and think of how big the battery bank</v>

5582
02:27:22.781 --> 02:27:24.940
<v Speaker 1>must be to power your fucking j Lo Mansion.</v>

5583
02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:25.131
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5584
02:27:25.131 --> 02:27:25.600
<v Speaker 1>that's what the,</v>

5585
02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:25.781
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

5586
02:27:25.781 --> 02:27:27.170
<v Speaker 1>that's what that the energy companies,</v>

5587
02:27:27.540 --> 02:27:32.540
<v Speaker 1>you can just start false flagging like houses go solar energy's blowing up</v>

5588
02:27:33.701 --> 02:27:34.534
<v Speaker 1>houses</v>

5589
02:27:35.730 --> 02:27:36.400
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll go like,</v>

5590
02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:36.611
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5591
02:27:36.611 --> 02:27:37.810
<v Speaker 1>we're going to stay on the grid.</v>

5592
02:27:37.990 --> 02:27:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that son.</v>

5593
02:27:38.891 --> 02:27:39.724
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

5594
02:27:40.490 --> 02:27:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5595
02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:42.113
<v Speaker 1>Why do we go?</v>

5596
02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:43.390
<v Speaker 1>What are you thinking about this site?</v>

5597
02:27:43.460 --> 02:27:44.380
<v Speaker 1>We think about this fight.</v>

5598
02:27:45.010 --> 02:27:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Tremendous amount of shit talking between these two.</v>

5599
02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Wayne's were fairly good.</v>

5600
02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:49.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good fight.</v>

5601
02:27:49.871 --> 02:27:50.704
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

5602
02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Johnson is,</v>

5603
02:27:52.151 --> 02:27:52.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5604
02:27:52.380 --> 02:27:52.581
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5605
02:27:52.581 --> 02:27:54.610
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting because he's,</v>

5606
02:27:55.360 --> 02:27:55.631
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

5607
02:27:55.631 --> 02:27:55.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5608
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:59.080
<v Speaker 1>at times like looks real good striking.</v>

5609
02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:00.033
<v Speaker 1>But the question is,</v>

5610
02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:02.010
<v Speaker 1>does he have enough to hang with poor,</v>

5611
02:28:02.011 --> 02:28:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

5612
02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:02.891
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

5613
02:28:02.891 --> 02:28:05.410
<v Speaker 1>does he choose to strike with him or has he tried to take them down?</v>

5614
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Like what is he going to do here?</v>

5615
02:28:06.971 --> 02:28:08.170
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be really interesting.</v>

5616
02:28:08.430 --> 02:28:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Pull a pretty much has the same strategy always presses forward and,</v>

5617
02:28:12.490 --> 02:28:13.570
<v Speaker 1>and tries to strike.</v>

5618
02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Looks great at this weight class though.</v>

5619
02:28:15.250 --> 02:28:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Jamie just pulled up some shit with our ready on Tesla for blowing up.</v>

5620
02:28:18.190 --> 02:28:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5621
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Put that,</v>

5622
02:28:19.090 --> 02:28:20.050
<v Speaker 1>put that back up Jamie.</v>

5623
02:28:20.051 --> 02:28:20.920
<v Speaker 1>There's said tests.</v>

5624
02:28:20.921 --> 02:28:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

5625
02:28:21.130 --> 02:28:26.090
<v Speaker 1>this Tesla's spontaneously catches fire burns down during test drive in France.</v>

5626
02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:31.100
<v Speaker 1>What they should put that on all they to put that on CNN all day for a week.</v>

5627
02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:32.570
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

5628
02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:33.410
<v Speaker 1>And then that's it.</v>

5629
02:28:33.411 --> 02:28:36.110
<v Speaker 1>That it's so easy to get rid of good technology.</v>

5630
02:28:36.290 --> 02:28:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Well they had a problem with Tesla's early on were uh,</v>

5631
02:28:39.530 --> 02:28:43.310
<v Speaker 1>if underground debris or a ground debris,</v>

5632
02:28:43.311 --> 02:28:44.420
<v Speaker 1>like if they rolled over some,</v>

5633
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:48.040
<v Speaker 1>some rocks or something like that and it damaged the under carriage that I get</v>

5634
02:28:48.050 --> 02:28:48.950
<v Speaker 1>to have some issues.</v>

5635
02:28:49.130 --> 02:28:51.350
<v Speaker 1>So they fixed that issue somehow or another,</v>

5636
02:28:51.351 --> 02:28:54.890
<v Speaker 1>they probably like poly urea coated the bottom of the cars or something is they</v>

5637
02:28:54.891 --> 02:28:56.790
<v Speaker 1>put a titanium shield on the bottom there.</v>

5638
02:28:56.800 --> 02:28:57.633
<v Speaker 1>You got that?</v>

5639
02:28:57.740 --> 02:28:58.390
<v Speaker 1>No ma'am.</v>

5640
02:28:58.390 --> 02:28:58.741
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

5641
02:28:58.741 --> 02:28:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5642
02:28:59.020 --> 02:28:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5643
02:28:59.330 --> 02:29:01.010
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to get rid of Tesla.</v>

5644
02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:03.193
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5645
02:29:03.390 --> 02:29:05.460
<v Speaker 1>This is an interesting fight here man.</v>

5646
02:29:05.490 --> 02:29:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Cause Michael Johnson at one point in time was looking real good.</v>

5647
02:29:08.250 --> 02:29:09.420
<v Speaker 1>He was climbing that ladder.</v>

5648
02:29:09.450 --> 02:29:10.380
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Wind Street,</v>

5649
02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:12.870
<v Speaker 1>but the Nate Diaz fight set them back quite a bit.</v>

5650
02:29:14.450 --> 02:29:15.830
<v Speaker 1>He got dismantled in that fight.</v>

5651
02:29:15.831 --> 02:29:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Those the best nights ever looked.</v>

5652
02:29:17.001 --> 02:29:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Good luck being that Nate.</v>

5653
02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:18.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5654
02:29:18.711 --> 02:29:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Nate looked real good man.</v>

5655
02:29:20.390 --> 02:29:23.870
<v Speaker 1>And I was talking to Ludwig about it and he was talking about how the way Nate</v>

5656
02:29:23.871 --> 02:29:25.100
<v Speaker 1>throws his one too.</v>

5657
02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:29.990
<v Speaker 1>He goes like most people go one to like the left hand and then the right hand</v>

5658
02:29:29.991 --> 02:29:31.580
<v Speaker 1>comes behind it with Nate.</v>

5659
02:29:31.581 --> 02:29:33.050
<v Speaker 1>They're coming at you at the same time.</v>

5660
02:29:33.051 --> 02:29:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5661
02:29:33.410 --> 02:29:33.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5662
02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:34.960
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

5663
02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:35.780
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

5664
02:29:35.780 --> 02:29:37.550
<v Speaker 1>they're coming together.</v>

5665
02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:37.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5666
02:29:37.971 --> 02:29:38.271
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

5667
02:29:38.271 --> 02:29:39.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a totally different reason.</v>

5668
02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:40.953
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

02:30:33.990 --> 02:30:35.840
<v Speaker 1>John Big John McCarthy try to stop it,</v>

5714
02:30:35.841 --> 02:30:37.640
<v Speaker 1>but he hit him like an extra shot.</v>

5715
02:30:38.060 --> 02:30:43.060
<v Speaker 1>And then the guy tried to fight tank after that for fucking him up.</v>

5716
02:30:43.490 --> 02:30:44.301
<v Speaker 1>It was so weird.</v>

5717
02:30:44.301 --> 02:30:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Like he wanted to fuck him up for fucking him up to do it.</v>

5718
02:30:47.810 --> 02:30:48.860
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to rally.</v>

5719
02:30:48.860 --> 02:30:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Johnson had just been like,</v>

5720
02:30:50.230 --> 02:30:51.063
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

5721
02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:52.250
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in here man?</v>

5722
02:30:52.280 --> 02:30:53.113
<v Speaker 1>Because he's,</v>

5723
02:30:53.370 --> 02:30:54.680
<v Speaker 1>he keeps talking shit.</v>

5724
02:30:54.770 --> 02:30:55.640
<v Speaker 1>We a beautiful,</v>

5725
02:30:55.641 --> 02:30:57.170
<v Speaker 1>like he's totally out of position.</v>

5726
02:30:57.410 --> 02:31:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Dustin [inaudible] feet were totally out of position and Johnson landed a</v>

5727
02:31:00.771 --> 02:31:01.431
<v Speaker 1>perfect shot.</v>

5728
02:31:01.431 --> 02:31:01.911
<v Speaker 1>Look at the referee,</v>

5729
02:31:01.911 --> 02:31:03.680
<v Speaker 1>lost his shoe first ever.</v>

5730
02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:04.823
<v Speaker 1>First time ever.</v>

5731
02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:05.743
<v Speaker 1>That's what you get.</v>

5732
02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Skechers Bam.</v>

5733
02:31:08.690 --> 02:31:11.630
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting from the other angle because his feet were completely out of</v>

5734
02:31:11.631 --> 02:31:13.430
<v Speaker 1>position and then he cracked him again.</v>

5735
02:31:13.460 --> 02:31:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

5736

5774
02:31:52.681 --> 02:31:54.430
<v Speaker 3>I'd much rather meet them up in this.</v>

5784
02:32:06.361 --> 02:32:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Can let them jot each other.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't want to take any shit now.</v>

5806
02:32:39.721 --> 02:32:41.250
<v Speaker 3>You just want to fuck more people up.</v>

5807
02:32:41.251 --> 02:32:41.930
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5808
02:32:41.930 --> 02:32:44.970
<v Speaker 3>I could only imagine because I've never ever fucked anybody up.</v>

5809
02:32:46.050 --> 02:32:47.040
<v Speaker 3>I could never imagine.</v>

5810
02:32:47.430 --> 02:32:48.860
<v Speaker 3>All I do is as a,</v>

5811
02:32:49.500 --> 02:32:51.210
<v Speaker 3>have you had an animosity Joe Schilling?</v>

<v Speaker 3>you beat a guy.</v>

5815
02:32:52.561 --> 02:32:55.260
<v Speaker 3>Let's say there's bad blood before you guys fight.</v>

5816
02:32:55.380 --> 02:32:56.310
<v Speaker 3>Do you carry on,</v>

5817
02:32:56.340 --> 02:33:00.480
<v Speaker 3>do you hold that bad blood in the locker room kind of get it out?</v>

5818
02:33:00.481 --> 02:33:01.150
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>

5819
02:33:01.150 --> 02:33:01.983
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5820
02:33:02.820 --> 02:33:03.390
<v Speaker 3>Usually.</v>

5821
02:33:03.390 --> 02:33:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever fought a guy where it's just bad mad shit talking like it was like</v>

5822
02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:08.610
<v Speaker 3>out of control</v>

5823
02:33:08.610 --> 02:33:09.510
<v Speaker 8>on Twitter and shit?</v>

5824
02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:10.560
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

5825
02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:10.860
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

5826
02:33:10.860 --> 02:33:13.310
<v Speaker 8>I've had like a couple like beef,</v>

5827
02:33:13.311 --> 02:33:14.970
<v Speaker 8>so like that where we had like multiple fights.</v>

5828
02:33:14.971 --> 02:33:16.290
<v Speaker 8>Me and Levin had three fights.</v>

5829
02:33:16.291 --> 02:33:17.150
<v Speaker 8>Me and uh,</v>

5830
02:33:17.330 --> 02:33:18.560
<v Speaker 8>I followed Simon Martin.</v>

5831
02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:20.940
<v Speaker 8>Twitter's telling each other to fuck off and chat.</v>

5832
02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:21.750
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

5833
02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:22.231
<v Speaker 8>not really.</v>

5834
02:33:22.231 --> 02:33:25.140
<v Speaker 8>I don't think Twitter was one of the interviews and went back and forth space.</v>

5835
02:33:25.570 --> 02:33:30.220
<v Speaker 3>The lemon one was weird because Levin pulled out of your fight and then he</v>

5836
02:33:30.221 --> 02:33:30.851
<v Speaker 3>fought Simon.</v>

5837
02:33:30.851 --> 02:33:32.110
<v Speaker 3>Mark is after that and,</v>

5838
02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:34.150
<v Speaker 3>and just stop fighting at one point in time.</v>

5839
02:33:34.151 --> 02:33:34.361
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5840
02:33:34.361 --> 02:33:34.770
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

5841
02:33:34.770 --> 02:33:37.230
<v Speaker 3>what happened in that fight with</v>

5842
02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:38.830
<v Speaker 8>the assignment and 11,</v>

5843
02:33:38.890 --> 02:33:40.570
<v Speaker 8>I was there and I still don't know what happened.</v>

5844
02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:41.433
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

5845
02:33:41.620 --> 02:33:42.453
<v Speaker 8>I think uh,</v>

5846
02:33:44.820 --> 02:33:45.461
<v Speaker 8>can you got a,</v>

5847
02:33:45.461 --> 02:33:45.761
<v Speaker 8>a,</v>

5848
02:33:45.761 --> 02:33:49.090
<v Speaker 8>a warning or something for hold for holding are I think,</v>

5849
02:33:49.091 --> 02:33:49.840
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

5850
02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:50.740
<v Speaker 8>he got an eight count.</v>

5851
02:33:50.741 --> 02:33:55.390
<v Speaker 8>I think they fell between the ropes and the and 11 and get back in the room</v>

5852
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:56.530
<v Speaker 8>during fast enough.</v>

5853
02:33:56.531 --> 02:33:58.630
<v Speaker 8>So they give him a standing eight count and he got pissed.</v>

5854
02:33:59.690 --> 02:33:59.920
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5855
02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:01.450
<v Speaker 8>He just quit like halfway through the fight.</v>

5856
02:34:01.570 --> 02:34:02.380
<v Speaker 8>Just got up,</v>

5857
02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:03.220
<v Speaker 8>walked out of the ring,</v>

5858
02:34:03.221 --> 02:34:03.580
<v Speaker 8>quit.</v>

5859
02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:04.690
<v Speaker 8>And he hasn't really fought since.</v>

5860
02:34:04.691 --> 02:34:05.170
<v Speaker 8>How's he?</v>

5861
02:34:05.170 --> 02:34:05.381
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

5862
02:34:05.381 --> 02:34:06.214
<v Speaker 8>I don't think so.</v>

5863
02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:08.950
<v Speaker 8>You were saying that you didn't think that he wanted to find anymore?</v>

5864
02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:11.020
<v Speaker 8>It was like one of those things like the reason why,</v>

5865
02:34:11.380 --> 02:34:11.651
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

5866
02:34:11.651 --> 02:34:13.300
<v Speaker 8>I can't imagine anybody like I lost,</v>

5867
02:34:13.301 --> 02:34:15.640
<v Speaker 8>like I had respect for him even though we had like,</v>

5868
02:34:15.700 --> 02:34:16.151
<v Speaker 8>he was like,</v>

5869
02:34:16.151 --> 02:34:16.990
<v Speaker 8>we're rivalry,</v>

5870
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.440
<v Speaker 8>but,</v>

5871
02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:18.241
<v Speaker 8>and then when he did that,</v>

5872
02:34:18.241 --> 02:34:18.970
<v Speaker 8>I just,</v>

5873
02:34:18.970 --> 02:34:22.270
<v Speaker 8>you're like the champion and you're representing kickboxing and representing</v>

5874
02:34:22.271 --> 02:34:24.790
<v Speaker 8>your country and representing all of this like shit.</v>

5875
02:34:24.820 --> 02:34:26.980
<v Speaker 8>And you quit because the,</v>

5876
02:34:27.100 --> 02:34:27.610
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5877

<v Speaker 3>ball home and the,</v>

5879
02:34:29.031 --> 02:34:30.600
<v Speaker 3>and then gave up your world title.</v>

5880
02:34:30.610 --> 02:34:31.443
<v Speaker 3>It was ridiculous.</v>

5881
02:34:32.490 --> 02:34:33.323
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

5882
02:34:34.050 --> 02:34:36.840
<v Speaker 3>He got out of the ring defending his title and quit.</v>

5883
02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:38.753
<v Speaker 3>That was just weird.</v>

5884
02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:39.633

5889
02:34:47.850 --> 02:34:48.683
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

5890

5909
02:35:28.940 --> 02:35:29.870
<v Speaker 3>Do you tie your shoes?</v>

02:35:31.710 --> 02:35:33.500
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever lost your shoe in a scramble?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Gave him a flat tire.</v>

5917
02:35:41.091 --> 02:35:42.350
<v Speaker 3>If you watch that back,</v>

5918
02:35:42.380 --> 02:35:45.260
<v Speaker 3>no one should be sketchers in a street fight.</v>

5919
02:35:45.470 --> 02:35:47.150
<v Speaker 3>You mean pour Yay or Johnson.</v>

5920
02:35:47.210 --> 02:35:47.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm just kidding.</v>

5921
02:35:47.900 --> 02:35:48.430

<v Speaker 3>How did he lose the shoe?</v>

5925
02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:53.503
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

5926
02:35:53.740 --> 02:35:54.950
<v Speaker 3>he'd already laid out right there.</v>

5927
02:35:55.700 --> 02:35:56.600
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad angle.</v>

5928
02:35:56.810 --> 02:35:57.620

02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:00.430
<v Speaker 3>You know what it was?</v>

5933
02:36:00.430 --> 02:36:03.500
<v Speaker 3>She was probably too small because dance feeder so fucking big.</v>

5934
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:06.710
<v Speaker 3>You probably didn't have any shoes that fit him because Dan Merkel Jada's a</v>

5935
02:36:06.711 --> 02:36:07.250
<v Speaker 3>giant,</v>

5939
02:36:14.571 --> 02:36:15.650
<v Speaker 3>they're extra white foot.</v>

5940
02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:17.091
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

5941
02:36:17.091 --> 02:36:19.520
<v Speaker 3>Like people white feet have those new balances,</v>

5942
02:36:19.521 --> 02:36:20.920
<v Speaker 3>those weird old new balances.</v>

5943
02:36:20.930 --> 02:36:22.150
<v Speaker 3>Maybe put the 16 on,</v>

5944
02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:22.431
<v Speaker 3>but he said,</v>

5945
02:36:22.431 --> 02:36:23.264
<v Speaker 3>I just won't tie him.</v>

5946
02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:24.710
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to go away.</v>

5947
02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:29.450
<v Speaker 3>And you know that that's the worst that could happen.</v>

5948
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Function for the Ufcu that SAP Spanish,</v>

5949
02:36:34.580 --> 02:36:36.020
<v Speaker 3>you can hear the Spanish commentary.</v>

5950
02:36:36.730 --> 02:36:38.240
<v Speaker 3>What if the UFC came to you and said,</v>

5951
02:36:38.241 --> 02:36:43.241
<v Speaker 3>we want to add an option to listen to the bike can penguin and they see the</v>

5952
02:36:43.251 --> 02:36:45.770
<v Speaker 3>problem with that is then we would have to guarantee we're going to do it.</v>

5953
02:36:46.460 --> 02:36:47.660
<v Speaker 3>We don't always want to do it.</v>

5954
02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>fight and pain is where we're independent.</v>

5957
02:36:53.420 --> 02:36:53.781
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5958
02:36:53.781 --> 02:36:56.240
<v Speaker 3>we get together and we really wouldn't be doing this anyway.</v>

5959
02:36:56.260 --> 02:36:58.460
<v Speaker 3>We'd be $2 billion.</v>

5960
02:36:58.670 --> 02:36:59.503
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

5961

6000
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:08.023
<v Speaker 2>you could.</v>

6001
02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

6002
02:38:14.110 --> 02:38:15.080
<v Speaker 2>if they weren't real.</v>

6003
02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:16.400
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>

6004
02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:20.690
<v Speaker 2>I believe I was in Denver with my,</v>

6005
02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:24.240
<v Speaker 2>my boy Willie from KBP AI low six,</v>

6006
02:38:24.241 --> 02:38:27.710
<v Speaker 2>seven and willy took me into the parking lot.</v>

6007
02:38:27.711 --> 02:38:28.550
<v Speaker 2>They had a,</v>

6008
02:38:28.551 --> 02:38:28.781
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

6009
02:38:28.781 --> 02:38:32.210
<v Speaker 2>a show that they did live from the parking lot where a dude fluid jetpack.</v>

6010
02:38:32.570 --> 02:38:34.010
<v Speaker 2>So jetpacks do exist.</v>

6011
02:38:34.011 --> 02:38:37.580
<v Speaker 2>But the dude who fluid had two ACL braces on.</v>

6012
02:38:37.940 --> 02:38:38.271
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

6013
02:38:38.271 --> 02:38:38.620
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

6014
02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:39.021
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

6015
02:38:39.021 --> 02:38:40.380
<v Speaker 2>what's up with the ACL brace?</v>

6016
02:38:40.381 --> 02:38:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Does he like,</v>

6017
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:41.061
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

6018
02:38:41.061 --> 02:38:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I fucking crashed the thing so many times for my legs apart.</v>

6019
02:38:44.150 --> 02:38:44.540
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

6020
02:38:44.540 --> 02:38:45.373
<v Speaker 2>at this point,</v>

6021
02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:47.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even going to bother getting it fixed.</v>

6022
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:48.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6023
02:38:48.051 --> 02:38:48.884
<v Speaker 2>they have them,</v>

6024
02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:51.650
<v Speaker 2>but that this guy had this guy,</v>

6025
02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:52.513
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

6026
02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:55.250
<v Speaker 2>this is a much newer prototype with Willie.</v>

6027
02:38:55.290 --> 02:38:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6028
02:38:55.760 --> 02:39:00.720
<v Speaker 2>and the gentleman who we saw this was like 2000 so good looks.</v>

6029
02:39:00.770 --> 02:39:03.140
<v Speaker 2>So back then they could only do it.</v>

6030
02:39:03.140 --> 02:39:06.230
<v Speaker 2>He said they could only fly for 30 seconds.</v>

6031
02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:10.520
<v Speaker 2>So what would happen is he would go 15 seconds up and then it would take about,</v>

6032
02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:12.290
<v Speaker 2>he really wanted to go down.</v>

6033
02:39:12.291 --> 02:39:12.561
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

6034
02:39:12.561 --> 02:39:15.230
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to land in about five seconds.</v>

6035
02:39:15.380 --> 02:39:15.711
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

6036
02:39:15.711 --> 02:39:16.250
<v Speaker 2>because I don't,</v>

6037
02:39:16.250 --> 02:39:18.380
<v Speaker 2>I've needed a buffer at like 30 seconds.</v>

6038
02:39:18.381 --> 02:39:19.430
<v Speaker 2>You're basically out of juice.</v>

6039
02:39:19.431 --> 02:39:20.061
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

6040
02:39:20.061 --> 02:39:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Pleat wastes of time.</v>

6041
02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

6042
02:39:22.010 --> 02:39:23.090
<v Speaker 2>but for now,</v>

6043
02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:26.870
<v Speaker 2>see the thing is virtual reality that for 50 years,</v>

6044
02:39:27.250 --> 02:39:31.610
<v Speaker 2>the thing is virtual reality used to be a waste of time too,</v>

6045
02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:34.760
<v Speaker 2>until the computers and the technology caught up.</v>

6046
02:39:34.761 --> 02:39:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Now they have virtual reality that will freak you the fuck out,</v>

6047
02:39:37.611 --> 02:39:38.180
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6048
02:39:38.180 --> 02:39:40.370
<v Speaker 2>There's a crazy virtual reality you showed me.</v>

6049
02:39:40.970 --> 02:39:41.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6050
02:39:41.190 --> 02:39:41.420
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6051
02:39:41.420 --> 02:39:41.571
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6052
02:39:41.571 --> 02:39:42.404
<v Speaker 2>you never did it.</v>

6053
02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:43.161
<v Speaker 2>He never did it.</v>

6054
02:39:43.161 --> 02:39:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I didn't show you anything.</v>

6055
02:39:44.810 --> 02:39:44.961
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6056
02:39:44.961 --> 02:39:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

6057
02:39:45.410 --> 02:39:45.531
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6058
02:39:45.531 --> 02:39:48.200
<v Speaker 2>I didn't show you never put a goggle on.</v>

6059
02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:50.090
<v Speaker 2>You never went and saw the graph and no,</v>

6060
02:39:50.091 --> 02:39:50.241
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6061
02:39:50.241 --> 02:39:50.391
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6062
02:39:50.391 --> 02:39:50.541
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6063
02:39:50.541 --> 02:39:50.661
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6064
02:39:50.661 --> 02:39:50.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6065
02:39:50.820 --> 02:39:51.001
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6066
02:39:51.001 --> 02:39:51.141
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6067
02:39:51.141 --> 02:39:51.300
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

6068
02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:51.460
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

6069
02:39:51.460 --> 02:39:52.940
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing it in two dimensions.</v>

6070
02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:53.983
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean anything.</v>

6071
02:39:54.110 --> 02:39:56.990
<v Speaker 2>When you put that goggles on and you're looking around in this world,</v>

6072
02:39:57.020 --> 02:39:59.600
<v Speaker 2>even if the graphics aren't perfect day freak,</v>

6073
02:39:59.601 --> 02:40:00.560
<v Speaker 2>you the fuck out.</v>

6074
02:40:01.930 --> 02:40:02.763
<v Speaker 2>They get weird.</v>

6075
02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:05.150
<v Speaker 2>You're walking a wire in a canyon.</v>

6076
02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:06.321
<v Speaker 2>It's and you're like,</v>

6077
02:40:06.321 --> 02:40:07.154
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

6078
02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:08.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared of heights.</v>

6079
02:40:08.570 --> 02:40:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Even in this fucking,</v>

6080
02:40:09.951 --> 02:40:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I was in some hallway where there's a boxing.</v>

6081
02:40:12.531 --> 02:40:13.480
<v Speaker 2>What kind of Shit?</v>

6082
02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:14.640
<v Speaker 2>Here's a boxing one.</v>

6083
02:40:14.641 --> 02:40:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6084
02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:15.040
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

6085
02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:15.721
<v Speaker 2>you boxes guy.</v>

6086
02:40:15.721 --> 02:40:18.840
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because you hold these handles.</v>

6087
02:40:19.010 --> 02:40:22.770
<v Speaker 2>You got to hold them like this for your fist to look like this and the game.</v>

6088
02:40:22.950 --> 02:40:23.940
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>

6089
02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:26.850
<v Speaker 2>So like you looks like you're hitting the guy like this with your hands,</v>

6090
02:40:26.940 --> 02:40:28.530
<v Speaker 2>but you're really doing this in the air.</v>

6091
02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:33.620
<v Speaker 2>It's so it's not 100% like boxing technique but you could change that mean you</v>

6092
02:40:33.951 --> 02:40:37.200
<v Speaker 2>could definitely change it to you're putting something in your hand and wherever</v>

6093
02:40:37.201 --> 02:40:38.190
<v Speaker 2>position your hand is in,</v>

6094
02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:40.680
<v Speaker 2>that's the position the gloves would be in and then it would feel a lot more</v>

6095
02:40:40.681 --> 02:40:41.100
<v Speaker 2>natural.</v>

6096
02:40:41.100 --> 02:40:41.730
<v Speaker 2>But it's very,</v>

6097
02:40:41.730 --> 02:40:42.570
<v Speaker 2>this is what it looks like.</v>

6098
02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:44.490
<v Speaker 2>It's very rudimentary right now.</v>

6099
02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:49.580
<v Speaker 2>But for as far as like movement and as far as like teaching someone how to avoid</v>

6100
02:40:50.521 --> 02:40:51.720
<v Speaker 2>punches and counter,</v>

6101
02:40:51.750 --> 02:40:54.660
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel anything when you hit him but you,</v>

6102
02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:58.350
<v Speaker 2>you do have to move correctly in order to hit it.</v>

6103
02:40:58.351 --> 02:41:00.060
<v Speaker 2>What happens if you throw the right technique,</v>

6104
02:41:00.061 --> 02:41:00.690
<v Speaker 2>the punches just,</v>

6105
02:41:00.690 --> 02:41:01.670
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't snap with it.</v>

6106
02:41:01.710 --> 02:41:03.570
<v Speaker 2>You should have happens if you do throw,</v>

6107
02:41:03.571 --> 02:41:06.820
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter because it's not based on how the punch actually what,</v>

6108
02:41:06.821 --> 02:41:08.490
<v Speaker 2>what position that glove is when it lands.</v>

6109
02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:11.750
<v Speaker 2>It's based on whether the glove lands to do it.</v>

6110
02:41:11.751 --> 02:41:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Like with like some kind of helmet that electroids connect to your brain where</v>

6111
02:41:16.170 --> 02:41:17.870
<v Speaker 2>you could kind of feel when you yes.</v>

6112
02:41:17.950 --> 02:41:18.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6113
02:41:18.281 --> 02:41:18.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

6114
02:41:18.660 --> 02:41:20.570
<v Speaker 2>And get zapped a little zap.</v>

6115
02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:22.140
<v Speaker 2>But then that</v>

6116
02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:27.930
<v Speaker 2>that gives you a Parkinson's quicker than actual trauma.</v>

6117
02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:28.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6118
02:41:28.081 --> 02:41:28.980
<v Speaker 2>here's what happened.</v>

6119
02:41:29.130 --> 02:41:33.330
<v Speaker 2>The dude in the video game caught me with a punch and that when they catch it,</v>

6120
02:41:33.331 --> 02:41:34.920
<v Speaker 2>you see a flash that's kind of,</v>

6121
02:41:34.970 --> 02:41:37.800
<v Speaker 2>and it gives you the same feeling that happens when you get,</v>

6122
02:41:37.950 --> 02:41:38.160
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

6123
02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:38.640
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>

6124
02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:39.030
<v Speaker 2>I better,</v>

6125
02:41:39.030 --> 02:41:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I better wait flash.</v>

6126
02:41:40.050 --> 02:41:40.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6127
02:41:40.321 --> 02:41:41.071
<v Speaker 2>But it gives you that,</v>

6128
02:41:41.071 --> 02:41:41.551
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>

6129
02:41:41.551 --> 02:41:42.384
<v Speaker 2>we're in trouble.</v>

6130
02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:46.380
<v Speaker 2>It gives you like that same little weird endorphin rush if you get actually</v>

6131
02:41:46.381 --> 02:41:47.214
<v Speaker 2>punched in the face.</v>

6132
02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:48.390
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting.</v>

6133
02:41:49.290 --> 02:41:50.123
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting.</v>

6134
02:41:50.190 --> 02:41:55.140
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm thinking is if someone develops a program where they take a guy like</v>

6135
02:41:55.141 --> 02:42:00.141
<v Speaker 2>you and Joe Schilling does his kickboxing techniques and you literally,</v>

6136
02:42:01.350 --> 02:42:03.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's going to have to be like one or two more,</v>

6137
02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:04.793
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6138
02:42:05.210 --> 02:42:07.710
<v Speaker 2>like versions of this improvements,</v>

6139
02:42:07.950 --> 02:42:10.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to get to a point where it's virtual and to the point where it's</v>

6140
02:42:10.951 --> 02:42:12.270
<v Speaker 2>super high resolution.</v>

6141
02:42:12.420 --> 02:42:16.830
<v Speaker 2>So they could hire a guy like you to throw kicks and punches and in a,</v>

6142
02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:21.060
<v Speaker 2>in a computer simulation where all of your different kicks and punches are all</v>

6143
02:42:21.061 --> 02:42:24.570
<v Speaker 2>programmed in there along with like patterns that you might use and someone can</v>

6144
02:42:24.571 --> 02:42:28.350
<v Speaker 2>actually practice fighting you without fighting you like your opponent.</v>

6145
02:42:28.380 --> 02:42:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6146
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.800
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

6147
02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:29.951
<v Speaker 2>Kind.</v>

6148
02:42:29.951 --> 02:42:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Kinda like you would,</v>

6149
02:42:31.171 --> 02:42:34.320
<v Speaker 2>you would get used to seeing you across the cage.</v>

6150
02:42:34.470 --> 02:42:36.810
<v Speaker 2>That'd be illegal to steal someone's fucking moves.</v>

6151
02:42:37.330 --> 02:42:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you sold your fucking program to the enemy.</v>

6152
02:42:41.790 --> 02:42:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Like imagine your elder or training where you need a partner that you're doing</v>

6153
02:42:45.301 --> 02:42:45.451
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

6154
02:42:45.451 --> 02:42:45.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

6155
02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:46.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6156
02:42:46.290 --> 02:42:46.470
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6157
02:42:46.470 --> 02:42:48.760
<v Speaker 2>you're basically doing I training at that point of some,</v>

6158
02:42:48.790 --> 02:42:53.790
<v Speaker 2>a drill where you're doing actual real time had moment where that shit you could</v>

6159
02:42:54.361 --> 02:42:54.571
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

6160
02:42:54.571 --> 02:42:57.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you the couch laying in bed right now.</v>

6161
02:42:57.990 --> 02:42:59.190
<v Speaker 2>It's attached to a cord.</v>

6162
02:42:59.191 --> 02:43:01.710
<v Speaker 2>So it would be weird for like spinning things.</v>

6163
02:43:01.711 --> 02:43:05.370
<v Speaker 2>It'd be weird if you're trying to throw spinning elbows or spinning kicks or</v>

6164
02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:06.510
<v Speaker 2>move too much.</v>

6165
02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:06.901
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6166
02:43:06.901 --> 02:43:08.010
<v Speaker 2>if you had too much footwork,</v>

6167
02:43:08.011 --> 02:43:09.180
<v Speaker 2>you might get tangled up in this.</v>

6168
02:43:09.300 --> 02:43:11.410
<v Speaker 2>But how long for this motherfucker's wireless.</v>

6169
02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:12.940
<v Speaker 2>And once that thing's wireless,</v>

6170
02:43:12.941 --> 02:43:16.420
<v Speaker 2>then you just wear a helmet and you're basically in some enter the dragon room</v>

6171
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:19.390
<v Speaker 2>because you set these things up and we're Dunkin had it,</v>

6172
02:43:19.391 --> 02:43:20.440
<v Speaker 2>he had it in his office,</v>

6173
02:43:20.441 --> 02:43:22.300
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially like the same size of this room.</v>

6174
02:43:22.450 --> 02:43:25.780
<v Speaker 2>You've got a camera up there and a camera up there and it makes a grid on the</v>

6175
02:43:25.781 --> 02:43:26.201
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

6176
02:43:26.201 --> 02:43:27.900
<v Speaker 2>And that grid on the ground is the,</v>

6177
02:43:27.901 --> 02:43:28.960
<v Speaker 2>the battlefield.</v>

6178
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:30.490
<v Speaker 2>A grid is where you do cut out.</v>

6179
02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Like there's an archery game and that grid represents a tech castle and these</v>

6180
02:43:34.511 --> 02:43:37.330
<v Speaker 2>invading armies are coming and you're shooting at them with bows and arrows?</v>

6181
02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:39.593
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>

6182
02:43:39.630 --> 02:43:40.710
<v Speaker 6>it's already in his backpack.</v>

6183
02:43:40.711 --> 02:43:41.850
<v Speaker 6>So it's off of uh,</v>

6184
02:43:41.970 --> 02:43:43.080
<v Speaker 6>like big wires.</v>

6185
02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:46.950
<v Speaker 6>It's not fully wireless Xbox on it that looks wireless to me.</v>

6186
02:43:47.010 --> 02:43:47.820
<v Speaker 6>Is that a,</v>

6187
02:43:47.820 --> 02:43:48.361
<v Speaker 6>what is a,</v>

6188
02:43:48.361 --> 02:43:50.470
<v Speaker 6>which version is this James is to say it's the vibe.</v>

6189
02:43:50.471 --> 02:43:53.450

6190
02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:54.353
<v Speaker 6>on her back.</v>

6191
02:43:55.050 --> 02:43:56.430
<v Speaker 6>Is that an try them?</v>

6192
02:43:57.120 --> 02:43:59.040
<v Speaker 6>It's a company like Msi I believe,</v>

6193
02:43:59.041 --> 02:44:00.640
<v Speaker 6>which is a for sale Joe or</v>

6194
02:44:02.750 --> 02:44:05.460
<v Speaker 6>Dunkin's maybe Dunkin got like a prototype.</v>

6195
02:44:05.461 --> 02:44:05.581

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6201
02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:11.930
<v Speaker 6>You don't need that.</v>

6202
02:44:11.930 --> 02:44:14.680
<v Speaker 6>There's not a place like where you can go like a,</v>

6203
02:44:14.700 --> 02:44:16.820
<v Speaker 6>like an Internet cafe where that a bunch of different,</v>

6204
02:44:16.850 --> 02:44:18.600
<v Speaker 6>now they put you in a room,</v>

<v Speaker 6>eight bucks an hour.</v>

6206
02:44:20.540 --> 02:44:21.960
<v Speaker 6>It's going to knock yourself out.</v>

6207
02:44:21.990 --> 02:44:22.823
<v Speaker 6>It's going to happen.</v>

6208
02:44:23.070 --> 02:44:26.130
<v Speaker 6>I'm telling you this technology is going to change the fucking world.</v>

02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Go down a wound rabbit hole on youtube.</v>

6459
02:51:10.621 --> 02:51:11.280
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

6460
02:51:11.280 --> 02:51:12.360
<v Speaker 3>you know when I was a kid,</v>

6461
02:51:12.361 --> 02:51:14.610
<v Speaker 3>you had to work to get a copy of faces of death.</v>

6462
02:51:14.790 --> 02:51:16.050
<v Speaker 3>You had to actually go out.</v>

6463
02:51:16.050 --> 02:51:16.890
<v Speaker 3>You got to seek it.</v>

6464
02:51:16.891 --> 02:51:19.350
<v Speaker 3>You got to go to that weird area of the video store.</v>

6465
02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:20.250
<v Speaker 3>You had a rented,</v>

6466
02:51:20.250 --> 02:51:21.990
<v Speaker 3>you gotta hope somebody else hadn't rented it before.</v>

6467
02:51:21.991 --> 02:51:26.850
<v Speaker 3>You any little fucking kid whose parents aren't paying attention can go on</v>

6468
02:51:26.851 --> 02:51:30.960
<v Speaker 3>youtube now and watch dudes bounce off of cliffs and buildings get run over by</v>

6469
02:51:30.961 --> 02:51:31.501
<v Speaker 3>trucks.</v>

6470
02:51:31.501 --> 02:51:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Isis car headwinds.</v>

6471
02:51:33.690 --> 02:51:34.980
<v Speaker 3>If you too doesn't catch it.</v>

6472
02:51:35.010 --> 02:51:35.530
<v Speaker 3>Those things,</v>

6473
02:51:35.530 --> 02:51:38.550
<v Speaker 3>they stay on for a while and keep fucking high school kids are probably the</v>

6474
02:51:38.551 --> 02:51:39.600
<v Speaker 3>first to find those things.</v>

6475
02:51:39.601 --> 02:51:40.560
<v Speaker 3>You got a smart little fucker.</v>

6476
02:51:40.561 --> 02:51:43.680
<v Speaker 3>He's on that under web looking at all sorts of shit.</v>

6477
02:51:43.710 --> 02:51:44.251
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

6478
02:51:44.251 --> 02:51:44.491
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

6479
02:51:44.491 --> 02:51:48.750
<v Speaker 3>What the input inputs that someone's mind under and the dark web.</v>

6480
02:51:48.810 --> 02:51:51.800
<v Speaker 3>That seems like such a trap.</v>

6481
02:51:51.970 --> 02:51:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

6482
02:51:52.200 --> 02:51:53.033
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6483
02:51:53.160 --> 02:51:54.270
<v Speaker 3>it's an under web.</v>

6484
02:51:54.390 --> 02:51:56.860
<v Speaker 3>You could do all the black lips are really sad.</v>

6485
02:51:57.390 --> 02:51:57.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6486
02:51:57.661 --> 02:51:59.370
<v Speaker 3>but it just seems like it's a trap.</v>

6487
02:51:59.550 --> 02:52:00.060
<v Speaker 3>The trap.</v>

6488
02:52:00.060 --> 02:52:02.280
<v Speaker 3>Well then you can't do all sorts of crazy shit.</v>

6489
02:52:02.281 --> 02:52:03.240
<v Speaker 3>They've arrested people.</v>

6490
02:52:03.540 --> 02:52:06.310
<v Speaker 3>The guy who created a that a website.</v>

6491
02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:07.553
<v Speaker 2>What was the website?</v>

6492
02:52:08.050 --> 02:52:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Silkroad yeah,</v>

6493
02:52:09.310 --> 02:52:10.060
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>

6494
02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:11.500
<v Speaker 2>he's actually in jail for life.</v>

6495
02:52:11.620 --> 02:52:13.180
<v Speaker 2>For facilities out.</v>

6496
02:52:13.240 --> 02:52:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Not as I say,</v>

6497
02:52:13.660 --> 02:52:14.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not out there.</v>

6498
02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:15.610
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty interesting doc.</v>

6499
02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:17.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's a documentary is the way you want to word it,</v>

6500
02:52:17.651 --> 02:52:19.330
<v Speaker 2>but on Viceland show,</v>

6501
02:52:19.360 --> 02:52:20.290
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>

6502
02:52:20.850 --> 02:52:21.730
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the name of it,</v>

6503
02:52:21.731 --> 02:52:23.830
<v Speaker 2>but they take a guy onto the dark web.</v>

6504
02:52:23.860 --> 02:52:24.100
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

6505
02:52:24.100 --> 02:52:24.641
<v Speaker 2>they show you like,</v>

6506
02:52:24.641 --> 02:52:25.720
<v Speaker 2>this is going on a website,</v>

6507
02:52:25.721 --> 02:52:26.680
<v Speaker 2>here's the Ebay,</v>

6508
02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:28.570
<v Speaker 2>here's how you can buy stuff with bitcoin.</v>

6509
02:52:28.630 --> 02:52:28.961
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>

6510
02:52:28.961 --> 02:52:29.794
<v Speaker 2>there's heroin.</v>

6511
02:52:29.890 --> 02:52:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Where do you get,</v>

6512
02:52:30.570 --> 02:52:31.403
<v Speaker 2>like how do you trade my,</v>

6513
02:52:31.470 --> 02:52:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's not been tightened up because of the trial.</v>

6514
02:52:35.230 --> 02:52:38.380
<v Speaker 2>The trial was really crazy because it turns out that the DEA agents,</v>

6515
02:52:38.410 --> 02:52:39.880
<v Speaker 2>the people who are investigating them,</v>

6516
02:52:39.881 --> 02:52:41.830
<v Speaker 2>wind up stealing the bitcoin money.</v>

6517
02:52:42.040 --> 02:52:45.970
<v Speaker 2>So the investigating guys wound up stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars.</v>

6518
02:52:46.180 --> 02:52:49.360
<v Speaker 2>And then the guy who created the whole thing still wound up going to jail.</v>

6519
02:52:49.450 --> 02:52:53.830
<v Speaker 2>So there was obviously some fuckery and shenanigans and real corruption going</v>

6520
02:52:53.831 --> 02:52:54.460
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

6521
02:52:54.460 --> 02:52:55.110
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

6522
02:52:55.110 --> 02:52:56.530
<v Speaker 2>this dude's in jail for life.</v>

6523
02:52:56.680 --> 02:52:58.090
<v Speaker 2>He's in jail for life and they,</v>

6524
02:52:58.120 --> 02:52:58.953
<v Speaker 2>but they said that,</v>

6525
02:52:59.500 --> 02:52:59.680
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

6526
02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:00.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know what he did,</v>

6527
02:53:00.791 --> 02:53:03.220
<v Speaker 2>but I think they said that he was trying to,</v>

6528
02:53:03.330 --> 02:53:03.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6529
02:53:03.730 --> 02:53:07.900
<v Speaker 2>get someone murdered or that was like one of the possibilities,</v>

6530
02:53:07.901 --> 02:53:08.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6531
02:53:08.470 --> 02:53:09.890
<v Speaker 2>That someone had a,</v>

6532
02:53:09.910 --> 02:53:13.990
<v Speaker 2>suggested they murder somebody and he was trying to set something up.</v>

6533
02:53:14.070 --> 02:53:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Well that makes sense.</v>

6534
02:53:15.030 --> 02:53:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Can Be ordered.</v>

6535
02:53:15.750 --> 02:53:17.680
<v Speaker 2>Killings of people were watching that movie that,</v>

6536
02:53:17.681 --> 02:53:17.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6537
02:53:17.980 --> 02:53:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Alex wintered made that he was in bed.</v>

6538
02:53:20.500 --> 02:53:21.490
<v Speaker 2>You can learn a lot about it.</v>

6539
02:53:21.610 --> 02:53:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6540
02:53:21.830 --> 02:53:22.930
<v Speaker 2>he didn't believe it.</v>

6541
02:53:22.960 --> 02:53:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Alex didn't believe it.</v>

6542
02:53:24.100 --> 02:53:25.480
<v Speaker 2>There's an interesting documentary.</v>

6543
02:53:25.481 --> 02:53:27.460
<v Speaker 2>I've watched the documentary before Alex came in.</v>

6544
02:53:28.010 --> 02:53:28.870
<v Speaker 2>He didn't believe it.</v>

6545
02:53:28.871 --> 02:53:30.550
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is he doesn't know.</v>

6546
02:53:30.850 --> 02:53:31.061
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6547
02:53:31.061 --> 02:53:31.420
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

6548
02:53:31.420 --> 02:53:34.330
<v Speaker 2>you don't really know what a guy did or didn't do unless you were there.</v>

6549
02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:35.193
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

6550
02:53:35.260 --> 02:53:35.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

6551
02:53:35.670 --> 02:53:35.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6552
02:53:35.950 --> 02:53:37.420
<v Speaker 2>we know the cops were liars though.</v>

6553
02:53:37.450 --> 02:53:38.380
<v Speaker 2>They were stealing money.</v>

6554
02:53:38.620 --> 02:53:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Like they're very cops that were in charge of the case were stealing money from</v>

6555
02:53:43.481 --> 02:53:43.840
<v Speaker 2>the soup.</v>

6556
02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:44.551
<v Speaker 2>He counts.</v>

6557
02:53:44.551 --> 02:53:45.970
<v Speaker 2>So the whole thing is so crazy.</v>

6558
02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Jamie is anonymous.</v>

6559
02:53:49.120 --> 02:53:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Like how do they still work?</v>

6560
02:53:50.300 --> 02:53:51.430
<v Speaker 2>How does that work?</v>

6561
02:53:51.610 --> 02:53:53.530
<v Speaker 2>What does do you know is anybody can be in,</v>

6562
02:53:53.770 --> 02:53:54.191
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

6563
02:53:54.191 --> 02:53:54.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6564
02:53:54.431 --> 02:53:56.200
<v Speaker 2>there's no like fucking meetings.</v>

6565
02:53:56.230 --> 02:53:57.700

02:55:27.561 --> 02:55:28.281
<v Speaker 2>that podcast.</v>

6634
02:55:28.281 --> 02:55:29.480
<v Speaker 2>He told me his work ethic,</v>

6635
02:55:29.481 --> 02:55:32.120
<v Speaker 2>we work with the same guys for our live shows and they were telling us about</v>

6636
02:55:32.300 --> 02:55:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Henry Rollins and his work ethic on the live shows.</v>

6637
02:55:34.761 --> 02:55:35.481
<v Speaker 2>It's insane,</v>

6638
02:55:35.481 --> 02:55:35.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6639
02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:36.673
<v Speaker 2>I can only imagine.</v>

6640
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:38.870
<v Speaker 2>He goes to these weird places,</v>

6641
02:55:38.871 --> 02:55:40.100
<v Speaker 2>he picks a spot in the world,</v>

6642
02:55:40.220 --> 02:55:45.010
<v Speaker 2>travels there and spends like a month there and just brings a typewriter or or</v>

6643
02:55:45.020 --> 02:55:50.020
<v Speaker 2>rather a a a camera and maybe a laptop and do you know his clothes and shit and</v>

6644
02:55:50.031 --> 02:55:53.840
<v Speaker 2>just lives with these people and just just goes to like Kuala Lampur.</v>

6645
02:55:53.870 --> 02:55:54.111
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6646
02:55:54.111 --> 02:55:54.944
<v Speaker 2>let's try that place.</v>

6647
02:55:55.140 --> 02:55:56.330
<v Speaker 2>Don't it goes by himself,</v>

6648
02:55:56.510 --> 02:55:57.470
<v Speaker 2>goes and hangs out,</v>

6649
02:55:57.980 --> 02:56:01.460
<v Speaker 2>takes a photos during the day and at nighttime write stories about it.</v>

6650
02:56:02.010 --> 02:56:04.190
<v Speaker 2>You know when he writes stories for a bunch of different publications,</v>

6651
02:56:04.191 --> 02:56:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give away any more of it because it's just awesome podcasts and</v>

6652
02:56:07.011 --> 02:56:07.700
<v Speaker 2>string dude.</v>

6653
02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6654
02:56:08.090 --> 02:56:09.230
<v Speaker 2>Are ran into him.</v>

6655
02:56:09.470 --> 02:56:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I think Ra was in Stockholm and he was doing standup and Henry Rollins was,</v>

6656
02:56:13.811 --> 02:56:15.290
<v Speaker 2>they were doing something else and they met up.</v>

6657
02:56:15.980 --> 02:56:17.770
<v Speaker 2>So interesting guy.</v>

6658
02:56:18.050 --> 02:56:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6659
02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Well even,</v>

6660
02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

6661
02:56:20.460 --> 02:56:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I always thought he was very smart and interesting and very passionate about a</v>

6662
02:56:23.781 --> 02:56:24.231
<v Speaker 2>lot of things,</v>

6663
02:56:24.231 --> 02:56:28.370
<v Speaker 2>but hearing them on Ari's podcast gave me a whole different appreciation for</v>

6664
02:56:28.371 --> 02:56:28.461
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

6665
02:56:28.461 --> 02:56:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you guys would connect.</v>

6666
02:56:30.200 --> 02:56:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's certain things.</v>

6667
02:56:31.910 --> 02:56:32.743
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be fun.</v>

6668
02:56:32.780 --> 02:56:35.360
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it hate me or maybe you hate him.</v>

6669
02:56:35.820 --> 02:56:36.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

6670
02:56:36.500 --> 02:56:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Now you guys be friends.</v>

6671
02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:37.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6672
02:56:37.731 --> 02:56:41.000
<v Speaker 2>I think listening to him on the [inaudible] podcast,</v>

6673
02:56:41.001 --> 02:56:42.860
<v Speaker 2>I would find him completely fascinating.</v>

6674
02:56:42.861 --> 02:56:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I just really respect that.</v>

6675
02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Completely off the beaten path choice of just decided he goes to these places</v>

6676
02:56:51.261 --> 02:56:52.640
<v Speaker 2>and they'll just go and,</v>

6677
02:56:52.641 --> 02:56:52.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6678
02:56:52.971 --> 02:56:54.610
<v Speaker 2>hang out in Afghanistan or go,</v>

6679
02:56:54.611 --> 02:56:55.700
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of always been a guy.</v>

6680
02:56:55.701 --> 02:56:56.600
<v Speaker 2>He's done it his way,</v>

6681
02:56:56.601 --> 02:56:57.710
<v Speaker 2>which you can appreciate it.</v>

6682
02:56:58.400 --> 02:56:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6683
02:56:58.910 --> 02:57:03.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean we started off as a musician and then now what he does is he writes,</v>

6684
02:57:03.291 --> 02:57:07.100
<v Speaker 2>and he does like the spoken word things apparently is doing a run at Largo in</v>

6685
02:57:07.101 --> 02:57:07.760
<v Speaker 2>December.</v>

6686
02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:11.750
<v Speaker 2>So I might go down there and check that live shows bad ass and it sells out like</v>

6687
02:57:11.751 --> 02:57:12.584
<v Speaker 2>a motherfucker.</v>

6688
02:57:12.650 --> 02:57:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6689
02:57:13.190 --> 02:57:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's uh,</v>

6690
02:57:15.040 --> 02:57:15.771
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting,</v>

6691
02:57:15.771 --> 02:57:18.050
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of like kind of doing standup but not,</v>

6692
02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:18.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6693
02:57:18.261 --> 02:57:21.200
<v Speaker 2>he's really just telling stories about things so he's not confined,</v>

6694
02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:22.753
<v Speaker 2>which is um,</v>

6695
02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:23.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6696
02:57:23.211 --> 02:57:23.630
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>

6697
02:57:23.630 --> 02:57:28.490
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people find like a podcast very freeing because it's one of the few</v>

6698
02:57:28.491 --> 02:57:30.380
<v Speaker 2>times that comics are,</v>

6699
02:57:30.381 --> 02:57:34.580
<v Speaker 2>aren't confined to this constant need to be funny like all the time,</v>

6700
02:57:34.610 --> 02:57:35.690
<v Speaker 2>like over and over and over again.</v>

6701
02:57:35.900 --> 02:57:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes it shows they're just funny back and forth,</v>

6702
02:57:38.061 --> 02:57:38.894
<v Speaker 2>funny back and forth.</v>

6703
02:57:38.900 --> 02:57:42.110
<v Speaker 2>But some you don't have to like sometimes there's a moment in a podcast where</v>

6704
02:57:42.111 --> 02:57:42.944
<v Speaker 2>you just have to,</v>

6705
02:57:42.950 --> 02:57:44.360
<v Speaker 2>you want to kind of explore something.</v>

6706
02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:46.010
<v Speaker 2>You can't really do that on stage though.</v>

6707
02:57:46.190 --> 02:57:46.611
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6708
02:57:46.611 --> 02:57:49.310
<v Speaker 2>like a comic can't really do that on stage unless they do some sort of a weird</v>

6709
02:57:49.311 --> 02:57:50.960
<v Speaker 2>artsy one person show,</v>

6710
02:57:51.320 --> 02:57:51.711
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

6711
02:57:51.711 --> 02:57:53.270
<v Speaker 2>But a guy like Rawlins,</v>

6712
02:57:53.271 --> 02:57:57.350
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have like any defined pattern that has shows have to follow.</v>

6713
02:57:57.500 --> 02:57:57.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6714
02:57:57.621 --> 02:57:58.610
<v Speaker 2>He's not in a box.</v>

6715
02:57:58.720 --> 02:58:01.100
<v Speaker 2>He's not a comedian like he can get up there and do you,</v>

6716
02:58:01.140 --> 02:58:02.310
<v Speaker 2>I know he has his guitar.</v>

6717
02:58:02.310 --> 02:58:04.380
<v Speaker 1>He tells these epic stories from his life.</v>

6718
02:58:04.410 --> 02:58:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6719
02:58:04.770 --> 02:58:05.210
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

6720
02:58:05.210 --> 02:58:06.043
<v Speaker 1>I'll do whatever you want.</v>

6721
02:58:06.060 --> 02:58:07.890
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to that show gone make me laugh.</v>

6722
02:58:07.891 --> 02:58:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Clown.</v>

6723
02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:09.870
<v Speaker 1>He did laugh in the first 10 or 15 minutes.</v>

6724
02:58:09.871 --> 02:58:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

6725
02:58:10.350 --> 02:58:10.710
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

6726
02:58:10.710 --> 02:58:13.220
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting what you guys do with fighter in the kid too.</v>

6727
02:58:13.221 --> 02:58:15.030
<v Speaker 1>It's cause like you're doing a podcast,</v>

6728
02:58:15.031 --> 02:58:19.020
<v Speaker 1>but you do a podcast live and you're doing this podcast live and it's kind of a</v>

6729
02:58:19.021 --> 02:58:19.591
<v Speaker 1>comedy show,</v>

6730
02:58:19.591 --> 02:58:21.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of whatever the fuck you want it to be show,</v>

6731
02:58:21.790 --> 02:58:22.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6732
02:58:22.141 --> 02:58:26.520
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of make your own sort of format of entertainment.</v>

6733
02:58:26.521 --> 02:58:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

6734
02:58:26.840 --> 02:58:31.410
<v Speaker 1>the live podcast format is a new form of entertainment in a way.</v>

6735
02:58:31.411 --> 02:58:32.940
<v Speaker 1>And I've only done a couple of them.</v>

6736
02:58:33.210 --> 02:58:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I did one of my own and bunch of other people's ones.</v>

6737
02:58:36.450 --> 02:58:37.380
<v Speaker 1>And the thing,</v>

6738
02:58:37.381 --> 02:58:39.930
<v Speaker 1>the interesting thing about it is it's not the same thing.</v>

6739
02:58:39.930 --> 02:58:41.040
<v Speaker 1>When an audience is there,</v>

6740
02:58:41.220 --> 02:58:42.240
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing it live,</v>

6741
02:58:42.241 --> 02:58:44.240
<v Speaker 1>it becomes way more of like they,</v>

6742
02:58:44.310 --> 02:58:47.610
<v Speaker 1>they're attention span is taken into consideration much more.</v>

6743
02:58:47.700 --> 02:58:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6744
02:58:48.270 --> 02:58:48.930
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

6745
02:58:48.930 --> 02:58:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Brian had the great idea because to to perform like it's a performance,</v>

6746
02:58:53.430 --> 02:58:54.750
<v Speaker 1>you know they're scripted parts.</v>

6747
02:58:55.020 --> 02:58:58.290
<v Speaker 1>It's broken up the segments because when he decided to do it,</v>

6748
02:58:58.291 --> 02:59:01.050
<v Speaker 1>I did my research and I went to some of the life podcast.</v>

6749
02:59:01.051 --> 02:59:01.261
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

6750
02:59:01.261 --> 02:59:01.830
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

6751
02:59:01.830 --> 02:59:04.020
<v Speaker 1>these people are loyal fans devoted,</v>

6752
02:59:04.200 --> 02:59:05.700
<v Speaker 1>but this is boring man.</v>

6753
02:59:05.730 --> 02:59:07.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just two guys on a mic talking.</v>

6754
02:59:07.051 --> 02:59:10.770
<v Speaker 1>There's not much to see and especially if you're in a comedy plays like if</v>

6755
02:59:10.771 --> 02:59:14.640
<v Speaker 1>you're doing the store or hit the Bray Improv with are used to seeing big acts</v>

6756
02:59:14.641 --> 02:59:16.230
<v Speaker 1>and people who entertain.</v>

6757
02:59:16.380 --> 02:59:17.850
<v Speaker 1>You got to kind of do your thing,</v>

6758
02:59:17.851 --> 02:59:18.240
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6759
02:59:18.240 --> 02:59:18.661
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to,</v>

6760
02:59:18.661 --> 02:59:19.890
<v Speaker 1>he'll just talk like buddies.</v>

6761
02:59:20.030 --> 02:59:20.820
<v Speaker 1>You got to have a plan.</v>

6762
02:59:20.820 --> 02:59:21.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6763
02:59:21.001 --> 02:59:22.770
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing a big venue for sure.</v>

6764
02:59:22.771 --> 02:59:27.771
<v Speaker 1>If you do it like Kevin Smith used to have this little theater in Hollywood and</v>

6765
02:59:28.291 --> 02:59:30.150
<v Speaker 1>I did a podcast there with him.</v>

6766
02:59:30.210 --> 02:59:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I did one with Norton there.</v>

6767
02:59:31.591 --> 02:59:33.900
<v Speaker 1>I did my podcast there with Norton a long time ago.</v>

6768
02:59:34.470 --> 02:59:35.190
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

6769
02:59:35.190 --> 02:59:36.990
<v Speaker 1>his theater only seats,</v>

6770
02:59:36.991 --> 02:59:37.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

6771
02:59:37.140 --> 02:59:38.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he has it anymore,</v>

6772
02:59:38.850 --> 02:59:41.430
<v Speaker 1>but it only seats like 40 people.</v>

6773
02:59:41.580 --> 02:59:43.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like this tiny little place.</v>

6774
02:59:43.261 --> 02:59:44.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like essentially like a,</v>

6775
02:59:44.431 --> 02:59:48.090
<v Speaker 1>an acting studio where people would take acting classes and then,</v>

6776
02:59:48.091 --> 02:59:48.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6777
02:59:48.331 --> 02:59:51.040
<v Speaker 1>they'd come down to the stage and perform and like it's,</v>

6778
02:59:51.120 --> 02:59:51.690
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6779
02:59:51.690 --> 02:59:52.050
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6780
02:59:52.050 --> 02:59:53.010
<v Speaker 1>it was so intimate.</v>

6781
02:59:53.011 --> 02:59:53.770
<v Speaker 1>It was bizarre.</v>

6782
02:59:53.770 --> 02:59:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Was this format,</v>

6783
02:59:54.661 --> 02:59:55.650
<v Speaker 1>was it like a podcast?</v>

6784
02:59:55.651 --> 02:59:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Cause then I don't think you have to put on a show as much.</v>

6785
02:59:57.900 --> 02:59:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6786
02:59:58.710 --> 02:59:59.281
<v Speaker 1>Podcast.</v>

6787
02:59:59.281 --> 02:59:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6788
02:59:59.580 --> 03:00:02.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's a podcast in front of a really small,</v>

6789
03:00:02.281 --> 03:00:02.941
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>

6790
03:00:02.941 --> 03:00:04.110
<v Speaker 1>super intimate crowd.</v>

6791
03:00:04.110 --> 03:00:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Like almost too intimate.</v>

6792
03:00:05.221 --> 03:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Like Wally George,</v>

<v Speaker 6>maybe I'll come back and do it.</v>

6851
03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:14.433
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I will,</v>

6852
03:01:14.470 --> 03:01:17.460
<v Speaker 6>but I guess we did like 60 or 70 episodes.</v>

6853
03:01:17.461 --> 03:01:17.831
<v Speaker 6>I'm like that.</v>

6854
03:01:17.831 --> 03:01:18.640
<v Speaker 6>I don't even remember.</v>

6855
03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:22.510
<v Speaker 6>I never go back and listen to him and I sat in enough shit.</v>

6856
03:01:22.630 --> 03:01:22.931
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

6857
03:01:22.931 --> 03:01:24.190
<v Speaker 6>do I want to be a fucking host?</v>

6858
03:01:24.191 --> 03:01:25.420
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to be a host to shit.</v>

6859
03:01:25.480 --> 03:01:26.020
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

6860
03:01:26.020 --> 03:01:26.853
<v Speaker 6>maybe I'll change it.</v>

6861
03:01:26.920 --> 03:01:27.753
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I will,</v>

6862
03:01:27.940 --> 03:01:32.500
<v Speaker 6>but I don't want to be that guy who says same shit over and over again.</v>

6863
03:01:32.501 --> 03:01:32.980
<v Speaker 6>Because when you're,</v>

6864
03:01:32.980 --> 03:01:34.060
<v Speaker 6>when you're running a show,</v>

6865
03:01:34.500 --> 03:01:35.500
<v Speaker 6>it's you do,</v>

6866
03:01:35.530 --> 03:01:36.221
<v Speaker 6>you have to,</v>

6867
03:01:36.221 --> 03:01:39.430
<v Speaker 6>you have to repeat that story because some people haven't heard it and then the</v>

6868
03:01:39.431 --> 03:01:41.810
<v Speaker 6>people who have heard at your hardcore fans will just stare.</v>

6869
03:01:41.810 --> 03:01:43.030
<v Speaker 6>It goes with that fucking show.</v>

6870
03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:44.230
<v Speaker 6>That's on your story too.</v>

6871
03:01:44.280 --> 03:01:46.500
<v Speaker 6>Cause did you have a partner or was it just you ride?</v>

6872
03:01:46.540 --> 03:01:46.781
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>

6873
03:01:46.781 --> 03:01:48.190
<v Speaker 6>I'd have a roomful of people.</v>

6874
03:01:48.191 --> 03:01:51.550
<v Speaker 6>I just invited five people at a time just to have just conversation just like</v>

6875
03:01:51.551 --> 03:01:51.910
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

6876
03:01:51.910 --> 03:01:53.530
<v Speaker 6>I wanted it four or five people to talk,</v>

6877
03:01:53.740 --> 03:01:55.780
<v Speaker 6>but after awhile I do,</v>

6878
03:01:55.810 --> 03:01:58.390
<v Speaker 6>I get sick of hearing myself tell the same goddamn story.</v>

6879
03:01:58.510 --> 03:01:59.440
<v Speaker 6>I think I've said enough.</v>

6880
03:01:59.980 --> 03:02:00.910
<v Speaker 6>I think I said enough.</v>

6881
03:02:01.180 --> 03:02:01.660
<v Speaker 6>I mean I do.</v>

6882
03:02:01.660 --> 03:02:03.100
<v Speaker 6>I want to be a host of some shit.</v>

6883
03:02:03.240 --> 03:02:03.621
<v Speaker 6>Well listen,</v>

6884
03:02:03.621 --> 03:02:06.100
<v Speaker 6>when you really don't feel like I want to be a host,</v>

6885
03:02:06.310 --> 03:02:07.690
<v Speaker 6>they manage to do a podcast.</v>

6886
03:02:07.691 --> 03:02:07.840
<v Speaker 6>Guys,</v>

6887

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

03:02:08.081 --> 03:02:09.160
<v Speaker 6>you could always do this one.</v>

6889
03:02:09.790 --> 03:02:10.300
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

6892
03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:14.200
<v Speaker 6>I'm not talking about being like being,</v>

6895
03:02:19.420 --> 03:02:22.330
<v Speaker 6>Like if you just want to do it occasionally and just get the itch out,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

7005
03:04:41.630 --> 03:04:45.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm really focusing on trying to just shut the world off.</v>

7006
03:04:45.530 --> 03:04:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Was Your podcast making money?</v>

<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

7010
03:04:48.050 --> 03:04:50.390
<v Speaker 3>I never tried to even look for fucking sponsors,</v>

7011
03:04:50.391 --> 03:04:50.631
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

7012
03:04:50.631 --> 03:04:51.464
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

7013
03:04:51.500 --> 03:04:52.610
<v Speaker 3>I was just doing it on my,</v>

7014
03:04:52.611 --> 03:04:52.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

7015
03:04:52.940 --> 03:04:55.490
<v Speaker 3>my own free time and just for the fun of it.</v>

7016
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:57.140
<v Speaker 3>And I think I've said enough man,</v>

7017
03:04:57.260 --> 03:04:57.800
<v Speaker 3>they're the,</v>

7018
03:04:57.800 --> 03:04:59.660
<v Speaker 3>all the episodes are still up on youtube.</v>

7019
03:05:00.230 --> 03:05:00.861
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to fuck,</v>

7020
03:05:00.861 --> 03:05:01.760
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you something man.</v>

7021
03:05:01.790 --> 03:05:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Even having sponsors,</v>

7022
03:05:03.230 --> 03:05:05.060
<v Speaker 3>even having sponsors is a fucking,</v>

7023
03:05:05.090 --> 03:05:08.570
<v Speaker 3>is a responsibility you have to consider is what have you ever sponsored that's</v>

7024
03:05:08.571 --> 03:05:09.404
<v Speaker 3>not good.</v>

7025
03:05:09.610 --> 03:05:12.650
<v Speaker 3>And I go to a response or that rips people off or something that where it goes</v>

7026
03:05:12.651 --> 03:05:12.891
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

7027
03:05:12.891 --> 03:05:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a sponsor that came to me,</v>

7028
03:05:14.631 --> 03:05:18.800
<v Speaker 3>which is like an Uber for Nannies for like people taking care of your kids.</v>

7029
03:05:18.801 --> 03:05:21.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can call us a right idea.</v>

7030
03:05:21.290 --> 03:05:22.430
<v Speaker 3>It's a terrible idea.</v>

7031
03:05:22.431 --> 03:05:23.360
<v Speaker 3>You don't even know this part.</v>

7032
03:05:23.361 --> 03:05:24.194
<v Speaker 3>What did they behave like?</v>

7033
03:05:24.200 --> 03:05:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Uber drivers.</v>

7034
03:05:27.050 --> 03:05:27.883
<v Speaker 3>You don't even know</v>

7035
03:05:29.380 --> 03:05:31.190
<v Speaker 3>how I heard it for a second.</v>

7036
03:05:31.191 --> 03:05:33.380
<v Speaker 3>I go no fucking way.</v>

7037
03:05:33.560 --> 03:05:38.170
<v Speaker 3>I was like no blocking guaranteed that run through like a rigger on,</v>

7038
03:05:38.190 --> 03:05:39.240
<v Speaker 3>on chat.</v>

7039
03:05:39.320 --> 03:05:40.550
<v Speaker 3>You've got gotta be careful that stuff.</v>

7040
03:05:40.551 --> 03:05:43.760
<v Speaker 3>And I've had this conversation with Joe before to certain sponsors.</v>

7041
03:05:43.761 --> 03:05:44.480
<v Speaker 3>We've,</v>

7042
03:05:44.480 --> 03:05:44.900
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

7043
03:05:44.900 --> 03:05:45.733
<v Speaker 3>we've turned down,</v>

7044
03:05:45.740 --> 03:05:50.150
<v Speaker 3>I won't say the name of the company to Mag a sponsor because cal and I a don't</v>

7045
03:05:50.151 --> 03:05:50.811
<v Speaker 3>believe in the product.</v>

7046
03:05:50.811 --> 03:05:52.440
<v Speaker 3>B are our audience.</v>

7047
03:05:52.450 --> 03:05:52.731
<v Speaker 3>Be like,</v>

7048
03:05:52.731 --> 03:05:54.050
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck Outta here.</v>

7049
03:05:54.080 --> 03:05:54.891
<v Speaker 3>This isn't really,</v>

7050
03:05:54.891 --> 03:05:56.270
<v Speaker 3>it was just doing it for a paycheck.</v>

7051
03:05:56.510 --> 03:05:57.320
<v Speaker 3>So we turned them down.</v>

7052
03:05:57.320 --> 03:06:02.320
<v Speaker 3>We had one that was a soup company and super suit suit and you'd have to go get</v>

7053
03:06:02.721 --> 03:06:06.290
<v Speaker 3>tailored and they send the suit in the mail like these worldclass suits.</v>

7054
03:06:06.440 --> 03:06:07.273
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with that?</v>

7055
03:06:07.310 --> 03:06:07.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

7056
03:06:07.760 --> 03:06:12.080
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with that is both are mine and counts came in the mail and they</v>

7057
03:06:12.081 --> 03:06:13.310
<v Speaker 3>were just so shitty.</v>

7058
03:06:13.780 --> 03:06:18.500
<v Speaker 3>Can't do this because dude's going to order suits and then they come all shitty.</v>

7059
03:06:18.501 --> 03:06:18.981
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm like,</v>

7060
03:06:18.981 --> 03:06:19.221
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

7061
03:06:19.221 --> 03:06:19.580
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

7062
03:06:19.580 --> 03:06:20.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7063
03:06:20.190 --> 03:06:21.023
<v Speaker 3>can't have it.</v>

7064
03:06:21.540 --> 03:06:22.490
<v Speaker 3>You know how it goes.</v>

7065
03:06:22.640 --> 03:06:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Well that's smart that you guys did that.</v>

7066
03:06:24.020 --> 03:06:27.410
<v Speaker 3>That's smart because the last thing you want to do is disappoint your fans in a</v>

7067
03:06:27.411 --> 03:06:29.210
<v Speaker 3>way like that where you can avoid it.</v>

7068
03:06:29.270 --> 03:06:29.541
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

7069
03:06:29.541 --> 03:06:30.860
<v Speaker 3>it's one thing if you get tricked,</v>

7070
03:06:31.400 --> 03:06:32.091
<v Speaker 3>but if you,</v>

7071
03:06:32.091 --> 03:06:32.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

7072
03:06:32.420 --> 03:06:33.680
<v Speaker 3>if you could avoid it,</v>

7073
03:06:34.160 --> 03:06:38.810
<v Speaker 3>it's his hard because right now there it's really opening up the market as far</v>

7074
03:06:38.811 --> 03:06:39.021
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

7075
03:06:39.021 --> 03:06:39.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

7076
03:06:39.500 --> 03:06:41.510
<v Speaker 3>people that are advertising on podcasts,</v>

7077
03:06:41.660 --> 03:06:42.500
<v Speaker 3>but they're still,</v>

7078
03:06:42.530 --> 03:06:44.150
<v Speaker 3>they're not like mainstream names.</v>

7079
03:06:44.151 --> 03:06:48.020
<v Speaker 3>You don't hear like Chevrolet advertising on podcasts or you know,</v>

7080
03:06:48.021 --> 03:06:48.854
<v Speaker 3>Samsung,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I had your Samsung did.</v>

7082
03:06:50.480 --> 03:06:50.691
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

7083
03:06:50.691 --> 03:06:52.130
<v Speaker 3>they should if to Latin mass,</v>

7084
03:06:52.160 --> 03:06:52.993
<v Speaker 3>not shit on him.</v>

7085
03:06:53.700 --> 03:06:53.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

7086
03:06:53.990 --> 03:06:54.801
<v Speaker 3>if they're smart,</v>

7087
03:06:54.801 --> 03:06:55.140
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

7088
03:06:55.140 --> 03:06:56.070
<v Speaker 3>because there's no better</v>

7089
03:06:56.070 --> 03:06:58.230
<v Speaker 1>platform for loyal listeners.</v>

7090
03:06:58.500 --> 03:07:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Then a fucking podcast who's going to listen to and talk for whatever,</v>

7091
03:07:01.860 --> 03:07:02.700
<v Speaker 1>six hours a week,</v>

7092
03:07:02.701 --> 03:07:03.331
<v Speaker 1>nine hours a week.</v>

7093
03:07:03.331 --> 03:07:06.300
<v Speaker 1>They're dedicated and until there's nothing like it,</v>

7094
03:07:06.580 --> 03:07:07.620
<v Speaker 1>TV ain't shit.</v>

7095
03:07:08.010 --> 03:07:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7096
03:07:08.160 --> 03:07:09.590
<v Speaker 1>32nd commercial ain't shit.</v>

7097
03:07:09.591 --> 03:07:10.590
<v Speaker 1>If people want to fast forward,</v>

7098
03:07:10.650 --> 03:07:11.371
<v Speaker 1>no one's watching.</v>

7099
03:07:11.371 --> 03:07:13.350
<v Speaker 1>T I have 500 fucking channels.</v>

7100
03:07:13.351 --> 03:07:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I Never Watch TV.</v>

7101
03:07:15.060 --> 03:07:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I watch TV,</v>

7102
03:07:15.840 --> 03:07:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I watch TV,</v>

7103
03:07:16.530 --> 03:07:16.990
<v Speaker 1>sports,</v>

7104
03:07:16.990 --> 03:07:17.823
<v Speaker 1>I watch now.</v>

7105
03:07:17.860 --> 03:07:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I watch Netflix.</v>

7106
03:07:18.990 --> 03:07:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I generally don't,</v>

7107
03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm always on my apple TV.</v>

7108
03:07:22.380 --> 03:07:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm always on Netflix,</v>

7109
03:07:23.620 --> 03:07:24.690
<v Speaker 1>always on the apple,</v>

7110
03:07:24.810 --> 03:07:25.710
<v Speaker 1>always on that flicks.</v>

7111
03:07:25.830 --> 03:07:29.310
<v Speaker 1>The only time I watch regular TV is when the ultimate fighter comes on or so I'm</v>

7112
03:07:29.311 --> 03:07:32.270
<v Speaker 1>just saying the advertisement as far as podcasts,</v>

7113
03:07:32.550 --> 03:07:34.520
<v Speaker 1>if they were smart man with uh,</v>

7114
03:07:34.580 --> 03:07:38.340
<v Speaker 1>with your audience or someone like Dan Carlin or NPR,</v>

7115
03:07:38.341 --> 03:07:39.820
<v Speaker 1>like dots where it's at these days,</v>

7116
03:07:40.170 --> 03:07:43.140
<v Speaker 1>more and more they will more and more they grow.</v>

7117
03:07:43.141 --> 03:07:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Dan Carlin told Tommy's in a weird position because he gets a fuck load of</v>

7118
03:07:46.441 --> 03:07:46.891
<v Speaker 1>downloads,</v>

7119
03:07:46.891 --> 03:07:51.210
<v Speaker 1>but he does his podcast so infrequently that the best model for him as far as</v>

7120
03:07:51.211 --> 03:07:54.480
<v Speaker 1>cash is actually to do it through subscriptions.</v>

7121
03:07:54.660 --> 03:07:56.010
<v Speaker 1>So when you order it from iTunes,</v>

7122
03:07:56.011 --> 03:07:57.300
<v Speaker 1>like especially the older episodes,</v>

7123
03:07:57.301 --> 03:07:59.460
<v Speaker 1>it costs a dollar 99 that makes sense for him.</v>

7124
03:07:59.490 --> 03:08:00.860
<v Speaker 1>But let me tell you something,</v>

7125
03:08:00.890 --> 03:08:02.670
<v Speaker 1>it is worth so much more than that.</v>

7126
03:08:02.671 --> 03:08:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Like his fucking podcast or they're like a work of art.</v>

7127
03:08:05.700 --> 03:08:06.121
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

7128
03:08:06.121 --> 03:08:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

7129
03:08:06.630 --> 03:08:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Dan Carlin,</v>

7130
03:08:07.890 --> 03:08:08.390
<v Speaker 1>he's got,</v>

7131
03:08:08.390 --> 03:08:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

7132
03:08:08.620 --> 03:08:10.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll send you a link to a hardcore history,</v>

7133
03:08:11.070 --> 03:08:11.490
<v Speaker 1>wrath,</v>

7134

03:08:40.410 --> 03:08:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Dan Carlin to slap somebody.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7160
03:08:43.231 --> 03:08:44.490
<v Speaker 1>he's not really into flat earth,</v>

7161
03:08:44.690 --> 03:08:45.301
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

7162
03:08:45.301 --> 03:08:45.750
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

7163
03:08:45.750 --> 03:08:50.370
<v Speaker 1>he's got such a deep knowledge of so much fucking history and he prepares for</v>

7164
03:08:50.371 --> 03:08:51.840
<v Speaker 1>months to get these things ready.</v>

7165
03:08:51.870 --> 03:08:52.710
<v Speaker 1>That's how it's different,</v>

7166
03:08:52.711 --> 03:08:52.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7167
03:08:52.951 --> 03:08:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of podcasts,</v>

7168
03:08:54.810 --> 03:08:55.470
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

7169
03:08:55.470 --> 03:08:55.861
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

7170
03:08:55.861 --> 03:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>like you said on the show,</v>

7171
03:08:57.180 --> 03:08:59.430
<v Speaker 1>you just turn on you having a conversation with your buddies.</v>

7172
03:08:59.640 --> 03:09:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Carlin has to fucking go balls deep into how he's going to articulate it,</v>

7173
03:09:05.310 --> 03:09:06.450
<v Speaker 1>the plan and there's,</v>

7174
03:09:06.510 --> 03:09:06.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7175
03:09:06.691 --> 03:09:08.160
<v Speaker 1>the start and finish in its history.</v>

7176
03:09:08.220 --> 03:09:09.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's not an opinion.</v>

7177
03:09:09.390 --> 03:09:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Well we were talking about it and I was like,</v>

7178
03:09:10.951 --> 03:09:15.240
<v Speaker 1>you know what we're doing as a podcast where you're doing is like an audio art</v>

7179
03:09:15.241 --> 03:09:15.601
<v Speaker 1>piece.</v>

7180
03:09:15.601 --> 03:09:16.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like a work of art.</v>

7181
03:09:16.890 --> 03:09:19.680
<v Speaker 1>That's also historically accurate audio book.</v>

7182
03:09:21.390 --> 03:09:23.610
<v Speaker 1>You termed an audio show.</v>

7183
03:09:23.790 --> 03:09:24.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7184
03:09:24.241 --> 03:09:24.660
<v Speaker 1>he's white.</v>

7185
03:09:24.660 --> 03:09:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Way More of a now I use that.</v>

7186
03:09:26.520 --> 03:09:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Where does it get out?</v>

7187
03:09:27.220 --> 03:09:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Where did he get his,</v>

7188
03:09:28.321 --> 03:09:29.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7189
03:09:29.010 --> 03:09:30.180
<v Speaker 1>like what is,</v>

7190
03:09:30.600 --> 03:09:32.480
<v Speaker 1>he knows obviously he knows everything on goal.</v>

7191
03:09:32.481 --> 03:09:34.260
<v Speaker 1>He can his con where does it get its information?</v>

7192
03:09:34.290 --> 03:09:38.520
<v Speaker 1>He gives you a bunch of different references that he uses from various history</v>

7193
03:09:38.521 --> 03:09:42.570
<v Speaker 1>books and he also shows the discrepancies and the opinions how one person</v>

7194
03:09:42.571 --> 03:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>believed it was this but another person.</v>

7195
03:09:43.891 --> 03:09:46.110
<v Speaker 1>But so he gives you a balanced perspective too,</v>

7196
03:09:46.320 --> 03:09:49.170
<v Speaker 1>but then relays the undeniable facts.</v>

7197
03:09:49.230 --> 03:09:51.570
<v Speaker 1>So he tells you when there's some vagueness in history,</v>

7198
03:09:51.630 --> 03:09:54.160
<v Speaker 1>which I really appreciate too because he's not dogmatic.</v>

7199
03:09:54.190 --> 03:09:57.160
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't have like one idea in his head of how things absolutely went down.</v>

7200
03:09:57.490 --> 03:09:58.020
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

7201
03:09:58.020 --> 03:10:00.010
<v Speaker 6>and he's just so entertaining man.</v>

7202
03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:01.720
<v Speaker 6>Cause he has a background in um,</v>

7203
03:10:01.780 --> 03:10:02.920
<v Speaker 6>in talk radio.</v>

7204
03:10:03.220 --> 03:10:07.630
<v Speaker 6>So he's just so good at being like a professional broadcaster.</v>

7205
03:10:07.780 --> 03:10:10.540
<v Speaker 6>And then the guy's a maniac when it comes to history.</v>

7206
03:10:10.541 --> 03:10:11.350
<v Speaker 6>So he does this.</v>

7207
03:10:11.350 --> 03:10:13.270
<v Speaker 6>He did the seat series on World War One.</v>

7208
03:10:13.271 --> 03:10:16.000
<v Speaker 6>I have no idea how fucking crazy world war one was.</v>

7209
03:10:16.300 --> 03:10:17.280
<v Speaker 6>No idea on nuts.</v>

7210
03:10:17.680 --> 03:10:19.030
<v Speaker 6>That one dude,</v>

7211
03:10:19.300 --> 03:10:19.790
<v Speaker 6>you got to live.</v>

7212
03:10:19.790 --> 03:10:20.410
<v Speaker 6>They're all good.</v>

7213
03:10:20.410 --> 03:10:20.891
<v Speaker 6>He's pretty,</v>

7214
03:10:20.891 --> 03:10:21.131
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

7215
03:10:21.131 --> 03:10:24.310
<v Speaker 6>Did you know that Hitler was actually a soldier in World War One?</v>

7216
03:10:24.340 --> 03:10:25.510
<v Speaker 6>Did you talk about that?</v>

7217
03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:27.040
<v Speaker 6>And not only with the a soldier,</v>

7218
03:10:27.041 --> 03:10:27.940
<v Speaker 6>but he was one of the most,</v>

7219
03:10:28.090 --> 03:10:31.840
<v Speaker 6>he got like hardcore purple heart type shit from Germany.</v>

7220
03:10:31.990 --> 03:10:34.570
<v Speaker 6>He did the hardcore shit he wanted.</v>

7221
03:10:34.571 --> 03:10:35.170
<v Speaker 6>Is that true?</v>

7222
03:10:35.170 --> 03:10:35.380
<v Speaker 6>Go,</v>

7223
03:10:35.380 --> 03:10:36.040
<v Speaker 6>hold on.</v>

7224
03:10:36.040 --> 03:10:36.851
<v Speaker 6>Hold on real quick.</v>

7229
03:10:50.330 --> 03:10:52.510
<v Speaker 6>I heard that he was a hardcore,</v>

7230
03:10:52.810 --> 03:10:56.130
<v Speaker 6>he's one serious like awards war time.</v>

7231
03:10:56.910 --> 03:10:58.030
<v Speaker 6>He was a war hero.</v>

7232
03:10:58.560 --> 03:11:01.900
<v Speaker 6>He got behind them because he was so hardcore and he's right on this,</v>

<v Speaker 6>First job,</v>

7240
03:11:09.730 --> 03:11:13.260
<v Speaker 6>the most dangerous job was sending messages to the front line from headquarters</v>

7241
03:11:13.261 --> 03:11:14.094
<v Speaker 6>at the front line.</v>

7242
03:11:14.110 --> 03:11:15.700

7245
03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:20.140
<v Speaker 6>He didn't want to get discharged.</v>

7246
03:11:20.141 --> 03:11:21.610
<v Speaker 6>You want it to go back to front,</v>

7247
03:11:21.611 --> 03:11:22.211

03:11:28.750 --> 03:11:29.081
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

7257
03:11:29.081 --> 03:11:31.690
<v Speaker 6>obviously if you're going to do a piece about world war one,</v>

7258
03:11:31.810 --> 03:11:35.050
<v Speaker 6>Hitler doesn't play a big part unless you're going to continue with World War</v>

7259
03:11:35.080 --> 03:11:40.080
<v Speaker 6>Two and talk about is serving the transition I guess if he goes to one.</v>

<v Speaker 6>that I didn't know that.</v>

7267
03:11:48.580 --> 03:11:49.630
<v Speaker 6>It's fascinating shit.</v>

7268
03:11:49.631 --> 03:11:52.900
<v Speaker 6>How we'll work to connects to JFK.</v>

7269
03:11:53.170 --> 03:11:54.780

7270
03:11:54.790 --> 03:11:55.571
<v Speaker 6>Fog.</v>

7272
03:11:56.710 --> 03:11:58.680
<v Speaker 6>It's way better than fucking uh,</v>

7273
03:11:59.080 --> 03:12:03.280
<v Speaker 6>game of Thrones cause it's real cause it actually really happened to find out.</v>

7274
03:12:03.281 --> 03:12:05.440

7279
03:12:16.780 --> 03:12:19.810
<v Speaker 6>and there's so much crazy shit involved.</v>

7280
03:12:20.080 --> 03:12:24.870
<v Speaker 6>It's really as like a some kind of mini series like you want to get into World</v>

<v Speaker 6>mini series.</v>

7284
03:12:29.111 --> 03:12:30.370
<v Speaker 6>It's so complex.</v>

7285
03:12:30.371 --> 03:12:31.540
<v Speaker 6>There's so many players.</v>

7286
03:12:31.690 --> 03:12:32.351
<v Speaker 6>Jesus go,</v>

7287

7288
03:12:33.551 --> 03:12:38.050
<v Speaker 6>he would drop some knowledge on us about it that he remembers.</v>

7289
03:12:38.080 --> 03:12:39.520
<v Speaker 6>Does he remember a lot about World War II,</v>

<v Speaker 6>so drop it.</v>

7295
03:12:43.781 --> 03:12:44.890
<v Speaker 6>Even if he doesn't know</v>

7296
03:12:46.600 --> 03:12:47.433
<v Speaker 6>that's what we do</v>

7297

7301
03:12:51.980 --> 03:12:56.420
<v Speaker 1>a moment in history where you go back and look at it and things will never be</v>

7315
03:13:23.670 --> 03:13:24.503
<v Speaker 1>Adolf Hitler,</v>

03:13:24.650 --> 03:13:25.670
<v Speaker 1>they were into him.</v>

7317

<v Speaker 1>Eddie is dropping some serious words.</v>

7318
03:13:27.201 --> 03:13:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Are Real knowledge on your ass now was Hitler,</v>

7319
03:13:29.901 --> 03:13:31.340
<v Speaker 1>was Hitler not a vegetarian?</v>

7320
03:13:31.670 --> 03:13:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

7321
03:13:32.030 --> 03:13:32.451
<v Speaker 1>I go with,</v>

7322
03:13:32.451 --> 03:13:33.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7323
03:13:33.020 --> 03:13:33.621
<v Speaker 1>I think that was,</v>

7324
03:13:33.621 --> 03:13:35.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a rumor that Hitler was a vegetarian.</v>

7325
03:13:35.900 --> 03:13:37.430
<v Speaker 1>He also did a shitload of judge.</v>

7326
03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7327
03:13:39.440 --> 03:13:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I think he was.</v>

7328
03:13:40.220 --> 03:13:40.670
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

7329
03:13:40.670 --> 03:13:41.510
<v Speaker 1>do you know that he was,</v>

7330
03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:42.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7331
03:13:42.651 --> 03:13:45.990
<v Speaker 1>he was an architect and all the major buildings in all the,</v>

7332
03:13:46.400 --> 03:13:47.390
<v Speaker 1>in Germany.</v>

7333
03:13:47.630 --> 03:13:48.390
<v Speaker 1>He designed them.</v>

7334
03:13:48.390 --> 03:13:50.810
<v Speaker 1>He was into designing not only the buildings,</v>

7335
03:13:50.990 --> 03:13:55.640
<v Speaker 1>but you know those giant Nazi parades with all the giant crazy shit.</v>

7336
03:13:55.820 --> 03:13:58.610
<v Speaker 1>He choreographed and designed all that shit.</v>

7337
03:13:58.640 --> 03:13:58.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7338
03:13:58.821 --> 03:14:01.700
<v Speaker 1>what a documentary called the architect of doom.</v>

7339
03:14:02.030 --> 03:14:03.580
<v Speaker 1>It's about Adolf Hitler being,</v>

7340
03:14:03.650 --> 03:14:06.620
<v Speaker 1>that's why he started hating the Jews because he was trying to get into this art</v>

7341
03:14:06.621 --> 03:14:10.420
<v Speaker 1>academy that was run by Jews and they denied him,</v>

7342
03:14:10.470 --> 03:14:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

7343
03:14:11.170 --> 03:14:13.070
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] podcast.</v>

7344
03:14:13.130 --> 03:14:13.910
<v Speaker 1>There you go,</v>

7345
03:14:13.910 --> 03:14:14.151
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

7346
03:14:14.151 --> 03:14:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm a white petit and world war two.</v>

7347
03:14:15.770 --> 03:14:20.770
<v Speaker 1>You guys just haven't even walked into the gym and that's all it says that prior</v>

7348
03:14:21.501 --> 03:14:22.910
<v Speaker 1>to 1937,</v>

7349
03:14:23.390 --> 03:14:24.260
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>

7350
03:14:24.710 --> 03:14:28.040
<v Speaker 1>he ate meat and then after 37 on,</v>

7351
03:14:28.041 --> 03:14:29.150
<v Speaker 1>towards the end of his life,</v>

7352
03:14:29.180 --> 03:14:30.770
<v Speaker 1>he started becoming vegetarian.</v>

7353
03:14:30.771 --> 03:14:32.320
<v Speaker 1>That's why he became crazy.</v>

7354
03:14:32.390 --> 03:14:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Apparently had chronic flatulence sort of thing or as far to not try to smear</v>

7355
03:14:36.771 --> 03:14:36.951
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

7356
03:14:36.951 --> 03:14:37.281
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

7357
03:14:37.281 --> 03:14:38.120
<v Speaker 1>And he sucked.</v>

7358
03:14:38.121 --> 03:14:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Boy's Dick still always far just like a smear</v>

7359
03:14:42.970 --> 03:14:43.803
<v Speaker 1>farting.</v>

7360
03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:48.920
<v Speaker 1>How many leaders that far problems?</v>

7361
03:14:48.921 --> 03:14:52.400
<v Speaker 1>They probably like 80% of leaders probably had heart problems or drinking scotch</v>

7362
03:14:52.401 --> 03:14:53.270
<v Speaker 1>all fucking night.</v>

7363
03:14:53.300 --> 03:14:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Well the um,</v>

7364
03:14:54.020 --> 03:14:58.190
<v Speaker 1>the meth thing is crazy because apparently like a lot of world leaders were on</v>

7365
03:14:58.191 --> 03:14:59.060
<v Speaker 1>speed back then.</v>

7366
03:14:59.330 --> 03:15:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Like that was a big issue.</v>

7367
03:15:00.620 --> 03:15:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the things about Hillary Clinton that popped up was that she was on</v>

7368
03:15:04.161 --> 03:15:04.460
<v Speaker 1>PR,</v>

7369
03:15:04.460 --> 03:15:06.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it was pro vigil or new vigil.</v>

7370
03:15:07.100 --> 03:15:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Provigil Provigil is a,</v>

7371
03:15:09.681 --> 03:15:10.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7372
03:15:10.070 --> 03:15:10.903
<v Speaker 1>it's like that,</v>

7373
03:15:10.940 --> 03:15:14.150
<v Speaker 1>that stimulant that a fighter pilots use to stay awake.</v>

7374
03:15:14.390 --> 03:15:15.560
<v Speaker 1>Like it keeps you on point.</v>

7375
03:15:15.561 --> 03:15:19.760
<v Speaker 1>It's illegal in the Olympics now because it's some sort of a performance</v>

7376
03:15:19.761 --> 03:15:20.171
<v Speaker 1>enhancing.</v>

7377
03:15:20.171 --> 03:15:20.631
<v Speaker 1>She's supposed to.</v>

7378
03:15:20.631 --> 03:15:21.640
<v Speaker 1>She supposedly on that so,</v>

7379
03:15:21.650 --> 03:15:21.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7380
03:15:21.771 --> 03:15:22.700
<v Speaker 1>she's on that.</v>

7381
03:15:24.840 --> 03:15:29.280
<v Speaker 1>This is bringing this up is because this lady was telling me that her,</v>

7382
03:15:29.330 --> 03:15:30.860
<v Speaker 1>her friend's husband is on,</v>

7383
03:15:31.250 --> 03:15:32.090
<v Speaker 1>he's on Adderall.</v>

7384
03:15:32.091 --> 03:15:33.400
<v Speaker 1>She was going off about Adderall.</v>

7385
03:15:33.440 --> 03:15:34.940
<v Speaker 1>She's like my friend's husbands on Adderall.</v>

7386
03:15:34.941 --> 03:15:35.774
<v Speaker 1>He takes it every day.</v>

7387
03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Every day.</v>

7388
03:15:37.050 --> 03:15:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Takes Adderall.</v>

7389
03:15:38.180 --> 03:15:40.640
<v Speaker 1>Like he says he needs it takes to keep up the pace of the day.</v>

7390
03:15:40.850 --> 03:15:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Like that is math.</v>

7391
03:15:42.510 --> 03:15:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

7392
03:15:43.120 --> 03:15:43.641
<v Speaker 1>It's approved.</v>

7393
03:15:43.641 --> 03:15:44.271
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>

7394
03:15:44.271 --> 03:15:45.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like the same as math.</v>

7395
03:15:45.771 --> 03:15:48.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're taking a controlled dose of meth every day.</v>

7396
03:15:48.200 --> 03:15:50.220
<v Speaker 1>How many people are out there just taking math.</v>

7397
03:15:50.930 --> 03:15:51.481
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

7398
03:15:51.481 --> 03:15:52.920
<v Speaker 1>you watch breaking bad a lot.</v>

7399
03:15:53.170 --> 03:15:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7400
03:15:53.330 --> 03:15:53.881
<v Speaker 1>but that's math.</v>

7401
03:15:53.881 --> 03:15:54.714
<v Speaker 1>Math,</v>

7402
03:15:56.160 --> 03:15:56.371
<v Speaker 1>math,</v>

7403
03:15:56.371 --> 03:15:56.820
<v Speaker 1>math.</v>

7404
03:15:56.820 --> 03:15:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Jamie pulled up.</v>

7405
03:15:57.721 --> 03:16:00.390
<v Speaker 1>How many people are a on Adderall?</v>

7406
03:16:00.450 --> 03:16:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Say how many people,</v>

7407
03:16:01.651 --> 03:16:02.910
<v Speaker 1>how many prescriptions of Adderall?</v>

7408
03:16:02.970 --> 03:16:04.800
<v Speaker 1>What were your fighter pilot drugs called?</v>

7409
03:16:04.801 --> 03:16:05.550
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

7410
03:16:05.550 --> 03:16:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's just take a guess real quick.</v>

7411
03:16:07.260 --> 03:16:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a guess on Adderall.</v>

7412
03:16:08.760 --> 03:16:08.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7413
03:16:08.971 --> 03:16:10.200
<v Speaker 1>How many people on Adderall?</v>

7414
03:16:10.230 --> 03:16:11.130
<v Speaker 1>How many prescriptions?</v>

7415
03:16:11.250 --> 03:16:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's all you really know.</v>

7416
03:16:12.301 --> 03:16:13.440
<v Speaker 1>You know how many prescriptions are written?</v>

7417
03:16:13.441 --> 03:16:15.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means as far as people.</v>

7418
03:16:15.690 --> 03:16:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I think 10% what?</v>

03:18:31.471 --> 03:18:33.210
<v Speaker 1>This Saturday we found a,</v>

7494
03:18:33.240 --> 03:18:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Jamie found something.</v>

7495
03:18:34.141 --> 03:18:38.040
<v Speaker 1>16 million prescriptions was in 1999 and 99</v>

7496
03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:41.760
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

7497
03:18:41.760 --> 03:18:42.450
<v Speaker 1>3 million.</v>

7498
03:18:42.450 --> 03:18:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I had to laugh at that,</v>

7499
03:18:43.600 --> 03:18:44.430
<v Speaker 1>but I was,</v>

7500
03:18:44.430 --> 03:18:47.160
<v Speaker 1>how many people are using those 16 million prescriptions?</v>

7501
03:18:47.170 --> 03:18:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Like how many prescriptions?</v>

7502
03:18:48.100 --> 03:18:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Like how long has the prescription last?</v>

7503
03:18:49.451 --> 03:18:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Do you get one every three months?</v>

7504
03:18:51.310 --> 03:18:51.531
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

7505
03:18:51.531 --> 03:18:52.031
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

7506
03:18:52.031 --> 03:18:53.800
<v Speaker 2>That a person gets four prescriptions a year,</v>

7507
03:18:53.801 --> 03:18:58.801
<v Speaker 2>so you divide that by four went to eight I think you get fit in days.</v>

7508
03:19:00.220 --> 03:19:01.390
<v Speaker 2>It's every 30 days,</v>

7509
03:19:01.391 --> 03:19:01.991
<v Speaker 2>right when you need them.</v>

7510
03:19:01.991 --> 03:19:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I think if when you get prescribed hold on son,</v>

7511
03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:05.230
<v Speaker 2>just stop the nonsense.</v>

7512
03:19:05.231 --> 03:19:06.190
<v Speaker 2>If you're hooked on Adderall,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was a patch.</v>

7529
03:19:24.910 --> 03:19:26.020
<v Speaker 2>They gave them a patch.</v>

7530
03:19:26.220 --> 03:19:28.930
<v Speaker 2>It was some sort of easy or Prozac or Ritalin,</v>

7563
03:20:03.040 --> 03:20:04.540
<v Speaker 2>I thought they didn't prescribe it every day.</v>

7564
03:20:04.760 --> 03:20:05.680
<v Speaker 2>I think just a refill.</v>

7565
03:20:05.681 --> 03:20:07.030
<v Speaker 2>It'd be 30 I think.</v>

7566
03:20:07.280 --> 03:20:09.660
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of people that take it every day</v>

7567
03:20:11.360 --> 03:20:13.630
<v Speaker 2>because they're not going to give you fucking hundred 20 pills.</v>

7568
03:20:13.790 --> 03:20:14.710
<v Speaker 2>No Slang.</v>

7569
03:20:14.740 --> 03:20:15.580
<v Speaker 2>I think they do.</v>

7570
03:20:15.820 --> 03:20:16.601
<v Speaker 2>I think they do.</v>

7571
03:20:16.601 --> 03:20:18.040
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you take one a day,</v>

7572
03:20:18.041 --> 03:20:18.874
<v Speaker 2>like that's how they,</v>

7573
03:20:18.880 --> 03:20:20.140
<v Speaker 2>I think they can do it.</v>

7574
03:20:20.290 --> 03:20:23.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's thought of as being like the danger that it is fucking idiot</v>

7575
03:20:23.891 --> 03:20:26.350
<v Speaker 2>or at least most people like you or I,</v>

7576
03:20:26.351 --> 03:20:27.490
<v Speaker 2>they think it's going to help you,</v>

7577
03:20:27.491 --> 03:20:30.640
<v Speaker 2>but kids are snorting that shit and taking classes.</v>

7578
03:20:31.120 --> 03:20:33.070
<v Speaker 2>The frills for testing of people abused it.</v>

7579
03:20:33.071 --> 03:20:33.821
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't saying that.</v>

7580
03:20:33.821 --> 03:20:34.110
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

7581
03:20:34.110 --> 03:20:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever taken it?</v>

7582
03:20:35.020 --> 03:20:35.500
<v Speaker 2>I take it.</v>

7583
03:20:35.500 --> 03:20:35.721
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

7584
03:20:35.721 --> 03:20:36.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting nothing done.</v>
