00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.250
<v Speaker 1>It's the general good experience no matter what you call it.</v>

2
00:00:07.251 --> 00:00:08.084
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.630
<v Speaker 1>that's going on right now to be in Venice for anywhere or in Hollywood for just</v>

4
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.291
<v Speaker 1>even just standing up there.</v>

5
00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the right.</v>

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.581
<v Speaker 1>Look around here.</v>

7
00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:16.941
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

8
00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I have coyote problems out here.</v>

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally there's a mountain lion spotting a lot of hawks brown going to be</v>

10
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:24.110
<v Speaker 1>where?</v>

11
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Deer everywhere.</v>

12
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.461
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

13
00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>I like it out here man.</v>

14
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:29.840
<v Speaker 1>This is quiet and this is not quite enough for me because I want,</v>

15
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.310
<v Speaker 1>I want to live in the fucking woods.</v>

16
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.490
<v Speaker 1>I have a very distinct idea of the difference between my private life and my</v>

17
00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>personal life or my,</v>

18
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:41.031
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:42.620
<v Speaker 1>my public life and my public life.</v>

20
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.300
<v Speaker 1>I love working for the UFC.</v>

21
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I loved doing standup comedy,</v>

22
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>but both of those things involve large numbers of people and constantly being</v>

23
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:53.930
<v Speaker 1>around large numbers of fucking inverse thousand people in this audience at the</v>

24
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:55.270
<v Speaker 1>UFC and you know,</v>

25
00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 1>and all these fucking people that you see at comedy shows and all these people</v>

26
00:00:58.011 --> 00:00:58.844
<v Speaker 1>in Vegas.</v>

27
00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I like.</v>

28
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>How do you take pictures after shows?</v>

29
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Short man,</v>

30
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

31
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>I just go out.</v>

32
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 1>When I do a comedy show,</v>

33
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

34
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.050
<v Speaker 1>we wait about five or 10 minutes to cool off and I'd go out and I think I'll</v>

35
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:09.884
<v Speaker 1>stay for hours.</v>

36
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.600

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

38
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.973
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

39
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.160
<v Speaker 1>but to go from that,</v>

40
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>you want like a quiet man living by the ocean,</v>

41
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:17.571
<v Speaker 1>living by the lake,</v>

44
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this before.</v>

45
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to live in populations,</v>

46
00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:25.670
<v Speaker 1>sentence centers anymore,</v>

60
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I didn't you because a,</v>

61
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 1>I went to do standup and I put myself on tape and said big mistake because</v>

62
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.561
<v Speaker 1>I can't talk about it.</v>

63

<v Speaker 1>Can't talk about it.</v>

65
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Two Oh folks,</v>

66
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I found out one of his coconut juice is better than regular coconut water.</v>

67
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

68
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.670
<v Speaker 1>The reason is because it comes from Thailand and they have their own plantation</v>

69
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>in Thailand because,</v>

70
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

71
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>we've tried water.</v>

72
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:04.980
<v Speaker 1>That's just pure coconut water.</v>

73
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.781
<v Speaker 1>Pure calls are going to want it.</v>

74
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>They just crack open the Cogan airport.</v>

75
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

120
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:57.140
<v Speaker 1>I got so many,</v>

121
00:02:57.141 --> 00:02:58.670
<v Speaker 1>but probably just the push away.</v>

122
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Just the hush here.</v>

123
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean to you when you do that?</v>

124
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm just pushing away negative energy and then I'm bringing in positive energy</v>

125
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.581
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

126

<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

127
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>it's this move.</v>

128
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>So don't try this at home because it takes life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It makes me nuts.</v>

136

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>follow him on Twitter and eventually falling on the Bryan count experience.</v>

223
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Right at the front counter is Paula</v>

224
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 1>and my friend is whether or not it's nice.</v>

225
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

226
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.620
<v Speaker 1>we get pretty hot up here too.</v>

227
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.463
<v Speaker 1>Is My favorite.</v>

228
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I like la in the winter because there's actual weather,</v>

229
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

230
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.270
<v Speaker 1>I liked when it rains out there man,</v>

231
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's weird.</v>

232
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.900
<v Speaker 1>How did you ever think like you,</v>

233
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:52.960
<v Speaker 1>you grew up in Phoenix.</v>

234
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever think that you could live in a place like Seattle where it rained</v>

235
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:56.140
<v Speaker 1>all the time?</v>

236
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.973
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever think about it?</v>

237
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

238
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

239
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I think once you're around it for that long,</v>

240
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 2>you would start to hate it.</v>

241
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

242
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:02.871
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

243
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 2>just like just like the people in Seattle.</v>

244
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of people from Seattle live in Arizona and they just want</v>

245
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:10.720
<v Speaker 2>to get out of the rain because there's not a lot of writing in Arizona and then</v>

246
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

247
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 2>then they start to hate it after a while.</v>

248
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a place where you can only live for a little while.</v>

249
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe you could do a year there,</v>

250
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you live there for a long period of time,</v>

251
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:19.641
<v Speaker 2>you probably go crazy.</v>

252
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 2>It'd be fun to go there and just write,</v>

253
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.540
<v Speaker 2>get all depressed.</v>

254
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Something about rain that makes me want to write.</v>

255
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Like if really starts to rain,</v>

256
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I want to rush home and right.</v>

257
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.093
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

258
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.223
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

259
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.200

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.731
<v Speaker 2>I got it dude.</v>

261
00:06:30.731 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 2>I got to reign mix like a rain writing mix.</v>

262
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Am I on my iPod?</v>

263
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.880

264
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

265
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 2>So you like listen to like fake rain fall.</v>

266
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:37.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like real random.</v>

267
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:38.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

268
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.871
<v Speaker 2>not like that.</v>

269
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Like there's just certain music sets.</v>

278
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Something that just makes me want to write about sucking dicks.</v>

279
00:06:57.731 --> 00:06:58.564
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

282
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.313

<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

285
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Don't shut us down bro.</v>

286
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking two gangsters or take off the tag.</v>

287
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.063
<v Speaker 2>There's this,</v>

288
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.620
<v Speaker 2>there's this famous video where like there was this huge riot in some kind of a</v>

289
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 2>high school assembly.</v>

290
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.740
<v Speaker 2>Like and after this fight they showed what was on the floor and it was all those</v>

291
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 2>stickers and white towels do you know to like wipe off your forehead and put it</v>

293
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 2>But it was just like at least 20 towels and like 30 stickers,</v>

294
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:33.091
<v Speaker 2>hats,</v>

295
00:07:33.091 --> 00:07:33.924
<v Speaker 2>sticks.</v>

296
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 2>How about these guys that don't even bend their bill?</v>

297
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 2>It's just raised.</v>

298
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.990
<v Speaker 2>It looks ridiculous.</v>

299
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.823
<v Speaker 2>Word choice.</v>

300
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 2>That choice.</v>

301
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.393
<v Speaker 2>Not a wide choice.</v>

302
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.833
<v Speaker 2>I would never do it.</v>

303
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.790
<v Speaker 2>It's something about it that just screams ethnic.</v>

304
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

305
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.793
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

306
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 2>So this is this crafting since the crafty move they can get a lot of chances and</v>

307
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:53.204
<v Speaker 2>not all of them work.</v>

308
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 2>Remember when people were wearing the clothes backwards cause the Kris kross</v>

309
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 2>jump didn't work,</v>

310
00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 2>didn't work.</v>

311
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 2>It worked for a little while,</v>

312
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.450
<v Speaker 2>for a bunch of times for those,</v>

313
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.240
<v Speaker 2>there's some days where you can go to the mall and see kids walking around with</v>

314
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:10.241
<v Speaker 2>the pants on backwards or they shaved the Z Z cover each year.</v>

315
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.520
<v Speaker 2>I had a pair off calvary cheese at one point in time that were like almost like</v>

316
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 2>elastic here and they pulled in tight and snug here and then they got to hear</v>

317
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 2>and they puffed out the puffed out and it was great.</v>

318
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Walk around and if you want to dance some nice motion.</v>

352
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>People don't want to let me loose.</v>

353
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:14.700
<v Speaker 1>They want to put the cross in front of me.</v>

354
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] radio this morning and I said Shit.</v>

355
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And they asked me to stop,</v>

356
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.470

360
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.731
<v Speaker 1>And then I said,</v>

361
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:24.564
<v Speaker 1>shit again.</v>

362
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.590
<v Speaker 1>That's an asshole.</v>

363
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

364
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 1>they had me on for 50 minutes,</v>

365
00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

366
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 1>You had me on the phone for 50 minutes and you know,</v>

367
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.670
<v Speaker 1>I started getting passionate talking about fighting and you know this and that</v>

368
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:35.870
<v Speaker 1>match ups and you know,</v>

369
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.411
<v Speaker 1>one guy,</v>

370
00:09:36.411 --> 00:09:37.760
<v Speaker 1>his attributes and another guy's,</v>

371
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.880

372
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's because of the podcast.</v>

373
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.020
<v Speaker 1>You get so used to just expressing yourself.</v>

374
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:46.854
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

375
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

376

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

377
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Talking normal.</v>

378
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:49.951
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard,</v>

379
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:50.161
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

380
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:54.480
<v Speaker 1>When I go on regular radio shows and I always go on bullet [inaudible] when was</v>

381
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:55.990
<v Speaker 1>the last time you get a radio show and you weren't high?</v>

382
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Was that I did anything.</v>

383
00:09:57.661 --> 00:09:58.494
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't hot,</v>

384
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's pointless to do radio.</v>

385
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 1>That marijuana is a conversation enhancer.</v>

386
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:04.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

387
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:05.790

388
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:06.993
<v Speaker 1>you're right there.</v>

389
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to go so high that you can't talk.</v>

390
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:10.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

391
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:11.430
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be careful.</v>

392
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

393
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I've done that before.</v>

394
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 1>It got so high that I can't formulate proper sentences and I'm like,</v>

395
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.731

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.720
<v Speaker 1>My goal is to get new Chuck's tomorrow.</v>

00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 1>That's how I want to start getting,</v>

399
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I want us to be able to go chess.</v>

411
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.470
<v Speaker 1>He's supposed to be fighting the romps gifts and he's on a conference call and</v>

412
00:10:43.471 --> 00:10:44.710

420
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.720
<v Speaker 1>They steps away from the conference call and you hear him hit the bar,</v>

421
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.380
<v Speaker 1>you can hear him hit the bug and then he comes back and he starts doing noon</v>

422
00:10:57.381 --> 00:10:58.080
<v Speaker 1>chucks.</v>

423
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.360
<v Speaker 1>So while they're on this conference call,</v>

424
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.540
<v Speaker 1>he's got the thing on and they're asking him questions and he's out there</v>

427
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.050
<v Speaker 1>And he says he's got a way to clean himself out.</v>

428
00:11:10.051 --> 00:11:12.300
<v Speaker 1>He said he just stopped smoking weed 10 days out.</v>

429
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.720
<v Speaker 1>He said 10 days ago.</v>

430
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

431
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 1>But he has no body.</v>

432
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:15.361
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

433
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:16.470
<v Speaker 1>there's so much cardio.</v>

434
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.660
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even let it get to the cells.</v>

435
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.240
<v Speaker 1>But the only time that he didn't do that,</v>

436
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.680
<v Speaker 1>who was a the gummy fight,</v>

437
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.240
<v Speaker 1>he tested positive for the gummy fight and they said there was so much weed in</v>

438
00:11:27.241 --> 00:11:31.170
<v Speaker 1>his system when they tested him that he had to be high when he was fighting.</v>

439
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.180
<v Speaker 1>So what he did was just get</v>

440
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.790
<v Speaker 1>just completely ripped and then went out there and fought tack,</v>

441
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.090
<v Speaker 1>annoyed,</v>

442
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:43.090
<v Speaker 1>go me and just outbox and pride and feel bad and then submitted him.</v>

443
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

444
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:48.900
<v Speaker 1>it's safer over there.</v>

445
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

446
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I want it submitted him.</v>

447
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.710
<v Speaker 1>You can pick up on how many things should do.</v>

448
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Think about what level.</v>

449
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

450
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:55.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

451
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:55.540
<v Speaker 1>you didn't do,</v>

452
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.390
<v Speaker 1>you'd have like smoked and got on stage.</v>

453
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.130
<v Speaker 1>And also when they,</v>

454
00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 1>you asking me and I said try it once a long time ago by accident.</v>

455
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't only smoke pot and maybe a half,</v>

456
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 1>a dozen times in my whole life until I was 30 and it was usually like at a party</v>

457
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I had a couple of drinks or whatever.</v>

458
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened.</v>

459
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:14.351
<v Speaker 1>Once I was at,</v>

460
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

461
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:15.850
<v Speaker 1>my roommates and I,</v>

462
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

463
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.610
<v Speaker 1>one of one of my roommates friends with is the January,</v>

464
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.503
<v Speaker 1>always smoked weed.</v>

465
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.760
<v Speaker 1>And so we all over the house and I didn't smoke weed at the time,</v>

466
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.680
<v Speaker 1>but we're thinking,</v>

467
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 1>what the hell,</v>

468
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:24.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

469
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:24.860
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

470
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.140
<v Speaker 1>everybody's smoking a little weed,</v>

471
00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a hit.</v>

472
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.400
<v Speaker 1>So I took a hit and I got super high and I was super paranoid and I was like,</v>

473
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.911
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

474
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go do comedy like this.</v>

475
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.580
<v Speaker 1>And I was really nervous to go do comedy.</v>

476
00:12:34.581 --> 00:12:34.781
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

477
00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:36.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm way too hard and going on stage or not,</v>

478
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:37.084
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this.</v>

479
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't mode if I forget my material.</v>

480
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.360
<v Speaker 1>And I went up and Slade and it's like a half feel for this material that I never</v>

481
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:44.194
<v Speaker 1>had before,</v>

482
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.760
<v Speaker 1>but that was a long time ago.</v>

483
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:48.410
<v Speaker 1>And then they get to do it again until I was like 38.</v>

484
00:12:48.411 --> 00:12:51.160
<v Speaker 1>If you got to that level and you could go in the ring and fight,</v>

485
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:51.821
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

486
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 1>I would do it just for the sake of it.</v>

487
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:54.184
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>

488
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.510
<v Speaker 1>especially against GSP,</v>

489
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:56.980
<v Speaker 1>I get it fucking stoned.</v>

490
00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Just enough like it's just see the punches because you just get in the zone like</v>

491
00:13:01.331 --> 00:13:03.010
<v Speaker 1>he was doing against Bj Penn.</v>

492
00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 1>He was just turning to walking on him and sometimes,</v>

493
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:05.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

494
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.000
<v Speaker 1>How about when he stuck his chin out and he's like,</v>

495
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.030
<v Speaker 1>it was fucking crazy.</v>

496
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Let and Bj Punch.</v>

497
00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

498
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.870

500
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.200
<v Speaker 1>and he's up in his GSP and that's all that is.</v>

501
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:15.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

504
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 1>he was walking in the ring and he's putting a shirt on.</v>

505
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:19.451
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

514
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:27.640
<v Speaker 1>He's walking around the ring going,</v>

515
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:28.530

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

666
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:34.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to fucking look at fish through the water polarized.</v>

667
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.610
<v Speaker 1>This is where they did the mock up training compound.</v>

668
00:17:38.611 --> 00:17:39.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm bidding on right out.</v>

669
00:17:39.791 --> 00:17:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I just want to go home before you came up with the camera.</v>

670
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Dave and I were talking about uh,</v>

671
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:48.510
<v Speaker 1>like recognizing old school comedians and like we're both kind of historians and</v>

672
00:17:48.511 --> 00:17:49.200
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

673
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.230
<v Speaker 1>we were trying to figure out whether or not we were being honest with ourselves</v>

674
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 1>and where are they that good and where we're trying to build them up but we're</v>

675
00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:56.760
<v Speaker 1>trying to keep it alive and let people know.</v>

676
00:17:56.761 --> 00:17:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I think we're trying to keep it alive and let people know.</v>

677
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:59.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

678
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.910
<v Speaker 5>I was just going to say that like what's it,</v>

679
00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.320
<v Speaker 5>it's not so much building them up cause they weren't great but it's like are</v>

680
00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:06.220
<v Speaker 5>they going to be as great to this next generation?</v>

681
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.530
<v Speaker 5>Probably not because they have their own people that they will have a chance to</v>

682
00:18:08.531 --> 00:18:09.840
<v Speaker 5>watch a Lenny Bruce uh,</v>

683
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 5>record.</v>

684
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:10.790
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>

685
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:11.740
<v Speaker 5>It's hard but you got to like,</v>

686
00:18:11.741 --> 00:18:12.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

687
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:13.330
<v Speaker 5>see it from that perspective.</v>

688
00:18:13.331 --> 00:18:15.010
<v Speaker 5>Cause comic does an age like music.</v>

689
00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.870
<v Speaker 5>So that's what it is,</v>

690
00:18:16.871 --> 00:18:17.440
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

691
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:17.711
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

692
00:18:17.711 --> 00:18:18.460
<v Speaker 5>Comedy,</v>

693
00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.450
<v Speaker 5>except for the stooges,</v>

694
00:18:19.451 --> 00:18:20.140
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

695
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.070
<v Speaker 5>they bring it hard.</v>

696
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.500
<v Speaker 5>Every little rascal is really close to my face.</v>

697
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:24.783
<v Speaker 5>Fisheye.</v>

698
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.010
<v Speaker 5>He said it looks like it's right,</v>

699
00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:27.761
<v Speaker 5>but I'm no,</v>

700
00:18:27.761 --> 00:18:28.600
<v Speaker 5>I was just thinking like,</v>

701
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.931
<v Speaker 5>oh we,</v>

702
00:18:28.931 --> 00:18:32.770
<v Speaker 5>oh we overplaying it to these younger cats who don't really give a shit or are</v>

703
00:18:32.771 --> 00:18:33.280
<v Speaker 5>we just like,</v>

704
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:33.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

705
00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.860
<v Speaker 5>some of them do the right fight and you know some of them,</v>

706
00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:36.850
<v Speaker 5>some of them are going to you,</v>

707
00:18:36.851 --> 00:18:39.010
<v Speaker 5>but that's because people are going to complain about everything.</v>

708
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.660
<v Speaker 5>So I figured it was a comedy fan,</v>

709
00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:41.494
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

710
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:42.610
<v Speaker 1>That's all right.</v>

711
00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.361
<v Speaker 1>Well listen man,</v>

712
00:18:43.361 --> 00:18:43.551
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

713
00:18:43.551 --> 00:18:44.620
<v Speaker 1>before I was a comic,</v>

714
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

715
00:18:45.281 --> 00:18:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've always been a comedy fan,</v>

716
00:18:46.691 --> 00:18:47.620
<v Speaker 1>but before I was a comic,</v>

717
00:18:47.621 --> 00:18:48.490
<v Speaker 1>when I was a comedy fan,</v>

718
00:18:48.491 --> 00:18:50.080
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to hear and heard this stuff.</v>

719
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.241
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

720
00:18:51.241 --> 00:18:51.570
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.670
<v Speaker 5>I heard it know you're a comic.</v>

722
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:53.470
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>

723
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh Steve Martin.</v>

724
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Just sitting around every week doing three times.</v>

725
00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:57.443
<v Speaker 1>That'd be amazing.</v>

726
00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.760
<v Speaker 1>How awesome would it be to watch Steve Martin too?</v>

727
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.661
<v Speaker 1>I was there.</v>

728
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:02.340
<v Speaker 1>I saw him a couple of times,</v>

729
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.140
<v Speaker 1>see Kennison live.</v>

730
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I never saw him say.</v>

731
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.850
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my regrets.</v>

732
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had seen him live.</v>

733
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:08.700
<v Speaker 1>I saw Kennison live three times,</v>

734
00:19:08.701 --> 00:19:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I think once when he was still hot.</v>

735
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.940
<v Speaker 1>And then once at the end where he was just was rock Russell Good anymore?</v>

736
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:15.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

737
00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:16.021
<v Speaker 1>it was bad.</v>

738
00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:16.860
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

739
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:17.701
<v Speaker 1>It was like I go,</v>

740
00:19:17.701 --> 00:19:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I got to watch the full metamorphoses,</v>

741
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:20.873
<v Speaker 1>the full,</v>

742
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

743
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.800
<v Speaker 1>getting sucked into Hollywood.</v>

744
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.701
<v Speaker 1>But at first saw him,</v>

745
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:27.630
<v Speaker 1>it was like 87 86 87 holy shit.</v>

746
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I saw him at Great Woods Center for the performing arts.</v>

747
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.981
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

748
00:19:30.981 --> 00:19:32.280
<v Speaker 1>he fucking destroyed.</v>

749
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.061
<v Speaker 1>He destroyed.</v>

750
00:19:33.061 --> 00:19:36.300
<v Speaker 1>And he had this bit at the end where he would take someone from the audience and</v>

751
00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.910
<v Speaker 1>bring them on stage and they would tell a story about how some girl broke her</v>

752
00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:39.661
<v Speaker 1>heart and call it,</v>

753
00:19:39.661 --> 00:19:40.920
<v Speaker 1>pull out a phone and call it.</v>

754
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:41.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah Dude,</v>

755
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.540
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>

756
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.380
<v Speaker 1>he crushed,</v>

757
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.230
<v Speaker 1>he crushed.</v>

758
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Everybody just left.</v>

759
00:19:45.121 --> 00:19:46.170
<v Speaker 1>They're shaking their heads like,</v>

760
00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:47.250
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

761
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.420
<v Speaker 5>he's the one guy that you can watch and not.</v>

762
00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:50.300
<v Speaker 5>And now we're doing it again.</v>

763
00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:51.590
<v Speaker 5>But this is true to me.</v>

764
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:52.870
<v Speaker 5>This is my truth with a,</v>

765
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.571
<v Speaker 5>with watching him,</v>

766
00:19:53.571 --> 00:19:55.880
<v Speaker 5>it's like he's the one guy that I think never got,</v>

767
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.190
<v Speaker 5>never was respected as a comic because his,</v>

768
00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.400
<v Speaker 5>his rock and roll life overplayed his comedy.</v>

769
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.200
<v Speaker 5>But when I watched him to this day,</v>

770
00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:07.130
<v Speaker 5>I feel like he's right in the room with me in my fucking phase and I'm shaking</v>

771
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:07.521
<v Speaker 5>with like,</v>

772
00:20:07.521 --> 00:20:08.450
<v Speaker 5>just fucking power.</v>

773
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.321
<v Speaker 5>It's his power,</v>

774
00:20:09.321 --> 00:20:09.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

775
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:10.760
<v Speaker 5>he's like bang,</v>

776
00:20:10.761 --> 00:20:11.031
<v Speaker 5>Bang,</v>

777
00:20:11.031 --> 00:20:11.380
<v Speaker 5>Bang.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And I love that [inaudible] says is fucking just man.</v>

779
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.210
<v Speaker 5>It's just like he's painting pictures up there and I love it.</v>

780
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:17.961
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.350
<v Speaker 5>nobody had done it again about hearing this shit.</v>

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:23.960

809
00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:52.140
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

810
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.070
<v Speaker 1>It was total paradigm shifting.</v>

811
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Screaming rage,</v>

812
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:56.790

816
00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:02.470
<v Speaker 1>you just get sucked into it.</v>

817
00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like a different kind of comedy.</v>

818
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:06.640
<v Speaker 1>It was completely different than anything I'd seen before.</v>

819
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:07.920
<v Speaker 5>You're absolutely right man.</v>

820
00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.080
<v Speaker 5>Cause that special now.</v>

821
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.933
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm thinking about it.</v>

822
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.730
<v Speaker 5>He owned that fucking room.</v>

823
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.070
<v Speaker 5>He owned that stage.</v>

824
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.340
<v Speaker 5>Went from being a preacher guy.</v>

825
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.020
<v Speaker 5>You fucking knew how to own it.</v>

826
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.470
<v Speaker 5>Fucking like everybody in the room thought he's making iconic.</v>

827
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.950
<v Speaker 5>That's like a preacher thing where you feel like he's talking to just you,</v>

828
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.140
<v Speaker 5>but he's talking to like a couple of hundred people,</v>

829
00:21:25.141 --> 00:21:25.920
<v Speaker 5>thousand people.</v>

830
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.060
<v Speaker 1>You the story bucking them.</v>

831
00:21:27.061 --> 00:21:28.050
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of crazy.</v>

832
00:21:28.051 --> 00:21:28.710
<v Speaker 1>I read his book.</v>

833
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever read his book?</v>

834
00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.300
<v Speaker 1>My brother Sam,</v>

835
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.310
<v Speaker 1>his brother Bill wrote a book about Shit.</v>

836
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I did read that book.</v>

837
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

838
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.330
<v Speaker 1>he got hit by a car when he was a little kid and it totally changed his</v>

839
00:21:36.331 --> 00:21:37.164
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

840
00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:40.950
<v Speaker 1>He got fucked up by a car and he got injured his head.</v>

841
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:45.240
<v Speaker 1>And after that became like reckless and wild wasn't a different person.</v>

842
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's like he was created almost by an accident.</v>

843
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.190
<v Speaker 5>I used to run into his brother,</v>

844
00:21:50.191 --> 00:21:52.950
<v Speaker 5>like occasionally like doing things like Montreal comedy festivals and stuff</v>

845
00:21:52.951 --> 00:21:53.370
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

846
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.920
<v Speaker 5>And I always felt like I had just gotten off and I felt like,</v>

847
00:21:55.921 --> 00:21:56.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

848
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:56.371
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

849
00:21:56.371 --> 00:21:56.970
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>

850
00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:57.803
<v Speaker 5>really nailed it.</v>

851
00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:59.050
<v Speaker 5>And then I would see him and I'd be like,</v>

852
00:21:59.260 --> 00:21:59.501
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

853
