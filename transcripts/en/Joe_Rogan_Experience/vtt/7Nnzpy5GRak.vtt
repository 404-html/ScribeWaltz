<v Speaker 1>I guess a little bit in the twitter</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Just everybody's excited about being</v>
<v Speaker 1>outraged.</v>

11
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

12
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This controversy every five seconds.</v>

13
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy on before,</v>

14
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>the guy that you just met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Dr Robert Schoch.</v>

15
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>He's a geologist from Boston University</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he is a part of this,</v>

16
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>backdating of the ancient,</v>

17
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of Egypt and they're talking</v>

18
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>all these different structures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be thousands and thousands of</v>

20
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>years older than people think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that he's working</v>

21
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:50.031
<v Speaker 1>on is that there was coronal mass</v>
<v Speaker 1>ejections from the sun somewhere around</v>

22
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>10,000 years ago that basically killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>off a giant percentage of the population</v>

23
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lightening storms millions of times</v>

24
00:00:57.271 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Speaker 1>greater than anything we've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced before.</v>

25
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>That literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which like lightning coming down,</v>

26
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>like rain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barbecuing the ground,</v>

27
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>killing people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people forst indicates civilization</v>

28
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>resets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like we need something like</v>

29
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>that to really be upset about because</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of being upset about Roseanne or</v>

30
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Samantha Bee or Samantha Bee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use the c word today,</v>

31
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:17.784
<v Speaker 1>that Nadia</v>

32
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.610
<v Speaker 2>chest outrage culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say everyone should just wait like 48</v>

33
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 2>hours if everybody hates you and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be onto the next person that</v>

34
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:26.620
<v Speaker 2>they have.</v>

35
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the cool things about</v>

36
00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:30.220
<v Speaker 1>the Internet is the cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

37
00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:32.080
<v Speaker 1>it hits you hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it goes back</v>

38
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 2>really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 2>It's never that serious</v>

40
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>sound like the old days when someone got</v>
<v Speaker 1>in trouble with something.</v>

41
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that trouble stuck.</v>

42
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that time.</v>

43
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I genuinely don't know that time.</v>

44
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.820
<v Speaker 2>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty nine.</v>

45
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 2>I just turned 29.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're very,</v>

46
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 2>very young in the shit stirring culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

47
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.270
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all new stuff to you.</v>

48
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 2>It's new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

49
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 2>and I think the thing that sucks for me</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I'm really conscious of it.</v>

50
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 2>Like I wish I thought all of this was</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>

51
00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 2>It would be easier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like even when I do things like just</v>

52
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 2>before this I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

53
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 2>let me do an instagram story that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>about to go on.</v>

54
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:04.171
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

55
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we under Grogan.</v>

56
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.991
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how weird.</v>

57
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm like holding my phone in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>of talking to this device you're aware</v>

58
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that kind of sucks that I'm aware</v>

59
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I.</v>

60
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 2>It would be so much more natural if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't aware of it,</v>

61
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls that just hey guys,</v>

62
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 2>and they all day and it feels normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So being conscious of it is kind of not</v>

63
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 2>that fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably the best way to approach</v>

64
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 2>it though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be conscious of our goofy it is</v>

65
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 2>because if you just swept away in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zeitgeists,</v>

66
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's basically ignorance is</v>

67
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 2>bliss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

68
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are people that think it's</v>

69
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 2>the most normal thing in the world to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just put your entire life on social</v>

70
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 2>media and I actually don't think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most normal thing in the world,</v>

71
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:46.380
<v Speaker 2>but my entire life is on social media.</v>

72
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just met you,</v>

73
00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:50.680
<v Speaker 1>but you seem like a very bright woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's probably part of the problem</v>

74
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.690
<v Speaker 1>is you're not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're stupid.</v>

75
00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:55.870
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like putting everything on</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram and you'd be.</v>

76
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you do the Selfie face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my favorite.</v>

77
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>This thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when</v>

78
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 2>they do that weird thing with their neck</v>
<v Speaker 2>angle,</v>

79
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm really bad at selfies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My cousin always has to take them if</v>

80
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:11.130
<v Speaker 2>we're in the same picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm getting good at my like</v>

81
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.390
<v Speaker 2>instagram angle and the things that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>

82
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you guys like this eyeshadow?</v>

83
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that ridiculous.</v>

84
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>My friend Cameron hanes loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He saw you on Fox News.</v>

85
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's this girl?</v>

86
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>She's making so much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like super hardcore conservative.</v>

87
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>So he likes when anyone is like young</v>
<v Speaker 1>and conservative,</v>

88
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>like loves Ben Shapiro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves all that Shit.</v>

89
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.380
<v Speaker 2>So you got excited about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have been really excited.</v>

90
00:03:36.381 --> 00:03:38.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

91
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm really unapologetically myself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>today that's like,</v>

92
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.540
<v Speaker 2>it's like seeing an alien.</v>

93
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.670
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to pull off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

94
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Because people get mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People trying this,</v>

95
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.390
<v Speaker 1>this one thing that is absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

96
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.480
<v Speaker 1>whether people like it or not or believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>it or not it people are trying to</v>

97
00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:58.481
<v Speaker 1>silence other people's opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you say something that doesn't jive</v>

98
00:03:58.761 --> 00:04:00.050
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of saying,</v>

99
00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:01.880
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this lady's kind of out there,</v>

100
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.950
<v Speaker 1>or she's saying some shit that I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure I agree with.</v>

101
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Instead of that,</v>

102
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire her.</v>

103

<v Speaker 2>Which was insane.</v>

105
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you really want someone to lose their</v>

106
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 2>job if you didn't like a tweet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how weird or some of these</v>

<v Speaker 2>situations I'll make you really want</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person not to able to feed their</v>

108
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 2>family because you don't like a tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are crazy.</v>

109
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Just they find targets and they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go after him.</v>

110
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.570
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of people that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

111
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.930
<v Speaker 1>writing boycott.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan because I was talking about</v>

112
00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:29.940
<v Speaker 1>having Roseanne Barr on the show</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

113
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know and it's like she just.</v>

114
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:33.900
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't have a right to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genuine.</v>

115
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Can't even talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can't even talk.</v>

116
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Even though I'm sure you don't agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

117
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with what she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

118
00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:42.710
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that she can't like have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation after that to me is like</v>

119
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:44.150
<v Speaker 2>the most bizarre thing in the entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

120
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:48.110
<v Speaker 2>but that is what outrage culture is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they need you off the island.</v>

121
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.040
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't even agree with what she said</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she apologized and nobody cares.</v>

122
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.460
<v Speaker 1>She's taken all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants.</v>

123
00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>She's drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's fucked out of her head and like my</v>

124
00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:03.270
<v Speaker 1>mom took ambien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just told me about this today.</v>

125
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I forgot I forgot about the store</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was telling her the story</v>

126
00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:08.160
<v Speaker 1>about another friend of mine on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast yesterday.</v>

127
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I talked about how a friend of mine got</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Ambien,</v>

128
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.920
<v Speaker 1>made a full meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooked it,</v>

129
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.330
<v Speaker 1>ate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to sleep,</v>

130
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:19.080
<v Speaker 1>got up in the morning and had zero</v>
<v Speaker 1>recollection of it was in total denial</v>

131
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:19.914
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>

132
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.580
<v Speaker 1>My mom told me that she went to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got up in the morning and she had got up</v>

133
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.950
<v Speaker 1>and put red lipstick and I'm a and nail</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polish all over the white bathroom.</v>

134
00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Carpet was a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's painted on it like a child now and</v>

135
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.560
<v Speaker 1>she had zero recollection of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

136
00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:43.200
<v Speaker 1>this is scary shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she's painted like a little kid</v>

137
00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:46.080
<v Speaker 1>would like a two year old would get</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahold of your lipstick and start drawing</v>

138
00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:48.240
<v Speaker 1>on the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She did that on this shag carpet.</v>

139
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Ambien is just like sleep look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It instantly brings you into sleep walk</v>

140
00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:53.490
<v Speaker 2>and you can do anything you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ambien.</v>

141
00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:55.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a bunch of college friends who</v>

142
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 2>used to do ambien and bizarre stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>would just come out.</v>

143
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm like very anti pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't take anything.</v>

144
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 2>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing at all.</v>

145
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 2>No drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't drink.</v>

146
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't do any toddler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

147
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wasn't always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

148
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 2>I kinda got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could say it's like a little</v>

149
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>bit of paranoia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once I started down this journey of</v>

150
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 2>realizing that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

151
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived for 26 years in my mind wasn't</v>

152
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 2>my own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I thought like being a liberal was</v>

153
00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 2>okay and like everything that was said</v>
<v Speaker 2>on tv it was okay.</v>

154
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Then it's like very easy to sort of get</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little paranoid and go,</v>

155
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what else did I do?</v>

156
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 2>I accept normally that is actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>retrospect to look a little weird and I</v>

157
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 2>started thinking about drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

158
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:33.860
<v Speaker 2>how can drinking possibly be the cure to</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything?</v>

159
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like you're getting married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink happy,</v>

160
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 2>you're sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink a little embarrassed,</v>

161
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.930
<v Speaker 2>have some drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

162
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 2>You want to come out of your shell drink</v>
<v Speaker 2>like no matter what emotion you have,</v>

163
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 2>there's like a liquor designed for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

164
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 2>this is a little shady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know,</v>

165
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did like a little bit of math and</v>

166
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:55.150
<v Speaker 2>I calculated that since I had started</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking when I was 14 years old and I</v>

167
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say like fair,</v>

168
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:58.010
<v Speaker 2>like I drank every weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably more in college,</v>

169
00:06:58.011 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 2>maybe five days a week in college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

170
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

171
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.790
<v Speaker 2>I've technically drank for like three</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of my life and that feels weird,</v>

172
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.670
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just not going to drink any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you put in your time.</v>

173
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a little break,</v>

174
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.960
<v Speaker 2>take a little break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

175
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 2>which is weird because now I go places</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

176
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't drink and everyone gets really</v>

177
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.750
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

178
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.800
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a glass of water.</v>

179
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:20.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an alcoholic.</v>

180
00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:23.480
<v Speaker 2>You can have a beer and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

181
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.290
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if other people were drinking,</v>

182
00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:27.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't do like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

183
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the weird one.</v>

184
00:07:28.811 --> 00:07:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

185
00:07:29.651 --> 00:07:30.820
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't trust you.</v>

186
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's either just like,</v>

187
00:07:32.261 --> 00:07:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I can't trust this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

188
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.180
<v Speaker 1>water's going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

189
00:07:37.181 --> 00:07:39.940
<v Speaker 1>we were fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then whoever did weird shit.</v>

190
00:07:39.941 --> 00:07:41.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all hammered.</v>

191
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if one person,</v>

192
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.910
<v Speaker 1>every person right and shit down</v>

193
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 2>the atrial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my friends are getting married and</v>

194
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 2>like the first thing they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I say I don't drink,</v>

195
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're not going to drink at</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wedding.</v>

196
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.070
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

197
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.960
<v Speaker 2>is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

198
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 2>can I still come and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel like you're ruining their</v>

199
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:59.740
<v Speaker 2>wedding because you're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink it.</v>

200
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.410
<v Speaker 2>It's like a very strange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture of drinking as a nondrinker</v>

201
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 2>you really realize how bizarre it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially.</v>

202
00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Take off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long has it been?</v>

203
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I stopped drinking last November,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it hasn't been like super long,</v>

204
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:14.990
<v Speaker 2>but long enough for people to really</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some weird feelings about it and</v>

205
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:16.790
<v Speaker 2>just some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just sober man.</v>

206
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

207
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a month off.</v>

208
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I took a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did sober October.</v>

209
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:23.530
<v Speaker 1>No Pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no booze,</v>

210
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.110
<v Speaker 1>and then we had to do 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

211
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:30.340
<v Speaker 1>15 hot yoga classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 minute hot yoga classes in a month.</v>

212
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.150
<v Speaker 1>It was this a bad between me and my four</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends was.</v>

213
00:08:33.151 --> 00:08:35.410
<v Speaker 1>It was a stupid bet because it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a stakes.</v>

214
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if one of us didn't do it,</v>

215
00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:41.050
<v Speaker 1>we had to throw a party but we all did</v>
<v Speaker 1>it so it was pointless but.</v>

216
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.170
<v Speaker 1>But we learned a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn a lot about just,</v>

217
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:49.530
<v Speaker 1>you learn a lot about that even if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think you use alcohol or pot as an</v>

218
00:08:50.201 --> 00:08:51.600
<v Speaker 1>escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

219
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.400
<v Speaker 1>you lean on it a little bit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

220
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 1>and I always talk like people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the differences</v>

221
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 2>you've noticed and there've been so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>differences,</v>

222
00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:02.130
<v Speaker 2>but I think like the number one thing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like the amount of confidence that</v>

223
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:02.861
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

224
00:09:02.861 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I have this theory now that alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you anxiety.</v>

225
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Like I used to be stressed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I realized that I was self</v>

226
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 2>diagnosing myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

227
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on a morning person.</v>

228
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 2>I was probably just like perpetually</v>
<v Speaker 2>hung over and never like now,</v>

229
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.710
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I jumped up now in the morning I have so</v>

230
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 2>much energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like wow,</v>

231
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how many things I've been like</v>
<v Speaker 2>self-diagnosing.</v>

232
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

233
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:24.910
<v Speaker 2>my skin just got bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once I turned 26,</v>

234
00:09:24.911 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 2>like skinny immediately clears up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

235
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:27.900
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I,</v>

236
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.700
<v Speaker 2>I just had so much alcohol in my system</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I like developed random things like</v>

237
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 2>it just kind of making excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not good for you.</v>

238
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five,</v>

239
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:37.910
<v Speaker 2>six nights a week?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

240
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 2>And the best way to like stop drinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to read an article that freaks you</v>

241
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:43.800
<v Speaker 2>out about like what drinking does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is what I do because it's like</v>

242
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 2>how I trained myself to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll look read some really extreme thing</v>

243
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 2>on the internet and then be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

244
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.320
<v Speaker 2>like</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

245
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 2>like this guy had this theory that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol and people call alcoholic</v>

246
00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 2>spirits or whatever that like when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink,</v>

247
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.650
<v Speaker 2>like it allows like evil spirits to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>into your body.</v>

248
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.450
<v Speaker 2>Like the most bizarre thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>

249
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't drink anymore.</v>

250
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Got To keep away from evil spirits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you used?</v>

251
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:11.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

252
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I just like read weird articles and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

253
00:10:13.521 --> 00:10:14.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna drink anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

254
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized like who else</v>

255
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 2>doesn't drink?</v>

256
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Like the most successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Donald Trump has never drank</v>

257
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 2>alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just fascinating because I'm</v>

258
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:22.404
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

259
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.550
<v Speaker 2>he's got so much energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

260
00:10:26.551 --> 00:10:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Like he's just like going at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

261
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.250
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Kirk doesn't drink.</v>

262
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:34.890
<v Speaker 2>He's like 24 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And taking over the world.</v>

263
00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:36.130
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

264
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.030
<v Speaker 2>who else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don trump junior doesn't drink.</v>

265
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he did like,</v>

266
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:43.020
<v Speaker 2>I used to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to but he doesn't drink.</v>

267
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

268
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the people that I'm around now</v>

269
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:51.300
<v Speaker 2>don't drink so it makes it easier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just like highly productive</v>

270
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:53.850
<v Speaker 2>individuals and I'm now like highly</v>
<v Speaker 2>productive.</v>

271
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Kim Kardashian doesn't drink and whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like to</v>

272
00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 2>be highly productive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also good to have fun.</v>

273
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.290
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think there's anything wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the little.</v>

274
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

275
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.660
<v Speaker 2>People can drink around me all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

276
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh actually I will say like when people</v>
<v Speaker 2>get like completely sloshed,</v>

277
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.390
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing to observe when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sober.</v>

278
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a strange place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like being on another planet where</v>

279
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:20.090
<v Speaker 2>like everyone's acting like a toddler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like watching a preschool class and</v>

280
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 2>going to the bathroom like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

281
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you screaming close to my face</v>

282
00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:26.490
<v Speaker 2>and talk to you and explain and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to get wrong.</v>

283
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Really close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like drinking makes you a really close</v>

284
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:32.250
<v Speaker 2>talker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something where you need to feel</v>

285
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:35.810
<v Speaker 2>like the heat emanating off of someone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

286
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people grabbed people do weird shit.</v>

287
00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:42.560
<v Speaker 2>To him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing to watch sober.</v>

288
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.820
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain number of drinks where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun and then there's a certain</v>

289
00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:46.410
<v Speaker 2>number of drinks were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

290
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:48.210
<v Speaker 2>human beings are weird.</v>

291
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.980
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

292
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I'm not going to like never</v>

293
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 2>drink again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I'm not even,</v>

294
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just like this is the new</v>

295
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.500
<v Speaker 2>candice I'm sure like when I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>married,</v>

296
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not going to not have like</v>

297
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.070
<v Speaker 2>gossip champagne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like right now,</v>

298
00:12:03.071 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 2>like especially with like the stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing,</v>

299
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm like I just don't have the energy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like tired.</v>

300
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is kind of a weird</v>

301
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.320
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you become this?</v>

302
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.760
<v Speaker 1>You're a very popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would call conservative thinker,</v>

303
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 1>but you're very young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how did this all happen?</v>

304
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.370
<v Speaker 1>How did you become this Fox News</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality?</v>

305
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Conservative thinker?</v>

306
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just launched a youtube channel</v>

307
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.760
<v Speaker 2>and fucking Youtube Youtube where magic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you teach a strange place.</v>

308
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange place.</v>

309
00:12:33.471 --> 00:12:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Internet and the Internet of things</v>

310
00:12:36.711 --> 00:12:38.750
<v Speaker 2>happen on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

311
00:12:38.751 --> 00:12:41.150
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really passionate.</v>

312
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understood I had studied for like,</v>

313
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.520
<v Speaker 2>it sounds strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I spent a year underground,</v>

314
00:12:46.521 --> 00:12:50.030
<v Speaker 2>like studying politics once I had my red</v>
<v Speaker 2>pill moment,</v>

315
00:12:50.031 --> 00:12:52.980
<v Speaker 2>if that's what you want to explain that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you used to be a liberal,</v>

316
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you became a conservative.</v>

317
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.780
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was it?</v>

318
00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.350
<v Speaker 2>So the story really starts with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school I guess,</v>

319
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how things can happen you in life and</v>

320
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:05.480
<v Speaker 2>they don't make sense when they happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like why God me?</v>

321
00:13:05.481 --> 00:13:07.010
<v Speaker 2>And then when you get a little older and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

322
00:13:07.011 --> 00:13:08.460
<v Speaker 2>this makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

323
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:13.630
<v Speaker 2>So I was the quote unquote victim of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate crime when I was in high school.</v>

324
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.870
<v Speaker 2>When you say quote unquote victims</v>
<v Speaker 2>victim know I hate the word victim and</v>

325
00:13:17.871 --> 00:13:19.850
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like an again early.</v>

326
00:13:19.851 --> 00:13:23.270
<v Speaker 2>I can see why early on I've sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed this mentality that like being</v>

327
00:13:23.271 --> 00:13:24.680
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no value in being a victim and</v>

328
00:13:24.681 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 2>people rush to call people a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They rushed to call somebody the</v>

329
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:28.820
<v Speaker 2>aggressor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you describe it that you</v>

330
00:13:28.821 --> 00:13:31.610
<v Speaker 2>experienced a hate crime against</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that was labeled as a hate</v>

331
00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:33.050
<v Speaker 2>crime?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I W I wouldn't even call it a hate</v>

332
00:13:33.051 --> 00:13:34.760
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we live in a label obsessed</v>

333
00:13:34.761 --> 00:13:37.430
<v Speaker 2>culture and before we seek to understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened,</v>

334
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.870
<v Speaker 2>we seek to like put it in a box like so</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

335
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Someone has to be a demon and someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to be an angel.</v>

336
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened was I received some</v>

337
00:13:46.371 --> 00:13:49.820
<v Speaker 2>voice mail messages from about four kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then like,</v>

338
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the language was,</v>

339
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.160
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty strong.</v>

340
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.260
<v Speaker 2>It was like run a tar and feather your</v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

341
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to put a bowl in the back of</v>

342
00:13:55.881 --> 00:13:57.440
<v Speaker 2>your head that we did the Martin Luther</v>
<v Speaker 2>King.</v>

343
00:13:57.441 --> 00:13:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

344
00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Edward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edward Edward.</v>

345
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.600
<v Speaker 2>And you received these on your phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>On my cell phone?</v>

346
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to work in all over Connecticut.</v>

365
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:47.740

<v Speaker 1>I would drive from Boston into</v>

366
00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did like a lot of gigs in Hartford.</v>

367
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.270
<v Speaker 1>I did gigs</v>

368
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.350

<v Speaker 2>Shout out tomorrow and starling junior</v>

370
00:14:57.381 --> 00:15:01.280
<v Speaker 2>though</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a boxer that came out of</v>

371
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Hartford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big time boxer,</v>

372
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.150

<v Speaker 2>Marlin starling.</v>

373
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.690
<v Speaker 2>But when you were in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody started doing this prank call</v>

374
00:15:13.801 --> 00:15:16.240
<v Speaker 2>and shit on you and was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all in one night.</v>

375
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.480
<v Speaker 2>It was all in one that was like four</v>
<v Speaker 2>voices tied to like a boyfriend or a</v>

376
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.990
<v Speaker 2>friend's house when I got the calls and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like put aside like it was a</v>

377
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.020
<v Speaker 2>blocked number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

378
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 2>I think anything of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like what I listened to it like</v>

379
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.390
<v Speaker 2>it was like some pretty horrific stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I definitely cried,</v>

380
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:34.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 17 years old.</v>

381
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the next day at school I took</v>

382
00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:39.470
<v Speaker 2>this philosophy class and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the topic was.</v>

383
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what prompted me to raise</v>
<v Speaker 2>my hand and like introduce what happened</v>

384
00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:45.260
<v Speaker 2>last night as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

385
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.270

<v Speaker 2>maybe I just needed to get off my chest.</v>

386
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.580
<v Speaker 2>But like the teacher like spazzed out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and was like,</v>

387
00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:51.500
<v Speaker 2>get up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to the principal's office,</v>

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:52.521
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

389
00:15:52.521 --> 00:15:55.220

<v Speaker 2>He brings me into the office,</v>

390
00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:57.320
<v Speaker 2>the principal like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freaked out.</v>

391
00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Like she just like the language was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

392
00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:00.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was shocking,</v>

393
00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:01.320
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

394
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.050
<v Speaker 2>and then she called like the resource</v>
<v Speaker 2>officer and then like the next period of</v>

395
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.440
<v Speaker 2>my life was like a blackout because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned out that three of the kids I had</v>

396
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:12.170
<v Speaker 2>never even met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this was like maybe some kids that</v>

397
00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:15.290
<v Speaker 2>had their first beer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the kids I was like friends with,</v>

398
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.860
<v Speaker 2>but we were arguing because he was upset</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was spending so much time with my</v>

399
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.380
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know he's gay.</v>

400
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Like he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

401
00:16:22.251 --> 00:16:23.150
<v Speaker 2>he just was like Jelly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

402
00:16:23.151 --> 00:16:23.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

403
00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:25.190
<v Speaker 2>just like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saying album every day started</v>

404
00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:26.870
<v Speaker 2>hanging off my boyfriend was a stupid</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

405
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.490
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

406
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:33.080
<v Speaker 2>no I 100 percent from what I'm told.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

407
00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:34.401
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

408
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then petty.</v>

409
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.530
<v Speaker 2>And then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here are my three friends and they were</v>

410
00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:43.220
<v Speaker 2>all going to get drunk and call these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call this black girl and you know,</v>

411
00:16:43.221 --> 00:16:45.800
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to say awful things until like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

412
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.090
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have to look at a human</v>
<v Speaker 2>being like,</v>

413
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.050
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to say awful things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But unfortunately for me,</v>

414
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.770
<v Speaker 2>one of the people in the car happened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the current governor of Connecticut</v>

415
00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

416
00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:00.440
<v Speaker 2>So this turned from like some kids prank</v>
<v Speaker 2>called to like said some awful things to</v>

417
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.370
<v Speaker 2>like front page of the newspaper</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the entire state of</v>

418
00:17:04.371 --> 00:17:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit in New York Naacp outside</v>

419
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:09.340
<v Speaker 2>of my school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to.</v>

420
00:17:09.341 --> 00:17:12.110
<v Speaker 2>It was like this situation that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about outrage culture.</v>

421
00:17:12.111 --> 00:17:15.860
<v Speaker 2>My first like introduction to outrage</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and the things that sort of</v>

422
00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:19.310
<v Speaker 2>formed my thoughts like this was a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>formative experience in my life.</v>

423
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which to me it wasn't,</v>

424
00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.590
<v Speaker 2>it was nonpolitical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was like my life wasn't mine.</v>

425
00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I went from like sitting down</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching.</v>

426
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.500
<v Speaker 2>I was watching Talladega nights with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend to being the most discussed</v>

427
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.220
<v Speaker 2>person in the state of Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was interesting about it was</v>

428
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:36.350
<v Speaker 2>just that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was the governor of</v>

429
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut sign that was in this car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to get the FBI involved to</v>

430
00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:44.240
<v Speaker 2>determine the authenticity of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe she called herself instead of</v>

431
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:45.890
<v Speaker 2>just saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes it was my son,</v>

432
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.940
<v Speaker 2>he actually left the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigated for six weeks and waited</v>

433
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.450
<v Speaker 2>and to get arrested six weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

434
00:17:50.451 --> 00:17:53.330
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like his son denying this one,</v>

435
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.900
<v Speaker 2>see if they can get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is politics,</v>

436
00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:55.441
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

437
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:58.410
<v Speaker 2>can we get away with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it plausible for us to get away with</v>

438
00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:58.740
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

439
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so six weeks of the entire state.</v>

440
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left school.</v>

441
00:18:02.911 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 2>People were like fighting on my behalf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fighting.</v>

442
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

443
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.830
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

444
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was just like,</v>

445
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:17.790
<v Speaker 2>it was like a monstrosity of a situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was one of those things where</v>

446
00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:19.590
<v Speaker 2>like literally like letters to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>editor and be like,</v>

447
00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 2>mom's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about,</v>

448
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:21.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outrage culture,</v>

449
00:18:21.511 --> 00:18:23.520
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe candice,</v>

450
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.930
<v Speaker 2>this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl,</v>

451
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:27.900
<v Speaker 2>I believe she called herself like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm just looking for attention one</v>

452
00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:31.050
<v Speaker 2>night and I just decided to say I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to hang by family from a tree.</v>

453
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny that someone would even</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an opinion on that?</v>

454
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.833
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bizarre.</v>

455
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Speaker 2>Writes letters to the editor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I.</v>

456
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:39.780
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>retrospectively,</v>

457
00:18:39.781 --> 00:18:40.051
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

458
00:18:40.051 --> 00:18:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is what life is about,</v>

459
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to go to youtube.</v>

460
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 2>I still don't believe.</v>

461
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was the situation that was just</v>

462
00:18:53.911 --> 00:18:57.580
<v Speaker 2>completely out of my control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as quick as it had,</v>

463
00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.250
<v Speaker 2>these kids got arrested and then as</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick as it happened,</v>

464
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:00.520
<v Speaker 2>it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

465
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.030
<v Speaker 2>for like everyone but not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are these kids,</v>

466
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:03.923
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

467
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Speaker 2>so I never wanted these kids to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrested.</v>

468
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Like if no one look at this whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation was taken out of my hands.</v>

469
00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:10.680
<v Speaker 2>People thought I didn't go to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>police.</v>

470
00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Like my teacher went to the police.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turned into the zoo.</v>

471
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 2>These kids were labeled publicly</v>
<v Speaker 2>racists,</v>

472
00:19:15.661 --> 00:19:17.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The youngest kid in the car,</v>

473
00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:19.860
<v Speaker 2>it was 14.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not comfortable with every labeling,</v>

474
00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:21.150
<v Speaker 2>a 14 year old racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

475
00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:24.810
<v Speaker 2>or any of these kids racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are kids and in my opinion,</v>

476
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.650
<v Speaker 2>adults that failed to act like adults</v>
<v Speaker 2>and adults that fail to take a step back</v>

477
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:29.520
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

478
00:19:29.521 --> 00:19:31.800
<v Speaker 2>why would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would prompt these kids do this?</v>

479
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.750
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so easy to be mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

480
00:19:33.751 --> 00:19:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so easy nowadays for children</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be mean?</v>

481
00:19:36.811 --> 00:19:39.210
<v Speaker 2>And no one to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I really thought about that,</v>

482
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I went through like five years of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>anorexia because of the situation</v>

483
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.540
<v Speaker 2>and I was the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

484
00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.990
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went through Lexia,</v>

485
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.320
<v Speaker 2>which is so weird now because like</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that know me now,</v>

486
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.730
<v Speaker 2>like there's no way you never didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>

487
00:19:53.731 --> 00:19:57.090
<v Speaker 2>But I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did like did not eat for like five</v>

488
00:19:57.091 --> 00:20:00.370
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had issues with Anorexia because I</v>

489
00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.820
<v Speaker 2>actually has a disease that genuinely is</v>
<v Speaker 2>about control.</v>

490
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.710
<v Speaker 2>It's about a certain control of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

491
00:20:04.711 --> 00:20:07.720
<v Speaker 2>And I felt that I had my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my life was fine and then like</v>

492
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.350
<v Speaker 2>people took the narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

493
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.180
<v Speaker 2>and I could decide to determine what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative was.</v>

494
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.110
<v Speaker 2>You're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

495
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.950
<v Speaker 2>you're a victim or maybe you're a liar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

496
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.480
<v Speaker 2>these kids are racists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kids are this,</v>

497
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.750
<v Speaker 2>and just nobody really thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you actually ruined all of our</v>

498
00:20:21.751 --> 00:20:22.080
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

499
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.000
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for a little bit like these kids</v>

500
00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:28.680
<v Speaker 2>went on to have duis and get arrested</v>
<v Speaker 2>and got into drugs and it was because it</v>

501
00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:31.830
<v Speaker 2>was outraged of everything that happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

502
00:20:31.831 --> 00:20:33.870
<v Speaker 2>would have been totally cool with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>apology.</v>

503
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

504
00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

505
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Good for you for looking at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hard to do because everybody</v>

506
00:20:41.191 --> 00:20:44.100
<v Speaker 2>loves when they are allowed to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>outraged.</v>

507
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Everybody loves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get outraged.</v>

508
00:20:45.241 --> 00:20:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Obviously what they did do was horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think a lot of kids,</v>

509
00:20:48.611 --> 00:20:51.520
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even understand how stupid</v>

510
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:54.550
<v Speaker 2>and gross it is what they do and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just know they can do it and they get a</v>

511
00:20:54.551 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 2>thrill out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's that mob mentality when</v>

512
00:20:57.491 --> 00:20:59.650
<v Speaker 2>there's like a bunch of people together</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the same thing,</v>

513
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.000
<v Speaker 2>wrap it up and start saying crazy shit.</v>

514
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.810
<v Speaker 2>Understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about it as a human being</v>

515
00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:07.210
<v Speaker 2>and not as somebody who to ab opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ear,</v>

516
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:07.661
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

517
00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:08.950
<v Speaker 2>we're going to call this black girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

518
00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 2>You've got a bunch of kids were going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say mean things to her on the phone and</v>

519
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:14.450
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to look her in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

520
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like if I hold up this pen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike just say mean stuff like</v>

521
00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:21.250
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say anything to this pen.</v>

522
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.490
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of um,</v>

523
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.350
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a formative experience that in</v>

524
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:29.700
<v Speaker 2>retrospect I understand has so much to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with why I am who I am because I</v>

525
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.320
<v Speaker 2>hated that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that label obsessed culture and the</v>

526
00:21:32.321 --> 00:21:33.820
<v Speaker 2>outrage machine and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

527
00:21:33.821 --> 00:21:34.480
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're done.</v>

528
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.290
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

529
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.120
<v Speaker 2>forget the people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose lives we just like.</v>

530
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.640
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know those people anymore?</v>

531
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

532
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.300
<v Speaker 2>I know like the siblings of them because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was friends.</v>

533
00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:44.800
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the people that was</v>

534
00:21:44.801 --> 00:21:46.660
<v Speaker 2>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very good friends with his brother</v>

535
00:21:46.661 --> 00:21:48.290
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to tell me this kid,</v>

536
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.650
<v Speaker 2>like a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I actually knew the kid's mother,</v>

537
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nobody cared.</v>

538
00:21:52.361 --> 00:21:55.600
<v Speaker 2>It was just hot story necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>

539
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.450
<v Speaker 2>They were just stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>

540
00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:01.750
<v Speaker 2>did something stupid and they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a way that they could scare</v>

541
00:22:01.751 --> 00:22:02.190
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

542
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.530
<v Speaker 2>That they could and they might fit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

543
00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.460
<v Speaker 2>like drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was their first beer.</v>

544
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people can do well.</v>

545
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.900
<v Speaker 2>The youngest was 14,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the youngest and this person was labeled</v>

546
00:22:13.901 --> 00:22:15.910
<v Speaker 2>a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's to me is like,</v>

547
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.490
<v Speaker 2>that's harsh on people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

548
00:22:18.491 --> 00:22:20.920
<v Speaker 2>you're too forgiving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not labeled them a racist because</v>

549
00:22:20.921 --> 00:22:22.870
<v Speaker 2>what they said was most certainly</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>

550
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The words are racist.</v>

551
00:22:24.521 --> 00:22:25.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can somebody,</v>

552
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the question is can somebody say</v>

553
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:30.580
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say a word that is racist and not be a</v>

554
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:31.990
<v Speaker 2>racist human being?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

555
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.940
<v Speaker 2>I think now I'm going to tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

556
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody stand up,</v>

557
00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:37.450
<v Speaker 2>I was watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually don't remember who it was.</v>

558
00:22:37.451 --> 00:22:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe it was Louis Ck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

559
00:22:39.581 --> 00:22:44.200
<v Speaker 2>but he was saying how he like instantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>turns into a racist,</v>

560
00:22:44.201 --> 00:22:46.420
<v Speaker 2>like if somebody cuts him off and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Chinese person,</v>

561
00:22:46.421 --> 00:22:48.100
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like instantly the first thing he has</v>

562
00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.620
<v Speaker 2>something to do with him being Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

563
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.990
<v Speaker 2>And there's a little bit of that in all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of us.</v>

564
00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Like I was walking through New York City</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other day and I'm like a huge bus</v>

565
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.590
<v Speaker 2>just happen to like stop in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like literally 45 agents got up and</v>

566
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:04.530
<v Speaker 2>suddenly I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't walk around.</v>

567
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.321
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

568
00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:07.360
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do Asians always travel in packs?</v>

569
00:23:07.361 --> 00:23:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the most bizarre thing,</v>

570
00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:11.740
<v Speaker 2>like I don't have an issue with them or</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a bus and traveling.</v>

571
00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:13.480
<v Speaker 2>And then afterwards I giggled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

572
00:23:13.481 --> 00:23:14.620
<v Speaker 2>what a stupid thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

573
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.670
<v Speaker 2>stupid thoughts even had to have because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm frustrated in the moment that I</v>

574
00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:20.620
<v Speaker 2>can't like get my bearings in New York</v>
<v Speaker 2>City.</v>

575
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yes,</v>

576
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I think that people in a moment of</v>
<v Speaker 2>frustration of anger,</v>

577
00:23:26.231 --> 00:23:28.210
<v Speaker 2>if you add alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you add Ambien,</v>

578
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>are coming from a place of upset and</v>

580
00:23:32.091 --> 00:23:37.060
<v Speaker 2>they can just do something that's stupid</v>
<v Speaker 2>without holding this like whole word for</v>

581
00:23:37.061 --> 00:23:40.000
<v Speaker 2>the rest of their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your 14 year racist and forever you are</v>

582
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.060
<v Speaker 2>raised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's march.</v>

583
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So especially today.</v>

584
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants</v>

585
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.030
<v Speaker 3>anybody to recover from anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

586
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.460
<v Speaker 3>They want to know that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dead.</v>

587
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.160
<v Speaker 3>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your career is done.</v>

588
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:56.000
<v Speaker 3>Your life is over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said the wrong thing.</v>

589
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Done the wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously there's some reasons</v>

590
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.760
<v Speaker 3>for some people to be like Harvey</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weinstein's.</v>

591
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:03.710
<v Speaker 3>Perfect example of that guy should be in</v>
<v Speaker 3>jail.</v>

592
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.610
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure this is a rapist.</v>

593
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is great.</v>

594
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Police alleged rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What for sure.</v>

595
00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:12.710
<v Speaker 3>He's done a lot of horrible shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

596
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 3>But then there's people that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

597
00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:19.060
<v Speaker 3>what did Samantha Bee say today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She called up Ivanka con.</v>

598
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens there.</v>

599
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:23.430
<v Speaker 3>Thinks he gets in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet she doesn't.</v>

600
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:26.330
<v Speaker 3>She's not going to get into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she doesn't because she left wing.</v>

601
00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 3>She's left wing overmanned space to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

602
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming some of this shit that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keith Olbermann job at espn.</v>

603
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:33.980

<v Speaker 3>they don't care.</v>

604

<v Speaker 3>There are fucking so many tweets that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>put out that are crazy called trump a</v>

<v Speaker 2>conservatives.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Ben Carson was literally called a porch</v>

<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

610
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.133
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>

611
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.770
<v Speaker 3>who created this system?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is it that did it though?</v>

612
00:24:54.771 --> 00:24:56.960
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like a famous person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a famous person.</v>

613
00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.410
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely called monkey black person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black Person.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's like if I call a Guy Guinea but</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's porch monkey is not.</v>

615
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't care who it's coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

616
00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:08.421
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

617
00:25:08.421 --> 00:25:11.940
<v Speaker 3>but black people are allowed to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist shit to other black people.</v>

618
00:25:11.941 --> 00:25:13.460
<v Speaker 3>Which racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

619
00:25:13.461 --> 00:25:15.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of it's okay if the uncle toms and</v>

620
00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:20.000
<v Speaker 3>we go weird stuff that we have laws or</v>
<v Speaker 3>rules culturally and I don't like those</v>

621
00:25:20.001 --> 00:25:21.410
<v Speaker 3>laws and rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I pushed back.</v>

622
00:25:21.411 --> 00:25:22.244
<v Speaker 3>I hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

623
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.550
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely hypocritical.</v>

624
00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.880
<v Speaker 3>Like someone was saying that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tweet that I retweeted today,</v>

625
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:33.350
<v Speaker 3>that smallville girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that smallville show is still on the air</v>

626
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.910
<v Speaker 3>and that girl is apparently she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's admitted to sex trafficking and</v>

627
00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:42.440
<v Speaker 3>that some of it was her idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read the smallville still on the air</v>

628
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:45.160
<v Speaker 3>and they're pulling Roseanne from Hulu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

629
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Roseanne swear she did not know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>lady was black.</v>

630
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.790
<v Speaker 3>She swears she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she doesn't,</v>

631
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.570
<v Speaker 3>she doesn't look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't allison mack's as branding</v>

632
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.780
<v Speaker 3>the sex slaves was her idea branding</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

633
00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:00.440
<v Speaker 3>Allison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's means like burning a logo into</v>

634
00:26:00.441 --> 00:26:01.820
<v Speaker 3>their bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

635
00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.940
<v Speaker 3>What is wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about that story.</v>

636
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Put that bitch must be off the charts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy.</v>

637
00:26:08.301 --> 00:26:09.134
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

638
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.710
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only accepted.</v>

639
00:26:10.711 --> 00:26:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have any ties whatsoever to</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative thought like if you have</v>

640
00:26:15.481 --> 00:26:17.940
<v Speaker 2>even liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liked a tweet that trump sent out,</v>

641
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.860
<v Speaker 2>like forget about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about it.</v>

642
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.450
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not even conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have conservative people or talk</v>

643
00:26:23.451 --> 00:26:26.700
<v Speaker 3>to and people call me all right and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this crazy shit.</v>

644
00:26:26.701 --> 00:26:29.110
<v Speaker 3>They're just looking to silence and</v>
<v Speaker 3>labor.</v>

645
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're obsessed with labels and I hate</v>

646
00:26:31.841 --> 00:26:33.280
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate the idea that you can't say</v>

647
00:26:33.281 --> 00:26:37.150
<v Speaker 2>something like they were literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everyone piled in every celebrity</v>

648
00:26:37.151 --> 00:26:39.520
<v Speaker 2>on the sun piled in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I tweeted a couple of weeks ago</v>

649
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.160
<v Speaker 2>that I was having a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw this,</v>

650
00:26:42.161 --> 00:26:43.860
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was having a at lunch</v>

651
00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 4>because I've just been observing Chelsea</v>
<v Speaker 4>handler.</v>

652
00:26:46.621 --> 00:26:49.530
<v Speaker 4>I just think she's weird person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know what happened because</v>

653
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.570
<v Speaker 4>I used to really like her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>

654
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.230
<v Speaker 4>10 years ago when you were liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

655
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like when she was,</v>

656
00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:58.080
<v Speaker 4>had her show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she was not politically correct.</v>

657
00:26:58.081 --> 00:27:00.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't know if anybody remembers</v>
<v Speaker 4>the show Chelsea lately,</v>

658
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.050
<v Speaker 4>but she was making fun of everybody and</v>
<v Speaker 4>now with the era of trump,</v>

659
00:27:04.051 --> 00:27:05.790
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something's weird.</v>

660
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.750
<v Speaker 4>She's getting older and I think she</v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to be an activist now and I think</v>

661
00:27:09.751 --> 00:27:12.720
<v Speaker 4>she's looking for more meaning and</v>
<v Speaker 4>importance because she doesn't have a</v>

662
00:27:12.721 --> 00:27:15.550
<v Speaker 4>family or children and I tweaked that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

663
00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.270
<v Speaker 4>you tweeted this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tweet it.</v>

664
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.720
<v Speaker 4>But it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

665
00:27:20.721 --> 00:27:22.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking to like a friend at lunch.</v>

666
00:27:22.711 --> 00:27:27.420
<v Speaker 4>I was and we were talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why some of these like older woman I</v>

667
00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:30.300
<v Speaker 4>have just gone bonkers and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend made a comment.</v>

668
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.280
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't like use your eggs,</v>

669
00:27:32.281 --> 00:27:33.410
<v Speaker 4>they scramble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just saying</v>

670
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:36.930
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend said,</v>

671
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 4>well I didn't even tweet that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't tweet that.</v>

672
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.830
<v Speaker 4>You're French.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put that shit on TV show.</v>

673
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:42.730
<v Speaker 4>It's really funny if we don't use your</v>
<v Speaker 4>eggs scrambled.</v>

674
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.270
<v Speaker 4>So I was like cracking up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's a but there's something</v>

675
00:27:45.271 --> 00:27:46.970
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something there.</v>

676
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.340
<v Speaker 4>It's not politically correct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I observed the pattern of Kathy</v>

677
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.530
<v Speaker 4>Griffin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I observe the pattern of Chelsea handler</v>

678
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.860
<v Speaker 4>and Sarah Silverman on the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not as bad but in that neighborhood.</v>

679
00:27:55.861 --> 00:27:57.450
<v Speaker 4>So I tweet out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think there's something</v>

680
00:27:57.451 --> 00:28:00.330
<v Speaker 4>associated like between like woman who</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have children and they need</v>

681
00:28:00.331 --> 00:28:04.320
<v Speaker 4>something to nurture and foster and try</v>
<v Speaker 4>to raise and in this sense it's society.</v>

682
00:28:04.321 --> 00:28:07.170
<v Speaker 4>Like they are just trying to parent the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hell out of society.</v>

683
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Speaker 4>And I think Sarah does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sarah goes back and forth.</v>

684
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.040
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>

685
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.300
<v Speaker 4>she's a kind person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's something like once in a</v>

686
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:16.021
<v Speaker 4>wash,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like,</v>

687
00:28:16.021 --> 00:28:18.270
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I did actually go back when I said,</v>

688
00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:19.104
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sarah,</v>

689
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.500
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't put you in the same category</v>
<v Speaker 4>as Kathy and Chelsea,</v>

690
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.390
<v Speaker 4>but it's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like obsessed with like</v>

691
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:29.910
<v Speaker 4>everything and they're completely wrong</v>
<v Speaker 4>and educated about everything and yet</v>

692
00:28:29.911 --> 00:28:31.590

<v Speaker 4>chunked up or delete the three now.</v>

699
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.110
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said like,</v>

700
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.840
<v Speaker 4>this is literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I tweet,</v>

701
00:28:48.841 --> 00:28:50.370
<v Speaker 4>this has nothing to do with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anybody.</v>

702
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:54.300
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the girl who supports trump and</v>

703
00:28:54.301 --> 00:28:56.580
<v Speaker 4>works for turning point USA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which loves trump.</v>

704
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what were the weirdest,</v>

705
00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.400
<v Speaker 4>like logical jump ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>

706
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.440
<v Speaker 4>And I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

707
00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.280
<v Speaker 4>Jake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jake,</v>

708
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.410
<v Speaker 4>stop yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

709
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.400
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in the end everyone was just like,</v>

710
00:29:05.401 --> 00:29:06.570
<v Speaker 4>delete the two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was just like,</v>

711
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.580
<v Speaker 4>how about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was the actual wording of the</v>

712
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:10.950
<v Speaker 4>tweet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think my exact words were at lunch</v>

713
00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:15.951
<v Speaker 4>with a friend talking about like how</v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre Chelsea Handler Kathy Griffin</v>

714
00:29:16.351 --> 00:29:17.610
<v Speaker 4>and Sarah Silverman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Sarah something.</v>

715
00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.670
<v Speaker 4>I just tweeted something like pro</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] and it was like the whole</v>

716
00:29:20.671 --> 00:29:22.020
<v Speaker 4>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was bizarre,</v>

717
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:24.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and how crazy they've gotten.</v>

718
00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.060
<v Speaker 4>And then I just said like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think that something really</v>

719
00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:29.190
<v Speaker 4>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Swimming if they don't have children.</v>

720
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.740
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a question question.</v>

721
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.920
<v Speaker 4>Such a hot spots or you're going after a</v>
<v Speaker 4>soft spot on.</v>

722
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

723
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:39.930
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

724
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 4>Sarah Huckabee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sanders</v>

725
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.270
<v Speaker 3>going to lose her job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

726
00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.890
<v Speaker 3>She can say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to say anything that's Sarah.</v>

727
00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.980
<v Speaker 3>There's anything to anybody to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

728
00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:52.330
<v Speaker 3>Anybody that supports trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

729
00:29:52.331 --> 00:29:55.360
<v Speaker 3>But then like these women who literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>go after these people,</v>

730
00:29:55.361 --> 00:30:00.310
<v Speaker 3>like the amount of vitriol that Chelsea</v>
<v Speaker 3>handler has thrown to Ivanka to every</v>

731
00:30:00.311 --> 00:30:02.440
<v Speaker 3>single woman in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chrissy teagan's also like a net.</v>

732
00:30:02.441 --> 00:30:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Like she just like angry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

733
00:30:03.791 --> 00:30:04.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like hate,</v>

734
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:05.734
<v Speaker 3>hate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hate.</v>

735
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.220
<v Speaker 3>And then like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing about them and like they were</v>

736
00:30:08.221 --> 00:30:10.240
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could you even question,</v>

737
00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.930
<v Speaker 3>how could you even ask a question if</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because they don't have kids?</v>

738
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.190
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you guys are so outraged</v>

739
00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 3>makes me sort of think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

740
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit.</v>

741
00:30:20.171 --> 00:30:22.840
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't delete the tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you didn't have any point at all,</v>

742
00:30:22.841 --> 00:30:25.030
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't work in that way.</v>

743
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.330
<v Speaker 3>Just like a stupid</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

744
00:30:28.331 --> 00:30:29.440
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't know what the fuck she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>

745
00:30:29.441 --> 00:30:30.520
<v Speaker 3>And I tweeted that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

746
00:30:30.521 --> 00:30:33.010
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be something here because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys are all losing your minds.</v>

747
00:30:33.011 --> 00:30:35.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so Sarah Silverman responded.</v>

748
00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:37.150
<v Speaker 3>Kathy Griffin was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went nuts.</v>

749
00:30:37.151 --> 00:30:39.980
<v Speaker 3>This was like a full on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Kathy Griffin is so happy someone's</v>

750
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:43.480
<v Speaker 3>talking about her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's busy and they'd gotten</v>

751
00:30:43.481 --> 00:30:46.840
<v Speaker 3>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at one point these people to me were</v>

752
00:30:46.841 --> 00:30:49.090
<v Speaker 3>funny and something sort of just</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

753
00:30:49.091 --> 00:30:53.200
<v Speaker 3>And like trump is the means like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever they're going through in life,</v>

754
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.950
<v Speaker 3>the outlet is trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And anybody that likes trump will people</v>

755
00:30:56.951 --> 00:30:58.440
<v Speaker 3>think there's a cultural war going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

756
00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:03.100
<v Speaker 3>Most certainly is areas for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they feel like they're on a side and</v>

757
00:31:03.101 --> 00:31:03.934
<v Speaker 3>they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

758
00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:07.570
<v Speaker 3>they're going to lob grenades during the</v>
<v Speaker 3>war and it gives people,</v>

759
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.900
<v Speaker 3>it also gives people a sense of purpose</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that engaging in these twitter</v>

760
00:31:10.901 --> 00:31:14.980
<v Speaker 3>fights somehow or another is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>reinforcing good behavior and shutting</v>

761
00:31:14.981 --> 00:31:18.610
<v Speaker 3>down the bad behavior and don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily believe that I,</v>

762
00:31:18.611 --> 00:31:20.950
<v Speaker 3>even if I don't agree with someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>online,</v>

763
00:31:20.951 --> 00:31:23.320
<v Speaker 3>I very rarely tweet about them.</v>

764
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

765
00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:29.110
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I try at this stage in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life to avoid conflict as much as</v>

766
00:31:29.111 --> 00:31:31.960
<v Speaker 3>possible unless it comes to writing</v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes.</v>

767
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.960
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people gotta get you gotta take the</v>

768
00:31:34.961 --> 00:31:35.950
<v Speaker 3>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

769
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:37.900
<v Speaker 3>And usually when I go after someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

770
00:31:37.901 --> 00:31:39.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not at that phase in my life</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's all peace.</v>

771
00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm definitely a person that'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>just say something,</v>

772
00:31:42.041 --> 00:31:45.550
<v Speaker 3>but usually it's just in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I thought,</v>

773
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not as thoughtful like,</v>

774
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.030
<v Speaker 3>and people were like back down or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>

775
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.870
<v Speaker 3>like this morning or yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Ben Shapiro and I got into a little</v>

776
00:31:52.871 --> 00:31:57.871
<v Speaker 3>spat and we actually like each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like I genuinely annoyed by his</v>

777
00:31:57.881 --> 00:31:59.770
<v Speaker 3>behavior online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's genuinely,</v>

778
00:31:59.771 --> 00:32:00.990
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just find them to be like,</v>

779
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:02.263
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by.</v>

780
00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:03.670
<v Speaker 3>I like him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the thing that's bizarre.</v>

781
00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:06.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like I think people think there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more like hate between us and there</v>

782
00:32:06.281 --> 00:32:06.941
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like not,</v>

783
00:32:06.941 --> 00:32:08.800
<v Speaker 3>it's just like genuinely like I read a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweet sound like dude,</v>

784
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.420
<v Speaker 3>shut up when I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did he say?</v>

785
00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.990
<v Speaker 3>Just little petty things that he throws</v>
<v Speaker 3>that trump's sometime that are so</v>

786
00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:14.824
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary.</v>

787
00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:18.530
<v Speaker 3>It's not even trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he,</v>

788
00:32:18.531 --> 00:32:21.190
<v Speaker 3>like Kim Kardashian goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

789
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.340
<v Speaker 3>get Alice Marie Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's been fighting for this for years.</v>

790
00:32:24.341 --> 00:32:28.530
<v Speaker 3>She put all of her money into a legal</v>
<v Speaker 3>team to do this and that's not the only</v>

791
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.430
<v Speaker 3>case she's been working on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like actually trying to help these</v>

792
00:32:30.431 --> 00:32:33.460
<v Speaker 3>people get clemency and she takes a</v>
<v Speaker 3>picture and he's like,</v>

793
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.130
<v Speaker 3>he says something just very Ben Shapiro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

794
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:38.380
<v Speaker 3>we should not be worshiping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slept like that.</v>

795
00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully he's worshiping as we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking a meeting</v>

796
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:41.540
<v Speaker 4>with convention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not worshiping a celebrity.</v>

797
00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:44.090
<v Speaker 4>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a little extreme of an analysis</v>

798
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.600
<v Speaker 4>for a meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the picture is taken,</v>

799
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.900
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

800
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.200
<v Speaker 4>I've visited the president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a full time photographer and</v>

801
00:32:49.201 --> 00:32:51.460
<v Speaker 4>every person that to the president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a picture of the,</v>

802
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:53.540
<v Speaker 4>in the Oval Office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a part of the system.</v>

803
00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:55.580
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yeah,</v>

804
00:32:55.581 --> 00:32:56.570
<v Speaker 4>so I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

805
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:57.620
<v Speaker 4>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

806
00:32:57.621 --> 00:32:58.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I didn't say shut up.</v>

807
00:32:58.761 --> 00:32:59.594
<v Speaker 4>I said like,</v>

808
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.930
<v Speaker 3>she's got a good point in a way we</v>
<v Speaker 3>really shouldn't be worshiping celebrity</v>

809
00:33:04.931 --> 00:33:08.750
<v Speaker 3>for the sake of celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially reality show celebrity.</v>

810
00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean that she couldn't have a</v>

811
00:33:10.271 --> 00:33:12.910
<v Speaker 3>very valid point about prison reform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

812
00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.310
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>

813
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:16.110
<v Speaker 4>She wasn't he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he said something like,</v>

814
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.630
<v Speaker 4>we shouldn't allow celebrities to shape</v>
<v Speaker 4>policy.</v>

815
00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:22.440
<v Speaker 4>She wouldn't go there shape policy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She literally had a case that she's been</v>

816
00:33:22.441 --> 00:33:23.221
<v Speaker 4>trying to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pardon me?</v>

817
00:33:23.221 --> 00:33:26.370
<v Speaker 4>The only person that can do that happens</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be President Donald Trump.</v>

818
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:27.870
<v Speaker 3>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

819
00:33:27.871 --> 00:33:29.660
<v Speaker 3>what she's trying to do is actually very</v>
<v Speaker 3>honored.</v>

820
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:31.040
<v Speaker 4>That's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

821
00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:31.880
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she.</v>

822
00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.940
<v Speaker 4>And she's been working on it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

823
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 4>she's actually into this now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she's into this prison reform and</v>

824
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:38.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm passionate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I grew up seeing my uncle's in</v>

825
00:33:38.481 --> 00:33:39.770
<v Speaker 4>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like for me,</v>

826
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:42.350
<v Speaker 4>the only time that I like snap back at</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone is if it's something that I care</v>

827
00:33:42.351 --> 00:33:43.021
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously.</v>

828
00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really am passionate about black</v>

829
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:46.160
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really passionate about the changes</v>

830
00:33:46.161 --> 00:33:48.950
<v Speaker 4>that can happen for black America and</v>
<v Speaker 4>prison reform or something I'm really</v>

831
00:33:48.951 --> 00:33:51.890
<v Speaker 4>passionate about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I've been observing like how hard</v>

832
00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:53.300
<v Speaker 4>yard at and working on this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hardly,</v>

833
00:33:53.301 --> 00:33:56.660
<v Speaker 4>Blanca has been working on this and have</v>
<v Speaker 4>really understood what they're trying to</v>

834
00:33:56.661 --> 00:33:57.051
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

835
00:33:57.051 --> 00:33:59.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to the prison reform summit a</v>

836
00:33:59.421 --> 00:34:02.450
<v Speaker 4>couple like a month ago and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Kim in this,</v>

837
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.790
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't even like agree with trump</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a lot of stuff.</v>

838
00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:08.480
<v Speaker 4>She's thrown some shade at him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is something is Alison Marie</v>

839
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.980
<v Speaker 4>Johnson case she was doing before trump</v>
<v Speaker 4>got into office.</v>

840
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.650
<v Speaker 3>What I love about the picture of her and</v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

841
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:13.450
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the fuck over here?</v>

842
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.170
<v Speaker 3>I was taking a picture with Donald.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be hugging.</v>

843
00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.160
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ha ha.</v>

844
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.060
<v Speaker 3>But she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she cares about the case.</v>

845
00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:24.220
<v Speaker 3>But look how far away she is from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at it.</v>

846
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.130
<v Speaker 3>I will say two of them</v>

847
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.010
<v Speaker 4>I will say is awkward though because his</v>
<v Speaker 4>desk is a lot lower than you than you</v>

848
00:34:32.011 --> 00:34:34.200
<v Speaker 4>realize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's actually a little closer to like</v>

849
00:34:34.201 --> 00:34:37.540
<v Speaker 4>stand up straight like she's standing or</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Ben,</v>

850
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.160
<v Speaker 4>I bent when I was in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is also kind of weird too.</v>

851
00:34:41.161 --> 00:34:43.950
<v Speaker 4>So it's like you see people who either</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this or they're like this and</v>

852
00:34:43.951 --> 00:34:44.740
<v Speaker 4>there's no in between.</v>

853
00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.820
<v Speaker 3>We could do like 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moviestar picture like this.</v>

854
00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.010
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should.</v>

855
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what I should've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she's closer than I thought she was.</v>

856
00:34:53.521 --> 00:34:56.130
<v Speaker 3>I felt like maybe I put it in my own</v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

857
00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.100
<v Speaker 3>It's actually pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn good right there.</v>

858
00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.880
<v Speaker 3>She's gorgeous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't look anything like she</v>

859
00:34:59.881 --> 00:35:01.090
<v Speaker 3>used to look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

860
00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.360
<v Speaker 3>whoever did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody does.</v>

861
00:35:03.361 --> 00:35:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Nowadays Mr. Surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did some awesome work.</v>

862
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.840
<v Speaker 3>She's plump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks good.</v>

863
00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:11.940
<v Speaker 3>But I guess the question is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrity.</v>

864
00:35:11.941 --> 00:35:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Do a good act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

865
00:35:13.351 --> 00:35:14.184
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

866
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.060
<v Speaker 3>Of course the answer is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

867
00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:17.910
<v Speaker 3>that's what Chelsea handler's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

868
00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:19.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like she's donating,</v>

869
00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:23.130
<v Speaker 3>but she really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She donated a million dollars to Puerto</v>

870
00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:23.360
<v Speaker 3>Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

871
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.540
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is good.</v>

872
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

873
00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.510
<v Speaker 3>That should be celebrated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what she's trying to do with all</v>

874
00:35:27.511 --> 00:35:29.580
<v Speaker 3>of her money now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't even give a fuck about like,</v>

875
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:31.580
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is good.</v>

876
00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:31.630
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

877
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.460
<v Speaker 4>All of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when they do stuff like that,</v>

878
00:35:33.461 --> 00:35:35.980
<v Speaker 4>it's great and it's honorable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like the stuff that I hate that</v>

879
00:35:35.981 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 4>celebrities do and what I wish I</v>
<v Speaker 4>differentiate</v>

880
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.890
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I guess this confuses people is when</v>

881
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:43.710
<v Speaker 3>they just give their opinion like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

882
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.920
<v Speaker 3>at like the emmys and they're onstage</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like teaching all of us about how</v>

883
00:35:46.921 --> 00:35:49.620
<v Speaker 3>wrong our opinions are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I don't need the celebrity</v>

884
00:35:49.621 --> 00:35:51.340
<v Speaker 3>grandstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

885
00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.000
<v Speaker 3>if there's an issue you care about other</v>
<v Speaker 3>than the fact that people disagree with</v>

886
00:35:54.001 --> 00:35:55.320
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then sure do.</v>

887
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:56.820
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you care about like Ashton Kutcher</v>

888
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:58.680
<v Speaker 3>going after sex trafficking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrate that.</v>

889
00:35:58.681 --> 00:36:01.940
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Kim Kardashian going over after a</v>

890
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.300
<v Speaker 3>crime justice reform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Celebrate that.</v>

891
00:36:03.301 --> 00:36:05.700
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you get these celebrities that</v>

892
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 3>just get up there and try to deliver a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tier two,</v>

893
00:36:07.771 --> 00:36:10.740
<v Speaker 3>it's like shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally nobody cares what you think</v>

894
00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.410
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the care enough that that person's</v>

895
00:36:13.411 --> 00:36:17.160
<v Speaker 3>got that platform and they feel like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is their opportunity to say</v>

896
00:36:17.161 --> 00:36:19.600
<v Speaker 3>something significant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at this girl also like</v>

897
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 3>thinking they're for sure 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtue signaling,</v>

898
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.000
<v Speaker 3>letting everybody know how moral and</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical they are.</v>

899
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.350
<v Speaker 3>Even if they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is just those fucking award</v>

900
00:36:31.351 --> 00:36:33.180
<v Speaker 3>shows or weird as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're weird.</v>

901
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.640
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should go up there and you should</v>

902
00:36:35.641 --> 00:36:39.910
<v Speaker 3>say thank you God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

903
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Thank you to the man upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

904
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Owed and you for number of the days when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to do that.</v>

905
00:36:45.541 --> 00:36:47.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to say a couple of names of</v>

906
00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 3>producers come up with a little piece of</v>
<v Speaker 3>paper and then they used to always think</v>

907
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:51.810
<v Speaker 3>the man upstairs and they used to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

908
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.330
<v Speaker 3>Now they have like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the face and the emotion,</v>

909
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started off.</v>

910
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.870
<v Speaker 3>Started this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marlin motherfucking Brando.</v>

911
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.930
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In between having sex with everyone.</v>

912
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.630
<v Speaker 3>Marlon Brando apparently fucked Richard</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pryor.</v>

913
00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:07.230
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucked a bunch of different people.</v>

914
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:07.771
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

915
00:37:07.771 --> 00:37:11.280
<v Speaker 3>I brought you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy was one Marvin Gaye.</v>

916
00:37:11.281 --> 00:37:13.560
<v Speaker 3>Am I making that up completely?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one was like,</v>

917
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.130
<v Speaker 3>it was sad.</v>

918
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.090
<v Speaker 3>It was Marvin Gaye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

919
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Pryor's wife admitted it,</v>

920
00:37:18.241 --> 00:37:20.020
<v Speaker 3>which to me is a huge prior fans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

921
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.510
<v Speaker 3>there was a spike through the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quincy said he would fuck anything in</v>

922
00:37:24.511 --> 00:37:25.350
<v Speaker 3>quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

923
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:27.180
<v Speaker 3>I bet it would be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard Pryor.</v>

924
00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>

925
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:31.150
<v Speaker 3>He's still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started this.</v>

926
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:36.380
<v Speaker 3>So he started this because when he won</v>
<v Speaker 3>the academy award for I wanna say it was</v>

927
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:40.950
<v Speaker 3>apocalypse now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a native American guy go on stage</v>

928
00:37:40.951 --> 00:37:43.860
<v Speaker 3>and take it to this place to highlight</v>
<v Speaker 3>the plight of native Americans.</v>

929
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.410
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was a different movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

930
00:37:46.411 --> 00:37:50.460
<v Speaker 3>it became as big political.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marlon Brando was crazy for the</v>

931
00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:51.870
<v Speaker 3>godfather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Godfather.</v>

932
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had this guy go up and accept the</v>

933
00:37:55.621 --> 00:37:58.440
<v Speaker 3>award in his place and give some speech</v>
<v Speaker 3>is woman.</v>

934
00:37:58.700 --> 00:37:59.533
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

935
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.070
<v Speaker 3>So then just became like a culture of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like trying to one up each other.</v>

936
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:05.010
<v Speaker 3>So that was going on really was him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know that that was a miracle.</v>

937
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.450
<v Speaker 3>It's unbearable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

938
00:38:06.451 --> 00:38:09.180
<v Speaker 3>it's just a little odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't stand it.</v>

939
00:38:09.181 --> 00:38:11.550
<v Speaker 3>It drives me insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's a huge difference.</v>

940
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.250
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean that I think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrities can't do good in the world.</v>

941
00:38:14.251 --> 00:38:19.251
<v Speaker 3>It's just that like the celebrity</v>
<v Speaker 3>grandstanding can use volume on this job</v>

942
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.390
<v Speaker 3>bearable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roger Moret looking all good.</v>

943
00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this won't hold on.</v>

944
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:23.603
<v Speaker 3>Go back to</v>

945
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.230
<v Speaker 5>modern Glendo the godfather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so now</v>

946
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:38.500
<v Speaker 5>my name's a little feather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>look at them.</v>

948
00:38:41.281 --> 00:38:42.990
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't say shit.</v>

949
00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Even back then nobody knew what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a</v>

950
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:51.730
<v Speaker 2>little feather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the president of the national native</v>

951
00:38:51.991 --> 00:38:54.560
<v Speaker 2>American affirmative image committee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's hot as fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and he has asked me to tell you in a</v>

953
00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.030
<v Speaker 2>very long speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I cannot share with you presently</v>

954
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:07.080
<v Speaker 2>because of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will be glad to share with the</v>

955
00:39:07.081 --> 00:39:12.081
<v Speaker 2>press afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>CanNot accept this very generous award</v>

956
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:20.630
<v Speaker 2>and the reasons for this being are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment of American Indians today by</v>

957
00:39:21.781 --> 00:39:25.140
<v Speaker 2>the film industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me,</v>

958
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:39.370
<v Speaker 2>and on television and movie reruns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also with recent happenings at</v>

959
00:39:40.671 --> 00:39:44.450
<v Speaker 2>wounded knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I beg at this time that I have not</v>

960
00:39:44.451 --> 00:39:49.451
<v Speaker 2>intruded upon this evening and that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>will in the future our hearts and our</v>

961
00:39:52.041 --> 00:39:54.410
<v Speaker 2>understandings will meet with love.</v>

962
00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.600
<v Speaker 3>Pause for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that what was going on?</v>

963
00:39:57.601 --> 00:39:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Just a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't it?</v>

964
00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:03.200
<v Speaker 3>The same place where a couple years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

965
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.530
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't wounded knee.</v>

966
00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:06.000
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Standing rock</v>

967
00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.850
<v Speaker 3>standing rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know that this is heavy head.</v>

968
00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.800
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where it all began.</v>

969
00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.700
<v Speaker 3>It's where I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>been trying to one up each other.</v>

970
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I might've made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she like one.</v>

971
00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.990
<v Speaker 3>She came in around the perfect time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

972
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:28.310
<v Speaker 3>NBC wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is our president tweeted it.</v>

973
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.930
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the not even pretending,</v>

974
00:40:30.931 --> 00:40:33.030
<v Speaker 3>which I appreciate now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not pretending to be the news</v>

975
00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:34.920
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're just like,</v>

976
00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.990
<v Speaker 3>we hate trump and we are the propaganda</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine that will tell you like twitter.</v>

977
00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.570
<v Speaker 3>It was just the NBC twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it said something like,</v>

978
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.990
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

979
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.130
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then everyone was out.</v>

980
00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.040
<v Speaker 3>There was like the opposite of outrage</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

981
00:40:50.041 --> 00:40:50.820
<v Speaker 3>which I don't even know what it is.</v>

982
00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:51.421
<v Speaker 3>It's like run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>run,</v>

983
00:40:51.421 --> 00:40:53.760
<v Speaker 3>run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to run because like speech</v>

984
00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:59.360
<v Speaker 3>secret and Dr Oz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like I can't take anything</v>

985
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.270
<v Speaker 3>seriously anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's things to be taken seriously.</v>

986
00:41:03.271 --> 00:41:06.740
<v Speaker 3>But celebrities probably on that list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard bureaus,</v>

987
00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:07.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

988
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:09.240
<v Speaker 3>Dot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well he's right about this.</v>

989
00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.080
<v Speaker 3>But he was trying to correlate like what</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kim did like with Alisha Marie Johnson</v>

990
00:41:13.081 --> 00:41:14.070
<v Speaker 3>with like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

991
00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:15.480
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like totally different.</v>

992
00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:17.430
<v Speaker 3>And just in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes she just gets a little</v>

993
00:41:17.431 --> 00:41:19.140
<v Speaker 3>like hall monitor for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

994
00:41:19.141 --> 00:41:20.200
<v Speaker 3>like it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

995
00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:23.880
<v Speaker 3>you can't help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was very snarky.</v>

996
00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:25.350
<v Speaker 3>I liked him a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like him too.</v>

997
00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.120
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like people we actually really get</v>

998
00:41:27.121 --> 00:41:29.000
<v Speaker 3>along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like the hall monitor,</v>

999
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:31.650
<v Speaker 3>I know these types of school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was in their classes,</v>

1000
00:41:31.651 --> 00:41:33.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're just like,</v>

1001
00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 3>like late</v>

1002
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.010
<v Speaker 4>to school or the last person you want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>see is like a hall monitor.</v>

1003
00:41:37.011 --> 00:41:40.910
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the idea that she would be late</v>

1004
00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:44.720
<v Speaker 4>writing you a pink slip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like Ben just gave me the pink</v>

1005
00:41:44.721 --> 00:41:46.620
<v Speaker 4>slip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do that.</v>

1006
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:47.510
<v Speaker 4>Just give it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ben.</v>

1007
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.620
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like right.</v>

1008
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:51.330
<v Speaker 4>This is a gateway to Saturday school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just like,</v>

1009
00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:56.900
<v Speaker 4>it's so bad</v>
<v Speaker 4>he saying sometimes.</v>

1010
00:41:56.901 --> 00:41:57.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do that.</v>

1011
00:41:57.821 --> 00:41:59.450
<v Speaker 4>A lot of you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you do that?</v>

1012
00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:01.010
<v Speaker 4>Can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's doing it sober.</v>

1013
00:42:01.011 --> 00:42:03.710
<v Speaker 4>He's not like some dudes who do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all adderall dot.</v>

1014
00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.013
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does that.</v>

1015
00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.840
<v Speaker 4>But I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked these kids in school.</v>

1016
00:42:08.841 --> 00:42:09.621
<v Speaker 4>I'd just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1017
00:42:09.621 --> 00:42:12.590
<v Speaker 4>I was just the kid that was just like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kinda like more chill and like I don't</v>

1018
00:42:12.591 --> 00:42:15.200
<v Speaker 4>need to like and sometimes new just</v>
<v Speaker 4>schools over stupid stuff.</v>

1019
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.050
<v Speaker 4>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I do wonder like if he's learning</v>

1020
00:42:18.051 --> 00:42:19.370
<v Speaker 4>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the one thing,</v>

1021
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.300
<v Speaker 4>like I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1022
00:42:20.301 --> 00:42:23.330
<v Speaker 4>because he doesn't like to have like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like once he has an opinion,</v>

1023
00:42:23.331 --> 00:42:26.900
<v Speaker 4>like I liked to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to have conversations and I like to</v>

1024
00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:29.030
<v Speaker 4>be wrong and about the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't know everything.</v>

1025
00:42:29.031 --> 00:42:32.240
<v Speaker 4>I think that's kind of like white people</v>
<v Speaker 4>love this podcast so much because you're</v>

1026
00:42:32.241 --> 00:42:34.460
<v Speaker 4>open to learning anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it will have people on this</v>

1027
00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:35.270
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1028
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:36.290
<v Speaker 4>what was he having,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1029
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:39.320
<v Speaker 4>Because there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's always something that you can</v>

1030
00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:40.790
<v Speaker 4>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's always something that you don't</v>

1031
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:43.790
<v Speaker 4>understand that you don't know if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have an open mind.</v>

1032
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.780
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that in in many ways and</v>

1033
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.540
<v Speaker 4>that like sometimes he's just not open</v>
<v Speaker 4>to learning about certain things and</v>

1034
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:55.580
<v Speaker 4>somebody might know something about a</v>
<v Speaker 4>culture beyond what he knows and it's</v>

1035
00:42:55.581 --> 00:42:56.250
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>

1036
00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.050
<v Speaker 4>that's the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1037
00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:03.250
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just drives me crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I like is really fucking smart.</v>

1038
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:05.270
<v Speaker 4>And that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem.</v>

1039
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:08.060
<v Speaker 4>Exactly stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks everyone is stupid.</v>

1040
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:10.120
<v Speaker 4>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I hate it.</v>

1041
00:43:10.121 --> 00:43:14.160
<v Speaker 4>Like I got so annoyed with like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kanye West for second to the greatest</v>

1042
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.340
<v Speaker 4>article saying Kanye West is just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1043
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:18.710
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I wrote him an email.</v>

1044
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:19.550
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1045
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:22.460
<v Speaker 4>like I understand that to you and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way that you've done your life.</v>

1046
00:43:22.461 --> 00:43:23.690
<v Speaker 4>This doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1047
00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:28.130
<v Speaker 4>But this is actually really important</v>
<v Speaker 4>for black people to see that he was the</v>

1048
00:43:28.131 --> 00:43:31.050
<v Speaker 4>most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which thing was it him like,</v>

1049
00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:32.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>him tweeting out.</v>

1050
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:34.880
<v Speaker 4>I love the way cancer was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but beyond that saying that he openly</v>

1051
00:43:34.881 --> 00:43:38.330
<v Speaker 4>supported the president so I can see why</v>
<v Speaker 4>ben chips something like that down</v>

1052
00:43:38.331 --> 00:43:42.170
<v Speaker 4>initially because to him like culture is</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the way you talk about politics.</v>

1053
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.760
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like because he's by the book,</v>

1054
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.030
<v Speaker 4>but he has to understand that by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>book is not the way people in the hood</v>

1055
00:43:47.031 --> 00:43:49.370
<v Speaker 4>or being raised by the book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the way people in the projects</v>

1056
00:43:49.371 --> 00:43:51.320
<v Speaker 4>are being raised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These people have had their families</v>

1057
00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:53.960
<v Speaker 4>destroyed and decimated by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the welfare system.</v>

1058
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:55.790
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fathers aren't even at the homes,</v>

1059
00:43:55.791 --> 00:43:57.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the single motherhood rate jumped seven</v>

1060
00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.710
<v Speaker 4>from 25 percent in 1965 to 74 percent</v>
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>

1061
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:04.880
<v Speaker 4>and so these kids turn to culture to</v>
<v Speaker 4>father them.</v>

1062
00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.600
<v Speaker 4>They turned to Jay z and beyonce and hip</v>
<v Speaker 4>hop and Kanye and to tell them what's</v>

1063
00:44:08.601 --> 00:44:11.270
<v Speaker 4>right and what's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for so long because the left has had</v>

1064
00:44:11.271 --> 00:44:14.000
<v Speaker 4>a stranglehold on culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've had a strangle hold on black</v>

1065
00:44:14.001 --> 00:44:16.460
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the most significant thing that</v>

1066
00:44:16.461 --> 00:44:20.750
<v Speaker 4>opened up this dialogue beyond the work</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was doing was this simple tweet</v>

1067
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.240
<v Speaker 4>and the simple show of support from</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kanye West.</v>

1068
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:28.370
<v Speaker 4>And I was so frustrated that he had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had to like in that moment just like</v>

1069
00:44:28.371 --> 00:44:29.990
<v Speaker 4>dismiss them as crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like dude,</v>

1070
00:44:29.991 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 4>like just be willing to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1071
00:44:31.801 --> 00:44:32.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just be willing to say like,</v>

1072
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:36.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand why the hell this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that this is why people want to</v>

1073
00:44:36.951 --> 00:44:38.160
<v Speaker 4>talk about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1074
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.030
<v Speaker 4>But maybe there's something here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I always understood that culture was</v>

1075
00:44:42.031 --> 00:44:44.820
<v Speaker 4>the most important vertical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When Charlie and I first met and we sat</v>

1076
00:44:44.821 --> 00:44:46.100
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I defined three very minimal.</v>

1077
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.460
<v Speaker 4>Charlie is Charlie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charlie,</v>

1078
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:53.760
<v Speaker 4>Charlie Kirk is like this 18 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We started turning point USA who I work</v>

1079
00:44:53.761 --> 00:44:56.610
<v Speaker 4>for when he was 18 and he is like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>savant.</v>

1080
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.160
<v Speaker 4>They call him like trump's boy wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1081
00:44:59.161 --> 00:45:02.230
<v Speaker 4>he's a brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to talk about like smart and</v>

1082
00:45:02.231 --> 00:45:03.630
<v Speaker 4>beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the smartest person I know is</v>

1083
00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:05.850
<v Speaker 4>Charlie Kirk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hands down and he's only 24.</v>

1084
00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:06.841
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't,</v>

1085
00:45:06.841 --> 00:45:08.160
<v Speaker 4>he didn't go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>

1086
00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like just reading weird stuff when</v>

1087
00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:11.140
<v Speaker 4>he was seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1088
00:45:11.141 --> 00:45:12.240
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like things that everyone's like,</v>

1089
00:45:12.241 --> 00:45:13.520
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just read that Thomas Soul.</v>

1090
00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:13.861
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

1091
00:45:13.861 --> 00:45:15.080
<v Speaker 4>I read it when I was six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1092
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:17.100
<v Speaker 4>what am I trying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you not say that?</v>

1093
00:45:17.101 --> 00:45:18.540
<v Speaker 4>Could you be cool?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

1094
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:19.374
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1095
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.330
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when Charlie and I met and I,</v>

1096
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.630
<v Speaker 4>like I told him like my plan to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>help black America and wake them up</v>

1097
00:45:24.631 --> 00:45:27.510
<v Speaker 4>because I understood how we had fallen</v>
<v Speaker 4>victim to this brainwash.</v>

1098
00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:30.690
<v Speaker 4>There was brainwashed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the leftist dogma.</v>

1099
00:45:30.691 --> 00:45:32.490
<v Speaker 4>There's this idea that because we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>black,</v>

1100
00:45:32.491 --> 00:45:35.460
<v Speaker 4>we have to vote Democrat anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is not a Democrat is racist and</v>

1101
00:45:35.461 --> 00:45:38.040
<v Speaker 4>against helping us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is like what so many black</v>

1102
00:45:38.041 --> 00:45:39.270
<v Speaker 4>Americans believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believed it.</v>

1103
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:40.920
<v Speaker 4>I believed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1104
00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:41.381
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm a,</v>

1105
00:45:41.381 --> 00:45:42.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm a pretty smart girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1106
00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.160
<v Speaker 4>I've always been a very smart girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always,</v>

1107
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.120
<v Speaker 4>I've always been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1108
00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:48.120
<v Speaker 4>I've excelled in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in academics,</v>

1109
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:50.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how did I fall victim to it?</v>

1110
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.690
<v Speaker 4>The exact same system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1111
00:45:51.691 --> 00:45:53.430
<v Speaker 4>These three verticals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first being the family,</v>

1112
00:45:53.431 --> 00:45:56.430
<v Speaker 4>that breakdown of the family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The second one I'm being culture,</v>

1113
00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.770
<v Speaker 4>which then to me like growing up it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Jay z,</v>

1114
00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:01.610
<v Speaker 4>like Jay z was God to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I would throw on like I was,</v>

1115
00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:02.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went through a lot of stuff when I was</v>

1116
00:46:02.851 --> 00:46:04.140
<v Speaker 4>a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have a great family,</v>

1117
00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.310
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1118
00:46:05.311 --> 00:46:07.500
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would throw on a Jay z album and</v>

1119
00:46:07.501 --> 00:46:09.870
<v Speaker 4>like whatever he said was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like going to church,</v>

1120
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.700
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1121
00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:14.130
<v Speaker 4>and I can't stand them now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the third vertical,</v>

1122
00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.120
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1123
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.280
<v Speaker 4>because he knows exactly what he's doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's a trader,</v>

1124
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:22.310
<v Speaker 4>but the third vertical being education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was casual side trader,</v>

1125
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:26.580
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like beyonce and Jay z because he</v>

1126
00:46:26.581 --> 00:46:29.460
<v Speaker 4>knows what's happening to black America</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's somebody that built his entire</v>

1127
00:46:29.461 --> 00:46:32.490
<v Speaker 4>career off the backs of black America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1128
00:46:32.491 --> 00:46:37.270
<v Speaker 4>of being the guy who started in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>honing in in Queens and worked at,</v>

1129
00:46:37.271 --> 00:46:38.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a drug dealer and worked his way up</v>

1130
00:46:38.761 --> 00:46:40.920
<v Speaker 4>and it became the ideal for so many</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in Black America.</v>

1131
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.380
<v Speaker 4>And then he stands on stage and endorses</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton.</v>

1132
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:46.800
<v Speaker 4>He stands on stage and tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black America to put the same people in</v>

1133
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:49.770
<v Speaker 4>the White House that locked up more</v>
<v Speaker 4>black men than any present history of</v>

1134
00:46:49.771 --> 00:46:50.730
<v Speaker 4>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Clinton,</v>

1135
00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.770
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The person that stands on the crime bill</v>

1136
00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:55.710
<v Speaker 4>of 94 is Bill Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But because Jay Z is now focused on</v>

1137
00:46:55.711 --> 00:46:57.780
<v Speaker 4>getting a piece of the pie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the globalist piece of the Pie,</v>

1138
00:46:57.781 --> 00:46:59.590
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't care about black America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1139
00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:00.780
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's my opinion.</v>

1140
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what,</v>

1141
00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:06.000
<v Speaker 4>what it was or do you think that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>he thought that Donald Trump represented</v>

1142
00:47:06.001 --> 00:47:07.530
<v Speaker 4>a lot of racist white people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1143
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:09.503
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1144
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.160
<v Speaker 4>Not even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kind of,</v>

1145
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.890
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not for a single second,</v>

1146
00:47:13.891 --> 00:47:16.400
<v Speaker 4>Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because Jay z is very smart now.</v>

1147
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:17.251
<v Speaker 4>I didn't speak to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1148
00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:20.370
<v Speaker 4>I know like there's a certain thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>where like I just,</v>

1149
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:22.590
<v Speaker 4>I know that Jay z and beyonce betrayed</v>
<v Speaker 4>the black community.</v>

1150
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:25.200
<v Speaker 4>Like there they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they did it purposely for</v>

1151
00:47:25.201 --> 00:47:26.220
<v Speaker 4>financial gain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1152
00:47:26.221 --> 00:47:26.971
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1153
00:47:26.971 --> 00:47:27.700
<v Speaker 4>I think that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1154
00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.860
<v Speaker 4>they were interested in having,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to be</v>

1155
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 3>the people that control the world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they felt that Hillary Clinton,</v>

1156
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:34.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were working with Obama very</v>

1157
00:47:34.331 --> 00:47:37.810
<v Speaker 3>closely and very cluey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we know that the Obama</v>

1158
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:40.690
<v Speaker 3>administration worked very hard to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton to office and they</v>

1159
00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:45.100
<v Speaker 3>wanted to stay in that group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they supported Hillary Clinton</v>

1160
00:47:45.101 --> 00:47:48.910
<v Speaker 3>who was selected behind closed doors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forget the American people to the next</v>

1161
00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:52.300
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States selected certainly by the</v>

1162
00:47:52.301 --> 00:47:53.260
<v Speaker 3>DNC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1163
00:47:53.261 --> 00:47:54.940
<v Speaker 3>no 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But beyond that,</v>

1164
00:47:54.941 --> 00:47:56.320
<v Speaker 3>it was an embed with Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1165
00:47:56.321 --> 00:47:59.440
<v Speaker 3>she was our secretary of state and she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was doing deals behind closed doors</v>

1166
00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.750
<v Speaker 3>and Jay Z and beyonce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're a part of that click,</v>

1167
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:04.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were a part of the celebrated</v>

1168
00:48:04.901 --> 00:48:08.350
<v Speaker 3>celebrities that were allowed to go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the White House and they'd wear the ties</v>

1169
00:48:08.351 --> 00:48:12.670
<v Speaker 3>and everybody will be taken photo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was a cool thing to be friends</v>

1170
00:48:12.671 --> 00:48:13.760
<v Speaker 3>with Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1171
00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.900
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants to go to the White House</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like celebrities.</v>

1172
00:48:16.901 --> 00:48:18.640
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to get celebrities to go with</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

1173
00:48:18.641 --> 00:48:21.400
<v Speaker 3>There's so much controversy attached to</v>
<v Speaker 3>attach your career.</v>

1174
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Can you get attacked and attacked by</v>
<v Speaker 3>quarter left and right?</v>

1175
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:28.870
<v Speaker 3>Part of what's happening with Rosanna is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just that you made a racist tweet,</v>

1176
00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 3>she didn't know it was racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She supports trump and then she,</v>

1177
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:37.000
<v Speaker 3>her character supports trump and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>were looking for something to hate her</v>

1178
00:48:37.001 --> 00:48:39.220
<v Speaker 3>over and she handed it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1179
00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:40.943
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1180
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:45.960
<v Speaker 3>you stick your neck out in that way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just people on the left for sure.</v>

1181
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.390
<v Speaker 3>Look at anyone who's a trump supporter</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an open target.</v>

1182
00:48:49.391 --> 00:48:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Even if they're a reasonable person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they're a person who is kind and</v>

1183
00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:58.740
<v Speaker 3>measured and very even keeled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like the nicest person I've ever</v>

1184
00:48:59.201 --> 00:49:00.760
<v Speaker 3>met about the trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1185
00:49:00.761 --> 00:49:03.550
<v Speaker 3>and she's like never responds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never punches back.</v>

1186
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:04.483
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and look what they,</v>

1187
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.600
<v Speaker 3>how they treat her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1188
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.090
<v Speaker 3>this house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Samantha Bee did it.</v>

1189
00:49:07.091 --> 00:49:09.280
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people have gone after all the</v>

1190
00:49:09.281 --> 00:49:10.490
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go after Ivanka.</v>

1191
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:14.650
<v Speaker 3>She's such a kind person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just because her father is</v>

1192
00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:18.100
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's open season and that's why jake</v>

1193
00:49:18.101 --> 00:49:21.430
<v Speaker 3>tapper jumps into a tweet about Chelsea</v>
<v Speaker 3>handler and tries to correlate trump.</v>

1194
00:49:21.431 --> 00:49:25.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're obsessed with people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm like,</v>

1195
00:49:25.511 --> 00:49:26.380
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like trump.</v>

1196
00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:27.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the guy.</v>

1197
00:49:27.611 --> 00:49:32.080
<v Speaker 3>I think it's really funny to have jake</v>
<v Speaker 3>tapper on the news the day of the</v>

1198
00:49:32.081 --> 00:49:33.760
<v Speaker 3>election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did a comedy.</v>

1199
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:36.270
<v Speaker 3>We did a podcast from the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1200
00:49:36.271 --> 00:49:38.200
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we call it the end of the world podcast,</v>

1201
00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:41.350
<v Speaker 3>have a bunch of people because whoever</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck when's the end of the world,</v>

1202
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:45.220
<v Speaker 3>this live podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1203
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:49.840
<v Speaker 3>I went into the green room afterwards to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the comedians bar and jake tapper was on</v>

1204
00:49:49.841 --> 00:49:54.841
<v Speaker 3>TV and he was so bummed out and I took a</v>
<v Speaker 3>photo of him like him on the screen.</v>

1205
00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.670
<v Speaker 3>You just see the sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember his face.</v>

1206
00:49:57.671 --> 00:50:00.700
<v Speaker 3>He was really sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was sad to find that,</v>

1207
00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:01.723
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

1208
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:05.950
<v Speaker 3>the best likes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a splice together,</v>

1209
00:50:05.951 --> 00:50:08.620
<v Speaker 3>like all of the clips of just like it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was exceptional.</v>

1210
00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:10.760
<v Speaker 3>The news anchors and the emotion that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was coming out of them.</v>

1211
00:50:10.761 --> 00:50:14.860
<v Speaker 3>And he did some crazy thing is all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them that said he'll never win.</v>

1212
00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:19.060
<v Speaker 3>You'll never win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's forever.</v>

1213
00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.320
<v Speaker 3>They laughed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they laughed.</v>

1214
00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I remember there's a moment where like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ann Coulter,</v>

1215
00:50:21.821 --> 00:50:23.080
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so who do you have winning?</v>

1216
00:50:23.081 --> 00:50:24.670
<v Speaker 3>And she says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump.</v>

1217
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.740
<v Speaker 3>And they broke into laughter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the cool kids,</v>

1218
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.940
<v Speaker 2>the cool kids at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1219
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:32.360
<v Speaker 2>at the lunch table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really how they've been</v>

1220
00:50:32.361 --> 00:50:36.290
<v Speaker 2>acting like they're not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that they're the cool kids at</v>

1221
00:50:36.291 --> 00:50:40.280
<v Speaker 2>the lunch table and they get to define</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's cool and they're just having a</v>

1222
00:50:40.281 --> 00:50:42.050
<v Speaker 2>rude awakening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's beautiful to watch.</v>

1223
00:50:42.051 --> 00:50:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

1224
00:50:43.031 --> 00:50:44.550
<v Speaker 2>He loves an upset to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1225
00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:47.570
<v Speaker 2>people love enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they also wants their team gets</v>

1226
00:50:47.571 --> 00:50:49.280
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they want to support their team so</v>

1227
00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.260
<v Speaker 2>they fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making it tribal.</v>

1228
00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Tribal right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Versus left.</v>

1229
00:50:55.251 --> 00:50:55.791
<v Speaker 2>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1230
00:50:55.791 --> 00:50:57.650
<v Speaker 2>fuck these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Jake tapper.</v>

1231
00:50:57.651 --> 00:51:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm going on this side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my team now.</v>

1232
00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:05.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like team sports fanatics right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1233
00:51:05.901 --> 00:51:08.540
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's little sense anymore.</v>

1234
00:51:08.541 --> 00:51:11.120
<v Speaker 2>It's just like this is the team that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've plugged my life too.</v>

1235
00:51:11.121 --> 00:51:14.600
<v Speaker 2>And part of that is ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you just spent how many months</v>

1236
00:51:14.601 --> 00:51:16.130
<v Speaker 2>calling everybody racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist,</v>

1237
00:51:16.131 --> 00:51:17.300
<v Speaker 2>deplorable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you really going to go,</v>

1238
00:51:17.301 --> 00:51:17.781
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1239
00:51:17.781 --> 00:51:19.610
<v Speaker 2>I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to hold on to something.</v>

1240
00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1241
00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:24.800
<v Speaker 2>and I see that because like when I went</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this prison reform summit,</v>

1242
00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:28.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm Van Jones was there and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Donald trump is speaking and it was</v>

1243
00:51:28.581 --> 00:51:30.320
<v Speaker 2>like love between them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1244
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.290
<v Speaker 2>But this is the guy that said White</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lash,</v>

1245
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right after the election.</v>

1246
00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.060
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1247
00:51:35.061 --> 00:51:36.920
<v Speaker 2>but how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can he go back from that?</v>

1248
00:51:36.921 --> 00:51:38.590
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1249
00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:41.630
<v Speaker 2>peddle backwards from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So half of them are fake in my opinion.</v>

1250
00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:44.110
<v Speaker 2>I find them to be fake because I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>them behind closed doors.</v>

1251
00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.700
<v Speaker 2>They don't feel that animosity for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president cause it's hard to.</v>

1252
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:49.700
<v Speaker 2>He's really likable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like his presence when you meet</v>

1253
00:51:49.701 --> 00:51:51.290
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very aware of himself.</v>

1254
00:51:51.291 --> 00:51:53.060
<v Speaker 2>He's aware of the jokes that are being</v>
<v Speaker 2>made about him.</v>

1255
00:51:53.061 --> 00:51:56.080
<v Speaker 2>He'll make the jokes about himself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1256
00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.440
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's likable,</v>

1257
00:51:57.441 --> 00:51:59.840
<v Speaker 2>he's got the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just has something about him when he</v>

1258
00:51:59.841 --> 00:52:02.960
<v Speaker 2>makes a tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a memorial day saying that the dead</v>

1259
00:52:02.961 --> 00:52:07.961
<v Speaker 2>soldiers would be really happy to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the economy is doing and how black</v>

1260
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:09.760
<v Speaker 2>unemployment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the slowest.</v>

1261
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Never been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit was ridiculous.</v>

1262
00:52:12.231 --> 00:52:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I actually missed that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just laughing as I.</v>

1263
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.450
<v Speaker 2>every time someone says a trunk to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like,</v>

1264
00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's funny that he put the</v>

1265
00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:22.580
<v Speaker 2>me in memorial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an article,</v>

1266
00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you we're in going in</v>

1267
00:52:26.841 --> 00:52:27.350
<v Speaker 2>different directions.</v>

1268
00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Like I predict in 20 slash 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's not going to go on seat and</v>

1269
00:52:29.991 --> 00:52:31.040
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be here.</v>

1270
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like he just wants to talk and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard.</v>

1271
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:37.700
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard for these people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak because what happens is they go</v>

1272
00:52:37.701 --> 00:52:39.680
<v Speaker 2>onto a stage and the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love him.</v>

1273
00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:41.750
<v Speaker 2>They great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone loves him because he's really</v>

1274
00:52:41.751 --> 00:52:43.280
<v Speaker 2>likable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be in room with trump and not</v>

1275
00:52:43.281 --> 00:52:46.910
<v Speaker 2>laugh and like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they take out his fingers right</v>

1276
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.920
<v Speaker 2>now I know they take away the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the clips and they spliced up and they</v>

1277
00:52:52.401 --> 00:52:53.690
<v Speaker 2>make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he said something bad,</v>

1278
00:52:53.691 --> 00:52:56.810
<v Speaker 2>but what they're doing is it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible game to play because you're not</v>

1279
00:52:56.811 --> 00:53:00.110
<v Speaker 2>just lying on trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're lying on the 50,000 people,</v>

1280
00:53:00.111 --> 00:53:02.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thousands of people that are there</v>

1281
00:53:02.121 --> 00:53:03.020
<v Speaker 2>to hear him speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1282
00:53:03.021 --> 00:53:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Like so they're playing a game where</v>
<v Speaker 2>then those people get pissed off with</v>

1283
00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:07.670
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think they're playing a game where</v>

1284
00:53:07.671 --> 00:53:09.620
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're misinterpreting the things that</v>

1285
00:53:09.621 --> 00:53:13.710
<v Speaker 2>he's said plenty of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way they spliced it up.</v>

1286
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that,</v>

1287
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:17.120
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that moment when he says,</v>

1288
00:53:17.121 --> 00:53:18.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this was the old days,</v>

1289
00:53:18.321 --> 00:53:20.570
<v Speaker 2>we take you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we take you out to the back,</v>

1290
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.290
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1291
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:24.170
<v Speaker 2>do you remember that moment when he said</v>
<v Speaker 2>while he was running and somebody was,</v>

1292
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>causing a circus in the</v>

1293
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:28.080
<v Speaker 4>crowd and like he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get him out of here.</v>

1294
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.850
<v Speaker 4>And then the way they ran it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1295
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:30.730
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1296
00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:33.960
<v Speaker 4>like when in the old days when they used</v>
<v Speaker 4>to like hang black people from trees.</v>

1297
00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1298
00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:38.400
<v Speaker 4>I think he literally meant that you used</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be able to get your ass kicked.</v>

1299
00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 4>That's how they spin it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then same thing,</v>

1300
00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:43.410
<v Speaker 4>like when he said you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you have to lose?</v>

1301
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:45.120
<v Speaker 4>Prior to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had listed every stat.</v>

1302
00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:46.180
<v Speaker 4>We're quietly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got tentative and you're like,</v>

1303
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.860
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean,</v>

1304
00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:47.693
<v Speaker 4>the loser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1305
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.050
<v Speaker 4>But then they get that clip in there</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1306
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:51.840
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump is insulting black America.</v>

1307
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:53.800
<v Speaker 4>He's saying that they all live in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1308
00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.260
<v Speaker 4>he's saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Typically speaking,</v>

1309
00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.600
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the people that live in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the projects are going to be letter in</v>

1310
00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:59.370
<v Speaker 4>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is black America,</v>

1311
00:53:59.371 --> 00:54:02.760
<v Speaker 4>so he's asking the current,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the past administrations have not been</v>

1312
00:54:02.761 --> 00:54:04.260
<v Speaker 4>serving you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you have to lose?</v>

1313
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.740
<v Speaker 4>So it frustrates me because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see that,</v>

1314
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:09.930
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they mix it up and they try to</v>

1315
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.330
<v Speaker 4>divide the country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the end of the day,</v>

1316
00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:15.450
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately for them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's actually really likable and same</v>

1317
00:54:15.451 --> 00:54:16.920
<v Speaker 4>for don trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>junior like,</v>

1318
00:54:16.921 --> 00:54:18.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're really funny.</v>

1319
00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:20.580
<v Speaker 4>They're really likable and they're aware</v>
<v Speaker 4>of themselves.</v>

1320
00:54:20.581 --> 00:54:21.960
<v Speaker 4>Like they're in on the joke guys like,</v>

1321
00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie was telling me the other day that</v>

1322
00:54:24.791 --> 00:54:27.900
<v Speaker 1>they made some video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the video that they made to see</v>

1323
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:30.880
<v Speaker 1>if you can find that video was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny with her all mocking themselves</v>

1324
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.840
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was it about that Laurel and um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1326
00:54:36.141 --> 00:54:38.100

<v Speaker 3>I actually haven't even heard the words</v>

1327
00:54:38.101 --> 00:54:39.330
<v Speaker 3>that everyone was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't either.</v>

<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

1329
00:54:40.081 --> 00:54:41.640

<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1330
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:43.160
<v Speaker 3>I will not listen to the board.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I didn't even listen to the word,</v>

1333
00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.860
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they made fun of themselves.</v>

1334

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is a different.</v>

1339
00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The news put it up so I've got to get</v>

1340
00:54:58.611 --> 00:54:59.410
<v Speaker 1>the real one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's hilarious that they have.</v>

1343
00:55:03.561 --> 00:55:06.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is actually a very clever thing to</v>

1344
00:55:06.801 --> 00:55:07.130
<v Speaker 1>do</v>

1345

<v Speaker 4>because they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they're all like that.</v>

1346
00:55:08.361 --> 00:55:10.370

1352
00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:30.210

<v Speaker 3>if you need me to do that.</v>

1353
00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:32.653
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's been reported that you hear more or</v>

1357
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:44.380

<v Speaker 3>Clearly you're getting your information</v>

1358
00:55:44.381 --> 00:55:46.570
<v Speaker 3>from CNN because that's fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>all I hear is yawning.</v>

1362
00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:53.390
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong here?</v>

1363
00:55:53.391 --> 00:55:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Something going on today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things messing up.</v>

1364
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:58.810
<v Speaker 1>What is messing up the tri caster?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1365
00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.990
<v Speaker 1>We to do that thing we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and fix up.</v>

1366
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the idea is that these people</v>

1367
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.380
<v Speaker 1>had the sense of humor and then with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump at the end he's doing.</v>

1368
00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:11.480
<v Speaker 1>What is he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was He at</v>

1369
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:13.920
<v Speaker 4>a year?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1370
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.950
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1371
00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.720
<v Speaker 4>and that's the thing is they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they were in on the joke and I</v>

1372
00:56:18.721 --> 00:56:23.410
<v Speaker 4>think that people don't realize like how</v>
<v Speaker 4>in on the joke they are like,</v>

1373
00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

1374
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.550
<v Speaker 2>he's aware that you say all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that he tweets out and</v>

1375
00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:28.440
<v Speaker 2>says all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1376
00:56:28.441 --> 00:56:30.940
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like don trump junior is aware that he's</v>

1377
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:32.800
<v Speaker 2>a billionaire son and that's what people</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1378
00:56:32.801 --> 00:56:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a billionaire.</v>

1379
00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:37.480
<v Speaker 2>So and like they're so funny and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sad that people don't get to see</v>

1380
00:56:37.481 --> 00:56:39.670
<v Speaker 2>that side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I actually do hope that they all come</v>

1381
00:56:39.671 --> 00:56:43.600
<v Speaker 2>on the show because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People should actually see how hilarious</v>

1382
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:45.730
<v Speaker 2>they are and how aware of themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like the most to me,</v>

1383
00:56:45.731 --> 00:56:47.650
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most likable,</v>

1384
00:56:47.651 --> 00:56:50.650
<v Speaker 2>relatable first family of my lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1385
00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't speak to anyone but there.</v>

1386
00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:55.670
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't think that Obama and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michelle were likable.</v>

1387
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.730
<v Speaker 2>My God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1388
00:56:57.731 --> 00:56:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to like Obama?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was a likable guy.</v>

1389
00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.000
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what's funny,</v>

1390
00:57:01.001 --> 00:57:06.001
<v Speaker 2>I was at a dinner last night with people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that came over from Cuba and this woman</v>

1391
00:57:06.761 --> 00:57:08.980
<v Speaker 2>said that when she first heard Obama</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak and she was,</v>

1392
00:57:08.981 --> 00:57:10.120
<v Speaker 2>she was way older.</v>

1393
00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:13.610
<v Speaker 2>She broke down crying because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>reminded her of the first time shared</v>

1394
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Fidel Castro street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a bizarre thing to say,</v>

1395
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:16.301
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

1396
00:57:16.301 --> 00:57:17.111
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything.</v>

1397
00:57:17.111 --> 00:57:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I've never been to Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they got scared that America was</v>

1398
00:57:21.101 --> 00:57:23.320
<v Speaker 2>going to turn into a communist country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was with a bunch of Cubans.</v>

1399
00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

1400
00:57:25.091 --> 00:57:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they literally came out of their</v>

1401
00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:30.820
<v Speaker 2>mouths but have ptsd but what they know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they say could be.</v>

1402
00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:34.270
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they were saying was like the</v>

1403
00:57:34.271 --> 00:57:35.670
<v Speaker 2>veneer of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1404
00:57:35.671 --> 00:57:36.430
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the.</v>

1405
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:38.530
<v Speaker 2>It was like exactly what you wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>

1406
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:40.730
<v Speaker 2>Obama said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the perfect and the perfect home.</v>

1407
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.770
<v Speaker 2>The perfect hand mannerism with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1408
00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:45.880
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1409
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:49.540
<v Speaker 2>the perfect inflection in his voice and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about that to me,</v>

1410
00:57:49.541 --> 00:57:50.980
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the person that I am,</v>

1411
00:57:50.981 --> 00:57:53.140
<v Speaker 2>that just was super inauthentic and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1412
00:57:53.141 --> 00:57:54.460
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Obama won in 2008,</v>

1413
00:57:54.461 --> 00:57:55.600
<v Speaker 2>I cried like the let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

1414
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:56.980
<v Speaker 2>let's let me not be fake here.</v>

1415
00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's black,</v>

1416
00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:00.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was going to be great,</v>

1417
00:58:00.101 --> 00:58:01.080
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1418
00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:02.230
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1419
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as things went on and I was watching</v>

1420
00:58:04.001 --> 00:58:05.380
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

1421
00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:08.080
<v Speaker 2>everything seemed so fake and he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really doing anything.</v>

1422
00:58:08.081 --> 00:58:11.530
<v Speaker 2>So I just don't respond to that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a personality.</v>

1423
00:58:11.531 --> 00:58:14.860
<v Speaker 2>I liked that authentic and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why trump coming in behind him,</v>

1424
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was so relatable as a precedent.</v>

1425
00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Like there's this theory and it's a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

1426
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tumor,</v>

1427
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Koran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1428
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:25.480
<v Speaker 2>why do you like revolution?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Revolutions take place unexpectedly.</v>

1429
00:58:25.481 --> 00:58:28.180
<v Speaker 2>You could argue that right now America</v>
<v Speaker 2>is having a revolution.</v>

1430
00:58:28.181 --> 00:58:29.830
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not out there shooting each other,</v>

1431
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:32.860
<v Speaker 2>but there's an ideological revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cultural war,</v>

1432
00:58:32.861 --> 00:58:34.090
<v Speaker 2>if you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's taken place.</v>

1433
00:58:34.091 --> 00:58:35.770
<v Speaker 2>And too many people just seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected,</v>

1434
00:58:35.771 --> 00:58:37.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama was in office and then like,</v>

1435
00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to Donald Trump.</v>

1436
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:41.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the theory is that when you're,</v>

1437
00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.690
<v Speaker 2>when the public and the private of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

1438
00:58:43.691 --> 00:58:47.290
<v Speaker 2>our personas get too far apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a natural evolution takes place.</v>

1439
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:50.800
<v Speaker 2>And Society really has just been so</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake.</v>

1440
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:51.341
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1441
00:58:51.341 --> 00:58:54.010
<v Speaker 2>like everything offends you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere you go.</v>

1442
00:58:54.011 --> 00:58:57.760
<v Speaker 2>People get offended by people's hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like literally Kardashians will put</v>

1443
00:58:57.761 --> 00:59:01.900
<v Speaker 2>their hair in braids and the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet will explode.</v>

1444
00:59:01.901 --> 00:59:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Saying that they need to pay tribute to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa.</v>

1445
00:59:04.031 --> 00:59:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Like the crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1446
00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.860
<v Speaker 2>I have never in my life looked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's hair and felt emotional.</v>

1447
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:09.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you're doing,</v>

1448
00:59:09.881 --> 00:59:12.040
<v Speaker 2>your hair is fine with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you took the time to do it,</v>

1449
00:59:12.041 --> 00:59:13.970
<v Speaker 2>it's fine with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea is,</v>

1450
00:59:13.971 --> 00:59:16.060
<v Speaker 2>is that as a culture we've become so</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake.</v>

1451
00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:21.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm just looking to get angry at things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fake thing.</v>

1452
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:22.000
<v Speaker 2>It's fake.</v>

1453
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.050
<v Speaker 3>It's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 100.</v>

1454
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:25.660
<v Speaker 3>There's no person that can tell me that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the first time they saw Braden,</v>

1455
00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:28.250
<v Speaker 3>someone tear and upset them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then somebody told them that they</v>

1456
00:59:28.251 --> 00:59:30.550
<v Speaker 3>should be upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like privately when they're at home,</v>

1457
00:59:30.551 --> 00:59:32.420
<v Speaker 3>do you think they get upset when they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching TV?</v>

1458
00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:34.970
<v Speaker 3>I think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some people to get upset</v>

1459
00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:35.990
<v Speaker 3>at a lot of stupid shit.</v>

1460
00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're inauthentic with</v>

1461
00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.030
<v Speaker 1>their being upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think their focus in their anger</v>

1462
00:59:42.031 --> 00:59:43.980
<v Speaker 1>is just misguided and dumb.</v>

1463
00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:44.801
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

1464
00:59:44.801 --> 00:59:47.210
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's the dumb part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's just when it gets to dumb</v>

1465
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:49.970
<v Speaker 3>with hoop earrings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

1466
00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.880
<v Speaker 3>it's like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Bantu Braids,</v>

1467
00:59:51.881 --> 00:59:53.860
<v Speaker 3>you need to pay tribute to the island of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamaica.</v>

1468
00:59:53.861 --> 00:59:57.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm like horse off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you've got to be a really inspired</v>

1469
00:59:57.041 --> 00:59:58.750
<v Speaker 3>person to even look up why you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>offended.</v>

1470
00:59:58.751 --> 01:00:01.030
<v Speaker 3>Like that takes a lot of research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who is researching?</v>

1471
01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:05.410
<v Speaker 3>Like who started the Bantu knots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like who's who started the corn row.</v>

1472
01:00:05.411 --> 01:00:07.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a lot of time on your hands.</v>

1473
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:09.880
<v Speaker 3>For me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I could just not have to</v>

1474
01:00:09.881 --> 01:00:12.730
<v Speaker 3>research why I'm offended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a little more time.</v>

1475
01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:16.570
<v Speaker 3>Ejections boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>power grid goes down.</v>

1476
01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Lightening storms million times greater</v>
<v Speaker 3>than anything and we wouldn't be worried</v>

1477
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.080
<v Speaker 3>about braids anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1478
01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.160
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too easy.</v>

1479
01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:24.420
<v Speaker 3>It's too easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too easy to live.</v>

1480
01:00:24.421 --> 01:00:25.450
<v Speaker 3>There's no wolves in the street.</v>

1481
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:27.520
<v Speaker 3>There's no humor either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing is like,</v>

1482
01:00:27.521 --> 01:00:31.510
<v Speaker 3>especially like you a former standup</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian,</v>

1483
01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:32.373
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Current.</v>

1484
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.960
<v Speaker 3>You still buy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you tore in and do you do comedy</v>

1485
01:00:34.961 --> 01:00:39.290
<v Speaker 3>or</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy or do you.</v>

1486
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:41.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

1487
01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:44.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't speak ever do I speaking right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>

1488
01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.230
<v Speaker 3>Places you do that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do that shit.</v>

1489
01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:50.080
<v Speaker 3>Get you on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could just be having conversations with</v>

1490
01:00:50.081 --> 01:00:51.490
<v Speaker 3>the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People love to talk to you.</v>

1491
01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:56.170
<v Speaker 3>That's tiresome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the thing is like how is it difficult</v>

1492
01:00:56.171 --> 01:00:59.130
<v Speaker 3>when you're standing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't say anything anymore because</v>

1493
01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:01.210
<v Speaker 3>like five seconds in your whole life can</v>
<v Speaker 3>be over.</v>

1494
01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:04.960
<v Speaker 3>Can you just have to legitimately not</v>
<v Speaker 3>give a fuck and have a bunch of good</v>

1495
01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:07.010
<v Speaker 3>friends that you really love and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1496
01:01:07.011 --> 01:01:10.870
<v Speaker 3>you surround yourself with loving people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you all support each other and then</v>

1497
01:01:10.871 --> 01:01:13.090
<v Speaker 3>when people get mad at you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I do.</v>

1498
01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:15.160
<v Speaker 3>People don't realize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they don't realize how little I</v>

1499
01:01:15.161 --> 01:01:16.930
<v Speaker 3>care about their outreach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always say to myself,</v>

1500
01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:19.090
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if they knew how little I</v>
<v Speaker 3>cared.</v>

1501
01:01:19.091 --> 01:01:22.110
<v Speaker 3>If they actually write the article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if they actually knew how little I</v>

1502
01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.780
<v Speaker 3>care a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You still talking about jake tapper and</v>

1503
01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:28.840
<v Speaker 3>fascinated by it and fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just look at Jake tapper was like a day</v>

1504
01:01:28.841 --> 01:01:31.030
<v Speaker 3>where they all were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1505
01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:33.290
<v Speaker 3>and then like the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his fist right now.</v>

1506
01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1507
01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Then the next day it was over like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1508
01:01:36.371 --> 01:01:38.630
<v Speaker 3>like just now with like Ben Shapiro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like no one cares.</v>

1509
01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Ben doesn't care like that.</v>

1510
01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:41.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to teach other in one week,</v>

1511
01:01:41.771 --> 01:01:44.470
<v Speaker 3>like in two weeks I'm in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing an event together.</v>

1512
01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:46.060
<v Speaker 3>Like I see them all the time and I like</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1513
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:48.490
<v Speaker 3>but like to everyone else they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>weighing in.</v>

1514
01:01:48.491 --> 01:01:49.324
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1515
01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.750
<v Speaker 1>so this is your business though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is your,</v>

1516
01:01:51.751 --> 01:01:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you're in the business of politics now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is what I want to get to.</v>

1517
01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>How do you go from being a liberal who</v>
<v Speaker 1>cried when Obama was elected?</v>

1518
01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>He's black on black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

1519
01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:06.110
<v Speaker 1>How do you go from that to being miss</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative poster girl in 2018?</v>

1520
01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what you are 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

1521
01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are like a lot of people that are</v>

1522
01:02:10.831 --> 01:02:12.270
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love the fact that you're</v>

1523
01:02:12.271 --> 01:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're smart,</v>

1524
01:02:13.381 --> 01:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>you're articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're black and you,</v>

1525
01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking forceful with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and ideas and you them through</v>

1526
01:02:19.471 --> 01:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>quick and</v>

1527
01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:23.790
<v Speaker 4>you're not scared of pissing people off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is very exciting to</v>

1528
01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:25.290
<v Speaker 4>conservative people that are on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sidelines.</v>

1529
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:28.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like we got fucking great running</v>
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>

1530
01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to win the superbowl this</v>

1531
01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.360
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's how they look at you like</v>

1532
01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.720
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like a great soldier in the</v>

1533
01:02:33.721 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 4>field.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how people look at it.</v>

1534
01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:36.323
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1535
01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.340
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how do you go from that?</v>

1536
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:41.760
<v Speaker 4>What happened to reconcile?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened to me in high school?</v>

1537
01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:47.250
<v Speaker 4>We got to that and then we got off track</v>
<v Speaker 4>two things that I wanted to correct the</v>

1538
01:02:47.461 --> 01:02:49.110
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I wanted to correct what had</v>

1539
01:02:49.111 --> 01:02:50.760
<v Speaker 4>happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the first thing was I launched a</v>

1540
01:02:50.761 --> 01:02:53.010
<v Speaker 4>website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a blog for young girls that were</v>

1541
01:02:53.011 --> 01:02:56.300
<v Speaker 4>going through things I had gotten out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the eating disorder and I wanted to just</v>

1542
01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:58.350
<v Speaker 4>give girls that may be going through</v>
<v Speaker 4>something a way to.</v>

1543
01:02:58.350 --> 01:02:58.921
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1544
01:02:58.921 --> 01:03:00.450
<v Speaker 4>So I do I build this blog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you go and eat?</v>

1545
01:03:00.451 --> 01:03:01.590
<v Speaker 4>I tell them they can write whatever they</v>
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>

1546
01:03:01.591 --> 01:03:03.690
<v Speaker 4>That was the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The second thing I wanted to do was to</v>

1547
01:03:03.691 --> 01:03:07.080
<v Speaker 4>combat like I felt and I still feel in</v>
<v Speaker 4>my soul that children today are growing</v>

1548
01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:11.190
<v Speaker 4>up in a time that people can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't even stop to think about,</v>

1549
01:03:11.191 --> 01:03:13.080
<v Speaker 4>we have 10 year olds that are killing</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves over snapchat.</v>

1550
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:16.560
<v Speaker 4>Like if someone posts a picture on</v>
<v Speaker 4>snapchat and they killed themselves,</v>

1551
01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and no one has really thought about how</v>

1552
01:03:19.771 --> 01:03:23.100
<v Speaker 4>much technology has negatively impacted</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability for a child to grow up.</v>

1553
01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.170
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they're concerned about the way they</v>

1554
01:03:25.171 --> 01:03:27.300
<v Speaker 4>look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I used to Babysit name to put</v>

1555
01:03:27.301 --> 01:03:32.301
<v Speaker 4>myself through some years of college and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a nanny for these kids.</v>

1556
01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.560
<v Speaker 4>So they care about how they look when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was 10.</v>

1557
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:38.180
<v Speaker 4>Like I didn't care how I looked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know how I looked at it.</v>

1558
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:40.110
<v Speaker 4>I definitely didn't have seen the</v>
<v Speaker 4>pictures.</v>

1559
01:03:40.111 --> 01:03:40.950
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1560
01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.950
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now we have kids color.</v>

1561
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.200
<v Speaker 4>Just so the second thing I wanted to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said I have this great idea that I'm</v>

1562
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:48.940
<v Speaker 4>going to build this project.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1563
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.640
<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the,</v>

1564
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:53.430
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the social autopsy bit that the</v>

1565
01:03:53.431 --> 01:03:55.590
<v Speaker 4>youtubers were freaking out about and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they thought that it was a political</v>

1566
01:03:55.591 --> 01:03:57.840
<v Speaker 4>machine and it was going to be to help</v>
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

1567
01:03:57.870 --> 01:04:00.990
<v Speaker 4>I found that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it never launched.</v>

1568
01:04:00.991 --> 01:04:05.070
<v Speaker 4>It was an idea that I had to build</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that would be like screenshots</v>

1569
01:04:05.071 --> 01:04:07.640
<v Speaker 4>of what people said online and like to</v>
<v Speaker 4>put them in like a timeout.</v>

1570
01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.820
<v Speaker 4>So I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were going around,</v>

1571
01:04:08.821 --> 01:04:11.770
<v Speaker 4>we were meeting with high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like high schools and saying like,</v>

1572
01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:13.920
<v Speaker 4>we're thinking about building something</v>
<v Speaker 4>for children that.</v>

1573
01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:17.100
<v Speaker 4>So instead of going to prison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you send a mean tweet or a snap,</v>

1574
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.280
<v Speaker 4>like what if you just couldn't like trap</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the football team,</v>

1575
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.710
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what if like your teachers to check</v>

1576
01:04:22.711 --> 01:04:24.630
<v Speaker 4>the database to see like how you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>behaving online.</v>

1577
01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:28.480
<v Speaker 4>Was it like naive going back like sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it.</v>

1578
01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:32.340
<v Speaker 4>But the idea that the feedback that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>were getting from principals was like</v>

1579
01:04:32.341 --> 01:04:35.190
<v Speaker 4>first try it on adults because like if</v>
<v Speaker 4>this goes awry,</v>

1580
01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:37.770
<v Speaker 4>like to do this for children is not</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be a great idea.</v>

1581
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.620
<v Speaker 4>So I started kickstart her saying that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm raising money for this project to</v>

1582
01:04:40.621 --> 01:04:44.970
<v Speaker 4>help combat online bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was like a project that was so</v>

1583
01:04:44.971 --> 01:04:48.060
<v Speaker 4>from the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just like trying to rectify the</v>

1584
01:04:48.061 --> 01:04:52.320
<v Speaker 4>wrongs that I felt were done for these</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids that aggressed me,</v>

1585
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:53.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in high school.</v>

1586
01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:56.400
<v Speaker 4>And instead I ended up in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a firestorm again.</v>

1587
01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.140
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1588
01:04:58.141 --> 01:05:01.880
<v Speaker 4>God really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Gamer Gate scandal like that.</v>

1589
01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:03.000
<v Speaker 4>Do you know about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1590
01:05:03.001 --> 01:05:06.210
<v Speaker 4>you've spoken to my leg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I knew nothing about it.</v>

1591
01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.420
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't a Gamer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't lying,</v>

1592
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:08.790
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing about it,</v>

1593
01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:11.610
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I put this kickstarter up saying</v>

1594
01:05:11.611 --> 01:05:13.860
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we're doing is figuratively lifting</v>

1595
01:05:13.861 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 4>the masks off of trolls and the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 4>lost its mind.</v>

1596
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.740
<v Speaker 4>It lost its mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a girl named Zoe Quinn who was</v>

1597
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:23.860
<v Speaker 4>patient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the Gamer Gate scandal calls me</v>

1598
01:05:23.861 --> 01:05:27.710
<v Speaker 4>and at this point she was working for</v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter as the official anti harassment</v>

1599
01:05:27.711 --> 01:05:30.550
<v Speaker 4>or twitter and she basically threatens</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and tells me to kill the project.</v>

1600
01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:34.840
<v Speaker 4>And I had no idea at the bread and</v>
<v Speaker 4>butter of the Gamer Gate scandal called</v>

1601
01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:36.490
<v Speaker 4>me on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She contacted me via twitter.</v>

1602
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:40.630
<v Speaker 4>My numbers were threatened first she</v>
<v Speaker 4>started off with like,</v>

1603
01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm the girl that was the victim of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gamergate.</v>

1604
01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:45.610
<v Speaker 4>And instantly to me it was all people</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't wear a victim like a badge.</v>

1605
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:48.520
<v Speaker 4>Like I knew this because I had gone</v>
<v Speaker 4>through this in high school and she was</v>

1606
01:05:48.521 --> 01:05:49.660
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you why you need to kill</v>

1607
01:05:49.661 --> 01:05:51.230
<v Speaker 4>your project immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1608
01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.410
<v Speaker 4>because there are people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1609
01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.620
<v Speaker 4>there are that harassed me and they will</v>
<v Speaker 4>harass you if they find out about it.</v>

1610
01:05:56.621 --> 01:05:57.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to save you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1611
01:05:57.701 --> 01:05:58.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was Kinda like,</v>

1612
01:05:58.570 --> 01:05:59.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate that and I'd be like,</v>

1613
01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:01.510
<v Speaker 4>no thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she got like,</v>

1614
01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>increasingly like you have to kill this</v>

1615
01:06:04.511 --> 01:06:05.890
<v Speaker 4>project.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she started crying.</v>

1616
01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.860
<v Speaker 4>It was like very bizarre phone call.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm super confused.</v>

1617
01:06:08.861 --> 01:06:12.550
<v Speaker 4>So your project was to take the masks</v>
<v Speaker 4>off trolls.</v>

1618
01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.710
<v Speaker 4>Figuratively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd never had built a technology.</v>

1619
01:06:14.711 --> 01:06:17.290
<v Speaker 4>We never like what we were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what we were going to literally do</v>

1620
01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:22.320
<v Speaker 4>was archive facebook messages because</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids on the Internet will being</v>

1621
01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:24.720
<v Speaker 4>ruthless.</v>

1622
01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.301
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>

1623
01:06:25.301 --> 01:06:28.510
<v Speaker 4>Their messages and archive it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why don't you have an issue with</v>

1624
01:06:28.511 --> 01:06:29.260
<v Speaker 4>this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand.</v>

1625
01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.960
<v Speaker 4>My kickstarter said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I said a word that made them</v>

1626
01:06:31.961 --> 01:06:34.120
<v Speaker 4>think that we were going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>unmask twitter trolls,</v>

1627
01:06:34.121 --> 01:06:37.540
<v Speaker 4>like a tow something that we had never</v>
<v Speaker 4>even thought of that like literally like</v>

1628
01:06:37.541 --> 01:06:42.250
<v Speaker 4>that we were gonna be able to like build</v>
<v Speaker 4>the technology name is going to be like</v>

1629
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:45.190
<v Speaker 4>that's Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1630
01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:47.110
<v Speaker 4>we did not build this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like crazy.</v>

1631
01:06:47.111 --> 01:06:49.750
<v Speaker 4>Like we literally had an idea to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>better place.</v>

1632
01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.780
<v Speaker 4>If I know I actually not opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1633
01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:54.370
<v Speaker 4>but we weren't building it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1634
01:06:54.371 --> 01:06:56.120
<v Speaker 4>that was she opposed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm so,</v>

1635
01:06:56.330 --> 01:06:57.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bread and butter of the Gamer Gate</v>

1636
01:06:57.731 --> 01:06:59.650
<v Speaker 4>scandal is that people say she harassed</v>
<v Speaker 4>herself.</v>

1637
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:02.440
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know this.</v>

1638
01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:03.790
<v Speaker 4>I just hung up the phone with her.</v>

1639
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:06.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hung up the phone with her and she was</v>

1640
01:07:06.641 --> 01:07:08.740
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go through with this project her,</v>

1641
01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:11.290
<v Speaker 4>these were her last words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to ruin everything.</v>

1642
01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.540
<v Speaker 4>Crying and hangs up the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1643
01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.480
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

1644
01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:19.730
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying that people think this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the Gamer Gate scandal.</v>

1645
01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.900
<v Speaker 4>She harassed herself in order to get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>left media helped her and launched like</v>

1646
01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:27.610
<v Speaker 4>a thousand charities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like all of these girls harassed</v>

1647
01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:29.410
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is like literally why Milo's</v>

1648
01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:31.550
<v Speaker 4>some people have definitely harassed</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

1649
01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:32.350
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the whole,</v>

1650
01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:35.890
<v Speaker 4>she was the first person that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>started with and everyone of these</v>

1651
01:07:35.891 --> 01:07:36.790
<v Speaker 4>gamers like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mind you,</v>

1652
01:07:36.791 --> 01:07:38.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Gamer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just telling you the two sides that</v>

1653
01:07:38.951 --> 01:07:40.840
<v Speaker 4>I walked into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know.</v>

1654
01:07:40.841 --> 01:07:42.640
<v Speaker 4>So I hang up the phone with her and nice</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a tweet that was like,</v>

1655
01:07:42.641 --> 01:07:45.070
<v Speaker 4>don't know who zoe Quinn is and I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell you this girl has never been</v>

1656
01:07:45.071 --> 01:07:48.990
<v Speaker 4>harassed and the world breaks what I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to say.</v>

1657
01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:50.250
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the finished resends.</v>

1658
01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:53.500
<v Speaker 4>I know some people have harassed</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

1659
01:07:53.501 --> 01:07:56.320
<v Speaker 4>They faked it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but way more people have actually been</v>

1660
01:07:56.321 --> 01:07:58.480
<v Speaker 4>harassed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure I agree.</v>

1661
01:07:58.481 --> 01:08:01.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying that her in particular</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you say by talking to her,</v>

1662
01:08:01.601 --> 01:08:02.860
<v Speaker 4>she's never been around 100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1663
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:03.321
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1664
01:08:03.321 --> 01:08:06.970
<v Speaker 4>I know like I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>victims don't like,</v>

1665
01:08:06.971 --> 01:08:10.410
<v Speaker 4>you would never like be like I'm the</v>
<v Speaker 4>victim of it.</v>

1666
01:08:10.411 --> 01:08:14.220
<v Speaker 4>It's something that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

1667
01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 4>here that's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I hang up the phone with her.</v>

1668
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:20.540
<v Speaker 4>I tweet this within one hour we start</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting inundated.</v>

1669
01:08:20.541 --> 01:08:21.410
<v Speaker 4>Just like she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she said,</v>

1670
01:08:21.411 --> 01:08:23.990
<v Speaker 4>if you don't kill the project,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean trump supporters are going to</v>

1671
01:08:23.991 --> 01:08:26.090
<v Speaker 4>come after you and start harassing you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like literally,</v>

1672
01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:31.120
<v Speaker 4>like we're getting inundated with emails</v>
<v Speaker 4>that say like Bob@trumpfortyfive.com and</v>

1673
01:08:31.551 --> 01:08:34.880
<v Speaker 4>they're like die and were die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you go through it like we're</v>

1674
01:08:34.881 --> 01:08:35.990
<v Speaker 4>going kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like the most,</v>

1675
01:08:35.991 --> 01:08:37.700
<v Speaker 4>like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this is kind of perfect,</v>

1676
01:08:37.701 --> 01:08:37.970
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1677
01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:42.170
<v Speaker 4>Like you warn me and then it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like within an hour we had had no</v>

1678
01:08:42.171 --> 01:08:43.070
<v Speaker 4>messages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing,</v>

1679
01:08:43.071 --> 01:08:45.400
<v Speaker 4>and then all of a sudden I was full on</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1680
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:46.011
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1681

<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no sweetheart,</v>

<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1683
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.990
<v Speaker 4>And she had been accused of doing this</v>
<v Speaker 4>like five times.</v>

1684
01:08:50.991 --> 01:08:54.200
<v Speaker 4>Like it wasn't like Milo and Breitbart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just covering all of the instances</v>

1685
01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:57.920
<v Speaker 4>that people have accused her of like she</v>
<v Speaker 4>calls them and then they get harassed.</v>

1686
01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:00.590
<v Speaker 4>She calls them and then they get</v>
<v Speaker 4>harassed and I didn't give up.</v>

1687
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:02.360
<v Speaker 4>I had no horse in the race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care about,</v>

1688
01:09:02.361 --> 01:09:03.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gamers respectfully.</v>

1689
01:09:03.861 --> 01:09:06.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't game right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't care about politics,</v>

1690
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:07.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>respectfully.</v>

1691
01:09:07.521 --> 01:09:10.670
<v Speaker 4>At that time it wasn't politicking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just had a phone call with the girl.</v>

1692
01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:12.530
<v Speaker 4>It was a little weird phone call and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I suddenly,</v>

1693
01:09:12.531 --> 01:09:16.380
<v Speaker 4>I was getting inundated with emails and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just making youtube videos at the time.</v>

1694
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.620
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was literally like fully doing this</v>

1695
01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:21.560
<v Speaker 4>degree with anything and I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>really try to build this high school,</v>

1696
01:09:21.561 --> 01:09:24.590
<v Speaker 4>like this thing to help kids that</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone says you docs minors like</v>

1697
01:09:24.591 --> 01:09:26.960
<v Speaker 4>literally like we were building this</v>
<v Speaker 4>platform is that children will never</v>

1698
01:09:26.961 --> 01:09:29.720
<v Speaker 4>have to be like get in serious trouble</v>
<v Speaker 4>for doing stupid stuff.</v>

1699
01:09:29.721 --> 01:09:32.390
<v Speaker 4>Like via technology ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did she get your contact?</v>

1700
01:09:32.391 --> 01:09:33.560
<v Speaker 4>She messaged me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gave it to her.</v>

1701
01:09:33.561 --> 01:09:35.780
<v Speaker 4>She messaged me on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she was burnt,</v>

1702
01:09:35.781 --> 01:09:39.380
<v Speaker 4>which are something that you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it literally her Hannah was burnt</v>

1703
01:09:39.381 --> 01:09:41.930
<v Speaker 4>rich and like at that time I wasn't even</v>
<v Speaker 4>like on twitter,</v>

1704
01:09:41.931 --> 01:09:45.140
<v Speaker 4>like I had just made a twitter profile</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I see someone that has a check mark</v>

1705
01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:47.060
<v Speaker 4>and it says like official whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>handle of twitter.</v>

1706
01:09:47.061 --> 01:09:49.130
<v Speaker 4>So what seems more official than like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>check mark?</v>

1707
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:51.410
<v Speaker 4>And so I was like here's my number,</v>
<v Speaker 4>call me.</v>

1708
01:09:51.411 --> 01:09:52.330

<v Speaker 4>you're going to have a conversation with</v>

1710
01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:57.860
<v Speaker 4>that maybe wants to partner with me</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm like oh this girl's been</v>

1711
01:09:57.861 --> 01:09:59.780
<v Speaker 4>harassed on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe she'll like want to help</v>

1712
01:09:59.781 --> 01:10:00.614
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1713
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Alice in Wonderland,</v>

1714
01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:07.340
<v Speaker 4>like totally like insane alice in</v>
<v Speaker 4>wonderland and then like all of a sudden</v>

<v Speaker 4>smoking.</v>

1716
01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:14.570
<v Speaker 4>So you think that someone orchestrated</v>

1717
01:10:15.351 --> 01:10:18.170

<v Speaker 4>That was my,</v>

1718
01:10:18.171 --> 01:10:19.040
<v Speaker 4>like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>harassment people.</v>

1723
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:30.090
<v Speaker 4>She was saying that you were going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get harassed by trump supporters.</v>

1724
01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:32.480
<v Speaker 4>She said she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she didn't say trump supporters.</v>

1725
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:34.360
<v Speaker 4>They all have their addresses happened</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they would actually have like weird porn</v>

1728
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.751
<v Speaker 4>handles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like weird handles,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I still have them.</v>

1731
01:10:42.651 --> 01:10:45.170
<v Speaker 4>I would have to pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did she think that someone was going</v>

1732
01:10:45.171 --> 01:10:45.921
<v Speaker 4>to harass you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1733
01:10:45.921 --> 01:10:49.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm still confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was saying she was trolls.</v>

1734
01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:51.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what she said when the</v>

1735
01:10:51.051 --> 01:10:53.620
<v Speaker 4>Gamergate people like these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these anonymous men who were harassed</v>

1736
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:54.770
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that harassed me,</v>

1737
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:56.120
<v Speaker 4>when they see what you're working on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna,</v>

1738
01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:57.620
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna Freak out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do it.</v>

1739
01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.790
<v Speaker 4>They've ruined my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1740
01:10:58.820 --> 01:10:59.780
<v Speaker 4>she's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she started saying,</v>

1741
01:10:59.781 --> 01:11:00.770
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get doxed.</v>

1742
01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:02.450
<v Speaker 4>They're going to find out what your</v>
<v Speaker 4>parent lives.</v>

1743
01:11:02.451 --> 01:11:06.080
<v Speaker 4>And like literally after that someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>sent me like a map and they had dogs to</v>

1744
01:11:06.081 --> 01:11:07.560
<v Speaker 4>my family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like my grandmother,</v>

1745
01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.560
<v Speaker 4>like where she lives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my grandfather.</v>

1746
01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:13.960
<v Speaker 4>Like it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was what she said was going to happen to</v>

1747
01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:16.880
<v Speaker 4>you contacting her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you think that she did.</v>

1748
01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:19.380
<v Speaker 4>She did it like I've said this a</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand times.</v>

1749
01:11:19.381 --> 01:11:20.730
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the second I said it,</v>

1750
01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:23.310
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden the New York magazine in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Washington Post tried to smear me</v>

1751
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:24.900
<v Speaker 4>instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instantly.</v>

1752
01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.750
<v Speaker 4>At that time I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1753
01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.320
<v Speaker 4>it's not implausible with the timeframe</v>
<v Speaker 4>of getting no.</v>

1754
01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:35.670
<v Speaker 4>Nobody messaging me right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To her calling me all of this flooding</v>

1755
01:11:35.671 --> 01:11:36.930
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the New York magazine,</v>

1756
01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:39.810
<v Speaker 4>I was a girl on kickstarter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why the hell is the Washington Post</v>

1757
01:11:39.811 --> 01:11:42.930
<v Speaker 4>calling me after I tweet this girl</v>
<v Speaker 4>harassed yourself,</v>

1758
01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:47.520
<v Speaker 4>the Washington Post New York magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the usual suspects right now,</v>

1759
01:11:47.521 --> 01:11:47.880
<v Speaker 4>the usual.</v>

1760
01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.140
<v Speaker 4>So at that time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh great.</v>

1761
01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:51.270
<v Speaker 4>The Washington Post,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1762
01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.900
<v Speaker 4>totally an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1763
01:11:53.290 --> 01:11:54.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're rushing to say like,</v>

1764
01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.040
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>candice got confused.</v>

1765
01:11:56.041 --> 01:11:56.521
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1766
01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:58.500
<v Speaker 4>it's been a long time internet</v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy.</v>

1767
01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.110
<v Speaker 4>So we Quinn's harassed herself and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada's got sucked in and like,</v>

1768
01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what Gamergate is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1769
01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:04.790
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know this article is about,</v>

1770
01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:08.040
<v Speaker 4>had no idea that there was accusations</v>
<v Speaker 4>that she had arrived.</v>

1771
01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.440
<v Speaker 4>Zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none.</v>

1772
01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.080
<v Speaker 4>The hall been harassed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an instinct.</v>

1773
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:16.350
<v Speaker 4>One instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got in the middle of a cultural</v>

1774
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:18.360
<v Speaker 4>war and people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get in touch with Nero.</v>

1775
01:12:18.361 --> 01:12:19.021
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

1776
01:12:19.021 --> 01:12:21.470
<v Speaker 4>is nero was Milo Yiannopoulos or the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tucker again,</v>

1777
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:23.310
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though like you just like landed.</v>

1778
01:12:23.311 --> 01:12:25.590
<v Speaker 4>And then people that I thought were</v>
<v Speaker 4>white nationalists,</v>

1779
01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:28.410
<v Speaker 4>which was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Breitbart was the only publication that</v>

1780
01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:30.420
<v Speaker 4>was like just telling the truth about</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happening.</v>

1781
01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:32.060
<v Speaker 4>Like just saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this girl jumped on kickstarter this</v>

1782
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.380
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's no pulling no leg in this race to</v>

1783
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:35.730
<v Speaker 4>nonpolitical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not end like,</v>

1784
01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:38.170
<v Speaker 4>this is what she says happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was just a,</v>

1785
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:42.690
<v Speaker 4>it was a very bizarre situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it changed my life because the</v>

1786
01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:47.580
<v Speaker 4>people that I would have thought in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>moment would have like come after me and</v>

1787
01:12:47.581 --> 01:12:51.780
<v Speaker 4>said awful things about me or said like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're the people that were very kind,</v>

1788
01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:52.501
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1789
01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:53.940
<v Speaker 4>at that time I would've said I was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>liberal,</v>

1790
01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:55.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have said like,</v>

1791
01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:58.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I supported Bernie Sanders or Hillary</v>

1792
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.591
<v Speaker 4>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1793
01:12:58.591 --> 01:13:00.540
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He probably wasn't politically active.</v>

1794
01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:05.130
<v Speaker 4>And people that were like reaching down</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just being kind were like Mike</v>

1795
01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 4>Cernovich,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who if I googled his name,</v>

1796
01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.360
<v Speaker 4>said it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was like a white supremacist.</v>

1797
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:12.720
<v Speaker 4>So it just was like a weird thing.</v>

1798
01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:15.300
<v Speaker 4>Like my whole life just went like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1799
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.990
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1800
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:18.300
<v Speaker 4>So one interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all it took.</v>

1801
01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:23.100
<v Speaker 4>It's a subsequent firestorm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there ever been any proof at all</v>

1802
01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:26.460
<v Speaker 4>who's done what you think she did?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a bunch of people saying the same</v>

1803
01:13:26.461 --> 01:13:28.980
<v Speaker 4>thing that had nothing to do with one</v>
<v Speaker 4>another in different situations and the</v>

1804
01:13:28.981 --> 01:13:31.570
<v Speaker 4>media refusing to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to um,</v>

1805
01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:34.650
<v Speaker 4>so like one of those blamed the victim</v>
<v Speaker 4>things nobody wants,</v>

1806
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:38.520
<v Speaker 4>unless there's just overwhelming and she</v>
<v Speaker 4>never responds like I've said it,</v>

1807
01:13:38.530 --> 01:13:40.060
<v Speaker 4>a thousand things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she harassed her,</v>

1808
01:13:40.061 --> 01:13:43.080
<v Speaker 4>like she never responds and I stick by</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1809
01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.420
<v Speaker 4>I'll never veer from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was.</v>

1810
01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:47.250
<v Speaker 4>But I always say that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was my moment,</v>

1811
01:13:47.251 --> 01:13:49.680
<v Speaker 4>like this project that I had never even</v>
<v Speaker 4>built out.</v>

1812
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.270
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that changed everything.</v>

1813
01:13:52.271 --> 01:13:56.720
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stopped the project and I subsequently</v>

1814
01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:58.650
<v Speaker 4>just wanted to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I just like,</v>

1815
01:13:58.651 --> 01:14:02.640
<v Speaker 4>is it possible that I got to 26 years</v>
<v Speaker 4>old and have everything wrong about</v>

1816
01:14:02.641 --> 01:14:04.090
<v Speaker 4>people that I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1817
01:14:04.150 --> 01:14:05.820
<v Speaker 4>I was just believing in the background.</v>

1818
01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:08.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that anybody that CNN said this one</v>

1819
01:14:08.641 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 4>interaction with one person that may or</v>
<v Speaker 4>not be deceptive,</v>

1820
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:15.220
<v Speaker 4>why would that make you switch political</v>
<v Speaker 4>affiliation?</v>

1821
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:17.260
<v Speaker 4>It was even switching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't politically active.</v>

1822
01:14:17.261 --> 01:14:20.020
<v Speaker 4>I just like if you had asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would've said I wasn't.</v>

1823
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:21.190
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was never,</v>

1824
01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:23.170
<v Speaker 4>I was never a girl wearing a pussy hat</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside.</v>

1825
01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:25.690
<v Speaker 4>Like people don't understand if if</v>
<v Speaker 4>chest,</v>

1826
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:26.553
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1827
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:31.830
<v Speaker 4>if press now that I think of like where</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm at now and talking about how I hate</v>

1828
01:14:32.261 --> 01:14:34.210
<v Speaker 4>labels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was probably already a conservative</v>

1829
01:14:34.211 --> 01:14:37.720
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't give a shit about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had $100,000 in student loan debt and</v>

1830
01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:39.490
<v Speaker 4>I was just trying to pay back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1831
01:14:39.491 --> 01:14:41.680
<v Speaker 4>That was my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing about politics,</v>

1832
01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:44.560
<v Speaker 4>but at that moment it made me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was forced to me to consider my</v>

1833
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:48.040
<v Speaker 4>political affiliations because I had me</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying this.</v>

1834
01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1835
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.340
<v Speaker 4>the New York magazine like tried to</v>
<v Speaker 4>smear me.</v>

1836
01:14:51.341 --> 01:14:54.520
<v Speaker 4>I say the Washington Post I just made me</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the exact same time Donald Trump is</v>

1837
01:14:54.521 --> 01:14:56.230
<v Speaker 4>getting on a stage and he's saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fake news.</v>

1838
01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:59.880
<v Speaker 4>It was just this divine moment trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>smear you.</v>

1839
01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.240
<v Speaker 4>So they called me and pretended to be my</v>
<v Speaker 4>friend.</v>

1840
01:15:02.241 --> 01:15:03.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just wanna know what happened.</v>

1841
01:15:03.761 --> 01:15:06.370
<v Speaker 4>Like I told him the story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gave him messages of like Zoe,</v>

1842
01:15:06.371 --> 01:15:10.150
<v Speaker 4>the timestamps that the hate vibe and</v>
<v Speaker 4>receiving and then the articles that</v>

1843
01:15:10.151 --> 01:15:11.800
<v Speaker 4>they wrote were like the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1844
01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:13.480

<v Speaker 4>the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like insane stuff.</v>

1846

<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm like,</v>

1847
01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:18.220

<v Speaker 4>the Washington Post actually,</v>

1848
01:15:18.221 --> 01:15:22.360
<v Speaker 4>because I caught them in a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I recorded the conversation and the</v>

1849
01:15:22.361 --> 01:15:25.660
<v Speaker 4>email of what she wrote didn't match.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They pulled the article.</v>

1850
01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.030
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you run this article,</v>

1851
01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:28.660
<v Speaker 4>I will sue you guys for libel.</v>

1852
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:30.430
<v Speaker 4>And the manager pulled the article and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

1853
01:15:30.431 --> 01:15:31.780
<v Speaker 4>you're not even relevant or even</v>
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

1854
01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.670
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to run this article I'm</v>

1855
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:35.680
<v Speaker 4>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still have it.</v>

1856
01:15:35.710 --> 01:15:37.520
<v Speaker 4>They were ready to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were ready to lie.</v>

1857
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:41.350
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to make it seem that I</v>

1858
01:15:41.351 --> 01:15:44.020
<v Speaker 4>had like they were trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was funding.</v>

1859
01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:47.620
<v Speaker 4>So like social autopsy was what that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>the like what the journalists were</v>

1860
01:15:47.621 --> 01:15:48.790
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out for whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason,</v>

1861
01:15:48.791 --> 01:15:51.220
<v Speaker 4>like who's helping you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I refused to say any names,</v>

1862
01:15:51.221 --> 01:15:53.020
<v Speaker 4>I just got that weird gut feeling on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>phone.</v>

1863
01:15:53.021 --> 01:15:54.010
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>this girl has been harassing her.</v>

1865
01:15:55.661 --> 01:15:58.420
<v Speaker 4>So why are you trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 4>where I'm getting money from?</v>

1866
01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.510
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1867
01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:03.100
<v Speaker 4>and when I refuse to answer the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the girl was going to like,</v>

1868
01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:07.330
<v Speaker 4>lied and tried to say that I had said</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain names that she was just trying</v>

1869
01:16:07.331 --> 01:16:11.740
<v Speaker 4>to get like other anti bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like organizations to come out and say I</v>

1870
01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:12.310
<v Speaker 4>was a liar.</v>

1871
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:15.430
<v Speaker 4>Like say I was working with them but I</v>
<v Speaker 4>had never said any names throughout the</v>

1872
01:16:15.431 --> 01:16:18.970
<v Speaker 4>phone and somebody gave me a tip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the antique,</v>

1873
01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:21.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna say the name of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They gave me a tip and said that,</v>

1874
01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:23.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they called and you know,</v>

1875
01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:24.760
<v Speaker 4>did you tell them this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

1876
01:16:24.761 --> 01:16:25.421
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1877
01:16:25.421 --> 01:16:27.160
<v Speaker 4>I literally have the recording.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were like,</v>

1878
01:16:27.161 --> 01:16:30.520
<v Speaker 4>you need to lawyer up like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Washington Post is trying to smear you</v>

1879
01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.740
<v Speaker 4>if.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he just wasn't that they said</v>

1880
01:16:32.741 --> 01:16:36.700
<v Speaker 4>that you hadn't said they were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>say that they were basically going to</v>

1881
01:16:36.701 --> 01:16:41.701
<v Speaker 4>try to get a really reputable</v>
<v Speaker 4>anti-bullying company to issue a strong</v>

1882
01:16:41.741 --> 01:16:44.800
<v Speaker 4>statement against me calling me a liar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this company,</v>

1883
01:16:44.801 --> 01:16:47.170
<v Speaker 4>because I had been in touch with them</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I had been on the phone with</v>

1884
01:16:47.171 --> 01:16:49.510
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had a sense that it just wasn't like</v>

1885
01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.430
<v Speaker 4>they didn't feel good out the reporter</v>
<v Speaker 4>either,</v>

1886
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:54.730
<v Speaker 4>so they gave me a heads up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had actually recorded the conversation</v>

1887
01:16:54.731 --> 01:16:57.970
<v Speaker 4>with the Washington Post was in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation that they didn't want to</v>

1888
01:16:57.971 --> 01:17:00.370
<v Speaker 4>prove they were going to print.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That like I said,</v>

1889
01:17:00.371 --> 01:17:05.290
<v Speaker 4>that this company was supporting me and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they reached out to that company and</v>

1890
01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.820
<v Speaker 4>that company denied it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I had never said that they was just</v>

1891
01:17:07.821 --> 01:17:09.890
<v Speaker 4>the way to say that I was a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never said it.</v>

1892
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:12.290
<v Speaker 3>You get what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The conversation.</v>

1893
01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my instinct was just like,</v>

1894
01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.380
<v Speaker 3>record the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine like you go through that and</v>

1895
01:17:18.381 --> 01:17:20.000
<v Speaker 3>then Donald Trump gets on the stage and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

1896
01:17:20.001 --> 01:17:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Washington Post is fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Bezos is like,</v>

1897
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:25.550
<v Speaker 3>it was just like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like order things from Amazon.</v>

1898
01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:29.010
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1900
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:33.800
<v Speaker 3>It's just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I shouldn't.</v>

1901
01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:35.230
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what do you need?</v>

1902
01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:36.390
<v Speaker 3>Crazy glue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bab.</v>

1903
01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.060
<v Speaker 3>I hear there's another company coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and</v>

1904
01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:44.000
<v Speaker 3>he's got us all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I lot shit off Amazon.</v>

1905
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.870
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1906
01:17:44.871 --> 01:17:46.190
<v Speaker 3>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even deny it.</v>

1907
01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.380
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just shows it's there.</v>

1908
01:17:48.381 --> 01:17:49.880
<v Speaker 3>It's just when you get home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's there.</v>

1909
01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:52.550
<v Speaker 3>It's home to you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he has anything to do with</v>

1910
01:17:52.551 --> 01:17:54.640
<v Speaker 3>the Washington Post?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he bought it.</v>

1911
01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:58.820
<v Speaker 3>It's his personal diary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now of course,</v>

1912
01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:02.570
<v Speaker 3>if you have you seen the stuff that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were their publishing show subscribe to</v>

1913
01:18:02.571 --> 01:18:05.780
<v Speaker 3>it online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning I pay to get it online,</v>

1914
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:06.890
<v Speaker 3>pay for propaganda.</v>

1915
01:18:07.290 --> 01:18:08.850
<v Speaker 3>Well occasionally I have a good story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1916
01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:11.350
<v Speaker 3>it's all it's propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1917
01:18:11.351 --> 01:18:13.330
<v Speaker 3>I can't take any other article series</v>
<v Speaker 3>this up.</v>

1918
01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.140
<v Speaker 3>They've run and that they've said it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like it just everything.</v>

1919
01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:20.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean like the stuff that you read like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Washington Post lately.</v>

1920
01:18:20.690 --> 01:18:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Do you like what was the last good</v>
<v Speaker 3>article?</v>

1921
01:18:22.311 --> 01:18:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the last that you thought this</v>

1922
01:18:24.261 --> 01:18:27.310
<v Speaker 3>was a fair and balanced reporting job by</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington Post?</v>

1923
01:18:27.311 --> 01:18:29.480
<v Speaker 3>They don't hate trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just went to report the news.</v>

1924
01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Difficult question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I read too many articles.</v>

1925
01:18:31.341 --> 01:18:34.250
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to go back and see which one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the number one?</v>

1926
01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:36.960
<v Speaker 3>What's the number one article on the top</v>
<v Speaker 3>of today?</v>

1927
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:38.960
<v Speaker 3>Right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be an interesting question.</v>

1928
01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Let's get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get a trump.</v>

1929
01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.200

1930
01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:47.480
<v Speaker 3>Will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be saying because it correlates</v>

1931
01:18:47.481 --> 01:18:48.450
<v Speaker 3>to trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's,</v>

1932
01:18:48.451 --> 01:18:49.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's her face be?</v>

1933
01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.390

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Miranda metal.</v>

1935
01:18:55.791 --> 01:19:00.791
<v Speaker 3>Tariffs trigger retaliation from Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will trade war that Samantha Bee,</v>

1936
01:19:02.931 --> 01:19:04.580
<v Speaker 3>apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After White House.</v>

1937
01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:08.310
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't condemnation calling Ivanka</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump a vulgar word I went to.</v>

1938
01:19:09.670 --> 01:19:12.890
<v Speaker 3>They're forgiving her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forgiving her in that.</v>

1939
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.170
<v Speaker 3>Just thinking of the headlines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1940
01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.910
<v Speaker 3>She apologized and she looks nice in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that picture.</v>

1941
01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Will be forgiving her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She apologizes after combination.</v>

1942
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:25.350

<v Speaker 3>Why don't they just can come on camera</v>

1943
01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.640
<v Speaker 3>for airing the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1944
01:19:28.641 --> 01:19:30.560
<v Speaker 3>they did it on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>

1945
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute was on her TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cut The fuck was on TV.</v>

1946
01:19:36.231 --> 01:19:40.850
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's tbs had to apologize to tbs said</v>

1947
01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:41.750
<v Speaker 3>Gunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1948
01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:46.960
<v Speaker 3>it was on her shows on tbs say cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the word they just apologize for.</v>

1949
01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:47.501
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1950
01:19:47.501 --> 01:19:49.790
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying did they air the actual word</v>

1951
01:19:49.791 --> 01:19:51.410
<v Speaker 3>or did they beat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1952
01:19:51.411 --> 01:19:52.330
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1953
01:19:52.331 --> 01:19:55.220
<v Speaker 3>You remember when Steven Colbert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he,</v>

1954
01:19:55.221 --> 01:19:56.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said he,</v>

1955
01:19:56.091 --> 01:20:00.920
<v Speaker 3>that trump uses a Putin uses trump's</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth for his cock holster.</v>

1956
01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:03.570
<v Speaker 3>That shit's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm,</v>

1957
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:08.330
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would lose their mind.</v>

1958
01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Just imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine people that get it the worst are</v>

1959
01:20:11.221 --> 01:20:14.700
<v Speaker 3>black conservatives like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we get the things that people say</v>

1960
01:20:14.701 --> 01:20:16.950
<v Speaker 3>to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's bizarre now is white</v>

1961
01:20:16.951 --> 01:20:17.460
<v Speaker 3>liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1962
01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:18.720
<v Speaker 3>they just feel comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>

1963
01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:20.400
<v Speaker 3>why to like this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like so weird.</v>

1964
01:20:20.401 --> 01:20:22.020
<v Speaker 3>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll write and they'll say anything</v>

1965
01:20:22.021 --> 01:20:24.350
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>TBS networks.</v>

1966
01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.450
<v Speaker 3>It's taking the right action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right action,</v>

1967
01:20:26.451 --> 01:20:31.290
<v Speaker 3>and apologizing for the vial and</v>
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate language used about Ivanka</v>

1968
01:20:31.291 --> 01:20:33.540
<v Speaker 3>trump last night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those words should not have been aired.</v>

1969
01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:34.860
<v Speaker 3>It was our mistake too.</v>

1970
01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:36.760
<v Speaker 3>And we regretted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>

1971
01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:41.640
<v Speaker 3>I do not like the way they worded that</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's taken the right action.</v>

1972
01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:42.533
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1973
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:47.600
<v Speaker 3>they have a positive action attributed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to her before that negative.</v>

1974
01:20:48.051 --> 01:20:49.710
<v Speaker 3>When you read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you read what,</v>

1975
01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:51.300
<v Speaker 3>how they're going to interpret it while</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was there.</v>

1976
01:20:51.301 --> 01:20:52.560
<v Speaker 3>It's always going to be going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive,</v>

1977
01:20:52.561 --> 01:20:55.620
<v Speaker 3>but it's just not going to get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's oddly positive.</v>

1978
01:20:55.621 --> 01:20:58.740
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to know because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a double standard is double</v>

1979
01:20:58.741 --> 01:21:00.990
<v Speaker 3>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is what I heard Roseanne when</v>

1980
01:21:00.991 --> 01:21:02.700
<v Speaker 3>she had the number one show in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

1981
01:21:02.701 --> 01:21:05.160
<v Speaker 3>they just threw away a lot of money with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one.</v>

1982
01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also,</v>

1983
01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:10.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and did a lot of jobs for people to hook</v>

1984
01:21:10.261 --> 01:21:12.000
<v Speaker 3>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she doesn't want to do it</v>

1985
01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:13.470
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking to Roseanne.</v>

1986
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:16.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Personally I think she was so worn out</v>

1987
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:17.940
<v Speaker 3>from doing that show.</v>

1988
01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:20.650
<v Speaker 3>She's 66 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1989
01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:24.810
<v Speaker 3>and she's not in the best of health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she told me she got bronchitis doing</v>

1990
01:21:24.811 --> 01:21:26.580
<v Speaker 3>the show and she almost died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

1991
01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:29.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm too fucking old for this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this anyway.</v>

1992
01:21:29.311 --> 01:21:31.980
<v Speaker 3>And they were wearing me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wish that there was just a little</v>

1993
01:21:31.981 --> 01:21:36.180
<v Speaker 3>more humanity like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not saying that it's just like I</v>

1994
01:21:36.181 --> 01:21:40.380
<v Speaker 3>really fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strongly dislike something about the</v>

1995
01:21:40.381 --> 01:21:44.490
<v Speaker 3>outrage culture and the willingness to</v>
<v Speaker 3>forego the fact that she's a human being</v>

1996
01:21:44.491 --> 01:21:46.830
<v Speaker 3>and human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's something about people that</v>

1997
01:21:46.831 --> 01:21:51.450
<v Speaker 3>they believe that human beings are</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectible and tractable.</v>

1998
01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.970
<v Speaker 3>I think that this is something that left</v>
<v Speaker 3>has sold the idea that it's predictable,</v>

1999
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:58.080
<v Speaker 3>that you can defeat racism with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right person in office.</v>

2000
01:21:58.081 --> 01:21:59.480
<v Speaker 3>That you can like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2001
01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:00.690
<v Speaker 3>defeat sexism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2002
01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.990
<v Speaker 3>you can defeat massage and this is not</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

2003
01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:06.870
<v Speaker 3>You can't defeat these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bad things happen because human beings</v>

2004
01:22:06.871 --> 01:22:08.250
<v Speaker 3>are constantly learning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're flawed,</v>

2005
01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:11.460
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't you think that ultimately the</v>

2006
01:22:11.461 --> 01:22:14.280
<v Speaker 3>direction that we're all moving in as</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings,</v>

2007
01:22:14.610 --> 01:22:18.780
<v Speaker 3>if you looked at human beings from 3000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago to human beings have today</v>

2008
01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:24.050
<v Speaker 3>we're moving in a general direction of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more positive culture</v>

2009
01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.900
<v Speaker 3>does to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to me it does.</v>

2010
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:30.290
<v Speaker 3>Do is negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could both agree,</v>

2011
01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:33.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't be depleted,</v>

2012
01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.760
<v Speaker 3>but don't you think it can be shunned</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of society?</v>

2013
01:22:35.761 --> 01:22:38.130
<v Speaker 3>Slowly but surely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people realize there's repercussions</v>

2014
01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:40.920
<v Speaker 3>for racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're operating from a fear.</v>

2015
01:22:40.921 --> 01:22:43.020
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean that you're not racist</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're afraid to say it.</v>

2016
01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people realize that,</v>

2017
01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:47.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hurts people's feelings and it causes</v>

2018
01:22:47.731 --> 01:22:50.970
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of issues and no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe no human beings,</v>

2019
01:22:50.971 --> 01:22:53.340
<v Speaker 3>especially when they're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've learned this all the time when</v>

2020
01:22:53.341 --> 01:22:55.200
<v Speaker 3>they were in a spot where they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally unhappy.</v>

2021
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:56.830
<v Speaker 3>It's very easy for them to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2022
01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.660
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2023
01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:00.600
<v Speaker 3>lash out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you find someone who's just</v>

2024
01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:01.630
<v Speaker 3>miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2025
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:02.663
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2026
01:23:02.670 --> 01:23:04.560
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno the career,</v>

2027
01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:05.800
<v Speaker 3>the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

2028
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

2029
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:10.960
<v Speaker 4>person is much more likely to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's vitriolic and that's</v>

2030
01:23:10.961 --> 01:23:12.400
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the human condition.</v>

2031
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:15.070
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you lash out at someone else.</v>

2032
01:23:15.230 --> 01:23:18.730
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't you think that human beings in</v>

2033
01:23:18.731 --> 01:23:22.900
<v Speaker 4>general are less racist today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certainly less racist publicly in</v>

2034
01:23:22.901 --> 01:23:25.660
<v Speaker 4>America than 1950.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my gosh,</v>

2035
01:23:25.661 --> 01:23:28.760
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No questions past eight years ago.</v>

2036
01:23:28.761 --> 01:23:30.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we go back 68 years ago,</v>

2037
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:35.170
<v Speaker 4>the world has changed for the better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what love 100 percent in terms of</v>

2038
01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.970
<v Speaker 4>the social progress progress that we've</v>
<v Speaker 4>made,</v>

2039
01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:39.970
<v Speaker 4>especially in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sixty,</v>

2040
01:23:39.971 --> 01:23:43.540
<v Speaker 4>eight years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could at least come very close to</v>

2041
01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:45.830
<v Speaker 4>eradicating racism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2042
01:23:45.970 --> 01:23:47.860
<v Speaker 4>that's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2043
01:23:47.861 --> 01:23:50.710
<v Speaker 4>so if you're talking about just America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

2044
01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:54.070
<v Speaker 4>Well let's just go with America because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's was just it up because I don't know</v>

2045
01:23:54.071 --> 01:23:57.790
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>China or wherever.</v>

2046
01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:02.820
<v Speaker 4>There's some places where racism is just</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep and they accept it.</v>

2047
01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:05.950
<v Speaker 4>That's why I say like racism never go</v>
<v Speaker 4>away,</v>

2048
01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:08.410
<v Speaker 4>but they change it up because then</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll say Americans are racist towards</v>

2049
01:24:08.411 --> 01:24:09.011
<v Speaker 4>Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2050
01:24:09.011 --> 01:24:10.420
<v Speaker 4>When you say that you're going to do the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Muslim,</v>

2051
01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:14.470
<v Speaker 4>the Muslim ban from certain countries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's also considered like racism</v>

2052
01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.600
<v Speaker 4>and not just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2053
01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:19.390
<v Speaker 4>national security,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2054
01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:22.930
<v Speaker 4>So everything sort of becomes racism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the problem with racism is nobody</v>

2055
01:24:22.931 --> 01:24:25.510
<v Speaker 4>knows it means anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is racist.</v>

2056
01:24:25.511 --> 01:24:27.520
<v Speaker 4>You can use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could the starbucks situation,</v>

2057
01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:29.290
<v Speaker 4>which to me was not racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was racist.</v>

2058
01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.560
<v Speaker 4>That racism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the starbucks.</v>

2059
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:35.200
<v Speaker 4>We have to define racism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't think that was racist?</v>

2060
01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:37.090
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that was racist.</v>

2061
01:24:37.091 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 4>I live in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in.</v>

2062
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:41.860
<v Speaker 4>So you think if those were white dudes</v>
<v Speaker 4>hanging out in starbucks,</v>

2063
01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:44.530
<v Speaker 4>not buying anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just sitting down mind their own</v>

2064
01:24:44.531 --> 01:24:49.180
<v Speaker 4>business that they would have got fucked</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the same exact picture.</v>

2065
01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.470
<v Speaker 4>So first off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in Philadelphia.</v>

2066
01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:52.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if sometimes when I'm there I'm</v>

2067
01:24:52.841 --> 01:24:54.220
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if any white people live here</v>

2068
01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:58.270
<v Speaker 4>like Philadelphia is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's 44 percent black,</v>

2069
01:24:58.310 --> 01:25:01.300
<v Speaker 4>not excluding Hispanic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>44 percent black.</v>

2070
01:25:01.301 --> 01:25:03.640
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone who works in my build,</v>

2071
01:25:03.650 --> 01:25:05.110
<v Speaker 4>everyone's black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the weirdest thing.</v>

2072
01:25:05.111 --> 01:25:06.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a very black city,</v>

2073
01:25:06.551 --> 01:25:08.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So bizarre city to be racist.</v>

2074
01:25:08.861 --> 01:25:11.380
<v Speaker 4>Outright racist in like you're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 4>with black people all day.</v>

2075
01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:14.290
<v Speaker 4>So you remove that and then you think to</v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

2076
01:25:14.291 --> 01:25:15.910
<v Speaker 4>and I've seen this happened tons of</v>
<v Speaker 4>times,</v>

2077
01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:19.810
<v Speaker 4>is it possible that this guy was just on</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a power,</v>

2078
01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:22.510
<v Speaker 4>like power trips happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it happen at the most bizarre</v>

2079
01:25:22.511 --> 01:25:23.570
<v Speaker 4>places and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2080
01:25:23.571 --> 01:25:28.571
<v Speaker 4>like at the airport the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this woman gave me absolute hell at</v>

2081
01:25:28.901 --> 01:25:30.550
<v Speaker 4>Tsa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was like I came recap,</v>

2082
01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:31.780
<v Speaker 4>it was just absolute hell.</v>

2083
01:25:32.290 --> 01:25:35.260
<v Speaker 4>I could've walked away and said she was</v>
<v Speaker 4>racist and she randomly selected my bag</v>

2084
01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:37.570
<v Speaker 4>22 times to go through and made me go</v>
<v Speaker 4>through and miss my flight.</v>

2085
01:25:37.571 --> 01:25:40.180
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or she was having a bad day and she was</v>

2086
01:25:40.181 --> 01:25:41.170
<v Speaker 4>power tripping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2087
01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:42.790
<v Speaker 4>And then people have these little</v>
<v Speaker 4>positions.</v>

2088
01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:44.980
<v Speaker 4>It's like that movie where they go door</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2089
01:25:44.981 --> 01:25:45.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>

2090
01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:48.460
<v Speaker 4>and they have these little positions</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the manager of starbucks and you're</v>

2091
01:25:48.461 --> 01:25:51.250
<v Speaker 4>having an off day and these two kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>that could have easily said,</v>

2092
01:25:51.251 --> 01:25:52.150
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll buy a cookie.</v>

2093
01:25:52.210 --> 01:25:54.160
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like common decency by the way.</v>

2094
01:25:54.161 --> 01:25:56.530
<v Speaker 4>Even for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I go use the bathroom at starbucks,</v>

2095
01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:59.910
<v Speaker 4>I'll just fricking buy a cookie or a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little juice box or water.</v>

2096
01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.090
<v Speaker 4>Just something that makes me feel all</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2097
01:26:01.091 --> 01:26:03.800
<v Speaker 4>It's a little more civilized if I just</v>
<v Speaker 4>buy something even though I'm just here</v>

2098
01:26:03.801 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 4>to use</v>

2099
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:08.510
<v Speaker 3>the bathroom like so on both ends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pee real bad and there's a line you go</v>

2100
01:26:08.511 --> 01:26:09.470
<v Speaker 3>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2101
01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.660
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably spend to the bathroom and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then buy something afterwards.</v>

2102
01:26:11.661 --> 01:26:13.190
<v Speaker 3>I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a natural thing that like,</v>

2103
01:26:13.191 --> 01:26:18.110
<v Speaker 3>it's a little more because of these guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could just be a shower and the</v>

2104
01:26:18.111 --> 01:26:22.140
<v Speaker 3>toilet because of outrage culture rich</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture and say like my cousin who is</v>

2105
01:26:22.141 --> 01:26:24.380
<v Speaker 3>half Mexican and black had to go through</v>
<v Speaker 3>this training and she works for</v>

2106
01:26:24.381 --> 01:26:25.214
<v Speaker 3>starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2107
01:26:25.690 --> 01:26:26.660
<v Speaker 3>it's to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just insane.</v>

2108
01:26:26.661 --> 01:26:28.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that this guy was power</v>

2109
01:26:28.761 --> 01:26:30.410
<v Speaker 3>tripping?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These kids were being like,</v>

2110
01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:32.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could've just bought something and</v>

2111
01:26:32.181 --> 01:26:35.210
<v Speaker 3>it could have been resolved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you had two people that are being</v>

2112
01:26:35.211 --> 01:26:37.790
<v Speaker 3>stubborn and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and taking it to as far as possible,</v>

2113
01:26:37.791 --> 01:26:39.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about like hall monitor,</v>

2114
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:41.300
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the rules and it just got too</v>

2115
01:26:41.301 --> 01:26:42.134
<v Speaker 3>far.</v>

2116
01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.450
<v Speaker 3>That could be a perspective that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

2117
01:26:44.451 --> 01:26:47.390
<v Speaker 3>But it's also possible that they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>racially selected.</v>

2118
01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:50.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's racist.</v>

2119
01:26:50.061 --> 01:26:52.070
<v Speaker 3>And looked at them and they said these</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys are black,</v>

2120
01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:57.460
<v Speaker 3>we don't want them sitting around here</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not buying anything for.</v>

2121
01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Could you remind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weren't they just waiting for their</v>

2122
01:26:59.721 --> 01:27:04.460
<v Speaker 3>friend to the whole thing didn't make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long were they sitting there for 45</v>

2123
01:27:04.461 --> 01:27:06.710
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's like until the cops got</v>

2124
01:27:06.711 --> 01:27:08.210
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably weren't.</v>

2125
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:10.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long does it take to get the cops to</v>

2126
01:27:10.041 --> 01:27:12.210
<v Speaker 3>come and fill it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like if you were sitting there,</v>

2127
01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:13.053
<v Speaker 3>I fill it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2128
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:14.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never called the cops and feel it,</v>

2129
01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:18.070
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that like Philly is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a very,</v>

2130
01:27:18.210 --> 01:27:21.620
<v Speaker 3>it's a very black city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very black city.</v>

2131
01:27:21.621 --> 01:27:22.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there with uh,</v>

2132
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:26.930
<v Speaker 3>Dave Rubin and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson.</v>

2133
01:27:26.931 --> 01:27:30.600
<v Speaker 3>Peterson opened for them and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up,</v>

2134
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:32.450
<v Speaker 3>stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up.</v>

2135
01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:35.030
<v Speaker 3>I'd be good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come out tonight.</v>

2136
01:27:35.031 --> 01:27:35.864
<v Speaker 3>I'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get you up.</v>

2137
01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:36.763
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh wait,</v>

2138
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:39.650
<v Speaker 3>no I can't because I have A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to Wyoming right after this.</v>

2139
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:42.860
<v Speaker 3>You have any ideas of what you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about if you went on stage?</v>

2140
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:45.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be really funny though,</v>

2141
01:27:45.351 --> 01:27:49.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm like randomly really funny random</v>
<v Speaker 3>noises that when people pay.</v>

2142
01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:50.870
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be really good,</v>

2143
01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:53.540
<v Speaker 3>like really good voices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like really good,</v>

2144
01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:56.990
<v Speaker 3>like I'm finding to believe that most</v>
<v Speaker 3>people think they would do really good</v>

2145
01:27:56.991 --> 01:28:00.080
<v Speaker 3>at standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard because they get nervous.</v>

2146
01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see that.</v>

2147
01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.620
<v Speaker 3>It could be just like I'm not funny</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2148
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:08.750
<v Speaker 3>I probably would if I was on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I would be like that like</v>

2149
01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.600
<v Speaker 3>stereotypical comedian that just gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely sloshed and goes out.</v>

2150
01:28:11.601 --> 01:28:13.810
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting to try to loosen up the</v>
<v Speaker 3>labs.</v>

2151
01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:18.470
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a really hard thing to try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be funny in front of a sold out room.</v>

2152
01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:22.820
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important to be objective</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's important to look at</v>

2153
01:28:22.821 --> 01:28:27.200
<v Speaker 3>something for what it really is and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's highly possible that that</v>

2154
01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:28.990
<v Speaker 3>starbucks thing was racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

2155
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.490
<v Speaker 3>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just as.</v>

2156
01:28:31.491 --> 01:28:31.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

2157
01:28:31.941 --> 01:28:35.690
<v Speaker 3>it's just as of outweighed culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's here we are.</v>

2158
01:28:35.691 --> 01:28:37.070
<v Speaker 3>It's got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be racist.</v>

2159
01:28:37.071 --> 01:28:37.870
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2160
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:40.910
<v Speaker 3>the chances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just telling you like a lot of black</v>

2161
01:28:40.911 --> 01:28:42.860
<v Speaker 3>people that come in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I work from the starbucks and reading a</v>

2162
01:28:42.861 --> 01:28:44.300
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I work from starbucks all over</v>

2163
01:28:44.301 --> 01:28:45.530
<v Speaker 3>Philadelphia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like what I do.</v>

2164
01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:47.120
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just there's.</v>

2165
01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:48.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if there's any white people</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Philadelphia.</v>

2166
01:28:48.981 --> 01:28:53.981
<v Speaker 3>I'm constantly trying to find where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what area of town where you met?</v>

2167
01:28:54.490 --> 01:28:55.910
<v Speaker 3>Tower theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where we.</v>

2168
01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:59.480
<v Speaker 3>But they probably commuted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2169
01:28:59.490 --> 01:29:01.470
<v Speaker 3>the fuck drive.</v>

2170
01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:04.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all black people,</v>

2171
01:29:05.370 --> 01:29:07.860
<v Speaker 4>so it's a bizarre place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2172
01:29:07.861 --> 01:29:08.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's rough.</v>

2173
01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:10.740
<v Speaker 4>It's really rough and people don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>

2174
01:29:10.741 --> 01:29:11.191
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2175
01:29:11.191 --> 01:29:13.590
<v Speaker 4>like it's a weird place to come to if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're racist.</v>

2176
01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:17.340
<v Speaker 4>It's like really hard to be racist and</v>
<v Speaker 4>filled up because everyone's black.</v>

2177
01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:18.080
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like</v>

2178
01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:21.290
<v Speaker 1>we went to the movies once and we saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet of the apes actually,</v>

2179
01:29:21.291 --> 01:29:25.000
<v Speaker 1>ironically in a really black</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood and then we were.</v>

2180
01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.860
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there for the UFC and it was me</v>

2181
01:29:27.861 --> 01:29:30.690
<v Speaker 1>and my again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Tommy from Connecticut and we</v>

2182
01:29:30.691 --> 01:29:34.910
<v Speaker 1>were looking for somewhere to go and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to this uber black neighborhood and</v>

2183
01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:39.500
<v Speaker 1>it was a fucking blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious because I never,</v>

2184
01:29:39.501 --> 01:29:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I never go to an all black movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>theaters,</v>

2185
01:29:41.421 --> 01:29:43.610
<v Speaker 1>but they were yelling shit at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>

2186
01:29:43.611 --> 01:29:45.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they became like it was,</v>

2187
01:29:45.930 --> 01:29:48.910
<v Speaker 1>there was the audience that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining and those,</v>

2188
01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:51.730
<v Speaker 1>a movie and Talese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one scene in the movie where</v>

2189
01:29:51.731 --> 01:29:52.131
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2190
01:29:52.131 --> 01:29:53.810
<v Speaker 1>the planet of the apes kept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the guy's name?</v>

2191
01:29:53.811 --> 01:29:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Caesar got mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2192
01:29:55.311 --> 01:29:56.144
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

2193
01:30:01.150 --> 01:30:03.460
<v Speaker 1>barbecued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were high out of our mind.</v>

2194
01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:06.120
<v Speaker 1>So the whole thing was like extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious</v>

2195
01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.280
<v Speaker 4>black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a thing.</v>

2196
01:30:07.281 --> 01:30:09.050
<v Speaker 4>It's in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So funding is so much of what I do is</v>

2197
01:30:09.051 --> 01:30:11.300
<v Speaker 4>inspired by this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like people like this,</v>

2198
01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.880
<v Speaker 4>I guess presentation of black people in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the media.</v>

2199
01:30:13.881 --> 01:30:17.570
<v Speaker 4>It actually gets me mad because to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I could be biased.</v>

2200
01:30:17.630 --> 01:30:20.330
<v Speaker 4>I think black people are like the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>like funny.</v>

2201
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:21.920
<v Speaker 4>Like we're so funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so endearing.</v>

2202
01:30:21.921 --> 01:30:24.100
<v Speaker 4>Like when I'm around my cousins like I</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

2203
01:30:24.170 --> 01:30:25.880
<v Speaker 4>there's not a better time that I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>have when I'm around.</v>

2204
01:30:25.881 --> 01:30:27.980
<v Speaker 4>My family were not easily offended.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2205
01:30:27.981 --> 01:30:30.080
<v Speaker 4>We're constantly being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We tried to making fun of other people.</v>

2206
01:30:30.081 --> 01:30:34.010
<v Speaker 4>Like there's no one meaner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are portrayed like victims,</v>

2207
01:30:34.011 --> 01:30:36.350
<v Speaker 4>like everything upsets us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're just,</v>

2208
01:30:36.351 --> 01:30:40.040
<v Speaker 4>we feel so oppressed and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not like the black community</v>

2209
01:30:40.041 --> 01:30:42.910
<v Speaker 4>that I grew up in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my family and it's also not the,</v>

2210
01:30:43.050 --> 01:30:45.140
<v Speaker 4>the black community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like who we celebrate.</v>

2211
01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:47.660
<v Speaker 4>Like I was watching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it Chris rock stand up bigger and</v>

2212
01:30:47.661 --> 01:30:50.840
<v Speaker 4>blacker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched that like from 1994 classic,</v>

2213
01:30:51.230 --> 01:30:55.130
<v Speaker 4>like it is like the stuff that he said</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could never say today,</v>

2214
01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:00.530
<v Speaker 4>just like that is black culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went there on every single race.</v>

2215
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:03.770
<v Speaker 4>Every single culture made fun of</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody and it was beautiful.</v>

2216
01:31:03.771 --> 01:31:06.020
<v Speaker 4>It was perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a sold out Apollo theater.</v>

2217
01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:08.210
<v Speaker 4>He comes out in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first thing he says is like ratio</v>

2218
01:31:08.211 --> 01:31:08.870
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2219
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:11.630
<v Speaker 4>white people in the back today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2220
01:31:11.890 --> 01:31:14.690
<v Speaker 4>And everyone gets up and starts cheering</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they started making fun of black</v>

2221
01:31:14.691 --> 01:31:16.310
<v Speaker 4>people about things that we need to fix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2222
01:31:16.311 --> 01:31:17.144
<v Speaker 4>He's using like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2223
01:31:17.210 --> 01:31:19.190
<v Speaker 4>he's being funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's also saying stuff that's real.</v>

2224
01:31:19.191 --> 01:31:22.460
<v Speaker 4>Talking about that baby mama culture and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the difference between like the white</v>

2225
01:31:22.461 --> 01:31:24.230
<v Speaker 4>community starts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's talking about school shootings.</v>

2226
01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:26.420
<v Speaker 4>It had just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it was columbine that just</v>

2227
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:29.600
<v Speaker 4>happened and he starts talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and nobody was sensitive.</v>

2228
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:32.000
<v Speaker 4>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody in the audience was going the</v>

2229
01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:33.350
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2230
01:31:33.710 --> 01:31:35.060
<v Speaker 4>It was a different time.</v>

2231
01:31:35.630 --> 01:31:38.180
<v Speaker 1>I missed that time inundated with school</v>
<v Speaker 1>shootings.</v>

2232
01:31:38.181 --> 01:31:40.490
<v Speaker 1>There's so many of them now that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just twisted.</v>

2233
01:31:40.770 --> 01:31:42.130
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2234
01:31:42.190 --> 01:31:45.080
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with this is the problem</v>

2235
01:31:45.081 --> 01:31:48.890
<v Speaker 1>with when you blame the NRA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one in the NRA has ever committed.</v>

2236
01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:50.210
<v Speaker 4>I know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's insane.</v>

2237
01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:50.660
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2238
01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:52.600
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's bizarre that people blame them but.</v>

2239
01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:52.940
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

2240
01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:56.720
<v Speaker 1>there's an argument that there should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>tighter regulations on people with</v>

2241
01:31:56.721 --> 01:31:59.050
<v Speaker 1>mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People with the slope.</v>

2242
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:01.750
<v Speaker 3>Incredibly slippery for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is slippery and it's like it's</v>

2243
01:32:01.751 --> 01:32:03.040
<v Speaker 3>something you can't define.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

2244
01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.720
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too slow mental illness,</v>

2245
01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:05.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2246
01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:06.760
<v Speaker 3>It's too slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does that mean?</v>

2247
01:32:06.761 --> 01:32:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean if you go to one therapy</v>
<v Speaker 3>session,</v>

2248
01:32:08.970 --> 01:32:12.220
<v Speaker 3>like it is so slippery?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it.</v>

2249
01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.030
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2250
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:17.260
<v Speaker 3>it's a dangerous way to go down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>having to be 21 to be able to buy a gun.</v>

2251
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:19.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm against it because you shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to go get your limbs blown off</v>

2252
01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:21.160
<v Speaker 3>overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can't come back and defend your</v>

2253
01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:24.280
<v Speaker 3>home totally against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good argument that you</v>

2254
01:32:24.281 --> 01:32:26.680
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be able to go to war if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not 21 either,</v>

2255
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:30.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The frontal cortex isn't developed until</v>

2256
01:32:30.161 --> 01:32:31.930
<v Speaker 3>you're 25 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so who knows?</v>

2257
01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:36.580
<v Speaker 3>Who knows when you can make real good</v>
<v Speaker 3>rational decisions for yourself and the</v>

2258
01:32:36.581 --> 01:32:39.700
<v Speaker 3>idea is that if you take a 17 year old</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid fresh out of high school and send</v>

2259
01:32:39.701 --> 01:32:43.060
<v Speaker 3>them overseas and put a gun in his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he doesn't really know exactly what</v>

2260
01:32:43.061 --> 01:32:46.330
<v Speaker 3>he's doing in the first place because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not making informed choices.</v>

2261
01:32:46.331 --> 01:32:49.390
<v Speaker 3>You're just following the lead of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are in command.</v>

2262
01:32:49.391 --> 01:32:51.370
<v Speaker 3>You're hoping that they're telling you</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right thing to do.</v>

2263
01:32:51.490 --> 01:32:53.620
<v Speaker 3>You can get so bizarre to me is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're sitting here and we're talking</v>

2264
01:32:53.621 --> 01:32:56.530
<v Speaker 3>about the age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as if guns were just created like</v>

2265
01:32:56.531 --> 01:33:00.220
<v Speaker 3>you know when something's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's wrong?</v>

2266
01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:03.730
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mental Health,</v>

2267
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:04.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I say I,</v>

2268
01:33:04.931 --> 01:33:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it should the aeration of</v>

2269
01:33:07.421 --> 01:33:10.330
<v Speaker 3>culture altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they used to be taught the Bible in</v>

2270
01:33:10.331 --> 01:33:11.150
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

2271
01:33:11.150 --> 01:33:12.900
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people make fun of that now.</v>

2272
01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:15.370
<v Speaker 3>Now we've got this culture where you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>making fun of kids.</v>

2273
01:33:15.371 --> 01:33:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Like religion is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're so far away from religion.</v>

2274
01:33:17.931 --> 01:33:20.380
<v Speaker 3>Like that's like weird to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know like teaching religion is</v>

2275
01:33:20.381 --> 01:33:24.040
<v Speaker 3>like it's got like a scarlet letter if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come in as like a crow holy</v>

2276
01:33:24.041 --> 01:33:26.950
<v Speaker 3>Christian kid and like a normal public</v>
<v Speaker 3>public education thing.</v>

2277
01:33:26.951 --> 01:33:29.800
<v Speaker 3>You've got the family structure where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like these kids are running the</v>

2278
01:33:29.801 --> 01:33:32.500
<v Speaker 3>houses these days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I look on facebook and it's like</v>

2279
01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:36.070
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be funny when like a four</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old is acting like Cardi b.</v>

2280
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:37.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm like okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2281
01:33:37.061 --> 01:33:39.580
<v Speaker 3>It's funny because she's four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also like not funny because</v>

2282
01:33:39.581 --> 01:33:40.360
<v Speaker 3>she's four right?</v>

2283
01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you feel about little tay?</v>

2284
01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Who's a little tay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tay Is this all of out of the news now</v>

2285
01:33:47.951 --> 01:33:52.120
<v Speaker 3>because they found that it's a hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a nine year old Asian girl from</v>

2286
01:33:52.121 --> 01:33:53.590
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vancouver is that what's wrong?</v>

2287
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:57.310
<v Speaker 3>And she talks mad shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throws money around calls everybody</v>

2288
01:33:57.311 --> 01:33:59.740
<v Speaker 3>bitches and haters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my point.</v>

2289
01:33:59.741 --> 01:34:01.740
<v Speaker 3>Like this is considered like funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's entertaining.</v>

2290
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Like the fact that and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're okay with that.</v>

2291
01:34:03.701 --> 01:34:06.670
<v Speaker 3>And so parents are pushing their kids to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be more outrageous because there's a way</v>

2292
01:34:06.671 --> 01:34:10.770
<v Speaker 3>that they can make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to me it's like hanging out with Rick</v>

2293
01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rubin.</v>

2294
01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she looks like she's.</v>

2295
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.020
<v Speaker 3>She like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how old is she?</v>

2296
01:34:17.021 --> 01:34:18.830
<v Speaker 3>She looks like she's fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2297
01:34:18.831 --> 01:34:21.310
<v Speaker 3>those are hooks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should get the horns up and she's</v>

2298
01:34:21.311 --> 01:34:24.340
<v Speaker 3>got a g wagon in front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like the cash me outside girl.</v>

2299
01:34:24.650 --> 01:34:26.770
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we don't talk about any of that.</v>

2300
01:34:26.771 --> 01:34:29.320
<v Speaker 3>We don't talk about the fact that we no</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer focus on family.</v>

2301
01:34:29.321 --> 01:34:30.970
<v Speaker 3>We know it's no longer focused on</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>

2302
01:34:30.971 --> 01:34:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't need to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean to be that everyone needs</v>

2303
01:34:32.771 --> 01:34:35.260
<v Speaker 3>to be religious about their structure in</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>

2304
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:36.430
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Structure in,</v>

2305
01:34:36.431 --> 01:34:39.550
<v Speaker 3>in me when I grew up in and my grandpa</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to make us read the Bible around</v>

2306
01:34:39.551 --> 01:34:41.360
<v Speaker 3>the table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was some structure to that and</v>

2307
01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:45.960
<v Speaker 3>lessons and prayers that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's this mass,</v>

2308
01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:47.500
<v Speaker 3>the facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the snap,</v>

2309
01:34:47.501 --> 01:34:49.550
<v Speaker 3>the snapping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the instagram,</v>

2310
01:34:49.551 --> 01:34:52.130
<v Speaker 3>the twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we've changed the world and</v>

2311
01:34:52.131 --> 01:34:55.300
<v Speaker 3>expected children to say stay the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it and nobody talks about it.</v>

2312
01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.980
<v Speaker 3>So is that they say it's the gun's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fault.</v>

2313
01:34:57.230 --> 01:34:58.400
<v Speaker 3>We need to be stricter</v>

2314
01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:01.580
<v Speaker 4>gun gun legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the entire world has shifted.</v>

2315
01:35:01.581 --> 01:35:04.640
<v Speaker 4>We're not talking about those changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dynamic of the world that has</v>

2316
01:35:04.641 --> 01:35:05.880
<v Speaker 4>shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

2317
01:35:05.881 --> 01:35:07.790
<v Speaker 4>I just hold the different position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2318
01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:09.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it starts with family.</v>

2319
01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:11.810
<v Speaker 4>It starts with structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we need,</v>

2320
01:35:11.811 --> 01:35:13.910
<v Speaker 4>we need religion back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that needs to stop being</v>

2321
01:35:13.911 --> 01:35:17.240
<v Speaker 4>such a dirty word and into stopping</v>
<v Speaker 4>mocked roundly by the media.</v>

2322
01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.800
<v Speaker 4>Like it shouldn't be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2323
01:35:18.801 --> 01:35:20.030
<v Speaker 4>when joy Behar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2324
01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:22.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>says something about Jesus and the whole</v>

2325
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:25.400
<v Speaker 4>audience giggles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's weird.</v>

2326
01:35:25.401 --> 01:35:27.590
<v Speaker 4>She said something about Mike Pence</v>
<v Speaker 4>being mentally ill.</v>

2327
01:35:27.591 --> 01:35:28.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he talks to Jesus.</v>

2328
01:35:29.010 --> 01:35:30.470
<v Speaker 4>Think about how weird that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2329
01:35:30.471 --> 01:35:34.220
<v Speaker 4>Like how weird that the stuff that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>used to be normal,</v>

2330
01:35:34.221 --> 01:35:35.210
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>praying,</v>

2331
01:35:35.211 --> 01:35:36.560
<v Speaker 4>talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like when I grew up,</v>

2332
01:35:36.561 --> 01:35:38.630
<v Speaker 4>that was like my grandparents'</v>
<v Speaker 4>generation.</v>

2333
01:35:38.631 --> 01:35:42.260
<v Speaker 4>That was everyone was religious and now</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're so far away from that.</v>

2334
01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:43.131
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

2335
01:35:43.131 --> 01:35:44.390
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that seems like,</v>

2336
01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:47.570
<v Speaker 4>like it's okay to mock and we roundly</v>
<v Speaker 4>market all the time.</v>

2337
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:51.080
<v Speaker 4>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the structure in the home is,</v>

2338
01:35:51.170 --> 01:35:53.300
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most important thing that needs to</v>

2339
01:35:53.301 --> 01:35:54.500
<v Speaker 4>change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that some people are growing up</v>

2340
01:35:54.501 --> 01:35:56.630
<v Speaker 4>without fathers in the home is something</v>
<v Speaker 4>that needs to change.</v>

2341
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:59.480
<v Speaker 4>Letting your kid have a facebook account</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're seven.</v>

2342
01:35:59.690 --> 01:36:00.920
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just,</v>

2343
01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:03.020
<v Speaker 4>there's just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the information age,</v>

2344
01:36:03.021 --> 01:36:04.640
<v Speaker 4>but what information are they</v>
<v Speaker 4>downloading?</v>

2345
01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think that people need</v>

2346
01:36:07.041 --> 01:36:08.780
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think that people need</v>

2347
01:36:08.781 --> 01:36:10.760
<v Speaker 1>family and community and all those good</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2348
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:13.450
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to religion it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one is right?</v>

2349
01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:17.040
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about being right about.</v>

2350
01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't sound like there's not.</v>

2351
01:36:19.210 --> 01:36:22.130
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm going to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know nothing about scientology,</v>

2352
01:36:22.131 --> 01:36:24.350
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that people hate scientology.</v>

2353
01:36:24.351 --> 01:36:27.980
<v Speaker 1>That's all that all I know about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>created by a science fiction writer and</v>

2354
01:36:27.981 --> 01:36:30.110
<v Speaker 1>it's all nonsense right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you needed to know,</v>

2355
01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:33.800
<v Speaker 1>so that's one of the dumbest religions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>

2356
01:36:33.801 --> 01:36:36.270
<v Speaker 1>If you read like what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they stand for,</v>

2357
01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Leah Remini,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was in it for years,</v>

2358
01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:43.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch her series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she been on my podcast and she explained</v>

2359
01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:46.940
<v Speaker 1>her journey into it and what happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it and when she started to question</v>

2360
01:36:46.941 --> 01:36:48.500
<v Speaker 1>it and there's a whole thing.</v>

2361
01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:52.730
<v Speaker 1>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the fucking Hbo Documentary?</v>

2362
01:36:52.731 --> 01:36:57.230
<v Speaker 1>It's also the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the HBO on Scientology.</v>

2363
01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:00.290
<v Speaker 1>The Lawrence Wright going clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going clear.</v>

2364
01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read the book and I watched the</v>

2365
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:06.770
<v Speaker 1>documentary so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know nothing about it besides like Tom</v>

2366
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:07.161
<v Speaker 1>Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be like,</v>

2367
01:37:07.161 --> 01:37:08.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be honest with totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorant.</v>

2368
01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:10.520
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2369
01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:12.620
<v Speaker 1>for some people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

2370
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:15.260
<v Speaker 1>for some people its structure and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful,</v>

2371
01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:18.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ideologies are helpful sometimes because</v>

2372
01:37:18.561 --> 01:37:21.980
<v Speaker 1>they give you like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a format to live your life by or</v>

2373
01:37:21.981 --> 01:37:24.040
<v Speaker 1>scaffolding to keep your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2374
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:27.500
<v Speaker 1>your moral beliefs inside of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries and it helps you get ahead</v>

2375
01:37:27.501 --> 01:37:31.880
<v Speaker 1>and you have purpose in decision making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day it's a cult</v>

2376
01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:35.060
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of different ones.</v>

2377
01:37:35.061 --> 01:37:37.470
<v Speaker 1>So it's how do you decide?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just</v>

2378
01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:41.160
<v Speaker 4>that there's something that comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think just learning certain lessons.</v>

2379
01:37:41.161 --> 01:37:43.060
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying like we all need to like</v>

2380
01:37:43.090 --> 01:37:44.540
<v Speaker 4>structure structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

2381
01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:48.120
<v Speaker 4>like the Bible used to be taught in</v>
<v Speaker 4>school objectives will be taught by</v>

2382
01:37:48.121 --> 01:37:50.190
<v Speaker 4>people that were not practicing</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christians.</v>

2383
01:37:50.370 --> 01:37:52.300
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm used to be taught in school</v>

2384
01:37:52.301 --> 01:37:55.050
<v Speaker 4>objectively because there are still</v>
<v Speaker 4>lessons that are timeless in these</v>

2385
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 4>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't going</v>

2386
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.110
<v Speaker 2>to do with whether or not your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to then say,</v>

2387
01:37:58.111 --> 01:37:59.340
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we go to church and then we</v>

2388
01:37:59.341 --> 01:38:03.060
<v Speaker 2>pray in school and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can almost extract that and try to</v>

2389
01:38:03.061 --> 01:38:04.330
<v Speaker 2>teach these lessons objective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee,</v>

2390
01:38:04.331 --> 01:38:07.770
<v Speaker 2>but what kids are learning now is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to be an anarchistic,</v>

2391
01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:08.341
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2392
01:38:08.341 --> 01:38:10.440
<v Speaker 2>feminism 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one and every issue.</v>

2393
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:14.550
<v Speaker 2>You're like actually fostering an angry</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture by telling them in every term if</v>

2394
01:38:14.551 --> 01:38:16.620
<v Speaker 2>they should be outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are in outrage culture.</v>

2395
01:38:16.621 --> 01:38:19.320
<v Speaker 2>And then your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're surprised when somebody does</v>

2396
01:38:19.321 --> 01:38:21.490
<v Speaker 2>something outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2397
01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:23.030
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bizarre to me.</v>

2398
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.841
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2399
01:38:23.841 --> 01:38:26.420
<v Speaker 2>everything should piss you off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything should make you angry.</v>

2400
01:38:26.630 --> 01:38:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Everything should make you upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is as unjust.</v>

2401
01:38:29.601 --> 01:38:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Everything as oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know why this kid to shut up</v>

2402
01:38:32.661 --> 01:38:33.860
<v Speaker 2>at school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so angry.</v>

2403
01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:35.360
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

2404
01:38:35.361 --> 01:38:37.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're weirdly fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2405
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:39.810
<v Speaker 2>no one wants to have the conversation in</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting happens and everyone's to talk</v>

2406
01:38:39.811 --> 01:38:41.930
<v Speaker 2>about the NRA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then David Hogg is back on the news.</v>

2407
01:38:43.530 --> 01:38:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson has some interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas about religion and the fundamental</v>

2408
01:38:46.951 --> 01:38:51.951
<v Speaker 1>beliefs and the lessons that are learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>from things like the Bible and how they</v>

2409
01:38:53.251 --> 01:38:58.251
<v Speaker 1>apply to human life and that are our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief systems.</v>

2410
01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Without them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without these sort of structures and</v>

2411
01:39:02.101 --> 01:39:06.720
<v Speaker 1>belief systems is one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>leads civilization astray and that it's</v>

2412
01:39:06.721 --> 01:39:08.580
<v Speaker 1>done that before and things go awry.</v>

2413
01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had this debate with Charlie</v>

2414
01:39:10.741 --> 01:39:13.830
<v Speaker 2>and I did a panel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm down in DC and we were talking about</v>

2415
01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:18.530
<v Speaker 2>whether the reintroduction of God and</v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching them to school and I said like</v>

2416
01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:20.490
<v Speaker 2>at some point there seems to be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle.</v>

2417
01:39:20.491 --> 01:39:23.430
<v Speaker 2>I have this idea that like human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a certain way,</v>

2418
01:39:23.431 --> 01:39:25.170
<v Speaker 2>we're doomed to just keep repeating</v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

2419
01:39:25.171 --> 01:39:29.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm obsessed with Greek mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with like Egyptian history,</v>

2420
01:39:29.401 --> 01:39:31.740
<v Speaker 2>hieroglyphic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like anything that like or where they</v>

2421
01:39:31.741 --> 01:39:34.050
<v Speaker 2>tell stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially Greek mythology because the</v>

2422
01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:36.450
<v Speaker 2>lessons are there and we just keep doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2423
01:39:36.451 --> 01:39:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greed,</v>

2424
01:39:37.441 --> 01:39:39.090
<v Speaker 2>lust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the things that human beings fall</v>

2425
01:39:39.091 --> 01:39:40.020
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2426
01:39:40.050 --> 01:39:42.590
<v Speaker 2>So I had this idea when we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Charlie is,</v>

2427
01:39:42.591 --> 01:39:45.330
<v Speaker 2>is an evangelical Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not right.</v>

2428
01:39:45.331 --> 01:39:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I believe in I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I super smart guys.</v>

2429
01:39:47.671 --> 01:39:51.810
<v Speaker 2>And Evangelical Christians believe Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 2>came back to life.</v>

2430
01:39:51.870 --> 01:39:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2431
01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:54.053
<v Speaker 2>He's an avid dog.</v>

2432
01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Believes that someone died three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three days later they came back to life</v>

2433
01:39:58.830 --> 01:40:00.420
<v Speaker 1>and that they walked on water and</v>

2434
01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:02.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I haven't really gotten into a</v>

2435
01:40:02.701 --> 01:40:04.710
<v Speaker 2>thing because I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the person that should ever be</v>

2436
01:40:04.711 --> 01:40:08.880
<v Speaker 2>like debating or talking about religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not my shtick I guess.</v>

2437
01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:10.580
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I,</v>

2438
01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:12.780
<v Speaker 2>what I said to him [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and him both believed that in many</v>

2439
01:40:12.781 --> 01:40:14.950
<v Speaker 2>ways the reason that the government has</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2440
01:40:15.090 --> 01:40:17.550
<v Speaker 2>the media has started roundly dissing</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2441
01:40:17.610 --> 01:40:18.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in dissing,</v>

2442
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:20.970
<v Speaker 2>he says Christ is because the government</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to be God.</v>

2443
01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if people don't,</v>

2444
01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:27.460
<v Speaker 1>the media is responding to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government's suggestion.</v>

2445
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you think the reason why</v>

2446
01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:33.760
<v Speaker 2>religion is because the media is</v>
<v Speaker 2>responding to some sort of orders from</v>

2447
01:40:33.761 --> 01:40:35.620
<v Speaker 2>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's wrong.</v>

2448
01:40:35.650 --> 01:40:37.360
<v Speaker 2>So directive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2449
01:40:37.361 --> 01:40:38.141
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2450
01:40:38.141 --> 01:40:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Andrew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Breitbart said that politics is</v>

2451
01:40:41.021 --> 01:40:42.460
<v Speaker 2>downstream from culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2452
01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:45.310
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can argue that they feed into</v>

2453
01:40:45.311 --> 01:40:46.180
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

2454
01:40:46.181 --> 01:40:50.560
<v Speaker 2>but there's definitely something between</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and politics that is linked,</v>

2455
01:40:50.561 --> 01:40:52.100
<v Speaker 2>inextricably linked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2456
01:40:52.210 --> 01:40:54.120
<v Speaker 2>so when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2457
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:57.100
<v Speaker 4>when it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when everyone's on the same page,</v>

2458
01:40:57.101 --> 01:40:58.480
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if the government wants to get</v>

2459
01:40:58.481 --> 01:41:00.130
<v Speaker 4>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which it has been doing right,</v>

2460
01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:02.320
<v Speaker 4>and wants people to look to them for</v>
<v Speaker 4>answers,</v>

2461
01:41:02.321 --> 01:41:05.830
<v Speaker 4>which it has been doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to understand they have to sort</v>

2462
01:41:05.831 --> 01:41:09.280
<v Speaker 4>of destroy everything else that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>would potentially be looking to for</v>

2463
01:41:09.281 --> 01:41:10.300
<v Speaker 4>answers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2464
01:41:10.301 --> 01:41:14.470
<v Speaker 4>So instead of when you're down and out</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people would just go to church and</v>

2465
01:41:14.471 --> 01:41:15.430
<v Speaker 4>pray,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2466
01:41:15.431 --> 01:41:17.890
<v Speaker 4>Or believing in your family or the</v>
<v Speaker 4>family structure,</v>

2467
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:21.530
<v Speaker 4>they need to know that no matter what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think the government is the answer</v>

2468
01:41:21.531 --> 01:41:23.200
<v Speaker 4>and that is what a leftist at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the day,</v>

2469
01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:26.920
<v Speaker 4>the left believes the government can fix</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of their problems.</v>

2470
01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:29.920
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I find especially when I realized</v>

2471
01:41:29.921 --> 01:41:33.010
<v Speaker 4>that as they do not believe in religion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's just a thing.</v>

2472
01:41:33.011 --> 01:41:33.870
<v Speaker 4>It's a trend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've noticed that,</v>

2473
01:41:33.871 --> 01:41:34.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not religious,</v>

2474
01:41:34.811 --> 01:41:36.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2475
01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:38.980
<v Speaker 4>there's something wrong with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but leftists tend to be,</v>

2476
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really apart from religion.</v>

2477
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:45.160
<v Speaker 4>So you could make the argument could</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely be made that the destruction</v>

2478
01:41:45.730 --> 01:41:48.820
<v Speaker 4>of believing in the Bible have stopped</v>
<v Speaker 4>teaching the Bible is because you want</v>

2479
01:41:48.821 --> 01:41:51.240
<v Speaker 4>to make it so that every time you have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem then because you're still going</v>

2480
01:41:51.241 --> 01:41:53.110
<v Speaker 4>to our soul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to believe in something.</v>

2481
01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:55.660
<v Speaker 4>We're naturally beings that we need to</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe that something can fix</v>

2482
01:41:55.661 --> 01:41:57.610
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really believe that that is the reason</v>

2483
01:41:57.611 --> 01:41:59.400
<v Speaker 4>why we go get our palms read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2484
01:41:59.410 --> 01:42:00.730
<v Speaker 4>Like we just like there's something</v>
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

2485
01:42:00.731 --> 01:42:04.750
<v Speaker 4>Somebody has the answer and people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>starting to believe it's government in</v>

2486
01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:06.490
<v Speaker 4>America and it freaks me out.</v>

2487
01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:11.000
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you that people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and I agree with you that</v>

2488
01:42:11.001 --> 01:42:14.810
<v Speaker 1>people without religion try to find that</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and those rules and other</v>

2489
01:42:14.811 --> 01:42:16.190
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't believe that,</v>

2490
01:42:16.210 --> 01:42:18.740
<v Speaker 1>that this is like some calculated by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

2491
01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's human nature thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's human nature.</v>

2492
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:25.220
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be a daddy.</v>

2493
01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:28.700
<v Speaker 1>We want someone to tell us what to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that daddy is the government or</v>

2494
01:42:28.701 --> 01:42:31.280
<v Speaker 1>if that get daddy is aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

2495
01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:34.880
<v Speaker 1>people need something smarter than</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlie</v>

2496
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:35.850
<v Speaker 4>because then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2497
01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:37.980
<v Speaker 4>we got rid of the guard right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to go back to religion,</v>

2498
01:42:37.981 --> 01:42:38.701
<v Speaker 4>and then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2499
01:42:38.701 --> 01:42:40.800
<v Speaker 4>but Charlie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then we could actually recreate all</v>

2500
01:42:40.801 --> 01:42:42.870
<v Speaker 4>the terrible stuff that happened with</v>
<v Speaker 4>religion when religion became daddy.</v>

2501
01:42:42.871 --> 01:42:44.850
<v Speaker 4>So we might just be going government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>religion,</v>

2502
01:42:44.970 --> 01:42:45.810
<v Speaker 4>government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>religion,</v>

2503
01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:46.561
<v Speaker 4>government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

2504
01:42:46.561 --> 01:42:49.110
<v Speaker 4>Just swinging the pendulum corruption in</v>
<v Speaker 4>both.</v>

2505
01:42:49.170 --> 01:42:50.810
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's my.</v>

2506
01:42:50.850 --> 01:42:52.260
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2507
01:42:52.261 --> 01:42:54.900
<v Speaker 4>So I think that we could say that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to start reading using these</v>

2508
01:42:54.901 --> 01:42:56.220
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then we could just end up with the</v>

2509
01:42:56.221 --> 01:42:59.190
<v Speaker 4>extreme again where there's massive</v>
<v Speaker 4>corruption in the church.</v>

2510
01:42:59.191 --> 01:43:01.050
<v Speaker 4>Not everyone's pleased about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>emphasis in the church.</v>

2511
01:43:01.230 --> 01:43:02.190
<v Speaker 4>So then I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2512
01:43:02.370 --> 01:43:03.203
<v Speaker 4>we're just doomed.</v>

2513
01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I think we're doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Twain had a great line.</v>

2514
01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:08.600
<v Speaker 1>History doesn't repeat itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it rhymes.</v>

2515
01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:11.630
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go on.</v>

2516
01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.900
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

2517
01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:16.360
<v Speaker 4>Fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Duncan told me that yesterday.</v>

2518
01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:18.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it often rhymes.</v>

2519
01:43:18.521 --> 01:43:20.630
<v Speaker 4>That's the quote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it repeats itself fully.</v>

2520
01:43:20.970 --> 01:43:22.550
<v Speaker 4>Like we like all of the signs there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2521
01:43:22.570 --> 01:43:24.730
<v Speaker 4>we could literally just read this all in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Bible.</v>

2522
01:43:24.731 --> 01:43:27.530
<v Speaker 4>We can read this on Greek mythology and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know what happens.</v>

2523
01:43:27.531 --> 01:43:30.870
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like it's our humanity and but</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's.</v>

2524
01:43:30.970 --> 01:43:32.080
<v Speaker 4>Is it fixable?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2525
01:43:32.081 --> 01:43:33.810
<v Speaker 4>that's why people think that as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>society perspective,</v>

2526
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:35.770
<v Speaker 4>of course it's not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be great,</v>

2527
01:43:35.771 --> 01:43:36.970
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be,</v>

2528
01:43:37.150 --> 01:43:40.510
<v Speaker 4>but now we're in this culture where it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he cheated on his wife like,</v>

2529
01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:41.330
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this.</v>

2530
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:41.720
<v Speaker 4>Humans</v>

2531
01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:44.930
<v Speaker 1>are different than we used to be and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>we keep moving in this direction,</v>

2532
01:43:44.931 --> 01:43:46.970
<v Speaker 1>we're going to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to continue to improve.</v>

2533
01:43:46.971 --> 01:43:51.830
<v Speaker 1>I think the problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank queen cynical.</v>

2534
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:52.870
<v Speaker 4>It's not cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

2535
01:43:52.871 --> 01:43:53.910
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

2536
01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:54.913
<v Speaker 4>There's just always</v>

2537
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:57.380
<v Speaker 1>lifetime perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is that we're moving to a</v>

2538
01:43:57.381 --> 01:43:59.870
<v Speaker 1>greater good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're moving towards a greater good that</v>

2539
01:43:59.871 --> 01:44:03.710
<v Speaker 1>some day our children will enjoy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are in a better situation than</v>

2540
01:44:03.711 --> 01:44:06.350
<v Speaker 1>our grandparents were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our grandchildren will be in a better</v>

2541
01:44:06.351 --> 01:44:09.590
<v Speaker 1>situation than us and we're constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving towards improvement and this is</v>

2542
01:44:09.591 --> 01:44:14.570
<v Speaker 1>the reason why we're so dissatisfied</v>
<v Speaker 1>with racism and sexism and homophobia</v>

2543
01:44:14.571 --> 01:44:17.870
<v Speaker 1>and hate and all the bullshit that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>see in the world that can be prevented.</v>

2544
01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:23.060
<v Speaker 1>We think that if we can shun that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shame that and push it out of our</v>

2545
01:44:23.061 --> 01:44:27.290
<v Speaker 1>culture that some day in the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have gotten past this and evolve</v>

2546
01:44:27.291 --> 01:44:32.291
<v Speaker 1>to the point where we as a culture and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we as a civilization will be something</v>

2547
01:44:32.661 --> 01:44:36.530
<v Speaker 1>that we are proud of and we're not proud</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what we are now with school shootings</v>

2548
01:44:36.531 --> 01:44:41.090
<v Speaker 1>and people dependent on Oxycontin's and</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven year olds on facebook and we'll</v>

2549
01:44:41.091 --> 01:44:43.820
<v Speaker 1>take flashing cash in front of a g</v>
<v Speaker 1>wagon.</v>

2550
01:44:43.950 --> 01:44:44.783
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>

2551
01:44:45.370 --> 01:44:47.160
<v Speaker 4>that's nothing new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to talk about overmedicating</v>

2552
01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:49.100
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when I was a kid is sick shows</v>

2553
01:44:49.101 --> 01:44:50.990
<v Speaker 4>bouncing off the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just said you were hyper today.</v>

2554
01:44:50.991 --> 01:44:55.450
<v Speaker 4>It's like give him adderall is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I literally like ice babysit a kid and</v>

2555
01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:57.770
<v Speaker 4>like the mom would give them adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was six years old.</v>

2556
01:44:57.970 --> 01:44:58.580
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no.</v>

2557
01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:00.620
<v Speaker 4>What's wrong with him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he might be a kid,</v>

2558
01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:01.371
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2559
01:45:01.371 --> 01:45:02.800
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's another commerce,</v>

2560
01:45:02.810 --> 01:45:03.643
<v Speaker 4>he's got energy,</v>

2561
01:45:03.670 --> 01:45:05.640
<v Speaker 1>don't want to have kids when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2562
01:45:05.641 --> 01:45:07.390
<v Speaker 1>when kids are going crazy and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>tired,</v>

2563
01:45:07.391 --> 01:45:08.350
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2564
01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:10.490
<v Speaker 4>But you don't medicate them and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's bizarre.</v>

2565
01:45:10.491 --> 01:45:11.241
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they say,</v>

2566
01:45:11.241 --> 01:45:11.810
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2567
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:12.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something's wrong with him.</v>

2568
01:45:12.681 --> 01:45:15.470
<v Speaker 4>He's in school and he and he's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>performing his while he's not paying</v>

2569
01:45:15.471 --> 01:45:17.450
<v Speaker 4>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he's just not interested.</v>

2570
01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:19.260
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he'd rather be out.</v>

2571
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that very well.</v>

2572
01:45:20.941 --> 01:45:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking when I was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

2573
01:45:22.831 --> 01:45:27.831
<v Speaker 1>I am never going to tell my kids that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to pay attention to some</v>

2574
01:45:28.381 --> 01:45:29.490
<v Speaker 1>fucking boring shit.</v>

2575
01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:32.020
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or assume that maybe you want them to</v>

2576
01:45:32.021 --> 01:45:33.550
<v Speaker 4>pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I assume that there's something</v>

2577
01:45:33.551 --> 01:45:35.470
<v Speaker 4>wrong with them if they don't is what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy to me.</v>

2578
01:45:35.471 --> 01:45:38.740
<v Speaker 4>They assume there's something wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 4>their child and that they need medicine</v>

2579
01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:42.310
<v Speaker 4>because they're not paying attention to</v>
<v Speaker 4>math problems on the board for an hour.</v>

2580
01:45:42.490 --> 01:45:44.580
<v Speaker 4>That's what scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like parents are out of</v>

2581
01:45:44.581 --> 01:45:47.170
<v Speaker 4>touch down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the whole thing is unnatural.</v>

2582
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:49.960
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally agree with you.</v>

2583
01:45:49.961 --> 01:45:54.490
<v Speaker 4>Like I am like so anti and you see that</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's this famous kanye quote</v>

2584
01:45:54.730 --> 01:45:56.590
<v Speaker 4>where he says like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you see a five year old,</v>

2585
01:45:56.770 --> 01:45:58.510
<v Speaker 4>they have so much energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's,</v>

2586
01:45:58.511 --> 01:46:01.870
<v Speaker 4>they have so much confidence and so much</v>
<v Speaker 4>passion in everything that they do,</v>

2587
01:46:01.871 --> 01:46:04.780
<v Speaker 4>like they think they can be anything or</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can be a dancer or a singer,</v>

2588
01:46:04.781 --> 01:46:08.080
<v Speaker 4>they'll try to do flips and then go find</v>
<v Speaker 4>like an 11 year old after they've been</v>

2589
01:46:08.081 --> 01:46:09.190
<v Speaker 4>socialized in school.</v>

2590
01:46:09.190 --> 01:46:10.240
<v Speaker 4>They're like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2591
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:12.790
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that spark just dies in them and it's</v>

2592
01:46:12.791 --> 01:46:15.310
<v Speaker 4>because they're literally being put</v>
<v Speaker 4>through a system that tells them that</v>

2593
01:46:15.311 --> 01:46:16.180
<v Speaker 4>they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2594
01:46:16.181 --> 01:46:18.220
<v Speaker 4>this girl got a 90 on a test and you got</v>
<v Speaker 4>an 80,</v>

2595
01:46:18.221 --> 01:46:19.510
<v Speaker 4>so something must be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2596
01:46:19.511 --> 01:46:22.240
<v Speaker 4>you're not getting this right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe math is just not her thing.</v>

2597
01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:23.291
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she does.</v>

2598
01:46:23.291 --> 01:46:24.490
<v Speaker 4>She does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's not as good at math as</v>

2599
01:46:24.491 --> 01:46:27.550
<v Speaker 4>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody has their own pieces</v>

2600
01:46:27.551 --> 01:46:31.180
<v Speaker 4>of brilliant and that the current</v>
<v Speaker 4>education system does not foster to</v>

2601
01:46:31.181 --> 01:46:33.730
<v Speaker 4>those individually to individualism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're actually trying to create a</v>

2602
01:46:33.731 --> 01:46:36.010
<v Speaker 4>collectivist society by being able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>measure.</v>

2603
01:46:36.310 --> 01:46:39.070
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a kids brilliance by standardized</v>

2604
01:46:39.071 --> 01:46:40.990
<v Speaker 4>testing something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charlie and I very much agree.</v>

2605
01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're necessarily doing</v>

2606
01:46:43.321 --> 01:46:45.060
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they are is uninspired and</v>

2607
01:46:45.061 --> 01:46:48.800
<v Speaker 1>underpaid and they're boring and kids go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their classes and their board or</v>

2608
01:46:48.801 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 1>their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to get</v>

2609
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:51.540
<v Speaker 3>this stupid grade so they can keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>

2610
01:46:51.541 --> 01:46:53.610
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so bored.</v>

2611
01:46:53.611 --> 01:46:56.940
<v Speaker 3>I was those personality to your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a lot of energy.</v>

2612
01:46:56.941 --> 01:46:59.640
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine you sitting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I just always felt like they</v>

2613
01:46:59.641 --> 01:47:01.000
<v Speaker 3>were stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2614
01:47:01.010 --> 01:47:01.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2615
01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:03.320
<v Speaker 3>is this teacher even like smarter than</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

2616
01:47:03.321 --> 01:47:06.210
<v Speaker 3>Can we take a test?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a just like a quick Iq test to see</v>

2617
01:47:06.211 --> 01:47:09.030
<v Speaker 3>if I should even have to take a class</v>
<v Speaker 3>from someone who's actually dumber than</v>

2618
01:47:09.031 --> 01:47:12.120
<v Speaker 3>me and we're having those thoughts like</v>
<v Speaker 3>in high school just being like just</v>

2619
01:47:12.121 --> 01:47:14.820
<v Speaker 3>aren't even smart sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're not alone.</v>

2620
01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:19.170
<v Speaker 3>Good news is that from that you get this</v>
<v Speaker 3>dissatisfaction,</v>

2621
01:47:19.171 --> 01:47:23.850
<v Speaker 3>this feeling of just not not wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a part of this anymore and then you</v>

2622
01:47:23.851 --> 01:47:25.560
<v Speaker 3>start seeking other ways to make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>living.</v>

2623
01:47:25.570 --> 01:47:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Other ways to get mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see.</v>

2624
01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:30.930
<v Speaker 3>I got on Youtube and I started talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about stuff and people responded to it.</v>

2625
01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:34.590
<v Speaker 3>And so how did you go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Full blown conservative?</v>

2626
01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:36.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm a human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The White House.</v>

2627
01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:36.860
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>

2628
01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:38.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you been in the White House?</v>

2629
01:47:38.011 --> 01:47:40.260
<v Speaker 3>You're a conservative for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two years ago.</v>

2630
01:47:40.261 --> 01:47:42.540
<v Speaker 3>This is why some concern talking shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>

2631
01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:45.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because you're like a conservative,</v>

2632
01:47:45.271 --> 01:47:46.104
<v Speaker 3>wet dream.</v>

2633
01:47:48.010 --> 01:47:49.490
<v Speaker 3>A little bit of jealousy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm like,</v>

2634
01:47:49.491 --> 01:47:50.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

2635
01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:54.870
<v Speaker 3>But this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in this so much that I wish we</v>

2636
01:47:54.871 --> 01:47:56.250
<v Speaker 3>could stop that because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2637
01:47:56.251 --> 01:47:57.510
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's change the paradigm.</v>

2638
01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:00.600
<v Speaker 3>Like let's get trump to do the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Joe Rogan show as opposed to</v>

2639
01:48:00.601 --> 01:48:01.351
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean,</v>

2640
01:48:01.351 --> 01:48:03.180
<v Speaker 3>like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people don't see things that way.</v>

2641
01:48:03.181 --> 01:48:03.931
<v Speaker 3>It's all about me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

2642
01:48:03.931 --> 01:48:05.070
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ego comes out,</v>

2643
01:48:05.071 --> 01:48:05.940
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2644
01:48:05.941 --> 01:48:06.571
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2645
01:48:06.571 --> 01:48:07.770
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met Charlie,</v>

2646
01:48:07.771 --> 01:48:09.880
<v Speaker 3>that was a huge thing that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2647
01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:12.260
<v Speaker 3>I was speaking at the David Horowitz</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freedom Center.</v>

2648
01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Charlie's 24.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could ask why he's flying around</v>

2649
01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:16.080
<v Speaker 3>with the first family too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you meet them,</v>

2650
01:48:16.081 --> 01:48:17.940
<v Speaker 3>you understand he's just absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>

2651
01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2652
01:48:19.921 --> 01:48:21.930
<v Speaker 3>we just wanted to do this together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met him and I said,</v>

2653
01:48:21.931 --> 01:48:23.460
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there needs to be a black</v>

2654
01:48:23.461 --> 01:48:25.140
<v Speaker 3>revolution against the Democratic Party.</v>

2655
01:48:25.230 --> 01:48:27.330
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm the person to lead it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm your girl.</v>

2656
01:48:27.570 --> 01:48:32.570
<v Speaker 3>And I was speaking on a panel with Dave</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rubin about why I left the left and what</v>

2657
01:48:33.751 --> 01:48:37.590
<v Speaker 3>I understood about the left and he hired</v>
<v Speaker 3>me on the spot and the rest is sort of</v>

2658
01:48:37.591 --> 01:48:38.424
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2659
01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:39.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really it.</v>

2660
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:41.460
<v Speaker 3>I worked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked my ass off.</v>

2661
01:48:41.461 --> 01:48:43.200
<v Speaker 3>The one who hired you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who?</v>

2662
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:45.590
<v Speaker 3>Charlie Kirk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He actually runs turning point USA.</v>

2663
01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:46.800
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like so young.</v>

2664
01:48:46.801 --> 01:48:50.060
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you should look him up and figuring</v>

2665
01:48:50.061 --> 01:48:51.900
<v Speaker 3>out who he is because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

2666
01:48:51.901 --> 01:48:53.270
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be a future present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>

2667
01:48:53.271 --> 01:48:56.970
<v Speaker 3>And everyone says that everyone who</v>
<v Speaker 3>every show is bound and Fox as like very</v>

2668
01:48:56.971 --> 01:48:58.620
<v Speaker 3>rarely do you meet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like rush limbaugh just said,</v>

2669
01:48:58.621 --> 01:49:01.020
<v Speaker 3>very rarely do you meet someone and</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that's going to be a president of</v>

2670
01:49:01.021 --> 01:49:04.860
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try the is probably on like 18 different</v>

2671
01:49:04.861 --> 01:49:06.930
<v Speaker 3>kinds of pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know he said it's,</v>

2672
01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:08.800
<v Speaker 3>it's so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2673
01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:12.053
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's</v>

2674
01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:15.630
<v Speaker 3>clean now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know that he was not</v>

2675
01:49:15.631 --> 01:49:17.340
<v Speaker 3>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Took 100 pills a day.</v>

2676
01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:21.600
<v Speaker 3>That's scary to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And from taking pills,</v>

2677
01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:25.950
<v Speaker 3>you understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't even take tylenol.</v>

2678
01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:28.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't even like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like told me that by the way.</v>

2679
01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:30.510
<v Speaker 3>Very Fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair warning.</v>

2680
01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he explained to me,</v>

2681
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:35.580
<v Speaker 3>he explained to me the mechanism of rush</v>
<v Speaker 3>limbaugh going deaf and taking pills.</v>

2682
01:49:35.581 --> 01:49:36.750
<v Speaker 3>So rush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm wrong,</v>

2683
01:49:36.751 --> 01:49:38.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2684
01:49:38.221 --> 01:49:41.520
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

2685
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:46.920
<v Speaker 3>As long as we can from taking pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gone almost never lies.</v>

2686
01:49:46.930 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 3>Look up mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 3>sisters something.</v>

2688
01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:54.250
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just,</v>

2689
01:49:54.251 --> 01:49:54.821
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2690
01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:58.240
<v Speaker 3>I've worked incredibly hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I haven't slept since last</v>

2691

<v Speaker 3>but not all policies.</v>

2693
01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:04.900
<v Speaker 3>People ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:08.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just a girl who talks about stuff</v>

2697
01:50:08.921 --> 01:50:12.550
<v Speaker 3>that I believe in and people view me as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a politician.</v>

2698
01:50:12.551 --> 01:50:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand pills though.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Seems like a Paul.</v>

2703
01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:23.590
<v Speaker 3>This is what I don't get a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>polished.</v>

2704
01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:27.890
<v Speaker 3>You've got a little bit of a sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>plant.</v>

2705
01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:31.300
<v Speaker 3>You said these things before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the things you're saying,</v>

2706
01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:35.710
<v Speaker 3>you're very good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got a well oiled path.</v>

2707
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:38.330
<v Speaker 3>There's a nice groove in your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2708
01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:41.020
<v Speaker 3>you know how to say these things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then occasionally pop out of it and you</v>

2709
01:50:41.021 --> 01:50:43.280
<v Speaker 3>just play in Kansas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know when you're like,</v>

2710
01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:45.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to leave black America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go against the Democrats.</v>

2711
01:50:45.810 --> 01:50:47.620
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe you believe,</v>

2712
01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:50.410
<v Speaker 3>believe you said it many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times,</v>

2713
01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:52.450
<v Speaker 3>but I just said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you,</v>

2714
01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:55.150
<v Speaker 3>I told this in November.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was my plan,</v>

2715
01:50:55.330 --> 01:50:57.580
<v Speaker 3>so I'm just a person that's going after</v>
<v Speaker 3>my goal and then as I started</v>

2716
01:50:57.581 --> 01:51:00.010
<v Speaker 3>accomplishing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are just like throwing shade and</v>

2717
01:51:00.011 --> 01:51:00.611
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

2718
01:51:00.611 --> 01:51:02.400
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like now it's turned into like,</v>

2719
01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:05.620
<v Speaker 3>what has been the shade and the hate</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you think is unwarranted?</v>

2720
01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:07.030
<v Speaker 3>One?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2721

<v Speaker 3>first off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's not pretend like we can talk about</v>

2722
01:51:09.461 --> 01:51:13.240
<v Speaker 3>social justice warriors on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have them on the right to,</v>

2723
01:51:13.241 --> 01:51:16.390
<v Speaker 3>let's not pretend we don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that like they can't.</v>

2724
01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:19.420

01:51:46.901 --> 01:51:49.750
<v Speaker 3>what is the article going to be here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same boyfriend from high school and</v>

2739
01:51:49.751 --> 01:51:51.010
<v Speaker 3>he happened to be white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that'd be problem.</v>

2740
01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:54.070
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be a big part would be an</v>
<v Speaker 3>article that's for sure 100 percent,</v>

2741
01:51:54.071 --> 01:51:56.290
<v Speaker 3>but they just started digging in and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

2742
01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:57.970
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just working hard and if you want to</v>

2743
01:51:57.971 --> 01:52:00.490
<v Speaker 3>know what my strategy is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't make videos about you guys.</v>

2744
01:52:00.690 --> 01:52:02.140
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I make these not what I care about.</v>

2745
01:52:02.141 --> 01:52:03.670
<v Speaker 3>I have a brand and define my brand.</v>

2746
01:52:03.670 --> 01:52:06.430
<v Speaker 3>Your brand is just going after people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's not,</v>

2747
01:52:06.431 --> 01:52:09.070
<v Speaker 3>that's not a brand at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird thing on youtube where</v>

2748
01:52:09.190 --> 01:52:11.920
<v Speaker 3>you have these little communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they attack each other in the</v>

2749
01:52:11.921 --> 01:52:14.950
<v Speaker 3>communities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen the Vegan hate videos</v>

2750
01:52:14.951 --> 01:52:16.920
<v Speaker 3>where they go after it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I got,</v>

2751
01:52:17.090 --> 01:52:18.400
<v Speaker 3>it was like banana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's it?</v>

2752
01:52:18.401 --> 01:52:21.670
<v Speaker 3>Banana girl</v>
<v Speaker 3>freely or something?</v>

2753
01:52:21.671 --> 01:52:22.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard about.</v>

2754
01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:25.320
<v Speaker 3>I've heard about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't say call youtube like</v>

2755
01:52:25.330 --> 01:52:27.640
<v Speaker 3>youtube high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's like I and I was like the new</v>

2756
01:52:27.641 --> 01:52:29.320
<v Speaker 3>girl who showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are like 40.</v>

2757
01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know that's what's weird,</v>

2758
01:52:30.361 --> 01:52:32.140
<v Speaker 3>but like I was like the new girl who</v>
<v Speaker 3>showed up and like,</v>

2759
01:52:32.230 --> 01:52:34.660
<v Speaker 3>like</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheerleader.</v>

2760
01:52:34.661 --> 01:52:36.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the captain of the cheerleading</v>

2761
01:52:36.191 --> 01:52:37.024
<v Speaker 3>team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden</v>

2762
01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:39.900
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2763
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:42.430
<v Speaker 3>hate me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hate me.</v>

2764
01:52:43.070 --> 01:52:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be a youtuber.</v>

2765
01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 3>I just plugged my</v>

2766
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:49.160
<v Speaker 4>content on youtube and then I really</v>
<v Speaker 4>hate me.</v>

2767
01:52:50.690 --> 01:52:52.460
<v Speaker 4>That's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just like totally weird.</v>

2768
01:52:52.461 --> 01:52:55.150
<v Speaker 4>But it's fine because I never ran into</v>
<v Speaker 4>them because they don't have like,</v>

2769
01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:58.040
<v Speaker 4>there's no brand here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really don't think they go outside,</v>

2770
01:52:58.041 --> 01:53:00.650
<v Speaker 4>but there's no brand if you don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they run,</v>

2771
01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:05.150
<v Speaker 4>run back inside and make another huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's bizarre.</v>

2772
01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:06.470
<v Speaker 4>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's youtube high.</v>

2773
01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:08.480
<v Speaker 4>Then you have what I call game of</v>
<v Speaker 4>conservatives.</v>

2774
01:53:08.650 --> 01:53:09.560
<v Speaker 4>Just like didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't,</v>

2775
01:53:09.561 --> 01:53:11.720
<v Speaker 4>didn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did it like they're all like racing for</v>

2776
01:53:11.721 --> 01:53:14.900
<v Speaker 4>the throne and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like guys like there's like white</v>

2777
01:53:14.901 --> 01:53:16.100
<v Speaker 4>walkers at the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2778
01:53:16.130 --> 01:53:17.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the glove is trying to like turn this</v>

2779
01:53:17.931 --> 01:53:20.600
<v Speaker 4>into comedy so America can we not</v>
<v Speaker 4>compete for the egos.</v>

2780
01:53:20.601 --> 01:53:24.390
<v Speaker 4>That's like it's helping to save</v>
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>

2781
01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:27.680
<v Speaker 4>I genuinely believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like right now is the only time that we</v>

2782
01:53:27.681 --> 01:53:28.640
<v Speaker 4>have to save this country.</v>

2783
01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:30.520
<v Speaker 4>I genuinely believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're at the.</v>

2784
01:53:31.230 --> 01:53:34.220
<v Speaker 4>I think if Donald Trump did not win the</v>
<v Speaker 4>election,</v>

2785
01:53:34.250 --> 01:53:37.760
<v Speaker 4>we would've lost America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I genuinely like Hillary,</v>

2786
01:53:37.761 --> 01:53:40.670
<v Speaker 4>the global initiative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just this like the.</v>

2787
01:53:40.671 --> 01:53:43.490
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were like communist to me.</v>

2788
01:53:43.491 --> 01:53:44.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really believe that this is an</v>

2789
01:53:44.961 --> 01:53:47.450
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're like the last stand for Western</v>

2790
01:53:47.451 --> 01:53:48.740
<v Speaker 4>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look what's going on in Europe.</v>

2791
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:51.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like insane and people don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that.</v>

2792
01:53:51.321 --> 01:53:53.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is going on in Europe right now?</v>

2793
01:53:53.010 --> 01:53:55.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like Europe's done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she want you to watch the video.</v>

2794
01:53:55.641 --> 01:53:59.510
<v Speaker 4>Like Europe has committed suicide or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was called Douglas Murray on</v>

2795
01:53:59.511 --> 01:54:01.700
<v Speaker 4>the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was trying to explain to me his book</v>

2796
01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:03.950
<v Speaker 4>a strange death of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2797
01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:05.070
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he did a prayer.</v>

2798
01:54:05.071 --> 01:54:07.240
<v Speaker 4>You video on that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2799
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:10.370
<v Speaker 4>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they've lost Europe and the last</v>

2800
01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:13.400
<v Speaker 4>stand for resin civilization is America</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you have people that are</v>

2801
01:54:13.401 --> 01:54:14.330
<v Speaker 4>competing for Egos.</v>

2802
01:54:14.330 --> 01:54:14.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm like guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2803
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:19.700
<v Speaker 4>Like there's white walkers at the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand how you think that we</v>

2804
01:54:20.590 --> 01:54:23.880
<v Speaker 4>were almost losing America and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>battle for America.</v>

2805
01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:28.900
<v Speaker 4>I really feel that like just in in every</v>
<v Speaker 4>regard in terms of just just the people</v>

2806
01:54:29.691 --> 01:54:32.570
<v Speaker 4>that were running like Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this woman was a globalist.</v>

2807
01:54:32.610 --> 01:54:35.780
<v Speaker 4>Like just think about who we were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who we were in bed with like Saudi</v>

2808
01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:37.550
<v Speaker 4>Arabia selling all of our uranium to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia.</v>

2809
01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:40.040
<v Speaker 4>Like trump came in and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2810
01:54:40.041 --> 01:54:42.170
<v Speaker 4>like America people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We weren't the gap.</v>

2811
01:54:42.171 --> 01:54:43.850
<v Speaker 4>Like we lost them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're losing the middle class.</v>

2812
01:54:43.851 --> 01:54:47.860
<v Speaker 4>That gap between the rich and the poor</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like literally causing that.</v>

2813
01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:52.220
<v Speaker 4>A policy's shipping all of our jobs</v>
<v Speaker 4>overseas.</v>

2814
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:53.960
<v Speaker 4>The regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government getting bigger and</v>

2815
01:54:53.961 --> 01:54:55.820
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't do anything as an entrepreneur</v>

2816
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:57.980
<v Speaker 4>entrepreneur in America without a piece</v>
<v Speaker 4>of paper from the government,</v>

2817
01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:00.110
<v Speaker 4>discouraging people with this piece of</v>
<v Speaker 4>paper,</v>

2818
01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:02.780
<v Speaker 4>like sending,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like shutting down the factories from</v>

2819
01:55:02.781 --> 01:55:03.200
<v Speaker 4>getting that.</v>

2820
01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:05.870
<v Speaker 4>There's something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a little land between New York</v>

2821
01:55:05.871 --> 01:55:06.890
<v Speaker 4>and La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe it or not,</v>

2822
01:55:06.891 --> 01:55:07.400
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2823
01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:10.480
<v Speaker 4>and this is what trump understood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were losing that and,</v>

2824
01:55:10.481 --> 01:55:12.260
<v Speaker 4>and trump appealed to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those people.</v>

2825
01:55:12.261 --> 01:55:15.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm still floored,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as I'm traveling the world and</v>

2826
01:55:15.441 --> 01:55:19.310
<v Speaker 4>seeing different pieces of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm learning how ignorant I was like,</v>

2827
01:55:19.311 --> 01:55:21.050
<v Speaker 4>and that's the best thing in the entire</v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

2828
01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:25.010
<v Speaker 4>Just I fell victim to the idea that like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was progress,</v>

2829
01:55:25.011 --> 01:55:26.330
<v Speaker 4>it was progress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was progress.</v>

2830
01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:29.360
<v Speaker 4>We have to care about the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was progress and it's like no,</v>

2831
01:55:29.361 --> 01:55:32.630
<v Speaker 4>like we've been losing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>America has been losing and Donald Trump</v>

2832
01:55:32.631 --> 01:55:34.940
<v Speaker 4>understood that in a way that I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>end.</v>

2833
01:55:35.150 --> 01:55:37.130
<v Speaker 4>I thought we have to care about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>

2834
01:55:38.050 --> 01:55:40.450
<v Speaker 4>Not even a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even a little bit,</v>

2835
01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:41.390
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2836
01:55:41.391 --> 01:55:42.710
<v Speaker 4>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me clarify this.</v>

2837
01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:44.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't throw trash on the ground.</v>

2838
01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not saying like we need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2839
01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:48.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trash the environment like,</v>

2840
01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:51.050
<v Speaker 3>but do I believe in climate change?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2841
01:55:51.530 --> 01:55:54.690
<v Speaker 3>Don't believe in climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the climate always changes,</v>

2842
01:55:54.691 --> 01:55:56.610
<v Speaker 3>I guess is what I should do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that this is like,</v>

2843
01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:57.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an issue that,</v>

2844
01:55:57.900 --> 01:56:00.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is being that is fatal global warming,</v>

2845
01:56:00.691 --> 01:56:02.670
<v Speaker 3>which they've changed conveniently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got rid of the word one.</v>

2846
01:56:02.671 --> 01:56:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Scientists started disproving it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they only say client climate change.</v>

2847
01:56:06.230 --> 01:56:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2848
01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.370
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that was just a way to</v>

2849
01:56:08.371 --> 01:56:10.980
<v Speaker 3>extract dollars from Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't at all believe they had no</v>

2850
01:56:10.981 --> 01:56:12.870
<v Speaker 3>actionable plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was great for trump to gather that</v>

2851
01:56:12.871 --> 01:56:13.740
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was terrible.</v>

2852
01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:17.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is an incredibly complicated</v>

2853
01:56:17.131 --> 01:56:18.080
<v Speaker 3>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2854
01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:22.530
<v Speaker 3>You would have to talk to a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different scientists and see how they</v>

2855
01:56:22.531 --> 01:56:26.040
<v Speaker 3>gathered data and see what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand about co two levels and</v>

2856
01:56:26.041 --> 01:56:29.230
<v Speaker 3>what's the danger of that and what can</v>
<v Speaker 3>combat it and what could not.</v>

2857
01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:34.580
<v Speaker 3>Have you done all this flipping opinion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not.</v>

2858
01:56:34.650 --> 01:56:36.300
<v Speaker 3>This wouldn't be the hill I died on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2859
01:56:36.301 --> 01:56:37.770
<v Speaker 3>But it's not about part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just genuinely,</v>

2860
01:56:37.771 --> 01:56:40.200
<v Speaker 3>I've read a ton about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would not be able to.</v>

2861
01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:41.610
<v Speaker 3>I would not be able to come to you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>say like,</v>

2862
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:44.250
<v Speaker 3>this is my strong opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's like the easiest way to say</v>

2863
01:56:44.251 --> 01:56:45.084
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2864
01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:47.640
<v Speaker 3>The fact that there is a disparity in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the science committee about whether or</v>

2865
01:56:47.641 --> 01:56:49.650
<v Speaker 3>not it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's enough to very little,</v>

2866
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:51.390
<v Speaker 3>very little disparity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most,</v>

2867
01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:53.340
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most scientists,</v>

2868
01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:58.460
<v Speaker 3>most the vast majority agree that human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings are negatively affecting climate</v>

2869
01:56:59.341 --> 01:57:01.530
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority.</v>

2870
01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:03.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2871
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:04.500
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think so.</v>

2872
01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:08.280
<v Speaker 3>So you think that the very few</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists that disagree with the</v>

2873
01:57:08.281 --> 01:57:10.380
<v Speaker 3>consensus or the ones that are correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2874
01:57:10.381 --> 01:57:14.130
<v Speaker 3>I think if something is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's either subjective or objective and</v>

2875
01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.360
<v Speaker 3>their objective truths.</v>

2876
01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:16.710
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's subjective.</v>

2877
01:57:16.711 --> 01:57:19.050
<v Speaker 3>If you're saying that there are some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's very little.</v>

2878
01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:21.870
<v Speaker 3>There are some that don't get paid to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>on tv then some of their are not bill</v>

2879
01:57:21.871 --> 01:57:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Nye who are not funded scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2880
01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:27.120
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that has been a whole world not</v>

2881
01:57:27.121 --> 01:57:31.780
<v Speaker 3>assigned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not my heart when science</v>

2882
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:33.660
<v Speaker 3>piece,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the,</v>

2883
01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:37.330
<v Speaker 3>that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's not a good word to</v>

2884
01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:40.800
<v Speaker 3>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but bill Nye is like a science</v>

2885
01:57:40.890 --> 01:57:44.090
<v Speaker 3>influencer or a science entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2886
01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:46.770
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have a background in actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>

2887
01:57:46.771 --> 01:57:49.900
<v Speaker 3>He's not a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have a phd in science.</v>

2888
01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:55.200
<v Speaker 3>How to do with he promotes science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Science is not bad,</v>

2889
01:57:55.201 --> 01:58:00.201
<v Speaker 3>but the real problem is with climate</v>
<v Speaker 3>change is that would for sure there has</v>

2890
01:58:01.381 --> 01:58:04.350
<v Speaker 3>been ups and downs throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 3>history of this planet.</v>

2891
01:58:04.351 --> 01:58:05.710
<v Speaker 3>They're observable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've.</v>

2892
01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:08.670
<v Speaker 3>They followed them in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We was one of the subjects that I had</v>

2893
01:58:08.671 --> 01:58:12.540
<v Speaker 3>earlier today with a Dr Robert Schoch in</v>
<v Speaker 3>2014.</v>

2894
01:58:12.540 --> 01:58:15.750
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>87 percent of scientists said that human</v>

2895
01:58:15.751 --> 01:58:20.190
<v Speaker 3>activity is driving global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet only half the American public public</v>

2896
01:58:20.191 --> 01:58:22.080
<v Speaker 3>ascribe to that view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what website?</v>

2897
01:58:22.110 --> 01:58:26.780
<v Speaker 3>80 seven percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is scientific American though,</v>

2898
01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:29.880
<v Speaker 3>like that means it's making money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust that.</v>

2899
01:58:29.881 --> 01:58:31.530
<v Speaker 3>If it was a.org,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would probably take that,</v>

2900
01:58:31.531 --> 01:58:35.160
<v Speaker 3>but that this is just a random website</v>
<v Speaker 3>and scientific American is not</v>

2901
01:58:35.250 --> 01:58:37.570
<v Speaker 3>necessarily a random website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2902
01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:39.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe this like at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so you know,</v>

2903
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:43.630
<v Speaker 3>you don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I genuinely.</v>

2904
01:58:43.631 --> 01:58:46.420
<v Speaker 3>I genuinely don't believe I know you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I genuinely don't believe it.</v>

2905
01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:51.480
<v Speaker 3>I believe first time the consensus of</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists that are studying the data</v>

2906
01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:54.910
<v Speaker 3>and so what they're doing is studying</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the stories that came out about</v>

2907
01:58:54.911 --> 01:58:57.760
<v Speaker 3>the scientist that said that when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to present their evidence to show</v>

2908
01:58:57.761 --> 01:59:00.100
<v Speaker 3>like they were basically just getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut down at every corner,</v>

2909
01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:02.680
<v Speaker 3>you can pull that up to like scientists</v>
<v Speaker 3>who look up,</v>

2910
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:03.880
<v Speaker 3>I guess look up the opposite.</v>

2911
01:59:04.210 --> 01:59:05.550
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead of instead of looking for,</v>

2912
01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:07.390
<v Speaker 3>you're searching for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for what you're not looking for.</v>

2913
01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:10.290
<v Speaker 3>I didn't search for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I found when I searched it.</v>

2914
01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:12.460
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2915
01:59:12.490 --> 01:59:15.400
<v Speaker 3>look up is my question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you so sure.</v>

2916
01:59:15.401 --> 01:59:20.320
<v Speaker 3>This is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated subject and it is,</v>

2917
01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:24.970
<v Speaker 3>and I said I am not so sure that I would</v>
<v Speaker 3>die on the hill for it.</v>

2918
01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:28.990
<v Speaker 3>My opinion right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just that it was a means,</v>

2919
01:59:28.991 --> 01:59:31.840
<v Speaker 3>because forget the fact of whether you</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe global warming is real.</v>

2920
01:59:31.850 --> 01:59:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it's 100 percent real estate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know for fact that trail.</v>

2921
01:59:34.150 --> 01:59:39.150
<v Speaker 3>Is there a way clear global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>global climate change is definitely</v>

2922
01:59:39.281 --> 01:59:40.630
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's happening.</v>

2923
01:59:41.450 --> 01:59:42.530
<v Speaker 3>It's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2924
01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:44.080
<v Speaker 3>It has always had what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we?</v>

2925
01:59:44.081 --> 01:59:45.820
<v Speaker 3>What is the climate change?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2926
01:59:45.821 --> 01:59:47.740
<v Speaker 3>The climate changes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was different weather yesterday than</v>

2927
01:59:47.741 --> 01:59:48.574
<v Speaker 3>it was today.</v>

2928
01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:50.130
<v Speaker 3>The climate is forever changing like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2929
01:59:50.190 --> 01:59:52.930
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem is that people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>making it seem like that's something</v>

2930
01:59:52.931 --> 01:59:54.550
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not unique.</v>

2931
01:59:54.750 --> 01:59:58.030
<v Speaker 3>You're misrepresenting the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The issue is people think that human</v>

2932
01:59:58.031 --> 02:00:01.280
<v Speaker 3>beings are exacerbating climate change</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the point where there's a.</v>

2933
02:00:01.390 --> 02:00:04.210
<v Speaker 3>there's a tipping point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We cross over that tipping point.</v>

2934
02:00:04.211 --> 02:00:08.860
<v Speaker 3>We're going to deal with huge problems</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could be corrected if we act now</v>

2935
02:00:08.861 --> 02:00:13.030
<v Speaker 3>and put a lot of funding into climate</v>
<v Speaker 3>control and this is what Howard bloom</v>

2936
02:00:13.031 --> 02:00:16.660
<v Speaker 3>was on talking about a few days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about that the real</v>

2937
02:00:16.661 --> 02:00:20.140
<v Speaker 3>future involves the technology of</v>
<v Speaker 3>climate control and that will we have to</v>

2938
02:00:20.141 --> 02:00:25.141
<v Speaker 3>be really careful of is letting it get</v>
<v Speaker 3>too far where you can't ever stop it and</v>

2939
02:00:26.321 --> 02:00:28.360
<v Speaker 3>pull it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what scientists are reporting</v>

2940
02:00:28.361 --> 02:00:30.300
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why they want emission</v>

2941
02:00:30.370 --> 02:00:33.430
<v Speaker 3>standards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why they want to figure out how</v>

2942
02:00:33.431 --> 02:00:37.300
<v Speaker 3>to get people to be aware of the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is a real issue.</v>

2943
02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it regardless,</v>

2944
02:00:39.550 --> 02:00:42.550
<v Speaker 3>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they never existed,</v>

2945
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.090
<v Speaker 3>the earth has constantly gone through</v>
<v Speaker 3>cycles.</v>

2946
02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:50.200
<v Speaker 3>The question is not whether or not the</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth has gone through cycles of cooling</v>

2947
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:51.910
<v Speaker 3>and warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>

2948
02:00:52.210 --> 02:00:56.200
<v Speaker 3>are we exacerbating that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of scientists say we</v>

2949
02:00:56.201 --> 02:00:57.820
<v Speaker 3>are now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This could.</v>

2950
02:00:58.390 --> 02:01:01.600
<v Speaker 3>This could negatively impact all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of coastal cities.</v>

2951
02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:06.070
<v Speaker 3>This can be a gigantic problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not like the propaganda that's</v>

2952
02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:10.360
<v Speaker 3>drummed up by some sort of big business</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seeks to make money off of this or</v>

2953
02:01:10.361 --> 02:01:14.750
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Al Gore might've made some money off of</v>

2954
02:01:14.751 --> 02:01:16.090
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who's making money on that?</v>

2955
02:01:16.110 --> 02:01:19.570
<v Speaker 3>We were in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of money that America was</v>

2956
02:01:19.571 --> 02:01:20.920
<v Speaker 3>losing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's what I was gonna ask you.</v>

2957
02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:25.750
<v Speaker 3>So let's say amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>America was losing who was the Paris</v>

2958
02:01:25.751 --> 02:01:28.450
<v Speaker 3>agreement because this is the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 3>we wanted to get out of the Paris</v>

2959
02:01:28.451 --> 02:01:31.150
<v Speaker 3>agreement is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's why I wanted to get to say we</v>

2960
02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:34.720
<v Speaker 3>all agree that global warming is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it's real.</v>

2961
02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I can't see the question,</v>

2962
02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:39.950
<v Speaker 3>but why have a belief?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

2963
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Why have a belief as to whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>global warming is real or not real?</v>

2964
02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:47.200
<v Speaker 2>Because I just found in it you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the science,</v>

2965
02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:50.560
<v Speaker 2>but why have a belief in it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's high believe it's not a belief</v>

2966
02:01:50.561 --> 02:01:51.394
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in it,</v>

2967
02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:54.100
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have a belief that it doesn't</v>

2968
02:01:54.101 --> 02:01:54.934
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2969
02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:55.801
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2970
02:01:55.801 --> 02:01:58.540
<v Speaker 2>I personally think that this was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next.</v>

2971
02:01:58.570 --> 02:02:01.300
<v Speaker 2>The fact that it was presented to us by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Al Gore and it's just,</v>

2972
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:02.280
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2973
02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Not presented to us by just by Al Gore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Al Gore made a vr film and he's been</v>

2974
02:02:06.561 --> 02:02:09.260
<v Speaker 1>called like the first green billionaire</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's made a shitload of</v>

2975
02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:11.940
<v Speaker 2>the offer that he flies in his private</v>
<v Speaker 2>plane because he's so worried about the</v>

2976
02:02:11.941 --> 02:02:13.290
<v Speaker 2>emissions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is hilarious.</v>

2977
02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:16.560
<v Speaker 2>This is something hilarious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the people that are telling us a</v>

2978
02:02:16.561 --> 02:02:19.830
<v Speaker 2>fucking politician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's gross and all that stuff.</v>

2979
02:02:20.150 --> 02:02:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what worries me.</v>

2980
02:02:21.571 --> 02:02:24.960
<v Speaker 2>So my question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say that it's real.</v>

2981
02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Let's just assume like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's the best way to have,</v>

2982
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:29.140
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2983
02:02:30.450 --> 02:02:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel that you have found in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>research that there is something that</v>

2984
02:02:34.501 --> 02:02:37.680
<v Speaker 2>human beings can do that would change</v>
<v Speaker 2>this all around?</v>

2985
02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:38.950
<v Speaker 1>That's possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2986
02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:41.410
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that they're figuring</v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to pull carbon out of the</v>

2987
02:02:41.411 --> 02:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere and even even possibly reuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2988
02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:45.940
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of things that people</v>

2989
02:02:45.941 --> 02:02:46.960
<v Speaker 1>were trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2990
02:02:46.961 --> 02:02:47.860
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2991
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:52.150
<v Speaker 1>what was the young man who made that</v>
<v Speaker 1>device on slot?</v>

2992
02:02:52.450 --> 02:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>He figured out a way to make this device</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pulls plastic out of the oceans.</v>

2993
02:02:57.371 --> 02:02:58.510
<v Speaker 1>They're figuring out a way.</v>

2994
02:02:58.800 --> 02:02:59.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

2995
02:02:59.810 --> 02:03:01.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of plastic,</v>

2996
02:03:01.311 --> 02:03:03.110
<v Speaker 2>just can't like a overtime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I mean like,</v>

2997
02:03:03.111 --> 02:03:04.940
<v Speaker 2>so when I say that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

2998
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:07.770
<v Speaker 2>I believe in recycling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like a person that's like this,</v>

2999
02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:11.060
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that the government is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to take trillions of dollars</v>

3000
02:03:11.061 --> 02:03:13.520
<v Speaker 2>because we're in some agreement where</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all agreeing that we should do</v>

3001
02:03:13.521 --> 02:03:17.150
<v Speaker 2>something is useless and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and look from the stuff.</v>

3002
02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Like there's obviously a lot of debate</v>
<v Speaker 2>here and as I said,</v>

3003
02:03:19.950 --> 02:03:23.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so at the one thing you always</v>
<v Speaker 2>find with me is I'll never pretend to be</v>

3004
02:03:23.331 --> 02:03:26.300
<v Speaker 2>so educated on something like I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going onto college campuses talking</v>

3005
02:03:26.301 --> 02:03:27.710
<v Speaker 2>about global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do that.</v>

3006
02:03:27.770 --> 02:03:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why are you saying that you don't</v>

3007
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:30.140
<v Speaker 2>think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't,</v>

3008
02:03:30.141 --> 02:03:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3009
02:03:31.311 --> 02:03:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Maybe because it got so close maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it got so politicized.</v>

3010
02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Studies into scientific agreement on</v>
<v Speaker 1>human caused global warming.</v>

3011
02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:45.480
<v Speaker 1>And look at all the studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's between 100 percent and 91 percent</v>

3012
02:03:46.271 --> 02:03:48.790
<v Speaker 1>at the lowest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety one percent of one of the studies</v>

3013
02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:52.390
<v Speaker 1>from 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since the Union of concerned scientists</v>

3014
02:03:52.650 --> 02:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they almost,</v>

3015
02:03:54.290 --> 02:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty broad consensus.</v>

3016
02:03:57.180 --> 02:03:57.931
<v Speaker 2>Who did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who did?</v>

3017
02:03:57.931 --> 02:04:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pulling.</v>

3018
02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Is it the people that are a part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

3019
02:04:03.690 --> 02:04:05.940
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm asking.</v>

3020
02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Numbers can 300,</v>

3021
02:04:07.930 --> 02:04:12.930
<v Speaker 1>six scientists to confirm over 97</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of climate scientists agree and</v>

3022
02:04:13.451 --> 02:04:17.050
<v Speaker 1>over 97 percent of the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>articles find that global warming is</v>

3023
02:04:17.051 --> 02:04:21.100
<v Speaker 1>real and largely caused by humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my question to you is if you want to</v>

3024
02:04:21.101 --> 02:04:23.440
<v Speaker 1>step outside of the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>consensus,</v>

3025
02:04:23.710 --> 02:04:28.710
<v Speaker 1>which is vast and involves 10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>306 scientists and just say,</v>

3026
02:04:29.771 --> 02:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're right,</v>

3027
02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>even if you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have enough information to say</v>

3028
02:04:35.351 --> 02:04:35.940
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

3029
02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:36.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be.</v>

3030
02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Why I said this</v>

3031
02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:39.980
<v Speaker 3>was the thing you don't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3032
02:04:39.981 --> 02:04:42.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have to have someone sit down</v>

3033
02:04:42.211 --> 02:04:44.700
<v Speaker 3>and convinced me that it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I personally don't believe it.</v>

3034
02:04:44.701 --> 02:04:47.280
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good to start at a place of not</v>

3035
02:04:47.281 --> 02:04:48.540
<v Speaker 3>believing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3036
02:04:48.541 --> 02:04:49.890
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think you should start with</v>

3037
02:04:49.891 --> 02:04:53.250
<v Speaker 3>believing everything he did not believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>either or not believe?</v>

3038
02:04:53.251 --> 02:04:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not believe no,</v>

3039
02:04:55.110 --> 02:04:58.140
<v Speaker 3>but don't say you don't believe I learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

3040
02:04:58.650 --> 02:05:01.650
<v Speaker 3>learn about it and then have an opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're stating this opinion without</v>

3041
02:05:01.651 --> 02:05:04.220
<v Speaker 3>having any real understanding of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>climate science.</v>

3042
02:05:04.610 --> 02:05:06.480
<v Speaker 3>But that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what an opinion is.</v>

3043
02:05:06.481 --> 02:05:07.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

3044
02:05:07.411 --> 02:05:07.830
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

3045
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:10.380
<v Speaker 3>if you said that Kenneth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she went onto 10,000 college campuses</v>

3046
02:05:10.381 --> 02:05:11.610
<v Speaker 3>and you said that global warming isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>

3047
02:05:11.611 --> 02:05:14.400
<v Speaker 3>then we'd have a problem and I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a conversation.</v>

3048
02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:17.880
<v Speaker 3>Why have an opinion on something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have data about?</v>

3049
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:21.630
<v Speaker 3>This is my question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't necessarily have an opinion</v>

3050
02:05:21.631 --> 02:05:24.810
<v Speaker 3>on climate science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't know much about it,</v>

3051
02:05:24.930 --> 02:05:29.930
<v Speaker 3>but what I know is that what I've read</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the vast majority of people who</v>

3052
02:05:29.971 --> 02:05:32.350
<v Speaker 3>study it or an agreement that human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings are effect.</v>

3053
02:05:32.351 --> 02:05:35.490
<v Speaker 3>So I just my recall on a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I read,</v>

3054
02:05:35.491 --> 02:05:37.190
<v Speaker 3>and this was a while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is why I.</v>

3055
02:05:37.210 --> 02:05:39.330
<v Speaker 3>When I first formed my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not believing this,</v>

3056
02:05:39.331 --> 02:05:42.780
<v Speaker 3>I read it a shit ton of articles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't recall the data because like I</v>

3057
02:05:42.781 --> 02:05:43.770
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this wasn't something I was super</v>

3058
02:05:43.771 --> 02:05:45.930
<v Speaker 3>passionate about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like somebody posted something</v>

3059
02:05:46.170 --> 02:05:47.910
<v Speaker 3>and then I went on a tear or reading</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

3060
02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:51.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was essentially just noting that</v>

3061
02:05:51.511 --> 02:05:53.610
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of these studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you go and you,</v>

3062
02:05:53.730 --> 02:05:55.920
<v Speaker 3>if we had time to sit down and really</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled this up,</v>

3063
02:05:56.190 --> 02:05:57.550
<v Speaker 3>they're pulling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3064
02:05:57.720 --> 02:06:01.290
<v Speaker 3>10,000 scientists that are within a</v>
<v Speaker 3>community that is like these,</v>

3065
02:06:01.291 --> 02:06:02.430
<v Speaker 3>that works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you believe?</v>

3066
02:06:02.431 --> 02:06:04.710
<v Speaker 3>And everything that media matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>media matters,</v>

3067
02:06:04.711 --> 02:06:07.380
<v Speaker 3>dot org puts out for statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3068
02:06:07.381 --> 02:06:10.140
<v Speaker 3>That's a political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a political arm of the Democratic</v>

3069
02:06:10.140 --> 02:06:10.973
<v Speaker 3>Party.</v>

3070
02:06:12.510 --> 02:06:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Politics versus science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This has been politicized.</v>

3071
02:06:17.790 --> 02:06:21.330
<v Speaker 3>It has global warming in particular has</v>
<v Speaker 3>been politicized 100 percent.</v>

3072
02:06:21.331 --> 02:06:22.770
<v Speaker 3>It has been politicized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3073
02:06:22.771 --> 02:06:25.780
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole reason that I fell down</v>
<v Speaker 3>this dark hole one night reading about</v>

3074
02:06:25.781 --> 02:06:26.401
<v Speaker 3>it and I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3075
02:06:26.401 --> 02:06:29.610
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The day care it has been politicized.</v>

3076
02:06:29.611 --> 02:06:32.340
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's also maybe why you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying you don't agree with it so</v>

3077
02:06:32.341 --> 02:06:36.990
<v Speaker 3>quickly because it's an ideological</v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing point,</v>

3078
02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that global warming isn't real if</v>

3079
02:06:39.361 --> 02:06:41.580
<v Speaker 3>you're one of those people that thinks</v>
<v Speaker 3>global warming isn't real,</v>

3080
02:06:41.581 --> 02:06:44.310
<v Speaker 3>you're almost always on the right and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>

3081
02:06:44.311 --> 02:06:46.020
<v Speaker 3>but I'm telling you that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3082
02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:49.860
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do a deep dive on all of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I read about it because it was</v>

3083
02:06:49.861 --> 02:06:52.590
<v Speaker 3>at a forefront of discussion and so I</v>
<v Speaker 3>read about it all night and my</v>

3084
02:06:52.591 --> 02:06:55.200
<v Speaker 3>conclusion was that they started pulling</v>
<v Speaker 3>up all of these studies and the person</v>

3085
02:06:55.201 --> 02:06:57.810
<v Speaker 3>that did this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a deep dive on and they started</v>

3086
02:06:57.811 --> 02:07:00.840
<v Speaker 3>showing how like these community of</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists were in fact,</v>

3087
02:07:00.841 --> 02:07:03.240
<v Speaker 3>somewhere behind that.org as someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was being funded.</v>

3088
02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:06.520
<v Speaker 3>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the issue got to politicize for me to to</v>

3089
02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:10.170
<v Speaker 3>to believe that global warming was</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that was going to wipe out the</v>

3090
02:07:10.171 --> 02:07:12.790
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that is a fact,</v>

3091
02:07:13.150 --> 02:07:17.490
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that the funding</v>
<v Speaker 3>affects the scientific research and the</v>

3092
02:07:17.491 --> 02:07:21.690
<v Speaker 3>data which they all agree on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is universally across the</v>

3093
02:07:21.691 --> 02:07:25.830
<v Speaker 3>entire plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thousands and thousands of scientists</v>

3094
02:07:25.831 --> 02:07:28.170
<v Speaker 3>would not stake their reputation on</v>
<v Speaker 3>false data,</v>

3095
02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:33.420
<v Speaker 3>but what they're saying is not that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only reason why the world is getting</v>

3096
02:07:33.631 --> 02:07:37.030
<v Speaker 3>warm is because human beings that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only reason why the climate isn't</v>

3097
02:07:37.031 --> 02:07:40.150
<v Speaker 3>totally static for the rest of eternity</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of human beings.</v>

3098
02:07:40.330 --> 02:07:45.330
<v Speaker 3>What they're saying is we are negatively</v>
<v Speaker 3>impacting our own environment and we're</v>

3099
02:07:45.461 --> 02:07:50.461
<v Speaker 3>doing it because we have technology and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we use coal and fossil fuels and</v>

3100
02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:57.660
<v Speaker 3>emissions and we're raising our CEO two</v>
<v Speaker 3>levels and this is based on data and</v>

3101
02:07:57.731 --> 02:07:58.150
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

3102
02:07:58.150 --> 02:08:02.260
<v Speaker 3>This is something that you can look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could look at the data and follow</v>

3103
02:08:02.261 --> 02:08:05.860
<v Speaker 3>where they're getting this information</v>
<v Speaker 3>from and follow how they're making these</v>

3104
02:08:05.861 --> 02:08:10.420
<v Speaker 3>conclusions and follow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of these brilliant</v>

3105
02:08:10.421 --> 02:08:12.830
<v Speaker 3>people study that shit their whole line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

3106
02:08:12.850 --> 02:08:15.310
<v Speaker 3>and if I look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was a person that was putting forth</v>

3107
02:08:15.311 --> 02:08:19.720
<v Speaker 3>policy on climate change or if I was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person that put out by opinion publicly</v>

3108
02:08:19.721 --> 02:08:22.390
<v Speaker 3>on Paul on on climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do all of that.</v>

3109
02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:24.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand what you're saying,</v>

3110
02:08:24.461 --> 02:08:26.680
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is that you are a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very smart person.</v>

3111
02:08:26.681 --> 02:08:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people listened to you and they're</v>

3112
02:08:28.211 --> 02:08:29.960
<v Speaker 3>going to listen to for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

3113
02:08:31.650 --> 02:08:33.350
<v Speaker 3>but hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me finish what I'm saying.</v>

3114
02:08:33.351 --> 02:08:36.430
<v Speaker 3>To have a formal opinion on if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to have a formal opinion on</v>

3115
02:08:36.431 --> 02:08:36.730
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

3116
02:08:36.730 --> 02:08:41.140
<v Speaker 3>What you do have to have is the ability</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know when you don't know what the</v>

3117
02:08:41.141 --> 02:08:44.180
<v Speaker 3>fuck you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said you don't believe it.</v>

3118
02:08:45.010 --> 02:08:46.780
<v Speaker 3>Don't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He asked me and I said this wouldn't be</v>

3119
02:08:46.781 --> 02:08:51.781
<v Speaker 3>the hill I chose to die on because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't say you don't believe in because I</v>

3120
02:08:52.330 --> 02:08:57.330
<v Speaker 3>personally do not have a belief until</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really prefer if my language as</v>

3121
02:08:57.641 --> 02:08:59.890
<v Speaker 3>opposed to admitting that I do not know</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

3122
02:08:59.891 --> 02:09:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I went diamond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've never made a B.</v>

3123
02:09:01.241 --> 02:09:03.250
<v Speaker 3>I've never made a public statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would have preferred if I had just</v>

3124
02:09:03.251 --> 02:09:06.250
<v Speaker 3>started by saying I have no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no opinion.</v>

3125
02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:07.420
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3126
02:09:08.020 --> 02:09:09.000
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you.</v>

3127
02:09:09.010 --> 02:09:11.590
<v Speaker 3>You say no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say I don't believe in it.</v>

3128
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

3129
02:09:12.931 --> 02:09:15.100
<v Speaker 3>You're saying really clearly that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think it's real.</v>

3130
02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:17.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be the same if I said</v>

3131
02:09:17.111 --> 02:09:18.420
<v Speaker 3>to you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3132
02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:22.430
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you believe in God right now?</v>

3133
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:23.980
<v Speaker 3>I would say I don't know if he would</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

3134
02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:26.980
<v Speaker 3>I feel like this is sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>linguistics though.</v>

3135
02:09:27.070 --> 02:09:28.150
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3136
02:09:28.151 --> 02:09:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I always say I'm agnostic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe I believe it or I don't.</v>

3137
02:09:32.740 --> 02:09:34.650
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like if you say a lot of people</v>

3138
02:09:34.651 --> 02:09:37.280
<v Speaker 3>say they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think believers is definitely worth</v>

3139
02:09:37.370 --> 02:09:38.650
<v Speaker 3>associated with God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

3140
02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:44.320
<v Speaker 3>don't say I don't believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then somebody starts saying,</v>

3141
02:09:44.321 --> 02:09:44.961
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to form.</v>

3142
02:09:44.961 --> 02:09:45.794
<v Speaker 3>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3143
02:09:47.130 --> 02:09:47.651
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>

3144
02:09:47.651 --> 02:09:50.070
<v Speaker 3>Because God is not scientific data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3145
02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:52.420
<v Speaker 3>There's a big difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>measuring the CEO two levels in the</v>

3146
02:09:52.421 --> 02:09:55.480
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere and deciding whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an afterlife.</v>

3147
02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:59.410
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry that I just don't believe.</v>

3148
02:09:59.530 --> 02:10:03.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to try</v>

3149
02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:08.500
<v Speaker 3>to influence her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a very bright person.</v>

3150
02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:12.880
<v Speaker 3>If somebody had asked me like at a place</v>
<v Speaker 3>for influencing on a college campus,</v>

3151
02:10:12.881 --> 02:10:13.840
<v Speaker 3>what's your opinion?</v>

3152
02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:16.690
<v Speaker 3>I would say I have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you would say I don't believe in</v>

3153
02:10:16.691 --> 02:10:18.900
<v Speaker 3>it like you just did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is absolutely not what you,</v>

3154
02:10:19.370 --> 02:10:21.640
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are so many instances where you</v>

3155
02:10:21.641 --> 02:10:22.391
<v Speaker 3>could watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

3156
02:10:22.391 --> 02:10:24.970
<v Speaker 3>and you can ask Dave route,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when he asks me a question I say I</v>

3157
02:10:24.971 --> 02:10:27.940
<v Speaker 3>don't have any opinion about a different</v>
<v Speaker 3>subject for you and I are having a</v>

3158
02:10:27.941 --> 02:10:29.440
<v Speaker 3>conversation one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

3159
02:10:29.441 --> 02:10:32.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sitting here to try to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't go on campus talking about</v>

3160
02:10:32.051 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 3>global warming because I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have an opinion on it,</v>

3161
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:36.230
<v Speaker 4>but if you press me and asked if I</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe in it,</v>

3162
02:10:36.650 --> 02:10:37.910
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really believe in it,</v>

3163
02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:41.330
<v Speaker 4>but it could I go deep dive in and learn</v>
<v Speaker 4>that perhaps I'm wrong.</v>

3164
02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:44.180
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I personally am inclined to believe that</v>

3165
02:10:44.181 --> 02:10:46.220
<v Speaker 4>a lot of those studies are manipulated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3166
02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:48.680
<v Speaker 4>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>generally the one night that did deep</v>

3167
02:10:48.681 --> 02:10:51.820
<v Speaker 4>dive on it and when they showed like all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pieces of evidence,</v>

3168
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:53.160
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just seemed a little shady,</v>

3169
02:10:53.161 --> 02:10:56.270
<v Speaker 4>but I felt that it was politicized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think I have a right to say that.</v>

3170
02:10:56.271 --> 02:10:58.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe in something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I also don't know and that's what I</v>

3171
02:10:58.431 --> 02:10:59.630
<v Speaker 4>said to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe in it,</v>

3172
02:10:59.810 --> 02:11:01.970
<v Speaker 4>but I wouldn't die on this hill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know enough about it.</v>

3173
02:11:01.971 --> 02:11:02.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't</v>

3174
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:05.770
<v Speaker 1>when dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also said you don't believe in</v>

3175
02:11:05.771 --> 02:11:08.920
<v Speaker 1>it and you stated the reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you think it's a scam.</v>

3176
02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:09.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3177
02:11:10.770 --> 02:11:11.710
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do want me to.</v>

3178
02:11:11.711 --> 02:11:12.910
<v Speaker 4>You want me to lie to you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's okay,</v>

3179
02:11:12.911 --> 02:11:15.090
<v Speaker 4>but I just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sitting here saying like heated</v>

3180
02:11:15.110 --> 02:11:17.810
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very complicated.</v>

3181
02:11:17.811 --> 02:11:18.640
<v Speaker 4>That's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

3182
02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:20.060
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you want me to lie to you and</v>

3183
02:11:20.061 --> 02:11:22.280
<v Speaker 4>say I'm not a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want me to say you should the</v>

3184
02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:24.410
<v Speaker 4>correct term like the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like this is like the editing of</v>

3185
02:11:24.420 --> 02:11:25.820
<v Speaker 4>people do like when they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3186
02:11:25.930 --> 02:11:27.330
<v Speaker 4>a bond.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they ask a question you don't know.</v>

3187
02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:29.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm not running for office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm answering.</v>

3188
02:11:29.571 --> 02:11:32.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe in it that I appreciate</v>

3189
02:11:32.900 --> 02:11:33.920
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't be fake.</v>

3190
02:11:33.930 --> 02:11:36.440
<v Speaker 4>I die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is my number one problem in life is</v>

3191
02:11:36.441 --> 02:11:39.200
<v Speaker 4>I can't be fake and I know that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>oppressing me or that you want me to</v>

3192
02:11:39.201 --> 02:11:40.880
<v Speaker 4>adjust and to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3193
02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:43.850
<v Speaker 4>I do not have an opinion or the EPA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a politician.</v>

3194
02:11:43.851 --> 02:11:45.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you I don't believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could I?</v>

3195
02:11:45.410 --> 02:11:48.670
<v Speaker 4>Could I changed my perspective of</v>
<v Speaker 4>leaving in a year after I read that?</v>

3196
02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:50.270
<v Speaker 1>If you were just a regular person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>

3197
02:11:50.271 --> 02:11:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably go all right.</v>

3198
02:11:52.130 --> 02:11:54.260
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

3199
02:11:54.261 --> 02:11:55.730
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a very.</v>

3200
02:11:56.010 --> 02:11:58.470
<v Speaker 4>When I'm aware,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm aware when I'm on stage,</v>

3201
02:11:58.471 --> 02:12:00.900
<v Speaker 4>when I'm on my youtube channel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no videos of can.</v>

3202
02:12:00.901 --> 02:12:02.430
<v Speaker 4>If someone's talking about global</v>
<v Speaker 4>warming,</v>

3203
02:12:02.431 --> 02:12:04.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm aware of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is now a.</v>

3204
02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:05.233
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

3205
02:12:05.670 --> 02:12:07.590
<v Speaker 4>Now it's going to be broken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can go either way.</v>

3206
02:12:07.770 --> 02:12:08.550
<v Speaker 4>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3207
02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:10.310
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were going to be mad at me because</v>

3208
02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:14.560
<v Speaker 4>you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know what's funny though is that like</v>

3209
02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:16.830
<v Speaker 4>this feels so like we're not on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet right now,</v>

3210
02:12:16.831 --> 02:12:18.630
<v Speaker 4>but it's like I still don't feel like</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're on the Internet.</v>

3211
02:12:18.631 --> 02:12:19.530
<v Speaker 4>This is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3212
02:12:19.770 --> 02:12:21.840
<v Speaker 4>but like if we were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you and I are on a college campus,</v>

3213
02:12:21.841 --> 02:12:22.674
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

3214
02:12:22.890 --> 02:12:25.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm not really sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have an informed discussion on</v>

3215
02:12:25.351 --> 02:12:27.420
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jack Shit about global warming.</v>

3216
02:12:27.421 --> 02:12:28.310
<v Speaker 4>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3217
02:12:28.311 --> 02:12:30.450
<v Speaker 4>I think with the real fear is not even</v>
<v Speaker 4>global warming.</v>

3218
02:12:30.451 --> 02:12:31.920
<v Speaker 4>The real fear is global cooling.</v>

3219
02:12:32.070 --> 02:12:35.450
<v Speaker 4>The Ice Age is the most terrifying thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that can happen to human beings that</v>

3220
02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:38.130
<v Speaker 4>should happen is everybody dies global</v>
<v Speaker 4>warming,</v>

3221
02:12:38.131 --> 02:12:41.250
<v Speaker 4>you just move inland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that the real thing that people</v>

3222
02:12:41.251 --> 02:12:44.220
<v Speaker 4>are concerned about is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just beyond any of that stuff.</v>

3223
02:12:44.221 --> 02:12:46.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's more concerns in</v>

3224
02:12:46.021 --> 02:12:46.651
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

3225
02:12:46.651 --> 02:12:50.310
<v Speaker 4>I personally think that some scientists</v>
<v Speaker 4>are talking about global warming and it</v>

3226
02:12:50.311 --> 02:12:51.720
<v Speaker 4>got politicized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They figured it was another way to</v>

3227
02:12:51.721 --> 02:12:53.400
<v Speaker 4>extract human beings money because of</v>
<v Speaker 4>fear.</v>

3228
02:12:53.401 --> 02:12:55.950
<v Speaker 4>That's my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's probably some truth to</v>

3229
02:12:55.951 --> 02:12:57.630
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely going to find our</v>

3230
02:12:57.631 --> 02:12:59.100
<v Speaker 4>core scientists that agree with</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything we say.</v>

3231
02:12:59.101 --> 02:13:01.830
<v Speaker 4>If it's improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Harvard studies have been in incorrect</v>

3232
02:13:01.831 --> 02:13:05.050
<v Speaker 4>because they were being funded by</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain political interest group,</v>

3233
02:13:05.051 --> 02:13:08.880
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not inclined to pull up something</v>
<v Speaker 4>on and um,</v>

3234
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:12.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm blanking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll come back to me in a second.</v>

3235
02:13:12.061 --> 02:13:15.000
<v Speaker 4>But there were Harvard papers that had</v>
<v Speaker 4>been funded by certain researchers that</v>

3236
02:13:15.001 --> 02:13:18.330
<v Speaker 4>are trying to get a certain political</v>
<v Speaker 4>position out and it causes mass fear.</v>

3237
02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:21.120
<v Speaker 4>People are willing to spend their money</v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain way possible.</v>

3238
02:13:21.121 --> 02:13:21.990
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's real.</v>

3239
02:13:21.991 --> 02:13:23.250
<v Speaker 4>That's very real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are flawed.</v>

3240
02:13:23.251 --> 02:13:25.350
<v Speaker 4>So I'm not inclined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When someone pulls up an article and</v>

3241
02:13:25.351 --> 02:13:26.020
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3242
02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:28.110
<v Speaker 4>a 10,000 scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I err on the side of,</v>

3243
02:13:28.111 --> 02:13:29.370
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know those scientists are.</v>

3244
02:13:29.371 --> 02:13:31.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the organization is</v>
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>

3245
02:13:31.590 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going</v>

3246
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:33.660
<v Speaker 2>to stick by my guns and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really believe in it yet.</v>

3247
02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:36.210
<v Speaker 2>Now if I decide that I'm going to run</v>
<v Speaker 2>for office and I've got to make a</v>

3248
02:13:36.211 --> 02:13:37.920
<v Speaker 2>decision on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the atmosphere and,</v>

3249
02:13:37.921 --> 02:13:39.090
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what we're going to do about global</v>

3250
02:13:39.091 --> 02:13:41.970
<v Speaker 2>warming into two missions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better believe I will be fully ready</v>

3251
02:13:41.971 --> 02:13:42.960
<v Speaker 2>to discuss it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna.</v>

3252
02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Make a youtube video and just know the</v>
<v Speaker 2>outskirts of it.</v>

3253
02:13:45.271 --> 02:13:46.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3254
02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:48.540
<v Speaker 2>But if you and I having a discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

3255
02:13:48.541 --> 02:13:50.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would almost say</v>

3256
02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:53.130
<v Speaker 2>open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open to learning,</v>

3257
02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:55.230
<v Speaker 2>open to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always open to learning.</v>

3258
02:13:55.231 --> 02:13:56.760
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been wrong before.</v>

3259
02:13:56.761 --> 02:13:58.330
<v Speaker 2>I was a liberal two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3260
02:13:58.540 --> 02:13:59.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or three years ago.</v>

3261
02:13:59.701 --> 02:14:01.080
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a problem.</v>

3262
02:14:01.081 --> 02:14:05.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm open to learning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to like for like say</v>

3263
02:14:05.101 --> 02:14:07.560
<v Speaker 2>something that feels inauthentic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I wanted to say there was,</v>

3264
02:14:07.561 --> 02:14:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in it.</v>

3265
02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:09.860
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>become,</v>

3266
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:12.980
<v Speaker 2>it's a real right wing talking points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's very few,</v>

3267
02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:16.560
<v Speaker 2>like pro life is a very right wing</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking points.</v>

3268
02:14:16.561 --> 02:14:18.960
<v Speaker 2>Very few I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just guessing,</v>

3269
02:14:18.961 --> 02:14:22.080
<v Speaker 2>but very few liberals who are also</v>
<v Speaker 2>prolife well no.</v>

3270
02:14:22.081 --> 02:14:25.560
<v Speaker 2>So when I first went on Dave Rubin show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he asked me about that and I said,</v>

3271
02:14:25.561 --> 02:14:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm forming my opinion on it like just</v>

3272
02:14:27.961 --> 02:14:29.400
<v Speaker 2>like you and I just said about global</v>
<v Speaker 2>warming.</v>

3273
02:14:29.401 --> 02:14:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I said to Dave Rubin about a pro life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pro choice,</v>

3274
02:14:33.170 --> 02:14:33.961
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was like,</v>

3275
02:14:33.961 --> 02:14:35.880
<v Speaker 2>this is the first time someone has just</v>
<v Speaker 2>said that,</v>

3276
02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:38.010
<v Speaker 2>like just said that I'm forming an</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion on it and didn't feel like they</v>

3277
02:14:38.011 --> 02:14:38.910
<v Speaker 2>needed to get an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

3278
02:14:38.911 --> 02:14:40.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing I'm saying to you like I can</v>

3279
02:14:40.831 --> 02:14:42.600
<v Speaker 2>answer how I feel and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3280
02:14:42.610 --> 02:14:45.510
<v Speaker 2>and I'm happy to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a different kind of subjects.</v>

3281
02:14:45.810 --> 02:14:50.700
<v Speaker 2>But then I wanted to get really educated</v>
<v Speaker 2>on it and I became prolife but not</v>

3282
02:14:50.701 --> 02:14:53.610
<v Speaker 2>because I think people that are pro</v>
<v Speaker 2>choice or awful human beings,</v>

3283
02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:54.493
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3284
02:14:54.610 --> 02:14:55.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who needed to burn in hell.</v>

3285
02:14:55.981 --> 02:14:58.980
<v Speaker 2>But just because the history of it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really shady.</v>

3286
02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm with Margaret Sanger and because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>do recognize that it does seem a little</v>

3287
02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:04.050
<v Speaker 2>off putting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't say like,</v>

3288
02:15:04.051 --> 02:15:04.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3289
02:15:04.701 --> 02:15:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm prolife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just say to people that like,</v>

3290
02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:11.130
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the left is so pro choice</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time that they are running</v>

3291
02:15:11.131 --> 02:15:13.110
<v Speaker 2>around reporting to know black lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

3292
02:15:13.111 --> 02:15:15.900
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the numbers of black</v>

3293
02:15:15.901 --> 02:15:18.770
<v Speaker 2>babies never even get a chance to live</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you look at the numbers and</v>

3294
02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:22.980
<v Speaker 2>just understanding that 17 million black</v>
<v Speaker 2>babies had been exterminated since 1973.</v>

3295
02:15:22.981 --> 02:15:25.320
<v Speaker 2>So what kind of black lives do you care</v>
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>

3296
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:28.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that baby's life starts</v>
<v Speaker 2>after three months.</v>

3297
02:15:28.351 --> 02:15:30.420
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's scientific crap.</v>

3298
02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could probably pull up some articles</v>

3299
02:15:31.921 --> 02:15:35.030
<v Speaker 2>that say for sure the baby's life does</v>
<v Speaker 2>not begin until the three months.</v>

3300
02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:37.950
<v Speaker 2>We wonder the best indication that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby's life begins before it because you</v>

3301
02:15:37.951 --> 02:15:39.390
<v Speaker 2>have to rip it out of the stomach in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to kill it.</v>

3302
02:15:39.650 --> 02:15:40.260
<v Speaker 2>It if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3303
02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:41.071
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if left alone,</v>

3304
02:15:41.071 --> 02:15:42.510
<v Speaker 2>it would grow into a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3305
02:15:42.511 --> 02:15:45.420
<v Speaker 2>So I've thought about that issue and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a stance on it.</v>

3306
02:15:45.450 --> 02:15:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that would be my stance.</v>

3307
02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:48.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was president,</v>

3308
02:15:48.211 --> 02:15:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I'd say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be the president.</v>

3309
02:15:49.401 --> 02:15:50.320
<v Speaker 2>I'd states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3310
02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:51.630
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me say what trump said,</v>

3311
02:15:52.090 --> 02:15:53.310
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I stepped up,</v>

3312
02:15:53.370 --> 02:15:54.930
<v Speaker 2>if my country needed me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

3313
02:15:54.931 --> 02:15:57.270
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would step up and I would do the job.</v>

3314
02:15:57.450 --> 02:15:59.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have aspirations?</v>

3315
02:15:59.430 --> 02:16:01.800
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I promise you I get this question all</v>

3316
02:16:01.801 --> 02:16:02.760
<v Speaker 2>the time on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenneth,</v>

3317
02:16:02.761 --> 02:16:04.290
<v Speaker 2>do you want to be in the White House?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to be the White House?</v>

3318
02:16:04.530 --> 02:16:06.810
<v Speaker 2>I would love if Charlie Kirk was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>president of dates.</v>

3319
02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:09.000
<v Speaker 2>I would have fun being the press</v>
<v Speaker 2>secretary.</v>

3320
02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just let him in,</v>

3321
02:16:10.381 --> 02:16:12.120
<v Speaker 2>let the dogs in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would choose.</v>

3322
02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:17.430
<v Speaker 2>It just looks like a fun job because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so crazy fun job does because</v>

3323
02:16:17.431 --> 02:16:20.880
<v Speaker 2>they're just so crazy and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just have fun at that too.</v>

3324
02:16:20.881 --> 02:16:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be a fun job.</v>

3325
02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:25.860
<v Speaker 2>They're so serious and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3326
02:16:25.861 --> 02:16:28.020
<v Speaker 2>you take yourself seriously like Jim</v>
<v Speaker 2>Acosta.</v>

3327
02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Just be running the government of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest empire the world has ever</v>

3328
02:16:34.211 --> 02:16:36.400
<v Speaker 2>known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that would be fun?</v>

3329
02:16:36.670 --> 02:16:38.830
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't even seem remotely funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm being,</v>

3330
02:16:38.831 --> 02:16:41.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm being a little facetious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it insanely stressful.</v>

3331
02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Who's the press secretary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Huckabee.</v>

3332
02:16:44.741 --> 02:16:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looks stressed out.</v>

3333
02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:50.620
<v Speaker 2>I think she's just trying to have a game</v>
<v Speaker 2>face you just like a stupid question.</v>

3334
02:16:50.730 --> 02:16:52.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

3335
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:54.160
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3336
02:16:54.610 --> 02:16:57.490
<v Speaker 2>how far can you swim?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people could swim for sandy hours.</v>

3337
02:16:57.850 --> 02:17:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Nobody can swim forever and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>that job looks like to me forever.</v>

3338
02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Nobody can swim forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3339
02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:07.240
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't start this because I wanted to</v>

3340
02:17:07.241 --> 02:17:10.990
<v Speaker 2>get into politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started this because I saw a dial that</v>

3341
02:17:10.991 --> 02:17:12.610
<v Speaker 2>needed to be moved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what?</v>

3342
02:17:12.611 --> 02:17:15.430
<v Speaker 2>You're obviously a very ambitious</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

3343
02:17:15.730 --> 02:17:17.260
<v Speaker 2>You seem very ambitious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

3344
02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm good no matter what space I'm in</v>

3345
02:17:20.951 --> 02:17:22.540
<v Speaker 2>weather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I was in private equity,</v>

3346
02:17:22.810 --> 02:17:25.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm always good at my job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I put my mind to something,</v>

3347
02:17:25.420 --> 02:17:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I can do something and people will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>blown away.</v>

3348
02:17:27.850 --> 02:17:29.170
<v Speaker 2>That's always in my character.</v>

3349
02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:30.193
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3350
02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:33.280
<v Speaker 2>and I will do it despite people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't look at that.</v>

3351
02:17:33.281 --> 02:17:35.410
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my whole to do list is people telling me</v>

3352
02:17:35.411 --> 02:17:36.051
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3353
02:17:36.051 --> 02:17:38.500
<v Speaker 2>like I don't like when people try to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>me in a box.</v>

3354
02:17:38.501 --> 02:17:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't like the whole idea that</v>

3355
02:17:40.391 --> 02:17:42.160
<v Speaker 2>because you were this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be that.</v>

3356
02:17:42.161 --> 02:17:43.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I'm always going to decide</v>

3357
02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:47.970
<v Speaker 2>what's best for me and you to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican in the first place.</v>

3358
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:51.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm not Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing Republican.</v>

3359
02:17:51.521 --> 02:17:54.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm independent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm independent.</v>

3360
02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I know I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say I leaned right.</v>

3361
02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:59.340
<v Speaker 2>I definitely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that to me is just,</v>

3362
02:17:59.350 --> 02:18:01.780
<v Speaker 2>if you believe that people are allowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have different opinions,</v>

3363
02:18:01.810 --> 02:18:03.370
<v Speaker 2>you lean right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like literally,</v>

3364
02:18:03.371 --> 02:18:05.740
<v Speaker 2>that's where we're at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like you're not even allowed</v>

3365
02:18:05.741 --> 02:18:08.140
<v Speaker 2>to have a dissenting opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second Amendment.</v>

3366
02:18:09.450 --> 02:18:12.000
<v Speaker 2>I just think the slippery slope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro life</v>

3367
02:18:14.380 --> 02:18:18.330
<v Speaker 2>anti global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anti global warming thing is like,</v>

3368
02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:20.350
<v Speaker 2>this is something that I've looked at.</v>

3369
02:18:20.390 --> 02:18:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Your organ has forced on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I genuinely like we're getting along</v>

3370
02:18:24.641 --> 02:18:26.630
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3371
02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

3372
02:18:29.070 --> 02:18:33.970
<v Speaker 2>I have no reason to believe that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>some scientists that could very well be</v>

3373
02:18:33.971 --> 02:18:37.210
<v Speaker 2>funded as we constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are constantly being funded to</v>

3374
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:39.670
<v Speaker 2>create a public perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I very much believe that.</v>

3375
02:18:39.671 --> 02:18:40.880
<v Speaker 2>I see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3376
02:18:40.890 --> 02:18:42.920
<v Speaker 2>and we see this in the case of Donald</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump there.</v>

3377
02:18:42.930 --> 02:18:45.490
<v Speaker 2>If you go pull people in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to say he's a racist</v>

3378
02:18:45.491 --> 02:18:47.020
<v Speaker 2>sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just whatever is put on the</v>

3379
02:18:47.021 --> 02:18:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People believe as the truth.</v>

3380
02:18:48.610 --> 02:18:51.760
<v Speaker 2>I like to do a deeper dive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have not done deeper dive on global</v>

3381
02:18:51.761 --> 02:18:53.260
<v Speaker 2>warming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Save that one night when I went down to</v>

3382
02:18:53.261 --> 02:18:56.590
<v Speaker 2>our coal or what other like right wing</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking points.</v>

3383
02:18:56.591 --> 02:18:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything that you don't agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with?</v>

3384
02:18:58.420 --> 02:18:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

3385
02:18:59.530 --> 02:19:01.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is still a thing,</v>

3386
02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:06.930
<v Speaker 2>but I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fully support gay marriage and,</v>

3387
02:19:07.090 --> 02:19:08.290
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason is simple,</v>

3388
02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:11.170
<v Speaker 2>like regardless how people feel about</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage,</v>

3389
02:19:11.350 --> 02:19:15.640
<v Speaker 2>the government has stepped in and is now</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing marriage and the idea that two</v>

3390
02:19:15.641 --> 02:19:19.300
<v Speaker 2>individuals that are in love to should</v>
<v Speaker 2>get tax cuts while the others shouldn't,</v>

3391
02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:21.850
<v Speaker 2>is nonsensical just because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3392
02:19:21.851 --> 02:19:22.360
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make it.</v>

3393
02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:24.460
<v Speaker 2>So forget the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally don't think the government</v>

3394
02:19:24.461 --> 02:19:26.800
<v Speaker 2>should have gotten involved in marriages</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first place,</v>

3395
02:19:26.801 --> 02:19:29.870
<v Speaker 2>but they have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't sit here and decide that to</v>

3396
02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:32.720
<v Speaker 2>gay men don't get tax cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Amanda Woman Do.</v>

3397
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:34.820
<v Speaker 2>That's wrong from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a governing perspective.</v>

3398
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.830
<v Speaker 2>So if you're 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3399
02:19:36.831 --> 02:19:37.910
<v Speaker 2>that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3400
02:19:37.911 --> 02:19:39.590
<v Speaker 2>that's a good one because that's one</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gets slippery.</v>

3401
02:19:39.591 --> 02:19:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Even Caitlyn Jenner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't in a gay marriage,</v>

3402
02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:45.350
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that one is.</v>

3403
02:19:45.780 --> 02:19:47.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this can't get anywhere.</v>

3404
02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I have cousins that are gay like it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though despite the fact that</v>

3405
02:19:50.631 --> 02:19:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found them anti lgbt,</v>

3406
02:19:52.581 --> 02:19:54.890
<v Speaker 2>which is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I just think that since the</v>

3407
02:19:54.891 --> 02:19:56.930
<v Speaker 2>government has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has stepped up and decide it's going to</v>

3408
02:19:56.931 --> 02:19:58.790
<v Speaker 2>be in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's the governing body,</v>

3409
02:19:58.791 --> 02:20:01.110
<v Speaker 2>everyone should have a right to the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>tax customer.</v>

3410
02:20:02.020 --> 02:20:02.990
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't be.</v>

3411
02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:04.400
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the real problem.</v>

3412
02:20:04.401 --> 02:20:06.100
<v Speaker 2>But nobody talks about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are.</v>

3413
02:20:06.490 --> 02:20:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you,</v>

3414
02:20:07.970 --> 02:20:09.440
<v Speaker 2>you have to get married through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

3415
02:20:09.441 --> 02:20:11.240
<v Speaker 2>You got to be saved from the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets recognized by the government,</v>

3416
02:20:11.241 --> 02:20:12.040
<v Speaker 2>your tax cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3417
02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:14.360
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can check certain boxes when you do</v>

3418
02:20:14.361 --> 02:20:17.090
<v Speaker 2>your taxes because you're married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So since the government is doing that,</v>

3419
02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:20.360
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason why if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if two guys live in the same house,</v>

3420
02:20:20.361 --> 02:20:21.920
<v Speaker 2>that they should not be allowed to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>tax cuts.</v>

3421
02:20:21.921 --> 02:20:24.640
<v Speaker 2>So the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the separation of the church in the</v>

3422
02:20:24.650 --> 02:20:25.483
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3423
02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state has taken on something that</v>

3424
02:20:27.141 --> 02:20:28.670
<v Speaker 2>traditionally was in the church and</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they'd has,</v>

3425
02:20:28.671 --> 02:20:30.320
<v Speaker 2>you have to be looking at it</v>
<v Speaker 2>objectively.</v>

3426
02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite your personal feelings.</v>

3427
02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looked at objectively and every,</v>

3428
02:20:34.101 --> 02:20:37.820
<v Speaker 2>every person has a right to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get a tax cut because they married</v>

3429
02:20:37.821 --> 02:20:42.560
<v Speaker 2>the person that they love</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent with you on the gay marriage</v>

3430
02:20:42.561 --> 02:20:42.740
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3431
02:20:42.740 --> 02:20:47.280
<v Speaker 2>So what other ones don't you agree with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the right way.</v>

3432
02:20:47.281 --> 02:20:49.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing talking points.</v>

3433
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:52.080
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3434
02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:54.020
<v Speaker 2>So first off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chance just hilarious.</v>

3435
02:20:54.021 --> 02:20:55.070
<v Speaker 2>So it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just jump in it,</v>

3436
02:20:55.100 --> 02:20:55.933
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3437
02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.040
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the number one thing.</v>

3438
02:20:58.041 --> 02:21:00.290
<v Speaker 2>So my whole shtick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only time I snapped back or get</v>

3439
02:21:00.291 --> 02:21:01.460
<v Speaker 2>upset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because I'm really focusing on</v>

3440
02:21:01.490 --> 02:21:02.620
<v Speaker 2>community dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

3441
02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:06.470
<v Speaker 2>the committee that has been affected the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most by illegal immigration is a black</v>

3442
02:21:06.471 --> 02:21:07.370
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a fact.</v>

3443
02:21:07.371 --> 02:21:09.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk about low wage workers,</v>

3444
02:21:09.261 --> 02:21:10.370
<v Speaker 2>the people that are the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>unimportant,</v>

3445
02:21:10.371 --> 02:21:13.160
<v Speaker 2>this company or our young black men</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the ages of 18 and 21,</v>

3446
02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:16.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have been negatively impacted by</v>

3447
02:21:16.101 --> 02:21:19.760
<v Speaker 2>the influx of people running over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>border because they'll come here and</v>

3448
02:21:19.761 --> 02:21:20.570
<v Speaker 2>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3449
02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:22.510
<v Speaker 2>well you were going to pay this guy $7,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3450
02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:25.220
<v Speaker 2>whatever the minimum wages will do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for less.</v>

3451
02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:28.130
<v Speaker 2>And that directly impacts the black</v>
<v Speaker 2>labor force.</v>

3452
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:29.690
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3453
02:21:30.350 --> 02:21:32.690
<v Speaker 2>I recognize that we very much have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration problem.</v>

3454
02:21:32.691 --> 02:21:34.010
<v Speaker 2>I think that the immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3455
02:21:34.011 --> 02:21:36.020
<v Speaker 2>they talk about diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not diverse whatsoever.</v>

3456
02:21:36.440 --> 02:21:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Half of the immigrants that we take in</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Mexico,</v>

3457
02:21:38.331 --> 02:21:39.530
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's making America,</v>

3458
02:21:39.531 --> 02:21:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>

3459
02:21:40.730 --> 02:21:42.890
<v Speaker 2>If you want to take in some more from</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Africa,</v>

3460
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:45.230
<v Speaker 2>that'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only only three percent come from Africa</v>

3461
02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:47.570
<v Speaker 2>or I think four percent last year came</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Africa.</v>

3462
02:21:47.850 --> 02:21:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Tougher Commute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3463
02:21:49.170 --> 02:21:50.090
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tougher commute.</v>

3464
02:21:50.091 --> 02:21:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the truth is that the argument that</v>

3465
02:21:51.831 --> 02:21:55.200
<v Speaker 2>is behind people that are like so pro</v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration and against the wall is that</v>

3466
02:21:55.260 --> 02:21:56.930
<v Speaker 2>it's about diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about diversity,</v>

3467
02:21:57.320 --> 02:21:59.720
<v Speaker 2>it's about diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go look around the country and</v>

3468
02:21:59.721 --> 02:22:01.490
<v Speaker 2>actually make a diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are tons of people that live in</v>

3469
02:22:01.491 --> 02:22:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Africa that worked their ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love the opportunity to be in</v>

3470
02:22:04.101 --> 02:22:09.100
<v Speaker 2>America and we need to work that system</v>
<v Speaker 2>out just because they have a Geo Geo</v>

3471
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:11.240
<v Speaker 2>advantage here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't make it fair.</v>

3472
02:22:11.241 --> 02:22:12.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3473
02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:12.861
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3474
02:22:12.861 --> 02:22:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pro coming up with a solution for</v>

3475
02:22:16.071 --> 02:22:20.150
<v Speaker 2>immigration because it's negatively</v>
<v Speaker 2>impacting running for president candice.</v>

3476
02:22:20.151 --> 02:22:22.430
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not running for president.</v>

3477
02:22:22.431 --> 02:22:24.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm here and people going crazy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3478
02:22:24.990 --> 02:22:25.823
<v Speaker 2>A</v>

3479
02:22:26.410 --> 02:22:27.390
<v Speaker 1>logo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just do it.</v>

3480
02:22:27.391 --> 02:22:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Looks like what would be my slogan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make America great again.</v>

3481
02:22:29.341 --> 02:22:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Is already taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needed another one.</v>

3482
02:22:31.740 --> 02:22:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Keep making America better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even better.</v>

3483
02:22:37.620 --> 02:22:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Even more better.</v>

3484
02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:41.270
<v Speaker 4>You've been more better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3485
02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:43.970
<v Speaker 4>but these speeds of the things that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anything like in every situation,</v>

3486
02:22:43.971 --> 02:22:45.940
<v Speaker 4>and you'll see this if you watch like</v>
<v Speaker 4>trial and I live on campus.</v>

3487
02:22:45.980 --> 02:22:47.960
<v Speaker 4>Let me do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every situation when I'm asked my</v>

3488
02:22:47.961 --> 02:22:50.600
<v Speaker 4>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my answer is tailored towards the black</v>

3489
02:22:50.601 --> 02:22:53.060
<v Speaker 4>community because I just think that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>have really gotten the shit end of the</v>

3490
02:22:53.061 --> 02:22:53.600
<v Speaker 4>stick.</v>

3491
02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Did you write a lot of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these thoughts out of these</v>

3492
02:22:57.970 --> 02:22:58.900
<v Speaker 1>locked in your head?</v>

3493
02:22:59.020 --> 02:23:00.120
<v Speaker 4>My had I read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3494
02:23:00.250 --> 02:23:03.070
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I make cards like to just remember</v>

3495
02:23:03.071 --> 02:23:04.840
<v Speaker 4>certain numbers and to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3496
02:23:04.841 --> 02:23:05.674
<v Speaker 4>And I just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3497

<v Speaker 1>Kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You out that a couple years ago you were</v>

3498
02:23:09.050 --> 02:23:11.570
<v Speaker 1>liberal and now you're not just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative,</v>

3499
02:23:11.571 --> 02:23:15.680
<v Speaker 1>but you're on all these fucking cable</v>
<v Speaker 1>network shows and you're constantly</v>

3500
02:23:15.681 --> 02:23:19.820
<v Speaker 1>talking about it and you're the in a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people look at you as like the hope</v>

3501
02:23:19.821 --> 02:23:23.540
<v Speaker 1>for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a good looking 28 year old woman</v>

3502
02:23:23.541 --> 02:23:27.560
<v Speaker 1>who's super articulate and smart and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could rattle off facts and Statistics</v>

<v Speaker 1>and talk real good on camera.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Anyone young and vibrant.</v>

3506
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:37.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what every political party looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards.</v>

3507
02:23:37.970 --> 02:23:38.361
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3508

<v Speaker 1>remaining constant looking for somebody</v>

3509
02:23:40.581 --> 02:23:41.750
<v Speaker 1>on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking right now.</v>

3510
02:23:41.751 --> 02:23:45.080
<v Speaker 1>We need someone to go against trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need someone good bleak</v>

3511
02:23:47.060 --> 02:23:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Booker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need someone.</v>

3512
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:53.590
<v Speaker 1>We need someone like Charlie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like an actor.</v>

3513
02:23:54.530 --> 02:23:56.690
<v Speaker 4>He's just an actor is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just doesn't come across as authentic</v>

3514
02:23:56.691 --> 02:23:57.524
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but whatever.</v>

3515
02:23:57.900 --> 02:23:58.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>

3516
02:23:58.730 --> 02:24:01.400
<v Speaker 4>I do not like cory booker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know him whatsoever.</v>

3517
02:24:01.820 --> 02:24:02.720
<v Speaker 4>Great Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3518
02:24:03.050 --> 02:24:05.240
<v Speaker 4>He could be personally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's a publicly.</v>

3519
02:24:05.241 --> 02:24:07.730
<v Speaker 4>He's representing himself fictitiously</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion.</v>

3520
02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:10.790
<v Speaker 4>That's just my opinion is to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It almost sounds like no,</v>

3521
02:24:10.900 --> 02:24:14.870
<v Speaker 4>stop that attack knows how to go on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>attack.</v>

3522
02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:16.033
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

3523
02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:18.560
<v Speaker 4>I've just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the language I really don't like</v>

3524
02:24:18.561 --> 02:24:20.560
<v Speaker 4>when people sit on a stage and go</v>
<v Speaker 4>racism,</v>

3525
02:24:20.570 --> 02:24:21.321
<v Speaker 4>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>racism.</v>

3526
02:24:21.321 --> 02:24:22.610
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's to me,</v>

3527
02:24:22.611 --> 02:24:25.040
<v Speaker 4>it's insulting to people's intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talks about to me about what's going on</v>

3528
02:24:25.041 --> 02:24:26.330
<v Speaker 4>black minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to scare them.</v>

3529
02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:28.640
<v Speaker 4>Like it's the fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Politics pisses me off and that's what</v>

3530
02:24:28.641 --> 02:24:30.230
<v Speaker 4>they do every four years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fear politics.</v>

3531
02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:32.360
<v Speaker 4>Well guy bought for us because racism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>racism,</v>

3532
02:24:32.361 --> 02:24:33.270
<v Speaker 4>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

3533
02:24:33.730 --> 02:24:36.950
<v Speaker 4>That's manipulating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's using fear to control what we do.</v>

3534
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:39.440
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a right to just be presented</v>

3535
02:24:39.441 --> 02:24:41.240
<v Speaker 4>with the facts and being allowed to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>a decision on our own.</v>

3536
02:24:41.270 --> 02:24:42.770
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my really perspective.</v>

3537
02:24:42.771 --> 02:24:44.600
<v Speaker 4>That's the big thing that's been so</v>
<v Speaker 4>controversial.</v>

3538
02:24:44.601 --> 02:24:47.810
<v Speaker 4>Candice Owens thinks that the black</v>
<v Speaker 4>community should be spoken to about</v>

3539
02:24:47.811 --> 02:24:50.630
<v Speaker 4>what's going on in their communities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It shouldn't be thrown Jay Z and beyonce</v>

<v Speaker 4>concerts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all law Hillary Clinton.</v>

3541
02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:53.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like that.</v>

3542
02:24:53.260 --> 02:24:55.020
<v Speaker 4>Is that really that controversial a</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought?</v>

3543
02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:56.360
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's broken the Internet.</v>

3544
02:24:56.420 --> 02:24:57.590
<v Speaker 4>I go out and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3545
02:24:57.591 --> 02:25:00.380
<v Speaker 4>I think that there might be a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>more to the story that everybody's</v>

3546
02:25:00.410 --> 02:25:01.910
<v Speaker 4>racist and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

3547
02:25:01.911 --> 02:25:04.650
<v Speaker 4>Like she can't say that I'm not the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first black conservative views.</v>

3548
02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:07.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why I'm the most like</v>
<v Speaker 4>controversial at this has turned into</v>

3549
02:25:07.911 --> 02:25:08.300
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

<v Speaker 1>we already highlighted it young and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're good looking and you're all</v>

<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3558
02:25:25.041 --> 02:25:26.490
<v Speaker 4>it's just because like she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's a black girl,</v>

3559
02:25:26.491 --> 02:25:27.221

3560
02:25:27.221 --> 02:25:29.290

<v Speaker 4>it's because for the first time someone</v>

3561
02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:30.750
<v Speaker 4>has the audacity and it's not the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

3580
02:26:04.781 --> 02:26:09.040
<v Speaker 4>intellectually uninspired my whole life</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was in a room of people that</v>

3581
02:26:09.070 --> 02:26:11.920
<v Speaker 4>didn't understand me and I never</v>
<v Speaker 4>realized how,</v>

3582
02:26:12.170 --> 02:26:17.170
<v Speaker 4>how misunderstood I felt until I got</v>
<v Speaker 4>into a room with like Secretary Ben</v>

3583
02:26:17.500 --> 02:26:21.010
<v Speaker 4>Carson and he just like got me and Andy</v>
<v Speaker 4>Armstrong Williams who was a close</v>

3585
02:26:23.771 --> 02:26:24.400

<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

3588
02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:30.580
<v Speaker 4>it's been so inspiring and I'm so happy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't think I've ever been this</v>

3589
02:26:30.581 --> 02:26:33.070
<v Speaker 4>happy in my entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's hard for me to ever take</v>

3590
02:26:33.071 --> 02:26:36.430
<v Speaker 4>a negative perspective on anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>really except for global warming.</v>

3591
02:26:39.620 --> 02:26:44.620
<v Speaker 4>It's not real</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 3>she did the right thing by apologizing.</v>

3642
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:33.170
<v Speaker 3>She made the right action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take the correct action.</v>

02:28:33.230 --> 02:28:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she did.</v>

3644
02:28:34.370 --> 02:28:36.020
<v Speaker 3>She took.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'd made the correct action,</v>

3645
02:28:36.021 --> 02:28:37.460
<v Speaker 3>but what's so beautiful for me is I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>free.</v>

<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

3649
02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:43.010
<v Speaker 3>That's to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's freedom like that.</v>

02:28:43.020 --> 02:28:45.380
<v Speaker 3>You can'T be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the best part of this is that I'm</v>

<v Speaker 3>I can say whatever I want.</v>

3652
02:28:46.821 --> 02:28:48.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't have advertisers that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>boycott.</v>

3653
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:50.440
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can say my whole,</v>

3654
02:28:50.470 --> 02:28:53.810
<v Speaker 3>my twitter feed is just me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a very powerful thing.</v>

3655
02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel so empowered.</v>

3656
02:28:55.051 --> 02:28:56.180
<v Speaker 3>It's a very good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3657
02:28:56.420 --> 02:28:59.660
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure your ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

3658
02:28:59.930 --> 02:29:04.700
<v Speaker 3>There's no better way to have your ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>expressed than to have no one that you</v>

3659
02:29:04.701 --> 02:29:05.534
<v Speaker 3>are beholden to.</v>

3660
02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:08.330
<v Speaker 3>No boss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that and that's why I was like,</v>

3661
02:29:08.331 --> 02:29:09.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I start working with charlie in there,</v>

<v Speaker 3>part of my company now we work for each</v>

3663
02:29:11.961 --> 02:29:16.280
<v Speaker 3>other and it's just like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're mission or mission driven and I do</v>

3664
02:29:16.281 --> 02:29:17.510
<v Speaker 3>support the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>

3665
02:29:17.511 --> 02:29:20.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go work administration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems like a really the worst job</v>

3666
02:29:20.241 --> 02:29:21.380
<v Speaker 3>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

3667
02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:24.350
<v Speaker 3>We need to be the secretary or press or</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3668
02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:24.981
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

3669
02:29:24.981 --> 02:29:26.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This administration has got it because</v>

3670
02:29:26.961 --> 02:29:29.450
<v Speaker 3>they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so angry and bItter about</v>

3671
02:29:29.451 --> 02:29:31.280
<v Speaker 3>losing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I by that time 20,</v>

3672
02:29:31.281 --> 02:29:32.590
<v Speaker 3>24 comes around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3673
02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:34.490

<v Speaker 3>but they've just been like,</v>

3674
02:29:34.970 --> 02:29:36.380
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

3675
02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:38.520

<v Speaker 3>they're angry.</v>

3676
02:29:38.521 --> 02:29:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Like definitely an ideological war going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that it clouds a lot of thinking in</v>

3677
02:29:43.001 --> 02:29:43.834
<v Speaker 3>terms of winning.</v>

3678
02:29:44.100 --> 02:29:45.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You tell me who's winning.</v>

3679
02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:48.100
<v Speaker 3>We were winning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were republican now.</v>

3680
02:29:48.770 --> 02:29:51.380
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you just insert their code was we</v>

3681
02:29:51.410 --> 02:29:53.120
<v Speaker 3>know we're winning the independent</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinkers.</v>

3682
02:29:53.121 --> 02:29:54.140
<v Speaker 3>The people that think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

3683

<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

<v Speaker 3>See exactly your republican.</v>

3685
02:29:58.251 --> 02:30:02.450
<v Speaker 3>Now I know people that have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>mentality that people that are are,</v>

3686
02:30:02.451 --> 02:30:03.720
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are freedom driven,</v>

3687
02:30:03.721 --> 02:30:06.320
<v Speaker 3>that just want to be able to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>different ideas and that's why I snapped</v>

3688
02:30:06.321 --> 02:30:07.180
<v Speaker 3>back at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>conservatives to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3690
02:30:08.181 --> 02:30:10.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a product of the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't think like,</v>

3691
02:30:10.221 --> 02:30:11.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't want people to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3692
02:30:11.230 --> 02:30:13.530
<v Speaker 3>candace is just joining the lap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then she wants to create a model.</v>

3693
02:30:13.531 --> 02:30:15.080
<v Speaker 3>If on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no wrong,</v>

3694
02:30:15.290 --> 02:30:17.930
<v Speaker 3>all I want walk you would do is</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand you have a right to like</v>

3695
02:30:17.931 --> 02:30:21.410
<v Speaker 3>certain ideas on both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't like what you should never</v>

3696
02:30:21.411 --> 02:30:21.800
<v Speaker 3>allow us.</v>

3697
02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:24.710
<v Speaker 3>For someone to use your identity to</v>
<v Speaker 3>define how you have to think.</v>

3698
02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:26.510
<v Speaker 3>You should always be the person to</v>
<v Speaker 3>finding how you think.</v>

3699
02:30:26.690 --> 02:30:28.550
<v Speaker 3>That's the message that I say on college</v>
<v Speaker 3>campuses.</v>

3700
02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:30.960
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Qantas,</v>

3701
