00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Hello my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello people out there in cyber land.</v>

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human beings listening to one's and </v>

3
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>zero's transmitted through computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly,</v>

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how this works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>this episode podcast is brought to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Ting Tang is a mobile service company</v>

6
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>that is an independent company that uses</v>
<v Speaker 1>sprint.</v>

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.920
<v Speaker 1>What they do is they rent time on sprint</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get the same service that you </v>

8
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.401
<v Speaker 1>would get with sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have it set up their way and </v>

9
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:34.401
<v Speaker 1>their way is they want to do things is </v>
<v Speaker 1>evenly and ethically and just as they </v>

10
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to make it as like above board</v>

11
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the things you pay for when you</v>

12
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:46.611
<v Speaker 1>pay for cell phones are not necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you have contracts and </v>

13
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>early termination fees and if you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out of things,</v>

14
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:55.371
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that ting is </v>

15
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:55.371
<v Speaker 1>avoided.</v>

16
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any contracts cancel </v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime you want.</v>

17
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any early termination </v>
<v Speaker 1>fees.</v>

18
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>They think it's silly and they also have</v>
<v Speaker 1>it set up in a very brilliant way where </v>

19
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>you only pay for what you use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of having 120 minutes a month</v>

20
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month,</v>

21
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever your,</v>

22
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your pay thing is,</v>

23
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.560
<v Speaker 1>if you use less than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

24
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the company calls you up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>

25
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:22.521
<v Speaker 1>you should probably have a service for </v>
<v Speaker 1>less minutes because you don't use all </v>

27
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:26.781
<v Speaker 1>your minutes and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have all these minutes that you </v>

28
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:26.781
<v Speaker 1>didn't use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you did pay for the waiting,</v>

29
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:31.450
<v Speaker 1>has it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay for what you use and you would </v>

30
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>be shocked at how easy it is to save </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

31
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Ninety eight percent of people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>save money using ting.</v>

32
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about the coverage but I </v>

33
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.900
<v Speaker 1>know because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like at this point in time,</v>

35
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Sprint like Joey Diaz love sprint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's had sprint for like 10 years.</v>

36
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Don't text him on it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't text him.</v>

37
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>He won't accept phone messages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't accept text messages if you </v>

38
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>call him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to see matt full trunk called,</v>

39
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

40
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot Call Matt Full Toronto voicemail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No voicemail.</v>

41
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.840
<v Speaker 1>But this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not like some Hick cell phone </v>

42
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the sprint backbone,</v>

43
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:09.660
<v Speaker 1>so it's one of the best cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>providers in the country.</v>

44
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>So you get the exact same service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you own your phone,</v>

45
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>they'll sell you an iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five or 260 bucks,</v>

46
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:20.331
<v Speaker 1>they sell you all the best android </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones and you actually pay for the </v>

47
00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:24.081
<v Speaker 1>phone instead of what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go to a lot of places like the </v>

48
00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>bigger name places and you'd get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

49
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>it's 500 bucks.</v>

50
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not really 500 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more,</v>

51
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.540
<v Speaker 1>but you have to pay over the course of </v>
<v Speaker 1>several years that you have your </v>

52
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pay with the differences.</v>

53
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>So if you're paying a dollar $199,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the phone is actually $600 phone.</v>

54
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.060
<v Speaker 1>You owe them $401 that you'll have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay for over the course of your </v>

55
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.781
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why when you </v>

56
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:52.521
<v Speaker 1>try to leave your contract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay money to get out of it </v>

57
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>and this is all something you've signed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might not even realize it.</v>

58
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>That's how it was for the longest time </v>
<v Speaker 1>contracts and early termination fees and</v>

59
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.440
<v Speaker 1>paying for x amount of minutes per month</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Tim has just stepped in and stopped </v>

60
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.971
<v Speaker 1>all that nonsense and I think it's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the model that all cell phone </v>

61
00:03:08.971 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>companies using in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right now things using it,</v>

62
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>they have that new nexus five which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking bad ass.</v>

63
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>They have some bad ass google phones </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

64
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred 49 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You own it.</v>

65
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>It never have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no payments.</v>

66
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:19.850
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.850
<v Speaker 1>sits over conversations done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to leave,</v>

68
00:03:22.851 --> 00:03:23.490
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

90
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>It's even better than going to a gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times when you go to a gym,</v>

91
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 1>how often does the guy lift weights with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

92
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

93
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:39.901
<v Speaker 1>not very often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're following one of those </v>

94
00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:39.901
<v Speaker 1>dvds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you literally have to follow him.</v>

95
00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>He's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to do it too.</v>

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't slack off.</v>

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Awesome workout and really good for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body to.</v>

98
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:51.061
<v Speaker 1>It's a full body exercise type deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kettlebells,</v>

99
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.310
<v Speaker 1>and if you haven't used kettlebells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number one urge that I have every </v>

100
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.091
<v Speaker 1>time I do this commercial is please go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to either a personal trainer or get a </v>

101
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:05.251
<v Speaker 1>really light kettlebell and go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube and learn how to lift weights </v>

102
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:05.251
<v Speaker 1>and don't get crazy.</v>

103
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Don't hurt yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try start off slow and if you're </v>

104
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.190
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed by the fact that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting weights and it's only 18 pounds,</v>

105
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 1>just don't tell anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep working out,</v>

106
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 1>but don't tell anybody on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't put it on Youtube.</v>

107
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put.</v>

108
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Put an outfit on like a furry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like put like a crazy furry hat and plus</v>

109
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>you'll be really shattered with </v>
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells in the beginning anyway,</v>

110
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>so you'll probably hit yourself in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head a few times.</v>

111
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:27.930
<v Speaker 1>If you have one of those big furry </v>
<v Speaker 1>masks,</v>

112
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>it'll probably protect you a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have some Eric Cleans and </v>

113
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:33.420
<v Speaker 1>they hit you and your little chipmunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

114
00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a private,</v>

115
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.140
<v Speaker 1>private beginning.</v>

<v Speaker 3>developed a habit.</v>

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.230

<v Speaker 3>We're going to call that three weeks and</v>

127
00:06:19.261 --> 00:06:24.261
<v Speaker 3>I was in the Midwest the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never came home and it's nice to see </v>

128
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:29.230
<v Speaker 3>beautiful Los Angeles,</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

132
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 3>it's because it's off the fucking hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really unrealistic though.</v>

133
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 3>It's very unrealistic way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't ever deal with weather.</v>

134
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.940

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

142
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.960

<v Speaker 3>It might work out.</v>

173
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.400
<v Speaker 3>It could,</v>

<v Speaker 3>challenge.</v>

182
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:42.370
<v Speaker 3>It might work with the odd person put.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have like regular jobs </v>

183
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.781

184
00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:51.191

<v Speaker 3>I always go with insurance salesman </v>

185
00:08:51.191 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 3>because it seems like one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking boring bullshit jobs.</v>

205
00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:36.441
<v Speaker 1>lives in northern California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he talks like a regular insurance </v>

206
00:09:36.441 --> 00:09:36.441
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making fun,</v>

209
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.530
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love people.</v>

210
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Always get mad if you talk about them on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a podcast,</v>

211
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:47.661
<v Speaker 1>but even if you say good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say anything funny about some </v>

212
00:09:47.661 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 1>funny shit that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get so upset.</v>

213
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>

214
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:54.381
<v Speaker 1>we're all retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you listen to things we say about </v>

215
00:09:54.381 --> 00:09:54.381
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all retarded.</v>

216
00:09:54.381 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 1>I've said worse things about myself than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else.</v>

217
00:09:57.481 --> 00:10:02.481
<v Speaker 1>The thing that the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>been an insurance salesman and being a </v>

218
00:10:02.481 --> 00:10:04.881
<v Speaker 1>farmer though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think the farmers are a little bit </v>

219
00:10:04.881 --> 00:10:06.510
<v Speaker 1>more happy with what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like you get something done.</v>

220
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Like at the end of the day when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought in the crops,</v>

221
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.380
<v Speaker 1>when you fed the cow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know which order you do </v>

222
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:15.380
<v Speaker 1>that in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

223
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you did to bring in food.</v>

224
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

225
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Speaker 1>you can see it with your eyeballs over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the course of a couple months.</v>

226
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 1>You can see the crops growing.</v>

227
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:27.230
<v Speaker 1>They say construction workers are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy because they actually get to see </v>

228
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.080
<v Speaker 1>what they bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're also usually on drugs.</v>

229
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.730
<v Speaker 1>That helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That helps,</v>

230
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're totally right.</v>

231
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I think building things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting things like set up a farm,</v>

232
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:37.620
<v Speaker 1>plant the seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

233
00:10:37.621 --> 00:10:38.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

234
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.040
<v Speaker 1>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

235
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.120
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially be facilitating this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole construction process and if you </v>

236
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.020
<v Speaker 1>work in an office and just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resets every day,</v>

237
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 1>even as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

238
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:49.320
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go do another show.</v>

239
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:54.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go do another show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there isn't that on you because you </v>

240
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:54.770
<v Speaker 1>just change your act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have,</v>

241
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean essentially think about how long </v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes you to write an act.</v>

242
00:10:57.121 --> 00:11:02.121
<v Speaker 1>If we were smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would do is we would write to acts </v>

243
00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:05.720
<v Speaker 1>two acts and we'd do one on Friday night</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one on Saturday night or one Friday </v>

244
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.530
<v Speaker 1>early show the other one Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That way you would never feel anything </v>

246
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.311
<v Speaker 1>stale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of you putting it a </v>

247
00:11:16.311 --> 00:11:16.311
<v Speaker 1>little bit more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do that this week.</v>

00:12:28.411 --> 00:12:31.050

<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you lived in Dayton,</v>

278
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.450
<v Speaker 3>Ohio and you had to do stand up.</v>

282
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.440
<v Speaker 3>there's two clubs and there's like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>good one and the bad one.</v>

283
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.170
<v Speaker 3>And that's what all the comedians talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

284
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.880
<v Speaker 3>And there's a good one in the bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

285
00:12:44.881 --> 00:12:47.880
<v Speaker 3>And it's like you're always under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>supervision of the only clubs in town.</v>

286
00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:49.710
<v Speaker 3>So say you want to go up and fuck around</v>

<v Speaker 3>you can't do that when they're paying </v>

289
00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:57.740
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that when they're,</v>

290
00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.050
<v Speaker 3>when they're paying you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you also can't do that if you're an </v>

291
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.050
<v Speaker 3>open miker they're either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Competition is so high,</v>

292
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.330
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

296
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Open mic nights are fucking gigantic for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comic.</v>

297
00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you don't have open mic nights,</v>

298
00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:13.981
<v Speaker 1>then you wind up doing like these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these nights where like say you'll be </v>

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:18.631
<v Speaker 1>just do a couple of minutes and bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>people up and you know,</v>

301
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:23.551
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially just kind of getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience used to the fact there's a </v>

302
00:13:23.551 --> 00:13:25.981
<v Speaker 1>comedy show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>introducing the comedians properly and </v>

<v Speaker 1>your own.</v>

304
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there comes a point in time there </v>

305
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:31.050
<v Speaker 1>where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a place where you don't get</v>

306
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:31.900
<v Speaker 1>stage time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're not expanding.</v>

307

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got lucky this,</v>

308
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:36.160
<v Speaker 1>this spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could expand a lot.</v>

309
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go to the ice house.</v>

310
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:39.760
<v Speaker 1>You can go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yuck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What Midwest people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York people don't.</v>

317
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.410
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Midwest San Francisco people do.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's a new one.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You can't shit on the comedy scene.</v>

321

<v Speaker 3>There's too many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know and we got it.</v>

322
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.750
<v Speaker 3>We got all the New Yorker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well not all of them.</v>

323
00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:11.490
<v Speaker 3>We got some New Yorkers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get some midwest.</v>

324
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.260
<v Speaker 3>All the ones who understand winter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they move here.</v>

325
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:20.630
<v Speaker 3>If you understand winter and it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to be in that like you </v>

326
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:20.630
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to be.</v>

327
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:25.490
<v Speaker 3>It's good to be in that every now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then to feel it because it's really </v>

328
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:25.490
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

329
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.020
<v Speaker 3>But to live there every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six months when it's fucking freezing is</v>

330
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.080
<v Speaker 3>very taxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good to put the ankle weights on </v>

331
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.080
<v Speaker 3>every once in awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then take them off.</v>

338
00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:45.060
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the good.</v>

339
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:50.090
<v Speaker 3>That's the upside of touring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why else would there be 80 million </v>

340
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.090
<v Speaker 3>people here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop at Midwest.</v>

343
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.750
<v Speaker 1>talking shit on the La comedy scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a Dana Stevens.</v>

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Like what was the motor oil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be scared to eat.</v>

372
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.230
<v Speaker 1>How could you not eat or trust the water</v>
<v Speaker 1>or go to the bathroom?</v>

373
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:14.231
<v Speaker 1>Just going to the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like leaving a nice bathroom just in </v>

374
00:16:14.231 --> 00:16:17.321
<v Speaker 1>case if you have to go to the bathroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else and it be like to the </v>

375
00:16:17.321 --> 00:16:17.321
<v Speaker 1>point where you could die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's sit there too long.</v>

376
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.440
<v Speaker 1>People die in toilets.</v>

377
00:16:21.441 --> 00:16:23.190
<v Speaker 1>like to get cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a,</v>

378
00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:24.770
<v Speaker 1>a story that we're reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other day,</v>

379
00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.980
<v Speaker 1>guy dropped his cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to reach for it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

384
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't breathe.</v>

385
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't much methane and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Water couldn't.</v>

386
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awful.</v>

387
00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:44.020
<v Speaker 1>They died for a fucking cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually taking a shit as a great </v>

388
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:44.020
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You've got to do something about that.</v>

391
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.580
<v Speaker 1>That's really a bad smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

392
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Sooner or later you're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>flush.</v>

393
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.440
<v Speaker 1>That was disturbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was even more disturbing is </v>

394
00:16:59.440 --> 00:16:59.440
<v Speaker 1>already was telling us about gutter oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

395
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.091
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an oil cooking oil that they make from </v>

396
00:17:04.091 --> 00:17:04.091
<v Speaker 1>raw sewage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

397
00:17:04.091 --> 00:17:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't even imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even imagine.</v>

398
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:07.560
<v Speaker 1>You have to watch it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to believe that you're,</v>

399
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.550
<v Speaker 1>what you're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cooking oil is very expensive,</v>

400
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:15.730
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of people create their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking oil and they use rancid meat </v>

401
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.110
<v Speaker 1>like old bones and meat and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

402
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Boil it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also use raw sewage,</v>

403
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.590
<v Speaker 1>raw sewage mix in with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insanely fucked up.</v>

404
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:30.040
<v Speaker 1>We played a video of it the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think we're not going to play it </v>

405
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.711
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I encourage you to go online and </v>

406
00:17:32.711 --> 00:17:35.320
<v Speaker 1>anybody who wants to see it look up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gutter oil anytime people are like,</v>

407
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.550
<v Speaker 1>you got to have some authentic Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

408
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no thanks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he wanted to talk to us about the </v>

412
00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:50.861
<v Speaker 1>cooking oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd run out of time and it was one of </v>

413
00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:50.861
<v Speaker 1>the most harrowing stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost puked,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've seen a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people eat rats.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was just so shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

421
00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I started extra salivating right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>just thinking about it like that,</v>

422
00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.960
<v Speaker 1>that feeling that you get right before </v>

<v Speaker 1>was scooping raw sewage out into </v>

425
00:18:22.031 --> 00:18:27.031
<v Speaker 1>buckets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do they carry the buckets to our </v>

426
00:18:27.031 --> 00:18:29.221
<v Speaker 1>car and she'd put these buckets of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>card that you would drive off and that </v>

427
00:18:29.221 --> 00:18:29.221
<v Speaker 1>you'd sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was.</v>

428
00:18:29.221 --> 00:18:32.140
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about how she bought </v>
<v Speaker 1>herself a house from the money from this</v>

429
00:18:32.141 --> 00:18:34.690
<v Speaker 1>gutter oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she'd been lifting manhole covers,</v>

430
00:18:34.691 --> 00:18:39.691
<v Speaker 1>scooping out raw sewage when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it boiling and selling it and they</v>

00:20:01.581 --> 00:20:05.270
<v Speaker 1>things can get out of hand if you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have too much homeless,</v>

464
00:20:05.271 --> 00:20:07.550
<v Speaker 1>too much poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much this,</v>

465
00:20:07.551 --> 00:20:12.551
<v Speaker 1>too much that you can get to a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's examples over there today that </v>

466
00:20:12.551 --> 00:20:16.991
<v Speaker 1>you could go to China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see examples of this is what </v>

467
00:20:16.991 --> 00:20:19.421
<v Speaker 1>happens when you get overpopulation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are devalued and life becomes </v>

468
00:20:19.421 --> 00:20:20.570
<v Speaker 1>very different than what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to.</v>

469
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what you're experiencing.</v>

470
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a good.</v>

471
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a good indication that maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the midwest are right.</v>

472
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.490
<v Speaker 1>That maybe like being in a place like la</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just too fucked up.</v>

473
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I just think they're off with comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>living there.</v>

474
00:20:36.051 --> 00:20:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some real benefits to living.</v>

475
00:20:38.851 --> 00:20:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Like in Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was taught,</v>

476
00:20:40.571 --> 00:20:45.571
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to Brian about that today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about how great Seattle </v>

477
00:20:45.571 --> 00:20:48.791
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is some real benefits to living </v>

478
00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:49.300
<v Speaker 1>there as opposed to living here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely lower number of people,</v>

479
00:20:49.301 --> 00:20:51.250
<v Speaker 1>less stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The energy's different.</v>

480
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:55.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not as chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as showbiz based like there's a</v>

481
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.110
<v Speaker 1>ton of like positive things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could connect to a place like Seattle.</v>

482
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Good air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good breathing.</v>

483
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The water.</v>

484
00:21:01.451 --> 00:21:06.451
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it rains all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get depressed if you're a fucking </v>

485
00:21:06.451 --> 00:21:09.841
<v Speaker 1>little baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is that's where life </v>

486
00:21:09.841 --> 00:21:09.841
<v Speaker 1>come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Head.</v>

487
00:21:09.841 --> 00:21:14.300
<v Speaker 1>It comes from water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good that it's raining all the </v>

488
00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:14.300
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

489
00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Kurt Cobain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry Kurt.</v>

490
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I think Kurt was more depressed about </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin is blaming it on the rain.</v>

491
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all heroin.</v>

492
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Just come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of people up there smiling.</v>

493
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.800
<v Speaker 1>You're shooting yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a hell of a hangover going with </v>

494
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 1>heroin attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that guy stayed alive.</v>

495
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.220
<v Speaker 1>If we could keep that guy happy enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep making music.</v>

496
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.880
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking groundbreaking genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

497
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.000
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>

498
00:21:36.001 --> 00:21:38.500
<v Speaker 5>I really think it's a huge tragedy for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of people.</v>

499
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:41.200
<v Speaker 5>Like to joke about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he was so fucking good.</v>

500
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.300
<v Speaker 5>I forget how good it is and every time I</v>
<v Speaker 5>hear it,</v>

501
00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:44.080
<v Speaker 5>it's just like</v>

502
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.020
<v Speaker 1>so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Muse and an awesome impact.</v>

503
00:21:47.021 --> 00:21:52.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had an awesome impact for the few </v>

504
00:21:52.021 --> 00:21:52.300
<v Speaker 1>years that he was alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

505
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.060
<v Speaker 1>that guy changed the whole thing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole time.</v>

506
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just a fucking kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

507
00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I was at this guy's house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

508
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.520
<v Speaker 1>my friend's friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a friend of a friend that we were,</v>

509
00:22:03.521 --> 00:22:05.200

<v Speaker 1>he had a copy of it.</v>

510
00:22:05.201 --> 00:22:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a cassette at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he played nirvana.</v>

511
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.950
<v Speaker 1>We were both sitting around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and my friend going,</v>

512
00:22:11.951 --> 00:22:13.570
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guy was like,</v>

513
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.930
<v Speaker 1>people didn't really play music for </v>
<v Speaker 1>their friends very often.</v>

514
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Like it would have to be something </v>
<v Speaker 1>really cool for someone to go through.</v>

515
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.240

<v Speaker 1>teen spirit?</v>

522
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.050
<v Speaker 5>He's was the one my band played teen </v>
<v Speaker 5>spirit in high school.</v>

523
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:40.920

<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

530
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.150
<v Speaker 5>That shit was a knockout because I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>into like punk rock and rock and roll.</v>

531
00:22:57.151 --> 00:22:59.520

<v Speaker 5>And we're kind of.</v>

<v Speaker 5>All these bands are pretty great.</v>

533
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.110

<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

534
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.340
<v Speaker 5>Knocked it out of the fucking room.</v>

<v Speaker 1>in a hairband.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the dominoes?</v>

585
00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm really not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just eric.</v>

586
00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:56.630
<v Speaker 1>He always just say it's by Eric Clapton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking bad ass jam.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

589
00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.630
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not a pro cocaine either.</v>

590
00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a great fucking song and it's a pro</v>

597
00:25:17.181 --> 00:25:17.990
<v Speaker 1>cocaine song.</v>

598
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That cocaine song was actually not Eric </v>

599
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Clapton and it was a cover of a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>named Jj cale.</v>

600
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Who did it well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to hear the original version of</v>

601
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:27.770
<v Speaker 1>that now.</v>

604
00:25:31.881 --> 00:25:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I think they can suck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of this stupid.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Anytime we we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're just playing shit that's </v>

606
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.571
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not stealing any context and so </v>

607
00:25:43.571 --> 00:25:46.030
<v Speaker 1>you typically commenting on things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are readily available and youtube gets </v>

608
00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:49.070
<v Speaker 1>mad sometimes people put up that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy guy.</v>

609
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.150
<v Speaker 2>This is the original guy was an old </v>
<v Speaker 2>blues dude.</v>

610
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:05.460
<v Speaker 2>How old is this dude here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 1976 to take around cocaine.</v>

611
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:20.350
<v Speaker 2>That guy looks like a subtle and elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing that George Bush on the </v>

612
00:26:23.821 --> 00:26:26.100
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the original version,</v>

613
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.030
<v Speaker 2>is that w on the drum that's.</v>

614
00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.130
<v Speaker 1>See there's a conviction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's voice.</v>

615
00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

616
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:38.050
<v Speaker 2>he wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He meant it is done cocaine.</v>

617
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.350
<v Speaker 2>He could use a couple of bosses.</v>

618
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:58.130
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

619
00:26:58.131 --> 00:27:00.050
<v Speaker 1>He's not the most energetic guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like.</v>

620
00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:05.051
<v Speaker 1>It isn't a weird though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How some people's voices like in that </v>

621
00:27:05.051 --> 00:27:05.240
<v Speaker 1>aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that scene or just more compelling.</v>

622
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's got a compelling voice.</v>

623
00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Whatever reason I want to hear him keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

624
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Exactly like Johnny cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny cash.</v>

625
00:27:13.491 --> 00:27:18.491
<v Speaker 1>Towards the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was doing some of his best stuff and </v>

626
00:27:18.491 --> 00:27:18.491
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't even singing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was essentially talking.</v>

627
00:27:18.491 --> 00:27:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

628
00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's still so compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was heavy.</v>

629
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.260
<v Speaker 1>It fucking heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

630
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Something comes through in people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>voices and I don't know what it is.</v>

631
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:29.840
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

632
00:27:29.841 --> 00:27:33.280
<v Speaker 1>What makes one person's voice more </v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing?</v>

633
00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:38.290
<v Speaker 1>One first person's voice more </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally connected to your brain.</v>

634
00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

635
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:45.070
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like some people just have voices </v>

636
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.070
<v Speaker 1>that you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orson Welles,</v>

637
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:46.040
<v Speaker 1>you ever listen to Orson Welles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

638
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.830
<v Speaker 1>The guy who did the war of the worlds </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it on the radio.</v>

639
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Citizen Kane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

640
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Citizen Kane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was compelling to listen to him talk </v>

641
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.330
<v Speaker 1>or he used to do those wine commercials </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the end.</v>

642
00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.280
<v Speaker 1>We will sell no wine before it's time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just had.</v>

643
00:28:01.281 --> 00:28:03.130
<v Speaker 1>There's something about his voice like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy could,</v>

644
00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:08.160
<v Speaker 1>you could just have them talk about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and it would make your stuff more </v>

645
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:08.160
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an authority.</v>

646
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:08.160
<v Speaker 1>We will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no more.</v>

647
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Once I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all fucked up.</v>

648
00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Drinking wine and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have recordings if you don't like </v>

649
00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:17.260
<v Speaker 1>yelling about how preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

650
00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the copy he was reading was,</v>

651
00:28:18.501 --> 00:28:23.501
<v Speaker 1>he was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Citizen Kane came out when he was 25 </v>

652
00:28:23.501 --> 00:28:23.501
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

653
00:28:23.501 --> 00:28:28.121
<v Speaker 1>He knocked it out of the park is first </v>
<v Speaker 1>try one of the greatest movies of all </v>

654
00:28:28.121 --> 00:28:29.390
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then hurts what to do after that</v>

655
00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.870
<v Speaker 5>hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Squash that movie.</v>

656
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:32.640
<v Speaker 5>It was only out for a couple of weeks or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

657
00:28:32.641 --> 00:28:35.250
<v Speaker 5>The guy that was about willed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>William Randolph</v>

658
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.410
<v Speaker 1>hearst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hearst.</v>

659
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>

660
00:28:37.201 --> 00:28:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

661
00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.530
<v Speaker 5>He squashed it because it was actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>about him and it was in a negative light</v>

662
00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:47.130
<v Speaker 5>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was out of the theaters immediately </v>

663
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.610
<v Speaker 5>and it's not like you can watch the Shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>on cable back in the day.</v>

664
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was just kind of.</v>

665
00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.590
<v Speaker 5>It just kind of didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though we look back and we see it's</v>

666
00:28:53.591 --> 00:28:55.840
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was off everyone's brain.</v>

667
00:28:55.841 --> 00:28:56.130
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

668
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.950
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what movies did he do after that</v>

669
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.740
<v Speaker 5>touch of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was all.</v>

670
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.320
<v Speaker 5>It was all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing was as big as or yeah,</v>

671
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:10.510
<v Speaker 5>citizen Kane is the one that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks to as really great and nothing </v>

672
00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:10.670
<v Speaker 5>else really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think.</v>

673
00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was responsible for that and of </v>

674
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:15.780
<v Speaker 1>course the war of the worlds thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit was huge.</v>

675
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.010
<v Speaker 1>People were jumping off bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's really true.</v>

676
00:29:18.011 --> 00:29:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I think snopes that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

677
00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:23.380
<v Speaker 1>let's find out war of the world,</v>

678
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.500
<v Speaker 5>but it was something really incredible </v>
<v Speaker 5>what he did and it's something we do all</v>

679
00:29:26.501 --> 00:29:29.050
<v Speaker 5>the time now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We imitate a certain style,</v>

680
00:29:29.051 --> 00:29:33.730
<v Speaker 5>like we imitate the news all the time in</v>
<v Speaker 5>entertainment shows we entertain,</v>

681
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.540
<v Speaker 5>we imitate documentaries all the time in</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedies.</v>

682
00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.060
<v Speaker 5>He imitated a newsreel and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought it was real.</v>

683
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:40.340
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

684
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.340
<v Speaker 1>he read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he read it as as though he was </v>

685
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.750
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a news report and so they'd.</v>

686
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.580
<v Speaker 1>But they'd also have like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

687
00:29:48.581 --> 00:29:49.870
<v Speaker 1>it is a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

688
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:50.680
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

689
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mass panic and hysteria swept through </v>

690
00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.501
<v Speaker 1>United States on the eve of Halloween,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1938 when an all too realistic radio </v>

691
00:29:58.501 --> 00:30:03.300
<v Speaker 1>dramatization of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A world sent untold thousands of people </v>

692
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:03.760
<v Speaker 1>into the streets headed for the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

693
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.610
<v Speaker 1>it's an urban legend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

694
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:11.790
<v Speaker 1>That's too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's accurately misremembered like no </v>

695
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:14.080
<v Speaker 1>other radio program where essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying is,</v>

696
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:19.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all from a bbc if anybody's </v>

697
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:19.980
<v Speaker 1>interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

698
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Just the Halloween myth of the war of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worlds panic and uh,</v>

699
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.040
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's all very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very exaggerated,</v>

700
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:28.960
<v Speaker 1>but they do it really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they'd have,</v>

701
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:35.070
<v Speaker 1>they'd have like regular programming and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they interrupt it with the news </v>

702
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.280
<v Speaker 1>reports of aliens invading and they'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

703
00:30:36.281 --> 00:30:38.350
<v Speaker 1>now back to our regular scheduled </v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

704
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.990
<v Speaker 1>It just be like music and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is funny.</v>

705
00:30:40.991 --> 00:30:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Listen to what they said back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Radio is new,</v>

706
00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.720
<v Speaker 1>but it has adult responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the fucking Internet chided the New</v>

707
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.760
<v Speaker 1>York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has not mastered itself or the </v>

708
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.401
<v Speaker 1>material it uses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people were angry that Orson Welles </v>

709
00:30:56.401 --> 00:30:58.300
<v Speaker 1>did this war of the worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But imagine the New York Times said that</v>

710
00:30:58.301 --> 00:31:02.470
<v Speaker 1>about radio back then radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his new holy Shit.</v>

711
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.770
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes my skin tingle.</v>

712
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can read that.</v>

713
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I can read some people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>writers,</v>

714
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially talking about radio.</v>

715
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:19.110
<v Speaker 1>The way people talk about the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sentence easily could be about the </v>

716
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.110
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

717
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.030
<v Speaker 1>That it has or has not mastered itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the material it uses.</v>

718
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's new.</v>

719
00:31:23.741 --> 00:31:25.840
<v Speaker 1>But it has adult responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

720
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:27.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

721
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:28.890
<v Speaker 1>That is the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

722
00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.510
<v Speaker 1>So what's going to happen is we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna get censored very soon.</v>

723
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Just like radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

724
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:35.530
<v Speaker 1>radio didn't eventually get censored </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

725
00:31:35.531 --> 00:31:38.050
<v Speaker 1>It got sentenced for awhile and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>became satellite radio,</v>

726
00:31:38.051 --> 00:31:40.040
<v Speaker 1>which is way more popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

727
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Satellite Radio is essentially smushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular radio.</v>

728
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.840
<v Speaker 1>It's when everyone knows they can get </v>

738
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:12.030
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes of commercials on regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio just to hear subpar content.</v>

739
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:14.480
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

740
00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.150
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few good ones left.</v>

741
00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:21.180

<v Speaker 1>country is maybe a dozen radio stations </v>

<v Speaker 1>and why?</v>

744
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.810
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because it was censored.</v>

745
00:32:25.811 --> 00:32:28.060
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't compete,</v>

<v Speaker 1>give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's way more people that would way </v>

752
00:32:43.561 --> 00:32:45.851
<v Speaker 1>rather hear uncensored stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why when you look at Internet </v>

<v Speaker 1>videos and they have a million fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>that's can do it though anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big lesson in life.</v>

812
00:35:19.611 --> 00:35:21.830
<v Speaker 1>You can insist that things need to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they were.</v>

813
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:27.030
<v Speaker 1>It's key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can never be the way it was because </v>

814
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.170
<v Speaker 1>if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be a single cell organism.</v>

815
00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:28.540
<v Speaker 1>You fuckhead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.760
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous and those were good </v>

817
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.191
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess there was a time of no </v>

818
00:35:36.191 --> 00:35:36.191
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

819
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:37.800
<v Speaker 1>those were the days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No phone bill.</v>

820
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just muck muck in the ocean,</v>

821
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.820
<v Speaker 1>chilling about waiting for the aliens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come and mix the DNA in there.</v>

822
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Like in that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that movie?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was flipping channels that's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>chewed up.</v>

827
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Charlie's could have been fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>hottest astronaut ever was pretty hot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that would be great.</v>

834
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Special effects are pretty dope too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something was missing in that movie.</v>

835
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.660
<v Speaker 1>The movie just didn't quite.</v>

<v Speaker 3>really are that concerned about a movie.</v>

849

<v Speaker 3>gets on NBC,</v>

862
00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.170
<v Speaker 3>the network television premier that used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to mean something.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right now it means you're slow as fuck.</v>

865
00:37:37.621 --> 00:37:38.170
<v Speaker 3>would be the network television premier </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'd go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>well now this movie is legitimate.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I've ever.</v>

878

<v Speaker 3>Star wars came out and like 88 on like </v>
<v Speaker 3>NBC came out like 1988.</v>

879
00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.340
<v Speaker 3>It was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember?</v>

880
00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:08.350
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a movie they kept coming back </v>

881
00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:08.350
<v Speaker 3>to the theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>

882
00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

883
00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:12.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm the wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was TV movies when that was the </v>

884
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:13.430
<v Speaker 3>big thing where you would sit home and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there'd be like a movie that was made by</v>

885
00:38:13.431 --> 00:38:17.550
<v Speaker 3>NBC or CBS and ABC and some of them even</v>
<v Speaker 3>lasted weeks.</v>

886
00:38:17.551 --> 00:38:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Like they were just Salem's lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

887
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Made for TV movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're big poison ivy with Michael J.</v>

888
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:29.200
<v Speaker 3>Fox and intimate came.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did a new version of the shining </v>

889
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.981
<v Speaker 3>with the guy from wings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when that happened because </v>

890
00:38:32.981 --> 00:38:37.210
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shining doesn't really keep it real </v>

891
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:37.210
<v Speaker 3>to the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

892
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:37.210
<v Speaker 3>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

893
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:37.210
<v Speaker 3>but it's</v>

894
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:37.210
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

895
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.520
<v Speaker 1>They decided to UNCW,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubric it.</v>

896
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't,</v>

897
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't so hot.</v>

898
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that there's all these like </v>

899
00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.730
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies or like hints in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shining of like the moon landing and </v>

900
00:38:50.921 --> 00:38:51.820
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and the other.</v>

901
00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:56.240
<v Speaker 1>There was definitely references to a kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>wore and Apollo tee shirt and there's,</v>

902
00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.320
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of documentaries that </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakdown all the connections between </v>

903
00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:06.090
<v Speaker 1>the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distance between the earth and the </v>

904
00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.840
<v Speaker 1>moon being representative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all sorts of weird shit.</v>

905
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:10.150
<v Speaker 1>The documentary gave me blue balls </v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad though.</v>

906
00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

907
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:17.400
<v Speaker 1>I want to believe all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like it just never connected that </v>

908
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.191
<v Speaker 1>well for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I was a filmmaker I'd be </v>

909
00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:20.940
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by it because I think Kubrick</v>
<v Speaker 1>was secure.</v>

910
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Brick is one of those rare minds that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was operating on a bunch of different </v>

911
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.420
<v Speaker 1>sort of levels at the same time.</v>

912
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that he was writing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>script and creating this sort of </v>

913
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.080
<v Speaker 1>theatrical piece where you'd see Jack </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson get angry and,</v>

914
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:43.260
<v Speaker 1>but in his mind that wasn't enough and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he would add all of this like hidden </v>

915
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:48.181
<v Speaker 1>meaning things symbology and all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird stuff that he would add to it that</v>

916
00:39:48.821 --> 00:39:53.821
<v Speaker 1>would just kind of leave people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decipher like why exactly this number,</v>

917
00:39:54.521 --> 00:39:57.070
<v Speaker 1>what exactly was that supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent?</v>

918
00:39:57.071 --> 00:40:02.071
<v Speaker 1>And he had a bunch of shit attached to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it that didn't necessarily even have to </v>

919
00:40:02.071 --> 00:40:02.890
<v Speaker 1>be in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

920
00:40:02.891 --> 00:40:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Room to 37.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

921
00:40:04.631 --> 00:40:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't crazy about it.</v>

922
00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

923
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.460
<v Speaker 1>but I thought it was interesting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people thought he was,</v>

924
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:14.050
<v Speaker 1>he was the actual one who faked the moon</v>
<v Speaker 1>landing.</v>

925
00:40:14.051 --> 00:40:16.060
<v Speaker 1>He was the one hired to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

926
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:21.120
<v Speaker 1>the theory being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's zero evidence that shows </v>

927
00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.841
<v Speaker 1>that he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a bunch of evidence that </v>

928
00:40:24.841 --> 00:40:27.301
<v Speaker 1>shows that he was working with Nasa and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he got a lot of consulting with </v>

929
00:40:27.301 --> 00:40:30.490
<v Speaker 1>them when he was creating a 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>69 when he was doing in 2001.</v>

930
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.260
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

931
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.480
<v Speaker 1>of course it makes sense that he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>consult with them.</v>

932
00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were a huge movie movie producer,</v>

933
00:40:37.841 --> 00:40:38.490
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

934
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.850
<v Speaker 1>a guy who makes these perfect movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he made Dr.</v>

935
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:47.050
<v Speaker 1>strangelove was fantastic and he'd made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a wizard.</v>

936
00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Clockwork orange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guys wizard.</v>

937
00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy like that must put incredible </v>

938
00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:57.451
<v Speaker 1>amounts of consideration to every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect when you're doing something like </v>

939
00:40:57.451 --> 00:40:57.451
<v Speaker 1>space travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

940
00:40:57.451 --> 00:40:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Of course you would have some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with NASA.</v>

941
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if someone was going to be able to </v>

942
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:04.260
<v Speaker 1>fake the moon landing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably be that dude.</v>

943
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

944
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.630
<v Speaker 1>it probably be only that dude at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

945
00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.810
<v Speaker 1>George Lucas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a baby at that time.</v>

946
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.680
<v Speaker 1>George was probably like in his twenties</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

947
00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:19.830
<v Speaker 1>That was 1969 to 1972 was when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>filmed it in 68.</v>

948
00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:25.411
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see that Roger Moore </v>

949
00:41:25.411 --> 00:41:27.450
<v Speaker 1>documentary or Roger Moore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Bond when he's,</v>

950
00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:29.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's being chased by these bad guys that</v>

951
00:41:29.471 --> 00:41:31.980
<v Speaker 1>he runs through a set of the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

952
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

957
00:41:36.681 --> 00:41:38.870
<v Speaker 3>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were filming the Moon,</v>

958
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:44.620
<v Speaker 3>filming the Moon Landings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to rock it out and Roger Moore goes </v>

959
00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:44.620
<v Speaker 3>running through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

960
00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:49.451
<v Speaker 3>James Bond.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sean connery and Roger Moore had to be </v>

961
00:41:49.451 --> 00:41:49.451
<v Speaker 3>Roger Moore because they turned into </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy is after Roger Moore.</v>

962
00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting term.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was like a smokey and the bandit </v>

967
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.100
<v Speaker 3>type,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like Benny Hill music playing </v>

968
00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:06.100
<v Speaker 3>while he's chasing people around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

970
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:11.960
<v Speaker 3>And then you get Daniel Craig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is totally the more like the book,</v>

971
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's more like the real double o seven </v>

972
00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:17.320
<v Speaker 3>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literature,</v>

00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:30.281
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it started obviously with that guy </v>

977
00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:31.991

983
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.840
<v Speaker 3>British army.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sean connery.</v>

<v Speaker 3>James Bond movie?</v>

986
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:57.250
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy that that was between </v>

987
00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:59.201
<v Speaker 3>Roger Moore and Sean Connery and he kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of got influenced by the hippie movement</v>

988
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:05.470
<v Speaker 3>and grew his hair all long and started </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing all these public statements about </v>

989
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:08.870
<v Speaker 3>the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they dropped him in a second because</v>

990
00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:11.570
<v Speaker 3>he didn't fit the image anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>

991
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.270
<v Speaker 3>And he was really disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's always been disappointed by it.</v>

992
00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:19.650
<v Speaker 3>You know that he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he did that because you only got </v>

993
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:22.001
<v Speaker 3>one movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would have been set for life and he </v>

994
00:43:22.001 --> 00:43:22.001
<v Speaker 3>kind of locked them out too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

995
00:43:22.001 --> 00:43:25.750
<v Speaker 3>They locked him out and he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He seems to think he was kind of </v>

996
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:26.840
<v Speaker 3>influenced by like all these outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys like,</v>

998
00:43:27.981 --> 00:43:32.981

<v Speaker 3>and he felt like he didn't necessarily </v>

999
00:43:32.981 --> 00:43:34.280
<v Speaker 3>really want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just felt pressured to do it.</v>

1000
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:39.520
<v Speaker 3>The first guy was Barry Nelson in 1954.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the American you think?</v>

1001
00:43:39.771 --> 00:43:40.730

<v Speaker 1>American guy.</v>

1048
00:46:12.751 --> 00:46:14.830
<v Speaker 1>James Bond.</v>

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Identity Board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a board.</v>

1050
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Imagine Jason Bourne said something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1051
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So what kind of pussy am I paying money </v>

1053
00:46:27.891 --> 00:46:28.140
<v Speaker 1>to say it's just another movie where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>just goes to eat lunch.</v>

1054
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:34.310
<v Speaker 1>There was another guy in 1956.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name was Bob wholeness and Baba </v>

1055
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:39.500
<v Speaker 1>wholeness provided the voice for James </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bond in the South African radio </v>

1056
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.390
<v Speaker 1>adaption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was one of the James Bonds but not</v>

1057
00:46:42.391 --> 00:46:47.391
<v Speaker 1>a physical James Bond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there was Bob Simmons and Bob </v>

1058
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Simmons is apparently the guy</v>

1059
00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:52.640
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1061
00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:56.890
<v Speaker 1>stop doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or was it David Nivon?</v>

1063
00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was in the sixties whenever.</v>

1064
00:47:03.151 --> 00:47:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this one guy did one movie,</v>

1065
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.430

<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know which guy it is.</v>

1067
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:19.240
<v Speaker 1>It's either George Lazenby or David </v>
<v Speaker 1>Niven.</v>

1068
00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine it would be lazy and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason.</v>

1069
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:30.730

<v Speaker 5>all the James Bond movies are done by </v>

<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't say anything in his </v>

1081
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:08.981
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia about that just says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's just not that important to </v>

1082
00:48:09.131 --> 00:48:11.810
<v Speaker 1>some people that they put it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia.</v>

1093
00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:33.131
<v Speaker 1>playing the same character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's supposed to be </v>

1094
00:48:33.131 --> 00:48:33.710
<v Speaker 1>seamless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about the Hulk in modern times?</v>

1158
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:08.200
<v Speaker 1>If you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky to stay alive long </v>

1159
00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:08.210
<v Speaker 1>enough for your skin to have a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with your face,</v>

1160
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:12.290
<v Speaker 1>just slowly but surely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of that,</v>

1161
00:51:12.291 --> 00:51:17.291
<v Speaker 1>I did this cryo chamber thing today and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about it before the </v>

1162
00:51:17.291 --> 00:51:18.020
<v Speaker 1>podcast that I polished tweets up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1163
00:51:18.021 --> 00:51:23.021
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo told me about this and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>read about it online and I had a Ian </v>

1164
00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Mccall who's a fighter in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the top flyweight contenders.</v>

1165
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:29.300
<v Speaker 1>He does it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

1166
00:51:29.301 --> 00:51:30.620
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard too much about this.</v>

1167
00:51:30.621 --> 00:51:35.621
<v Speaker 1>I got to give this a try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went to this place called the Cryo </v>

1168
00:51:35.621 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 1>health center in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in La today and go into this.</v>

1169
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like sort of like a suntanning </v>
<v Speaker 1>booth I guess I got.</v>

1170
00:51:42.851 --> 00:51:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Or a sauna?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1171
00:51:43.761 --> 00:51:48.761
<v Speaker 1>like a song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a big metal sauna and it's 240 </v>

1172
00:51:49.371 --> 00:51:54.371
<v Speaker 1>degrees below zero in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you go in there for two minutes </v>

1173
00:51:54.371 --> 00:51:58.691
<v Speaker 1>naked at 240 degrees below zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a hard on.</v>

1174
00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I very hard.</v>

1175
00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1176
00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:08.840
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the strange feelings ever.</v>

1177
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:09.710
<v Speaker 1>How long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long?</v>

1178
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Only two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at.</v>

1179
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:15.920
<v Speaker 1>That's me and they're two minutes minus </v>
<v Speaker 1>two forties,</v>

1180
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:20.540
<v Speaker 1>240 degrees below zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how cold that feels and if as</v>

1181
00:52:20.541 --> 00:52:22.100
<v Speaker 1>long as you only do it for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

1182
00:52:22.101 --> 00:52:27.101
<v Speaker 1>it's actually really good for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel your eyes getting frozen or </v>

1183
00:52:27.101 --> 00:52:27.101
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1184
00:52:27.101 --> 00:52:28.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing about eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1185
00:52:28.131 --> 00:52:33.131
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about why don't your eyes get </v>

1186
00:52:33.131 --> 00:52:33.131
<v Speaker 1>cold when it gets really cold out.</v>

1187
00:52:33.131 --> 00:52:37.270
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the wind can whip into your eyes </v>

1188
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.270
<v Speaker 1>and it hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1189
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:38.140
<v Speaker 1>and that can be cold because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1190
00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:41.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like the physical act of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1191
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:44.360
<v Speaker 1>The actual Ehr itself smacking into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

1192
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Your eyeballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can hurt but regular cold.</v>

1193
00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Unless it gets really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fucking cold.</v>

1194
00:52:50.241 --> 00:52:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Your eyes don't get cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my eyes weren't called.</v>

1195
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:55.940
<v Speaker 1>The most noticeable thing wasn't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1196
00:52:55.941 --> 00:52:58.460
<v Speaker 1>My skin was really cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was hard to breathe.</v>

1197
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:04.120
<v Speaker 1>It's so cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything constricts you standing there</v>

1198
00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:06.890
<v Speaker 1>naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How safe is this?</v>

1199
00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Safe is fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1200
00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get in there.</v>

1201
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Seems safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a super easy to open up </v>

1202
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.830
<v Speaker 1>the door lock champs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a lock on the door?</v>

1203
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only if someone really doesn't like you </v>

1204
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:21.390
<v Speaker 1>definitely die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>

1205
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Someone locked you in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're if you're naked.</v>

1206
00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how long you're going to </v>

1207
00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:29.481
<v Speaker 1>laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if that locked just stopped </v>

1208

1209
00:53:29.481 --> 00:53:30.410
<v Speaker 1>They can't have a swinging door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just opened the door.</v>

1210
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:33.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's thick as fuck though.</v>

1211
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Be Hard to claw your way out of that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1212
00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get in this booth if you're in.</v>

1213
00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:40.770
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a fraternity or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>for eternity,</v>

1214
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.100

<v Speaker 1>frostbite where they have to remove like</v>

1218
00:53:53.221 --> 00:53:55.280

<v Speaker 1>We all voted in assholes.</v>

1224
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:18.210
<v Speaker 1>I was never joined one pass by Frat the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>

1225
00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:23.310

<v Speaker 1>the house and they were playing </v>

1226
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:23.310
<v Speaker 1>football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing catch,</v>

1227
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:27.921
<v Speaker 1>like on the lawn and there was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of them in there drinking beers </v>

<v Speaker 4>You said it's pretty funny.</v>

1232
00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:39.420
<v Speaker 4>It's all about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

1233
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:44.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people hanging out in the front </v>

1234
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:47.061
<v Speaker 4>porch and drinking and having parties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But living next to that with your </v>

1235
00:54:47.061 --> 00:54:47.061
<v Speaker 4>family,</v>

1236
00:54:47.061 --> 00:54:51.190
<v Speaker 1>did you see the reactions that a seth </v>
<v Speaker 1>rogen got by some wacky feminist?</v>

1237
00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it came to,</v>

1238
00:54:53.361 --> 00:54:58.361
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy that was shooting people up at </v>

1239
00:54:58.361 --> 00:54:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Santa Barbara know what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was this woman,</v>

1240
00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:00.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1241
00:55:00.711 --> 00:55:02.240
<v Speaker 1>the guy was shot at the epicenter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barbara.</v>

1242
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman somehow or another implied </v>

1243
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.880
<v Speaker 1>that it's cartoonish depictions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

1244
00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:13.330
<v Speaker 1>like in Seth Rogan's movies that lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>men to have these horrific ideas of what</v>

1245
00:55:14.691 --> 00:55:17.390
<v Speaker 1>women really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like somehow or another lead to</v>

1246
00:55:17.391 --> 00:55:21.410
<v Speaker 1>them killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in that one story.</v>

1247
00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:26.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible connection because he </v>

1248
00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:26.660
<v Speaker 1>killed men to killed more men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

1249
00:55:26.661 --> 00:55:29.000
<v Speaker 1>and he killed women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He killed four men and women.</v>

1250
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1251
00:55:29.511 --> 00:55:31.290
<v Speaker 1>he was just a sick fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1252
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:32.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kid was a mess.</v>

1253
00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:37.840
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 1>seth Rogan's movies like have to be </v>

1254
00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.170
<v Speaker 1>gender balanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1255
00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:42.170
<v Speaker 1>and at the sacrifice of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of comedy.</v>

1256
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Like they can't be caricaturists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't,</v>

1257
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:50.270
<v Speaker 1>whoever's in the film that it can't be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman with long nails is really done as </v>

1258
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.990
<v Speaker 1>big tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that happens,</v>

1259
00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.350
<v Speaker 1>a guy's going to murder people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1260
00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:54.680
<v Speaker 1>And what about actual cartoons?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1261
00:55:54.681 --> 00:55:59.681
<v Speaker 1>don't you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all those crazy depictions in </v>

1262
00:55:59.681 --> 00:55:59.681
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you heard about his new movie,</v>

1263
00:55:59.681 --> 00:56:00.350
<v Speaker 1>it's about North Korea.</v>

1264
00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:02.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And are they are already saying like,</v>

1265
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:06.050
<v Speaker 4>like this is a threat of war and if this</v>
<v Speaker 4>movie comes out that,</v>

1266
00:56:06.051 --> 00:56:08.250
<v Speaker 4>that they're threatening war on us </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of this movie,</v>

1267
00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:10.560
<v Speaker 4>they can't go to war with us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

1268
00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:15.680
<v Speaker 4>For one movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the new Seth rogen movie about </v>

1269
00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.510
<v Speaker 4>assassinating Kim Jong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1270
00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:20.500
<v Speaker 4>it's called a some.</v>

1271
00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if North Korea goes to</v>

1272
00:56:25.271 --> 00:56:27.280
<v Speaker 1>war and as for a fucking James Franco </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

1273
00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:29.730
<v Speaker 1>we'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't like them either.</v>

1274
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Not going to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just troll them on instagram.</v>

1275
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do this.</v>

1276
00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:38.270
<v Speaker 1>You have to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should have went to war over the south.</v>

1277
00:56:38.271 --> 00:56:40.580
<v Speaker 1>But that South Park movie team America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1278
00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:45.610
<v Speaker 1>that was way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was when they drew the line in the </v>

1279
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:45.610
<v Speaker 1>sand though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>

1280
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:47.540
<v Speaker 1>That was the first blow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then like one more time.</v>

1281
00:56:47.541 --> 00:56:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Mother fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One more time.</v>

1282
00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:51.320
<v Speaker 1>They're always threatening war though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't they?</v>

1283
00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they really get the mic.</v>

1284
00:56:54.291 --> 00:56:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Rib doesn't come back this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to war with you.</v>

1285
00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:59.460
<v Speaker 1>While they're very hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have much money.</v>

1286
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:01.980
<v Speaker 1>They say when you fly over North Korea </v>
<v Speaker 1>at night,</v>

1287
00:57:01.981 --> 00:57:04.050
<v Speaker 1>it's all dark because they can't afford </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep the lights on.</v>

1288
00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good place.</v>

1289
00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:11.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had Shane Smith from vice and he </v>

1290
00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:11.900
<v Speaker 1>talked about his vet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his visits to North Korea.</v>

1291
00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:16.820
<v Speaker 1>He said it was the craziest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they pretended that they took him </v>

1292
00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:16.820
<v Speaker 1>to a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all set up,</v>

1293
00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:21.231
<v Speaker 1>but there was no one else there with him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said it was so obvious that by </v>

1294
00:57:21.231 --> 00:57:21.231
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people move,</v>

1295
00:57:21.231 --> 00:57:25.791
<v Speaker 1>they didn't move with like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people who are comfortable working </v>

1296
00:57:25.791 --> 00:57:25.791
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1297
00:57:25.791 --> 00:57:26.310
<v Speaker 1>it was all totally new experience for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1298
00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:31.550
<v Speaker 1>So they probably were people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like forced into this position to </v>

1299
00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:32.430
<v Speaker 1>pretend that it was a restaurant for </v>
<v Speaker 1>American journalists.</v>

1300
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's going,</v>

1301
00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:37.140
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he got Dennis Rodman going over</v>

1302
00:57:37.141 --> 00:57:41.430
<v Speaker 1>there playing basketball and grab ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a fucking kid than the kid winds up</v>

1303
00:57:41.431 --> 00:57:43.350
<v Speaker 1>being the new dictator now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1304
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:49.690
<v Speaker 1>I miss the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Miss Dennis Rodman being on TV every </v>

1305
00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:52.240
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could be on tv every day if someone </v>

1306
00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:52.240
<v Speaker 1>was smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1307
00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Just follow them with the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that gone on?</v>

1308
00:57:52.791 --> 00:57:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Every reality show he should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good reality show producer.</v>

1309
00:57:56.510 --> 00:58:00.950
<v Speaker 1>You're telling me you can produce a TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>show about a slippery road,</v>

1310
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:06.970
<v Speaker 1>but you can't produce a TV show about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant black man with facial piercings </v>

1311
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:09.530
<v Speaker 1>that likes to get drunk or crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

1312
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:12.950
<v Speaker 1>He's a celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plays basketball with murderers.</v>

1313
00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plays basketball with the guy who </v>

1314
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:18.100
<v Speaker 1>killed his own family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1315
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:22.240
<v Speaker 1>The guy killed his own family because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was worried that they were going to </v>

1316
00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.780
<v Speaker 1>assassinate him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes over there and plays basketball.</v>

1317
00:58:23.781 --> 00:58:25.580
<v Speaker 1>With that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a show in Kaiser,</v>

1318
00:58:25.581 --> 00:58:30.581
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can make a show about dudes who </v>

1319
00:58:30.581 --> 00:58:30.760
<v Speaker 1>hunt alligators or swamp people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something.</v>

1320
00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like dudes giving away parking </v>
<v Speaker 1>tickets as a show.</v>

1321
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 3>a kid,</v>

1406
01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:52.210
<v Speaker 3>I was such a fan of naked gun and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to watch all those movies like </v>

1407
01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:53.210
<v Speaker 3>Kentucky Fried Movie Top secret.</v>

01:01:53.211 --> 01:01:58.211
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all just did not live up to the </v>

1409
01:01:58.211 --> 01:01:58.211
<v Speaker 3>naked gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1410
01:01:58.211 --> 01:01:58.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the movie?</v>

1411
01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.100
<v Speaker 3>What was the TV show that started naked </v>
<v Speaker 3>gun?</v>

1412
01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:04.820
<v Speaker 3>A police files or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Police squad and police squad.</v>

1413
01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:06.320
<v Speaker 3>Ninety three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1414
01:02:06.321 --> 01:02:11.321
<v Speaker 3>Tombstone was 21 fucking years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>

1415
01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:17.830
<v Speaker 3>And when there another movie about a doc</v>
<v Speaker 3>holiday and all those guys that came out</v>

1416
01:02:18.381 --> 01:02:20.110
<v Speaker 3>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're</v>

1417
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>too close to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to it,</v>

1418
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.790
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1419
01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>a little later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who was in it?</v>

1420
01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I want to say Kevin Costner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1421
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But tombstone was the good one with the </v>

1422
01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:36.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm your huckleberry and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>

1423
01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>You Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unforgiven no wrong.</v>

1424
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:42.970
<v Speaker 1>And a dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you confuse Kevin Costner and </v>

1425
01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:47.610
<v Speaker 1>clinics would go back to Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1426
01:02:47.611 --> 01:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Costner Played Wyatt earp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1427
01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>I think someone else played someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1428
01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>who else played it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurt Russell was in there somewhere.</v>

1429
01:02:58.801 --> 01:03:03.801
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's very confusing because I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>only seen tombstone Wyatt earp,</v>

1430
01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:07.590
<v Speaker 1>the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see why it was good,</v>

1431
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.400
<v Speaker 1>but it was weird because they had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1432
01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.760
<v Speaker 1>put Kevin Costner and some weird wig to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make them look like he was a kid and </v>

1433
01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.250
<v Speaker 1>then they took the wig off when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger and you're like,</v>

1434
01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.360
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was older,</v>

1435
01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:19.500
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1436
01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.900
<v Speaker 1>I was more of a young guns guy.</v>

1437
01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Young guns was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young guns was fun.</v>

1438
01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:27.300
<v Speaker 1>It was 94.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a year later.</v>

1439
01:03:27.301 --> 01:03:32.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was Kevin Costner and Dennis </v>

1440
01:03:32.301 --> 01:03:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Quaid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Quaid Played Doc holiday.</v>

1441
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:38.510
<v Speaker 1>He did a good job with doc holiday too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I remember this one dude who was an </v>

1442
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:40.230
<v Speaker 1>actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to tell him,</v>

1443
01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.340
<v Speaker 1>I saw the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a tombstone.</v>

1444
01:03:44.341 --> 01:03:47.220
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about how good val kilmer </v>
<v Speaker 1>was as doc holiday.</v>

1445
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:48.900
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude was creepy.</v>

1446
01:03:48.901 --> 01:03:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Good in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1447
01:03:50.350 --> 01:03:51.320
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was.</v>

1448
01:03:51.321 --> 01:03:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Performance is a little over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1449
01:03:53.581 --> 01:03:55.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Quaid I thought did a much better</v>

1450
01:03:55.471 --> 01:03:56.430
<v Speaker 1>job in the Ra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1451
01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:58.230
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't go.</v>

1452
01:03:58.231 --> 01:04:01.620
<v Speaker 1>You don't think he just saw you saw him </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1453
01:04:01.621 --> 01:04:06.621
<v Speaker 1>You saw what Val kilmer did and you knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't do that and it bothers </v>

1454
01:04:06.621 --> 01:04:08.820
<v Speaker 1>the shit out of you because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediocre sitcom actor.</v>

1455
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're all angry that Dennis Quaid </v>

1456
01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.810
<v Speaker 1>you like Dennis Quaid your hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're going to let you go.</v>

1457
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Because why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Dennis Quaid did it.</v>

1458
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.860
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the same kind of performance.</v>

1459
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:20.610
<v Speaker 1>That's a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a good job.</v>

1460
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:25.560
<v Speaker 1>But Val kilmer hit that creepy spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit that creepy spot where you really</v>

1461
01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:30.561
<v Speaker 1>believe he was a gunfighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really believed that he had some </v>

1462
01:04:30.561 --> 01:04:33.270
<v Speaker 1>lightning reflex and he had killed 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>men with his gun when he was like,</v>

1463
01:04:33.271 --> 01:04:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm your huckleberry and he's got this </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead look in his eyes.</v>

1464
01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:41.450
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude knew he couldn't hit that </v>

1465
01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:41.450
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1466
01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:44.751
<v Speaker 1>And so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was performance was very </v>

1467
01:04:44.751 --> 01:04:46.671
<v Speaker 1>over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck you did over the top of my </v>

1468
01:04:46.671 --> 01:04:46.671
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>

01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:01.060

<v Speaker 1>a date I guess.</v>

1501
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:02.920
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1502
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:07.950
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really let that a heckler get here </v>

1503
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:07.950
<v Speaker 1>just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1504
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:08.260
<v Speaker 1>don't let them bother you that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

1505
01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:09.130
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1506
01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:09.820
<v Speaker 1>fuck him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1507
01:06:09.821 --> 01:06:14.340
<v Speaker 1>you got shut those people down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was giving me advice on how to,</v>

1508
01:06:14.341 --> 01:06:15.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with hecklers,</v>

1509
01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:16.840
<v Speaker 1>not so dreamy.</v>

1510
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:18.160
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen dude,</v>

1511
01:06:18.161 --> 01:06:23.161
<v Speaker 1>you get up there and you tell you tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>some jokes and have some drunk asshole </v>

1512
01:06:23.161 --> 01:06:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Yell Shit at you in front of a packed </v>
<v Speaker 1>house where you have to deal with that.</v>

1513
01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1514
01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.740
<v Speaker 1>you want to try it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go try it and then then tell me,</v>

1515
01:06:29.741 --> 01:06:32.620
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when someone's interrupting the flow</v>

1516
01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:37.621
<v Speaker 1>of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like screaming shit out like you're </v>

1517
01:06:37.621 --> 01:06:39.841
<v Speaker 1>supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to deal with that and you got </v>

1518
01:06:39.841 --> 01:06:40.720
<v Speaker 1>to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a producer of a way as possible,</v>

1519
01:06:40.790 --> 01:06:43.450
<v Speaker 1>you have to discourage that from ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening again.</v>

1520
01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:45.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only way to get comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>

1521
01:06:45.581 --> 01:06:50.140
<v Speaker 1>It's your job as a comedian to belittle </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mock that person.</v>

1522
01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1523
01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:55.540
<v Speaker 1>It has to happen because the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>feels that the audience has pissed.</v>

1524
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:57.580
<v Speaker 1>You got a drunk eyes interrupting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1525
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:59.920
<v Speaker 1>It's almost always a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but occasionally it's a check,</v>

1526
01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.430
<v Speaker 1>but they're less aggressive now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chicks that do it,</v>

1527
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:06.010
<v Speaker 1>their heckles or very rarely like as out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and out.</v>

1528
01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Douchey is the men hackles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more clueless right now.</v>

1529
01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not used to being told to be </v>

1530
01:07:13.890 --> 01:07:13.890
<v Speaker 1>quiet.</v>

1531
01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.480
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck you.</v>

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.410
<v Speaker 7>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck.</v>

1533
01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Boston I just let it happen.</v>

1534
01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Just let them pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no win in that.</v>

1535
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:27.220
<v Speaker 1>You just Kinda have backup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a lot of people with you.</v>

1536
01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have like eight guys standing behind </v>

1537
01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:32.280
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1538
01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.800
<v Speaker 1>There's new club in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just opened up like in the bottom of </v>

1539
01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.561
<v Speaker 1>a hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those cool places where </v>

1540
01:07:37.561 --> 01:07:37.561
<v Speaker 1>there the clubs in the hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just.</v>

1541
01:07:37.561 --> 01:07:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Joey did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that it's very good club,</v>

1542
01:07:39.071 --> 01:07:40.750
<v Speaker 1>but the sound system sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1543
01:07:40.751 --> 01:07:42.190
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only.</v>

1544
01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:43.850
<v Speaker 1>The most important part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1545
01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.320
<v Speaker 1>and they don't want to hear about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently.</v>

1546
01:07:45.321 --> 01:07:46.960
<v Speaker 1>And people keep telling them the sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>system sucks.</v>

1547
01:07:46.961 --> 01:07:51.961
<v Speaker 1>They don't do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep telling them through the </v>

1548
01:07:51.961 --> 01:07:51.961
<v Speaker 1>sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think joey was like,</v>

1549
01:07:51.961 --> 01:07:51.961
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

1550
01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:53.740
<v Speaker 1>But Joey could do the Wilbur theater </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1551
01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Joe is gigantic now.</v>

1552
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Joe Is the man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1553
01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:59.050
<v Speaker 1>he's too funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all working out.</v>

1554
01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:01.990
<v Speaker 1>He likes doing comedy clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all like doing comedy clubs.</v>

1555
01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:07.050
<v Speaker 1>But if joey wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they didn't want to fix the sound </v>

1556
01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:07.050
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could easily do that.</v>

1557
01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:11.280
<v Speaker 1>The Boston comedy scene used to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>five clubs on one block and now they're </v>

1558
01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.410
<v Speaker 1>down to a theater and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outside rooms,</v>

1559
01:08:14.411 --> 01:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>like the dicta already rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a bunch of rooms.</v>

1560
01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:19.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's other people that book </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooms that I don't know about,</v>

1561
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:22.520
<v Speaker 1>but the Intel clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're down dike.</v>

1562
01:08:22.521 --> 01:08:25.650
<v Speaker 1>I think nick's does it only on weekends </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1563
01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.590
<v Speaker 1>then they have this new place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1564
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Like the feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scene just to the floor fell out of </v>

1565
01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:33.130
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1566
01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:33.420
<v Speaker 5>How long did you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you started in Boston,</v>

1567
01:08:33.421 --> 01:08:34.080
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1568
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:35.220
<v Speaker 5>And how many years were you there?</v>

1569
01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was back and forth the third and </v>

1570
01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.611
<v Speaker 1>fourth year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I only really lived there for like </v>

1571
01:08:44.611 --> 01:08:47.860
<v Speaker 1>two and a half years while I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

1572
01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I may live there for longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born in New Jersey,</v>

1573
01:08:51.730 --> 01:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>lived in San Francisco to allow as an 11</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a cow in New Jersey till seven San </v>

1574
01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven to 11,</v>

1575
01:08:58.001 --> 01:08:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 to 13.</v>

1576
01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Boston 13 to like 24 ish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I moved to New York.</v>

1577
01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>I was going back and forth the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1578
01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:12.610
<v Speaker 1>the first year I was doing a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was hard to get gigs in New York.</v>

1579
01:09:12.611 --> 01:09:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I was a new guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Road gigs especially.</v>

1580
01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:20.310
<v Speaker 1>So I'd get road gigs in Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get some of them around Boston that </v>

1581
01:09:20.310 --> 01:09:20.310
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least for the first,</v>

1582
01:09:20.310 --> 01:09:22.870
<v Speaker 1>like six months or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1583
01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:28.200
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking hard place now to make a,</v>

1584
01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.510
<v Speaker 1>make a living as a comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same thing anymore.</v>

1585
01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:32.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've only,</v>

1586
01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.630
<v Speaker 5>I've never played an actual club they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing,</v>

1587
01:09:36.330 --> 01:09:37.330
<v Speaker 5>there's not that many.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There</v>

1588
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:39.210
<v Speaker 1>used to be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

1589
01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could,</v>

1590
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if I had realized how great it </v>

1591
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:45.280
<v Speaker 1>was at the time of her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd realized how,</v>

1592
01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>how special it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I wouldn't have enjoyed it as </v>

1593
01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.611
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe like half of me enjoying it was </v>

1594
01:09:53.611 --> 01:09:54.820
<v Speaker 1>just being in the moment and then being </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to look back on it and go,</v>

1595
01:09:54.821 --> 01:09:56.260
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how lucky did I get?</v>

1596
01:09:56.650 --> 01:09:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Because I could've easily been somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

1597
01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:02.260
<v Speaker 1>I could have easily been in Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could it be I'm as a kid.</v>

1598
01:10:02.261 --> 01:10:04.660
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't my choice that we moved to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston.</v>

1599
01:10:04.661 --> 01:10:09.661
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a say in it and the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I came onto the scene in August of </v>

1600
01:10:09.661 --> 01:10:14.641
<v Speaker 1>2000 or 1988 rather in August of 1988,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I came on the scene,</v>

1601
01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I was 21 years old and the place was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just flooded with comedians.</v>

1602
01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:25.020
<v Speaker 1>There was all these like big name guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>were always in town.</v>

1603
01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:30.240
<v Speaker 1>There was always like billy crystal </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be in town and Robin Williams </v>

1604
01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:33.410
<v Speaker 1>would stop in and see these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had seen an hbo like Dom,</v>

1605
01:10:33.411 --> 01:10:38.411
<v Speaker 1>I rera was in town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these guys were in town and there </v>

1606
01:10:38.411 --> 01:10:40.930
<v Speaker 1>was a constant tour of like top level </v>
<v Speaker 1>talent that would come through Boston.</v>

1607
01:10:40.931 --> 01:10:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Like Hicks came through Boston Kennison </v>
<v Speaker 1>would come through Boston,</v>

1608
01:10:43.901 --> 01:10:45.700
<v Speaker 1>but he would do like theaters like down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cape,</v>

1609
01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:49.780
<v Speaker 1>so we'd go to the theaters and shit like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and we saw them in Mansfield too,</v>

1610
01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:52.930
<v Speaker 1>but it was just an incredible time for </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>

1611
01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:58.200
<v Speaker 1>like the greatest time ever to start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think now it's getting pretty </v>

1612
01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.711
<v Speaker 1>close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think now might be out of all of the </v>

1613
01:11:01.711 --> 01:11:03.130
<v Speaker 1>years that I've been doing comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more strong comedians now than I</v>

1614
01:11:03.131 --> 01:11:03.730
<v Speaker 1>think ever.</v>

1615
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:08.790
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot because everyone knows </v>
<v Speaker 5>what everyone's up to on the Internet </v>

1616
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:12.340
<v Speaker 5>and everyone is swinging for the fences </v>
<v Speaker 5>like everyone's really developed.</v>

1617
01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think</v>

1618
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.830
<v Speaker 5>it's also easier for guys to get gigs </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they can get gay.</v>

1619
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:23.990
<v Speaker 5>People can find out that you're funny </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of online you can get a </v>

1620
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:23.990
<v Speaker 5>developer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can get a podcast,</v>

1621
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:29.030
<v Speaker 5>develop a following,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then start doing well in clubs and </v>

1622
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:32.751
<v Speaker 5>people will come out to see you like way</v>
<v Speaker 5>easier than it would be to get a </v>

1623
01:11:32.751 --> 01:11:36.861
<v Speaker 5>television show which would give these </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of the same kind of following when </v>

1624
01:11:37.171 --> 01:11:40.710
<v Speaker 5>you would go to clubs that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you had to rely on 20 years ago.</v>

1625
01:11:40.711 --> 01:11:45.711
<v Speaker 5>Somebody will pick you to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now all you have to do is release your </v>

1626
01:11:45.711 --> 01:11:46.310
<v Speaker 5>CD online for free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1627
01:11:46.311 --> 01:11:51.311
<v Speaker 5>let everybody hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People downloaded and they laugh and </v>

1628
01:11:51.311 --> 01:11:51.311
<v Speaker 5>then they find out that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be at a club next week.</v>

1629
01:11:51.311 --> 01:11:52.870
<v Speaker 5>I'll go see that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's hilarious.</v>

1630
01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.600
<v Speaker 5>And then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1631
01:11:54.601 --> 01:11:58.640
<v Speaker 5>and then you put little videos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go out little this little that a podcast</v>

1632
01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.780
<v Speaker 5>or did it today,</v>

01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:06.180
<v Speaker 5>I love when networks out because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>such a shitty process.</v>

1635
01:12:06.181 --> 01:12:08.820
<v Speaker 5>Everyone going through two or three </v>
<v Speaker 5>channels.</v>

1636
01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:14.150
<v Speaker 1>We'll think about all the guys that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know now think about like Duncan Sigora,</v>

1637
01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Ra d as all those guys are going through</v>
<v Speaker 1>nontraditional channels.</v>

1638
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:24.830
<v Speaker 5>They are and and I've known a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>times it was like a Hollywood wasn't </v>

1639
01:12:24.901 --> 01:12:29.901
<v Speaker 5>picking up on some of those guys 100 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent and now they're like doing way </v>

1640
01:12:29.901 --> 01:12:34.311
<v Speaker 5>better than a lot of guys that have tv </v>
<v Speaker 5>spots once because their nightclub </v>

1641
01:12:34.311 --> 01:12:34.500
<v Speaker 5>comics Hollywood's looking for</v>

1642
01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.680
<v Speaker 1>like even our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had a conversation about that </v>

1643
01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:41.900
<v Speaker 1>recently about what it was like when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>first started out that he was always </v>

1644
01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:43.710
<v Speaker 1>worried that he wasn't doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was going to get them on TV.</v>

1645
01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.050
<v Speaker 1>It was like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it a prison?</v>

1646
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:49.080
<v Speaker 1>You would worry about doing tv or make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV set?</v>

1647
01:12:49.081 --> 01:12:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to have a TV set.</v>

1648
01:12:50.551 --> 01:12:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I have to be able to do censored </v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

1649
01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:58.730
<v Speaker 1>But he also knew that if he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncensored and just himself and raw,</v>

1650
01:12:58.891 --> 01:13:01.770
<v Speaker 1>he could say hilarious shit and he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill.</v>

1651
01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.160
<v Speaker 1>He knew that he had that in him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1652
01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.060
<v Speaker 1>but it was like this struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how do you.</v>

1653
01:13:06.061 --> 01:13:10.470
<v Speaker 1>But how do you break through and make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then as he was developing,</v>

1654
01:13:10.471 --> 01:13:13.350
<v Speaker 1>right as he was developing the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet thing came along.</v>

1655
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:15.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he got into podcasts early,</v>

1656
01:13:15.261 --> 01:13:15.590
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

1657
01:13:15.730 --> 01:13:17.140
<v Speaker 1>real early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1658
01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:22.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean that certainly helps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also just the amount of </v>

1659
01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:25.741
<v Speaker 1>material of his that's online now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's stand up or whether it's </v>

1660
01:13:25.741 --> 01:13:25.870
<v Speaker 1>him talking about shit.</v>

1661
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:29.380
<v Speaker 5>He's got so much material now to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every time I see him he's doing like,</v>

1662
01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:34.470
<v Speaker 5>like what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going up on stage and he's doing </v>

1663
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.470
<v Speaker 5>like a different 15 on the first show in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a different.</v>

1664
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:36.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about New York spots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1665
01:13:36.531 --> 01:13:38.530
<v Speaker 5>he's always got like a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got tons of material.</v>

1666
01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:38.900
<v Speaker 5>Hard</v>

1667
01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:39.450
<v Speaker 1>worker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1668
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:40.370
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

1669
01:13:40.371 --> 01:13:41.310
<v Speaker 1>he works hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1670
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:44.480
<v Speaker 1>he gets things done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

1671
01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.570
<v Speaker 1>he's motivated and also he's motivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's been,</v>

1672
01:13:48.170 --> 01:13:53.170
<v Speaker 1>he's been on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been the guy who tried to become a </v>

1673
01:13:53.170 --> 01:13:53.170
<v Speaker 1>comedian and was really struggling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hating it.</v>

1674
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:58.330
<v Speaker 1>And now that he's making it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that he's doing well and making </v>

1675
01:13:58.330 --> 01:13:58.330
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really appreciating it.</v>

1676
01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1677
01:13:59.080 --> 01:13:59.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1678
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:05.110
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people that grow up in shitty </v>

1679
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:07.901
<v Speaker 1>weather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones who really appreciate </v>

1680
01:14:07.901 --> 01:14:07.901
<v Speaker 1>La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1681
01:14:07.901 --> 01:14:10.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that when you struggle as a </v>

1682
01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:13.871
<v Speaker 1>comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to get on American or </v>

1683
01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:17.100
<v Speaker 1>America's got talent like the first year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and start touring the nation and selling</v>

1684
01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:21.160
<v Speaker 1>out theaters was doing comedy in a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I did mass square garden.</v>

1685
01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:22.320
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1686
01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:25.420
<v Speaker 1>that's a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to die up there.</v>

1687
01:14:25.530 --> 01:14:26.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've looked.</v>

1688
01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the bravest men ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's Charlie Murphy.</v>

1689
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Murphy's the bravest man ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to standup comedy because </v>

1690
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:38.791
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Murphy was in his forties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had never done standup before and he </v>

1691
01:14:38.791 --> 01:14:40.690
<v Speaker 1>was on a hit television show and when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on Chappelle show,</v>

1692
01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:42.820
<v Speaker 1>he was telling these great stories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like,</v>

1694
01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:48.650
<v Speaker 1>So they forced him into going and doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he would host and do like do,</v>

1695
01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:53.730
<v Speaker 1>do a little bit of time and then tell us</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories and people would laugh and then </v>

1696
01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:54.280
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden he realized he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:15.330
<v Speaker 1>it gets cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1819
01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.510

<v Speaker 1>He's earned it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's over.</v>

1841
01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.040
<v Speaker 1>It's over anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1842
01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.390
<v Speaker 1>just the last few days of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like your cigarettes.</v>

1843
01:21:09.391 --> 01:21:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Do whatever you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it right.</v>

1844
01:21:12.210 --> 01:21:14.850
<v Speaker 1>I think you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian's hanging in there.</v>

1845
01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:16.780
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could just hang in there to 70,</v>

1846
01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:21.820
<v Speaker 1>30 more years to the 70 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who really want to believe </v>

1847
01:21:22.201 --> 01:21:23.640
<v Speaker 1>that cigarette smoking is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

1848
01:21:23.650 --> 01:21:25.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all depends on the gene.</v>

1849
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:27.330
<v Speaker 1>If you've got that gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the cancer,</v>

1850
01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:30.000
<v Speaker 1>but none of my family has cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1851
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Knock on wood.</v>

1852
01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Absolve ation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1853
01:21:35.521 --> 01:21:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Not that many people have those jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who does.</v>

1854
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:43.790
<v Speaker 1>I think some people just survive somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another that is smoking your lungs </v>

1855
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:43.980
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1856
01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:47.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird one,</v>

1857
01:21:47.341 --> 01:21:52.341
<v Speaker 1>man there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw this thing the other day where </v>

1858
01:21:52.341 --> 01:21:52.341
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1859
01:21:52.341 --> 01:21:56.330
<v Speaker 1>the vape pens and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are clearly being marketed to </v>

1860
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:56.330
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1861
01:21:56.540 --> 01:22:01.540
<v Speaker 1>this says strawberry bubblegum flavored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly this is marketed towards </v>

1862
01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:02.280
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was gone.</v>

1863
01:22:02.490 --> 01:22:04.290
<v Speaker 1>I was watching that going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

1864
01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:08.160
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who pays you pays you to say this?</v>

1865
01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one way to look at it.</v>

1866
01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:12.570
<v Speaker 1>One would look at is say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe they really are concerned,</v>

1867
01:22:12.571 --> 01:22:14.190
<v Speaker 1>but they're just dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1868
01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they,</v>

1869
01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:19.980
<v Speaker 1>this was being marketed towards children</v>
<v Speaker 1>or adults that liked the taste of candy.</v>

1870
01:22:19.981 --> 01:22:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Is that even possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Candy with your tobacco?</v>

1871
01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:25.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty fucking possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't absolutely.</v>

1872
01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:30.260
<v Speaker 1>So that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two clearly being marketed towards </v>

1873
01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:30.260
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He magic.</v>

1874
01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:33.990
<v Speaker 1>We saw a kid with a vape pen and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>strawberry,</v>

1875
01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:38.991
<v Speaker 1>bubblegum flavored tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not an adult in the world there </v>

1876
01:22:38.991 --> 01:22:38.991
<v Speaker 1>will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1877
01:22:38.991 --> 01:22:42.951
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strangers would like grab it out of his </v>

1878
01:22:42.951 --> 01:22:42.951
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will that apparently,</v>

1879
01:22:42.951 --> 01:22:44.640
<v Speaker 1>that is a thing with young kids though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1880
01:22:44.641 --> 01:22:47.430
<v Speaker 1>They liked the vapor pens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids that are trying to quit smoking.</v>

1881
01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Kids that started smoking at age 15 are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>

1882
01:22:50.130 --> 01:22:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens,</v>

1883
01:22:51.451 --> 01:22:51.930

<v Speaker 1>17 years old and they've tried to get </v>

1887

<v Speaker 1>They've done this thing.</v>

1888

<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took her to a rehab.</v>

1889
01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:05.070
<v Speaker 1>They took her to a hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can't get off.</v>

1890
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:05.850

1891
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:09.220

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:14.680
<v Speaker 4>Regular cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My brother was always just like smoking </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1930
01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Well Greg Fitzsimmons is the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

1931
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.470
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lived in Boston and uh,</v>

1932
01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:39.810
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his parents were chain smokers.</v>

1933
01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:44.650
<v Speaker 1>And so his mother and his father were </v>
<v Speaker 1>both chain smokers and they were in this</v>

1934
01:24:44.651 --> 01:24:46.240
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like boxed in,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think at the time actually was in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

1936
01:24:47.951 --> 01:24:49.960
<v Speaker 1>And then you said he lived in New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile too.</v>

1937
01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.630
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just no air,</v>

1938
01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:54.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the winter.</v>

1939
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:56.770
<v Speaker 1>So the entire house was filled and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got asthma all the time.</v>

1940
01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:59.530
<v Speaker 1>So I'll fucked up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just fuck.</v>

01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm using that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The light.</v>

1943
01:25:05.141 --> 01:25:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Another one party rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1945
01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Keith Richards did happen.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Love that.</v>

1947
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:20.200

01:25:27.071 --> 01:25:30.700
<v Speaker 1>He is stressed the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what it is.</v>

1951
01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:36.090
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered if it's stress or </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a lack of sleep or if it's.</v>

1952
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:39.940
<v Speaker 1>They showed them where the aliens live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's the latter.</v>

1953
01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:41.890
<v Speaker 1>That would be the best one or the third </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

1954
01:25:41.891 --> 01:25:45.910
<v Speaker 1>He knows too much about the alien agenda</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would keep you up at night.</v>

1955
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why he plays along with the </v>

1956
01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:51.480
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1957
01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:51.480
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1958
01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.751
<v Speaker 1>The earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want me to fucking know what's </v>

1959
01:25:54.751 --> 01:25:54.751
<v Speaker 1>behind the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>

1960
01:25:54.751 --> 01:25:55.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in all seriousness,</v>

1961
01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:59.410
<v Speaker 1>no one person should have a job that </v>
<v Speaker 1>does that to them.</v>

1962
01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:05.060
<v Speaker 1>I know a job that is everybody just in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy way.</v>

1963
01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:11.080
<v Speaker 1>That's a great lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president is a great lesson for </v>

1964
01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:11.080
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1965
01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Like don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't work that hard.</v>

1966
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what happens to the president when </v>

1967
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:21.491
<v Speaker 1>he works at heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to burn that thing </v>

1968
01:26:21.491 --> 01:26:21.491
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1969
01:26:21.491 --> 01:26:22.790
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's going for a second term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody goes.</v>

1970
01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Anybody quit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody ever get to four years ago?</v>

1971
01:26:25.851 --> 01:26:26.500
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

1972
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not recently.</v>

1973
01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Not In the last 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it ever happened?</v>

1974
01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say a president has never </v>

1975
01:26:35.290 --> 01:26:35.290
<v Speaker 1>quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1976
01:26:35.290 --> 01:26:35.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Nixon was impeached.</v>

1977
01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.980
<v Speaker 1>The president ever reside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think,</v>

1978
01:26:39.981 --> 01:26:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Brian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1979
01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I think Teddy Roosevelt did really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1980
01:26:44.610 --> 01:26:46.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a physical issue.</v>

1981
01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:51.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he didn't want to hog it and </v>

1982
01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:51.340
<v Speaker 1>then he was bummed that he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Nixon,</v>

1983
01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:56.291
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Nixon resigned from office and </v>

1984
01:26:56.901 --> 01:26:59.030
<v Speaker 1>all he did was spy on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1985
01:26:59.031 --> 01:27:00.790
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1986
01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he did and he did things that they </v>

1987
01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:05.870
<v Speaker 1>were already doing.</v>

1988
01:27:06.130 --> 01:27:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was spying on each other.</v>

1989
01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Everybody spies on each other back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the public wasn't ready for that </v>

1990
01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.140
<v Speaker 1>shit right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not My America.</v>

1991
01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of interesting,</v>

1992
01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:21.431
<v Speaker 1>but that's how like a lot of weirdness </v>
<v Speaker 1>went on with the CIA after the Nixon </v>

1993
01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:29.620
<v Speaker 1>administration got out of office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's when freedom of information </v>

1994
01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:33.230
<v Speaker 1>act was like all over the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big issues.</v>

1995
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:34.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's when they had this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1996
01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:39.050
<v Speaker 1>this nuclear submarine that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian nuclear submarine.</v>

1997
01:27:39.090 --> 01:27:41.900
<v Speaker 1>It's an issue of a or an episode of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Radio Lab,</v>

1998
01:27:41.901 --> 01:27:45.410
<v Speaker 1>which is one of my favorite podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the what,</v>

1999
01:27:45.411 --> 01:27:45.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2000
01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Glomar responses either Glo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mar.</v>

2001
01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:51.380
<v Speaker 1>It was a corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>global marine.</v>

2002
01:27:51.650 --> 01:27:56.150
<v Speaker 1>And they were responsIble for rescuing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this nuclear submarine.</v>

2003
01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:01.240
<v Speaker 1>They had a contract to pull this nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>submarine that the russians had lost </v>

2004
01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:01.880
<v Speaker 1>from the bottom of the ocean was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven mile thing,</v>

2005
01:28:02.690 --> 01:28:03.380
<v Speaker 1>crazy thing.</v>

2006
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:08.180
<v Speaker 1>And so when the news got leaked and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to respond to the press,</v>

2007
01:28:08.181 --> 01:28:12.080
<v Speaker 1>they were being asked whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had this nuclear submarine in their</v>

2008
01:28:12.081 --> 01:28:17.081
<v Speaker 1>possession and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew because of the freedom of </v>

2009
01:28:17.081 --> 01:28:19.040
<v Speaker 1>information act that they had to give a </v>
<v Speaker 1>response they had to answer.</v>

2010
01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:22.520
<v Speaker 1>So the response was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can neither confirm nor deny.</v>

2011
01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's become something that people </v>

2012
01:28:27.730 --> 01:28:29.591
<v Speaker 1>say constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can neither confirm nor deny that mr </v>

2013
01:28:29.591 --> 01:28:32.890
<v Speaker 1>sheen was in that whorehouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can neither confirm nor deny that mr </v>

2014
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:34.550
<v Speaker 1>brian was with this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2015
01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:38.280
<v Speaker 1>when they do stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called a glo mar response.</v>

2016
01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:43.780
<v Speaker 1>And then it all came out of this because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the nixon administration's fuckups </v>

2017
01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:46.310
<v Speaker 1>because everybody was like aghast at </v>
<v Speaker 1>watergate and they wanted to acute,</v>

2018
01:28:46.311 --> 01:28:48.230
<v Speaker 1>told us you didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lied.</v>

2019
01:28:48.231 --> 01:28:51.980
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get those layers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go after those liars.</v>

2020
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:54.660
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2021
01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:57.770
<v Speaker 1>that's where all that shit came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>until they got good at lying in.</v>

2022
01:28:58.690 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Now that now they got it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw</v>

2023
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:03.580
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2024
01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:06.900
<v Speaker 5>you've probably talked about jfk a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>on this podcast,</v>

2025
01:29:06.901 --> 01:29:07.590
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or not.</v>

2026
01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:08.280
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

2027
01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:11.460
<v Speaker 5>I just sAw this recent thing on cnn and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it was all about like,</v>

2028
01:29:11.461 --> 01:29:13.420
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oswald did it [inaudible].</v>

2029
01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:15.540
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always thought,</v>

2030
01:29:16.770 --> 01:29:20.220
<v Speaker 5>I always thought it was like this big </v>
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy and now we're back to oswald.</v>

2031
01:29:20.221 --> 01:29:20.520
<v Speaker 5>Did it.</v>

2032
01:29:20.890 --> 01:29:24.850
<v Speaker 1>The mainstream America version is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>oswald?</v>

2033
01:29:24.851 --> 01:29:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2034
01:29:25.661 --> 01:29:27.420
<v Speaker 1>if you want to listen to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2035
01:29:27.970 --> 01:29:30.790
<v Speaker 1>most of the mainstream experts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2036
01:29:30.791 --> 01:29:33.070
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are on television,</v>

2037
01:29:33.250 --> 01:29:34.960
<v Speaker 1>they say oswald did it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2038
01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he did a loan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it makes any sense.</v>

2039
01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those things that you </v>

2040
01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.421
<v Speaker 1>really don't know unless you were there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's enough information back and </v>

2041
01:29:45.421 --> 01:29:47.350
<v Speaker 1>forth on both sides where the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing gets incredibly sketchy.</v>

2042
01:29:47.610 --> 01:29:49.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just saw those old,</v>

2043
01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:54.650
<v Speaker 5>I guess their pbs documentaries from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>eighties a and those just seems.</v>

2044
01:29:56.490 --> 01:29:58.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just seemed like they had a lot of,</v>

2045
01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:03.700
<v Speaker 5>not evidence exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but other people's perspectives and we </v>

2046
01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:05.800
<v Speaker 5>saw other people dressed as cops and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there might've been,</v>

2047
01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:11.700
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they say about any experience when </v>

2048
01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:14.820
<v Speaker 1>something goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if some.</v>

2049
01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:18.670
<v Speaker 1>There was a crazy explosion right across</v>
<v Speaker 1>the street from us right now and you and</v>

2050
01:30:18.671 --> 01:30:23.671
<v Speaker 1>I just happened to be outside shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shit podcast is over and the </v>

2051
01:30:23.671 --> 01:30:23.830
<v Speaker 1>building across the street from us </v>
<v Speaker 1>explodes.</v>

2052
01:30:24.610 --> 01:30:28.090
<v Speaker 1>We might have two completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories as to what went down.</v>

2053
01:30:28.110 --> 01:30:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you compare those stories,</v>

2054
01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:32.950
<v Speaker 1>one of us might not have been paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

2055
01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:35.110
<v Speaker 1>One of us mighT have a problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

2056
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:37.990
<v Speaker 1>One of us might want to exaggerate when </v>
<v Speaker 1>a camera's there.</v>

2057
01:30:37.991 --> 01:30:41.260
<v Speaker 1>One of us might want to make it seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was a hero.</v>

2058
01:30:41.261 --> 01:30:46.261
<v Speaker 1>One of us might want to make it seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was way more terrifying that </v>

2059
01:30:46.261 --> 01:30:46.600
<v Speaker 1>he's actually been through something so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more horrifying.</v>

2060
01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.210
<v Speaker 1>One of us might be the guy was a secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

2061
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I saw a man run out of that car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I witnessed it in evidence,</v>

2062
01:30:54.010 --> 01:30:56.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eye witness accounts are terrible.</v>

2063
01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:00.790
<v Speaker 1>They're really unreliable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever talked to someone that you know</v>

2064
01:31:01.150 --> 01:31:06.150
<v Speaker 1>and you guys went through some weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit together and you go back and he </v>

2065
01:31:06.150 --> 01:31:06.580
<v Speaker 1>gives you a version of it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare it to your version.</v>

2066
01:31:06.581 --> 01:31:08.680
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of us is fucking crazy.</v>

2067
01:31:08.681 --> 01:31:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't.</v>

2068
01:31:09.851 --> 01:31:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember any of this shit you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

2069
01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens.</v>

2070
01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

2071
01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:20.010
<v Speaker 1>when you hear about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people said they saw cops and </v>

2072
01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:20.010
<v Speaker 1>people said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>

2073
01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I witnessed the cia give the thumbs up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the shooting started,</v>

2074
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:24.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there.</v>

2075
01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you were,</v>

2076
01:31:27.490 --> 01:31:29.680
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you're just making a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit up,</v>

2077
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:32.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Memories a terrible dude.</v>

2078
01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:34.030
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're awful.</v>

2079
01:31:34.210 --> 01:31:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the evidence,</v>

2080
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.810
<v Speaker 1>tough to shoot someone three times that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that accurately from a,</v>

2081
01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:43.210
<v Speaker 1>from a window with a rifle that has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty scope,</v>

2082
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:44.200
<v Speaker 1>but it is possible.</v>

2083
01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Everybody says not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

2084
01:31:46.930 --> 01:31:49.240
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is the impacts on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

2085
01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:52.030
<v Speaker 1>The magic bullet theory that went </v>
<v Speaker 1>through one body.</v>

2086
01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:54.610
<v Speaker 1>it's not magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're just confused about the.</v>

2087
01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:59.350
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's magic is the bullet hit bones,</v>

2088
01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:01.540
<v Speaker 1>shatteRed bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and came out looking like that.</v>

2089
01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.970
<v Speaker 1>That looks like a bullet that got shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a swimming pool.</v>

2090
01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:06.640
<v Speaker 1>And anybody who tells you any </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently is not being honest.</v>

2091
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:12.030
<v Speaker 1>That seems weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that the bone was </v>

2092
01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:13.330
<v Speaker 1>shattered by that bullet and it came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking like that?</v>

2093
01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:16.360
<v Speaker 1>It's very unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

2094
01:32:16.361 --> 01:32:18.310
<v Speaker 1>very unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be possible.</v>

2095
01:32:18.370 --> 01:32:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the freakiest of freaky </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

2096
01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:24.220
<v Speaker 1>But when bullets hit things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fuck up.</v>

2097
01:32:24.221 --> 01:32:26.020
<v Speaker 1>They twist up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bend.</v>

2098
01:32:26.210 --> 01:32:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Just what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2099
01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:33.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's stronger bullets than other </v>

2100
01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:33.360
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Full metal jacket,</v>

2101
01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:33.520
<v Speaker 1>bullets like that one a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>

2102
01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:38.850
<v Speaker 1>But you're talking about like a bullet </v>
<v Speaker 1>that left fragments and people's bodies </v>

2103
01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:42.541
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't as simple as the bullet got </v>

2104
01:32:42.541 --> 01:32:42.541
<v Speaker 1>through shattered bone cleanly and fell </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto that.</v>

2105
01:32:42.541 --> 01:32:44.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it left little pieces of metal pieces of</v>

2106
01:32:44.921 --> 01:32:47.320
<v Speaker 1>metal that aren't actually missing from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bowl that they found.</v>

2107
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2108
01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:50.310
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's screwy.</v>

2109
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the scrooge story and it's a story </v>

2110
01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:55.480
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted that guy dead.</v>

2111
01:32:55.690 --> 01:33:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wanted that guy dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of people that wanted </v>

2112
01:33:00.690 --> 01:33:00.690
<v Speaker 1>that guy dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a.</v>

2113
01:33:00.690 --> 01:33:03.460
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't hard to imagine someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>plotted to murder him.</v>

2114
01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems pretty likely that someone </v>

2115
01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.760
<v Speaker 1>wanted to murder him and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's likely that oswald wanted to do it.</v>

2116
01:33:09.970 --> 01:33:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2117
01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:13.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it's way more likely that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these incredibly powerful groups that</v>

2118
01:33:13.991 --> 01:33:16.360
<v Speaker 1>would profit off of him being dead would</v>
<v Speaker 1>want him dead.</v>

2119
01:33:17.070 --> 01:33:20.230
<v Speaker 1>And I think back then in 1969,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

2120
01:33:20.231 --> 01:33:23.110
<v Speaker 1>63 is it were you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't at accountable,</v>

2121
01:33:23.111 --> 01:33:24.490
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get away with shit.</v>

2122
01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also think that people like to tie</v>

2123
01:33:27.311 --> 01:33:29.950
<v Speaker 1>up history with a nice neat little bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2124
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:33.160
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget all your conspiracy shenanigans.</v>

2125
01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Oswaldo acted alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird news program.</v>

2126
01:33:38.501 --> 01:33:40.990
<v Speaker 1>It was on cnn and it was very much like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very much like,</v>

2127
01:33:41.050 --> 01:33:42.100
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2128
01:33:42.170 --> 01:33:45.010
<v Speaker 1>it was a as well where like two hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>

2129
01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:48.400
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see someone who knows a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot about the case,</v>

2130
01:33:48.401 --> 01:33:49.450
<v Speaker 1>debate them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not me,</v>

2131
01:33:49.451 --> 01:33:51.520
<v Speaker 1>but someone who actually knows a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the case,</v>

2132
01:33:51.521 --> 01:33:53.050
<v Speaker 1>debate them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2133
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:56.110
<v Speaker 1>my take is that it's not an either or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2134
01:33:56.111 --> 01:33:58.840
<v Speaker 1>when everyone oswald did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oswaldo did that.</v>

2135
01:33:58.841 --> 01:34:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Oswald did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or oswald was a part of it.</v>

2136
01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:04.510
<v Speaker 1>That's possible as well.</v>

2137
01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:06.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's one thing that people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>considering.</v>

2138
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:11.200
<v Speaker 1>The idea that oswald got killed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew too much.</v>

2139
01:34:11.201 --> 01:34:12.580
<v Speaker 1>He was going to expose it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2140
01:34:12.650 --> 01:34:14.620
<v Speaker 1>it could have been the he got killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>because look,</v>

2141
01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:19.860
<v Speaker 1>they arrested him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we kill him then they're not even </v>

2142
01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:19.860
<v Speaker 1>going to know about all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooters,</v>

2143
01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:24.781
<v Speaker 1>but if they hold that guy and start </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrogating him and he starts telling </v>

2144
01:34:24.781 --> 01:34:26.380
<v Speaker 1>about the entire plan and then someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets in trouble.</v>

2145
01:34:26.381 --> 01:34:31.381
<v Speaker 1>So what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They murder him in front of a bunch of </v>

2146
01:34:31.381 --> 01:34:31.381
<v Speaker 1>cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2147
01:34:31.381 --> 01:34:31.500
<v Speaker 1>They had a guy with mob ties do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2148
01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole,</v>

2149
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:38.110
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing stinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anybody who pretends it doesn't </v>

2150
01:34:38.110 --> 01:34:41.701
<v Speaker 1>stink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just trying to put like a neat </v>

2151
01:34:41.701 --> 01:34:42.880
<v Speaker 1>little bow on it and be the guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a your unknown nonsense guy.</v>

2152
01:34:42.881 --> 01:34:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I know that I'm a no nonsense guy.</v>

2153
01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both know kevin has walled,</v>

2154
01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:49.990
<v Speaker 1>acted alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come end of story.</v>

2155
01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Am I right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus is fucking hippies.</v>

2156
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:54.760
<v Speaker 1>They want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll believe anything.</v>

2157
01:34:55.330 --> 01:34:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Lee harvey oswald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2158
01:34:58.941 --> 01:35:01.690
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know that that's a.</v>

2159
01:35:02.710 --> 01:35:04.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy thing that they can kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>the president.</v>

2160
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:06.860
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they did get away with it,</v>

2161
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:12.490
<v Speaker 1>if there is a group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the cia or the fbi or the </v>

2162
01:35:12.490 --> 01:35:15.080
<v Speaker 1>fucking mob or whoever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone did get away with killing the</v>

2163
01:35:15.081 --> 01:35:16.640
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's incredible.</v>

2164
01:35:17.210 --> 01:35:19.850
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2165
01:35:20.210 --> 01:35:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can't keep secrets.</v>

2166
01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:25.970
<v Speaker 1>That's proven fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

2167
01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:31.180
<v Speaker 1>That's the number one reason why you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should think that because people can't </v>

2168
01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:31.250
<v Speaker 1>keep secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will always kept sacred.</v>

2169
01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:33.530
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd be able to keep a secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would put me in jail.</v>

2170
01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.360
<v Speaker 1>People are pretty good at keeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>secrets.</v>

2171
01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who says that people are bad at </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping secrets just is not taking into </v>

2172
01:35:40.450 --> 01:35:42.950
<v Speaker 1>account how many fucking secrets there </v>
<v Speaker 1>really are that they don't know about.</v>

2173
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:45.350
<v Speaker 1>What you're seeing is the shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>secrets.</v>

2174
01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:50.560
<v Speaker 1>You know when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see someone get busted for </v>

2175
01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.050
<v Speaker 1>something where were seen as a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weak,</v>

2176
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:55.910
<v Speaker 1>weak john bitches flapping off at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gums and ruin in there.</v>

2177
01:35:55.911 --> 01:35:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Perfect situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2178
01:35:57.441 --> 01:35:58.490
<v Speaker 1>that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're saying.</v>

2179
01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:01.230
<v Speaker 1>But another group might be able to dress</v>
<v Speaker 1>up like an hour.</v>

2180
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:06.250
<v Speaker 1>God sacrifice a hooker light on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back to work at the mall and give </v>

2181
01:36:06.250 --> 01:36:11.051
<v Speaker 1>each other the little owl sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking make their way to the bathroom </v>

2182
01:36:11.051 --> 01:36:12.110
<v Speaker 1>passing away and he might keep that day </v>
<v Speaker 1>they die.</v>

2183
01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be fun for them like being a </v>

2184
01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:17.400
<v Speaker 1>mason or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2185
01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Fight club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2186
01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:21.280
<v Speaker 1>jihadist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely something too.</v>

2187
01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:23.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a radical life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2188
01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.930
<v Speaker 1>giving sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're doing it for a law about that</v>

2189
01:36:26.931 --> 01:36:28.190
<v Speaker 1>blown up bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2190
01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Making it real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keeping chicks from driving,</v>

2191
01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:33.670
<v Speaker 3>keeping chicks from being seen.</v>

2192
01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cover up,</v>

2193
01:36:34.981 --> 01:36:36.940
<v Speaker 1>cover up and no driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don,</v>

2194
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:42.210
<v Speaker 1>my religion says so my religions as so</v>

2195
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:48.030
<v Speaker 3>I sat next to two women on a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've took a greyhound bus for the first </v>

2196
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:48.400
<v Speaker 3>time over my midwest animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why'd you do that?</v>

2197
01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:51.910
<v Speaker 3>Because the budget was dwindling and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>needed to get back to cleveland.</v>

2198
01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:56.530
<v Speaker 3>That's real and so I took the greyhound </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sitting next to me were two women in</v>

2199
01:36:56.531 --> 01:37:01.531
<v Speaker 3>burkas and it was hot and it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>smell good.</v>

2200
01:37:03.730 --> 01:37:04.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was hot out.</v>

2201
01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:07.210
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't sexy.</v>

2202
01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:11.350
<v Speaker 3>It was sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a little bit of sexiness to it,</v>

2203
01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:13.090
<v Speaker 3>but there's something to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2204
01:37:13.091 --> 01:37:14.420
<v Speaker 3>let's make a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

2205
01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.300
<v Speaker 3>what's going on under that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be great.</v>

2206
01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:23.800
<v Speaker 3>It would be great if they were hot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were just into doing it because </v>

2207
01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:23.950
<v Speaker 3>they only one in the show themselves for</v>
<v Speaker 3>their man.</v>

2208
01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:25.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was their idea,</v>

2209
01:37:25.570 --> 01:37:26.750
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be kinda cool.</v>

2210
01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be kind of wild.</v>

2211
01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:31.090
<v Speaker 3>If you dated a chick and she just </v>
<v Speaker 3>started showing up.</v>

2212
01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:34.660

<v Speaker 3>I don't want anybody to see me,</v>

2214

<v Speaker 3>but you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

2215
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:40.420
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty hot.</v>

2217
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:48.390
<v Speaker 3>That's an intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's also a chick who will burn </v>

2218
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:49.690
<v Speaker 3>your fucking hold town down in hopes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing you when you break up with her.</v>

2219
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:55.310
<v Speaker 3>she loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'll fucking set a gas leak in your </v>

2220
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:58.950
<v Speaker 3>town slowly in the middle of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should plan it out in advance.</v>

2221
01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:01.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounds like a crazy bitch.</v>

2222
01:38:01.351 --> 01:38:04.410
<v Speaker 3>But whoever the guy was at first </v>
<v Speaker 3>invented the burka.</v>

2223
01:38:04.590 --> 01:38:06.710
<v Speaker 3>What a hater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve burke.</v>

2224
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:08.850
<v Speaker 3>What a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guys are cock blocker.</v>

2225
01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy is the worst pimp hand ever.</v>

2226
01:38:12.710 --> 01:38:14.760
<v Speaker 3>Pimp pants a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has to cover his chicks up.</v>

2227
01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:18.210
<v Speaker 3>Come on up so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at like this.</v>

2228
01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:19.530
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else.</v>

2229
01:38:19.531 --> 01:38:21.990
<v Speaker 3>Cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So heartbreaking.</v>

2230
01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.930
<v Speaker 3>What's a big part of the world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2231
01:38:24.931 --> 01:38:28.740
<v Speaker 3>it's not like 20 people are doing it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to get rid of the psychology.</v>

2232
01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:29.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible,</v>

2233
01:38:29.941 --> 01:38:30.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2234
01:38:30.841 --> 01:38:32.220
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You want to rescue those chicks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does bum me out,</v>

2236
01:38:34.081 --> 01:38:36.150
<v Speaker 3>but I think they're past the point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being rescued.</v>

2237
01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never know they might want to put the </v>

2238
01:38:41.210 --> 01:38:41.210
<v Speaker 3>effort in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I could do it like that,</v>

2239
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:44.130
<v Speaker 3>then I mean it kinda just bums me out.</v>

2240
01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:45.960
<v Speaker 3>If you could take them to the amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2241
01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:51.260
<v Speaker 3>Show them the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taken for a ride and then immediately </v>

2242
01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:54.570
<v Speaker 3>bring them back and sort of reinvigorate</v>
<v Speaker 3>them back into society.</v>

2245
01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.670
<v Speaker 3>If it took like maybe a week or two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to dedicate my life.</v>

2246
01:38:59.671 --> 01:39:01.350
<v Speaker 3>You should offer that as a service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should.</v>

2247
01:39:01.530 --> 01:39:03.120
<v Speaker 3>The full charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you call it.</v>

2248
01:39:03.330 --> 01:39:05.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcaster and burqa.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is it ready for a peruse stamp chunk?</v>

2254
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Now you're naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2255
01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:22.520
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know you're partying with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the full charge.</v>

2256
01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:26.550
<v Speaker 3>They'd probably never drank before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what to do with that shit?</v>

2257
01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:29.340
<v Speaker 3>We traveled by grey hounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2258
01:39:29.341 --> 01:39:34.341
<v Speaker 3>That would be rude to try to get someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk for the first time once you've </v>

2259
01:39:34.341 --> 01:39:34.341
<v Speaker 3>liberated them for their burqa.</v>

2260
01:39:34.341 --> 01:39:35.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2261
01:39:35.670 --> 01:39:38.220
<v Speaker 3>You don't have that kind of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just drink,</v>

2262
01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:43.780
<v Speaker 3>drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and party when you've been wearing a </v>

2263
01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:43.780
<v Speaker 3>burka your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2264
01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:45.270
<v Speaker 3>Reading off some ancient texts can't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2265
01:39:45.690 --> 01:39:47.940
<v Speaker 3>how long has it been around?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had to guess?</v>

2266
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:53.030
<v Speaker 3>if I had to guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's been around for fuck </v>

2267
01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:56.790
<v Speaker 3>over 2000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I really don't know.</v>

2268
01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:57.590
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna.</v>

2269
01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say I'm going to say you're</v>

2270
01:39:59.521 --> 01:40:02.130
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As the burka.</v>

2271
01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:05.820
<v Speaker 3>After a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before gbc.</v>

2272
01:40:05.821 --> 01:40:07.740
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my history in bc is very fuzzy.</v>

2273
01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:09.750
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>

2274
01:40:09.751 --> 01:40:14.751
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a diy kind of guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Face veiling portion is usually a </v>

2275
01:40:15.691 --> 01:40:20.691
<v Speaker 3>rectangular piece of semi-transparent </v>
<v Speaker 3>cloth with this top edge attached to a </v>

2276
01:40:20.691 --> 01:40:24.030
<v Speaker 3>portion of the headscarf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2277
01:40:24.031 --> 01:40:29.031
<v Speaker 3>When did it come from islamic texts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The quran has no requirement that women </v>

2278
01:40:31.021 --> 01:40:35.790
<v Speaker 3>covered their faces with a veil or cover</v>
<v Speaker 3>their bodies with the full body berko.</v>

2279
01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.910
<v Speaker 3>That's near my burka,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the full body burchell buddy.</v>

2280
01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:43.590
<v Speaker 3>It's called a chador.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not in the koran.</v>

2281
01:40:43.770 --> 01:40:48.770
<v Speaker 3>Many muslims believe that the collective</v>
<v Speaker 3>traditions of the life of mohammed or </v>

2282
01:40:48.770 --> 01:40:53.360
<v Speaker 3>hadith required both men and women to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dress and behave in public.</v>

2283
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:56.440
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thiS requirement has been interpreted in</v>

2284
01:40:56.441 --> 01:41:00.160
<v Speaker 1>many different ways by islamic scholars </v>
<v Speaker 1>and muslim communities.</v>

2285
01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Some interpretation say that avail is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a compulsory is not compulsory or </v>

2286
01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:07.870
<v Speaker 1>that it's not compulsory in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind men,</v>

2287
01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:13.080
<v Speaker 1>a sexual men or gay men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but gay men are allowed to either a </v>

2288
01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:13.210
<v Speaker 1>bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2289
01:41:13.211 --> 01:41:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to get rid of them,</v>

2290
01:41:14.321 --> 01:41:16.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to hit them with rocks.</v>

2291
01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>say what you want about America.</v>

2292
01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2293
01:41:22.570 --> 01:41:24.760
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is when we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about before,</v>

2294
01:41:25.150 --> 01:41:27.940
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these areas they've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been lIving like this for a long</v>

2295
01:41:27.941 --> 01:41:28.900
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2296
01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:30.430
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get out of that.</v>

01:41:30.670 --> 01:41:34.210
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to snap that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop that culture dead in his tracks and</v>

<v Speaker 1>no one's there to help you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>did this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd love the ancient texts.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that was forgotten.</v>

2352
01:44:27.110 --> 01:44:29.870
<v Speaker 3>The ancient scholars knew all about </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2353
01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:35.080
<v Speaker 3>The origins of the universe.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know who did that.</v>

2505

<v Speaker 3>Keep women out of comedy.</v>

2513
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:20.470

2526
01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Xannies in nashville is another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another classic spot,</v>

2527
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:47.900
<v Speaker 3>but on the back room of the atlanta </v>

<v Speaker 3>like I went to,</v>

2533
01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:06.250
<v Speaker 3>like to open mics and somebody actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>handed me a tape with bill hicks on it.</v>

2534
01:52:06.850 --> 01:52:09.670
<v Speaker 3>It was woody allen and bill hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2535
01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:11.890
<v Speaker 3>once I was bill hicks side was woody </v>

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2537
01:52:13.710 --> 01:52:17.500
<v Speaker 3>I definitely like bill hicks better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listened to this thing at the time and</v>

2538
01:52:17.590 --> 01:52:20.780
<v Speaker 3>probably still do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure does.</v>

2539
01:52:20.970 --> 01:52:24.850
<v Speaker 3>Do you take off any points because woody</v>
<v Speaker 3>allen's a perv no,</v>

2540
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:27.730
<v Speaker 3>not for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume it wasn't that much prefer back</v>

2541
01:52:27.731 --> 01:52:29.680
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't actually bother me.</v>

2542
01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Not as much as a woman in a burka.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does bother me,</v>

2543
01:52:33.821 --> 01:52:35.620
<v Speaker 3>but I still kinda like to watch his </v>
<v Speaker 3>movies.</v>

2544
01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:37.420
<v Speaker 3>A good movie maker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2545
01:52:37.421 --> 01:52:38.470
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

2546
01:52:39.250 --> 01:52:41.590
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's kinda fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2547
01:52:41.650 --> 01:52:42.910
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2548
01:52:42.911 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 3>there's a picture of him at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball game when</v>

2549
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:51.070
<v Speaker 1>his daughter was young and she sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>on his lap and she's really little and </v>

2550
01:52:51.070 --> 01:52:54.761
<v Speaker 1>then there's a picture of him at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball game many years later and </v>

2551
01:52:54.761 --> 01:52:56.930
<v Speaker 1>they're holding hands as a couple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so weird and it's just,</v>

2552
01:52:56.931 --> 01:52:59.090
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's okay at all.</v>

2553
01:52:59.091 --> 01:53:00.890
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's deep that,</v>

2554
01:53:00.910 --> 01:53:04.100
<v Speaker 1>that is a completely different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that's deep.</v>

2555
01:53:04.101 --> 01:53:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were there when that thing,</v>

2556
01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:08.900
<v Speaker 1>that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person was a baby,</v>

2557
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:11.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a little child,</v>

2558
01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know?</v>

2559
01:53:13.161 --> 01:53:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I dunno,</v>

2560
01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:16.490
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I choose not to speculate.</v>

2561
01:53:16.730 --> 01:53:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched a,</v>

2562
01:53:17.641 --> 01:53:19.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not callous about it.</v>

2563
01:53:19.751 --> 01:53:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2564
01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:22.880
<v Speaker 1>obviously I denounce it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say that it's gross,</v>

2565
01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:25.490
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any of the particulars.</v>

2566
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I barely paid attention to that whole </v>

2567
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.790
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't like to.</v>

2568
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I see people in those sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying situations,</v>

2569
01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:39.880
<v Speaker 1>the man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the women's splitting up the man going </v>

2570
01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:40.880
<v Speaker 1>after the girl's daughter and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>together now and like,</v>

2571
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:44.480
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fucking crazy pain.</v>

2572
01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:47.210
<v Speaker 1>But I was listening to a thing of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

2573
01:53:47.211 --> 01:53:52.211
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it was an interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was woody allen's comedy </v>

2574
01:53:52.211 --> 01:53:52.520
<v Speaker 1>and I downloaded it and it Was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2575
01:53:52.610 --> 01:53:57.610
<v Speaker 1>it was woody allen talking about standup</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was him talking about all of the,</v>

2576
01:53:59.601 --> 01:54:04.601
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different kinds of a joke writers </v>

2577
01:54:04.601 --> 01:54:06.320
<v Speaker 1>and different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a long ass fucking time ago.</v>

2578
01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:08.810
<v Speaker 1>And it was really kind of interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2579
01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:09.930
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2580
01:54:10.130 --> 01:54:12.380
<v Speaker 1>it was really interesting to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him from like,</v>

2581
01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:13.280
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2582
01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:18.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say it was probably like the 19 </v>

2583
01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:18.580
<v Speaker 1>fifties or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's talking about comedy.</v>

2584
01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:20.390
<v Speaker 1>If I had to guess by the references that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was using,</v>

2585
01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:25.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's talking about standup and he's </v>

2586
01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:25.780
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2587
01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:26.930
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the shit that he was saying</v>

2588
01:54:26.931 --> 01:54:29.510
<v Speaker 1>back then still holds true today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2589
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:36.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he was part of that like kinda </v>

2590
01:54:36.990 --> 01:54:38.551
<v Speaker 5>hipster original alt room comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they just used to do it at </v>

2591
01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:43.740
<v Speaker 5>makeshift places in the village and not </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessarily clubs or comedy clubs are </v>

2592
01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:44.470
<v Speaker 5>strip clubs or however,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever it was.</v>

2593
01:54:44.471 --> 01:54:45.750
<v Speaker 5>Trisha traditional back then.</v>

2594
01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that wild?</v>

2595
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they would do it.</v>

2596
01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:53.940
<v Speaker 1>They would do it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they would open for people to like </v>

2597
01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:53.940
<v Speaker 1>for bands and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would do stand up.</v>

2598
01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:58.930
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they just do it in coffee shops and </v>

2599
01:54:58.930 --> 01:54:58.930
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really weird because the con,</v>

2600
01:54:58.930 --> 01:55:01.760
<v Speaker 5>the standup comedy that we know today </v>
<v Speaker 5>really started in the seventies,</v>

2601
01:55:01.761 --> 01:55:03.650
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2602
01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:06.100
<v Speaker 5>maybe the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sixties.</v>

2603
01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:08.150
<v Speaker 5>Well it was lenny bruce really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>RigHt.</v>

2604
01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first seed.</v>

2605
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a bunch of other guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2606
01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:18.360
<v Speaker 1>There was sort of in that vein at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time that were coming along with him </v>

2607
01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:19.650
<v Speaker 1>back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he Was the original.</v>

2608
01:55:19.710 --> 01:55:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2609
01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:24.270
<v Speaker 5>And there's even like old rodney </v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerfield where he tries to do like a,</v>

2610
01:55:24.271 --> 01:55:27.230
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lenny bruce style where like,</v>

2611

<v Speaker 5>it's a big long story and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>liners.</v>

2613
01:55:32.530 --> 01:55:37.530

2614
01:55:37.530 --> 01:55:38.610
<v Speaker 5>jokes about like getting his car fixed </v>
<v Speaker 5>and riding in an airplane in</v>

2615
01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 1>a woody allen on comedy is the name of</v>

2618
01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:55.280
<v Speaker 3>10 different short little clips that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have broken up into segments on a </v>

2619
01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:56.520
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different topics.</v>

2620
01:55:56.670 --> 01:55:57.540
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

2621
01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:02.960
<v Speaker 3>Really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've alWays been fascinated by the </v>

2622
01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:02.960
<v Speaker 3>writing style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2623
01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:07.670
<v Speaker 3>everybody's got their own sort of style </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm also fascinated by how few </v>

2624
01:56:07.670 --> 01:56:07.670
<v Speaker 3>people actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2625
01:56:07.670 --> 01:56:12.160
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you find out that there's a lot of </v>

2626
01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:12.890
<v Speaker 3>comics that don't actually sit down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>write a whole essay.</v>

2627
01:56:12.891 --> 01:56:17.891
<v Speaker 3>You can't fake it for an hour body to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sit down with some coffee and scribble </v>

2628
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:23.510
<v Speaker 3>lazy pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have the opportunity to be a </v>

2629
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:26.721
<v Speaker 3>professional comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've actually figured out a way to </v>

2630
01:56:26.721 --> 01:56:27.330
<v Speaker 3>make it through that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not even writing anything down.</v>

2631
01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:28.960
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2632
01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:34.040
<v Speaker 3>silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because even if you write all the time </v>

2633
01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:34.040
<v Speaker 3>and you record a lot of your thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff,</v>

2634
01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:38.210
<v Speaker 3>there's still so few,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so little amount of material that makes </v>

2635
01:56:38.210 --> 01:56:38.210
<v Speaker 3>it to the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2636
01:56:38.210 --> 01:56:40.710
<v Speaker 3>So like if you're doing nothing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing's happening,</v>

2637

2645
01:57:03.570 --> 01:57:08.570
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's an awesome growth </v>
<v Speaker 3>process to do it the way he does it or </v>

2646
01:57:08.570 --> 01:57:10.350

2650
01:57:17.041 --> 01:57:18.510

01:57:18.511 --> 01:57:19.530
<v Speaker 3>play the hits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

2652
01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:24.560
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a difference between comedy and </v>

2653
01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:24.560
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I forget where I heard that,</v>

2658
01:57:30.091 --> 01:57:32.670
<v Speaker 3>but I believe different times though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a different era.</v>

2659

<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever see rodney live?</v>

<v Speaker 3>which is weird.</v>

2671
01:57:59.701 --> 01:58:04.701
<v Speaker 3>like what 11 year olds are going to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>movies about 60 year olds now and </v>

2672
01:58:04.701 --> 01:58:05.850

2674
01:58:08.130 --> 01:58:10.860
<v Speaker 3>but he was also something someone that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody loved.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You look at their neck.</v>

2773
02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.960
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at a still image just for</v>
<v Speaker 1>neck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's nothing.</v>

2775
02:02:06.261 --> 02:02:08.300
<v Speaker 1>You're saying nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making noise with your face.</v>

2776

02:02:09.951 --> 02:02:14.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing going on with what </v>

2778
02:02:14.951 --> 02:02:14.951
<v Speaker 1>you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just fixating on next.</v>

2779
02:02:14.951 --> 02:02:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a lot worse.</v>

2780
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Speaking in next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a video that I tweeted today.</v>

2781
02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:25.360
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's some climate change denier lady and</v>

2782
02:02:25.941 --> 02:02:26.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2783
02:02:26.691 --> 02:02:28.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got a weird neck.</v>

2784
02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Look at the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the picture on my twitter and </v>

2785
02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:37.301
<v Speaker 1>you'll see what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the one of the dumbest Climate </v>

2786
02:02:37.301 --> 02:02:39.320
<v Speaker 1>chaNge deNial videos I've ever seen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

2787
02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:41.570
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what this is,</v>

2788
02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:46.840
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of like I'm down home </v>
<v Speaker 1>country type people to want to tell you.</v>

2789
02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Climate change is a myth as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is her.</v>

2790
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

2791
02:02:52.681 --> 02:02:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Compare her neck to christie brinkley's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nag.</v>

2792
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:56.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll take christie brinkley's nap all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

2793
02:02:56.571 --> 02:03:00.140
<v Speaker 1>but play the play the video because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite hilarious.</v>

2794
02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:03.660
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

2795
02:03:03.661 --> 02:03:05.810
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to believe that there's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people like that,</v>

2796
02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:09.320
<v Speaker 1>but she's going on about cold climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

2797
02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Kalama change is a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you so upset in my announcements</v>

2798
02:03:14.110 --> 02:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>for congress here in Louisiana?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Progress.</v>

2799
02:03:16.421 --> 02:03:16.590
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

2800
02:03:16.610 --> 02:03:21.270
<v Speaker 8>something very provocative.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I said that global warming is a hoax.</v>

2801
02:03:21.570 --> 02:03:26.570
<v Speaker 8>Naturally liberals in the lame stream </v>
<v Speaker 8>media became unglued and attacked me in </v>

2802
02:03:26.621 --> 02:03:29.890
<v Speaker 8>media,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's geOrge orwell wrote,</v>

2803
02:03:30.150 --> 02:03:35.150
<v Speaker 8>and that's why I'm of universal deceit </v>
<v Speaker 8>telling the truth is a revolutionary </v>

2804
02:03:35.150 --> 02:03:37.920
<v Speaker 8>act.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A specter is haunting America.</v>

2805
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:41.190
<v Speaker 8>It is perhaps the greatest introduction </v>
<v Speaker 8>into the history.</v>

2806
02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:47.900
<v Speaker 8>It has been almost 10 years since failed</v>
<v Speaker 8>presidential candidate al gore put out </v>

2807
02:03:47.941 --> 02:03:50.760
<v Speaker 8>his propaganda film the inconvenient </v>
<v Speaker 8>truth,</v>

2808
02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:56.120
<v Speaker 8>proclaiming that the actions of </v>
<v Speaker 8>america's energy industry are causing a </v>

2809
02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:58.440
<v Speaker 8>catastrophic rise in the earth's </v>
<v Speaker 8>temperature,</v>

2810
02:03:59.310 --> 02:04:04.060
<v Speaker 8>quite inconveniently for al gore and for</v>
<v Speaker 8>the rest of the politicians who continue</v>

2811
02:04:04.061 --> 02:04:09.061
<v Speaker 8>to advance this delusion.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Any 10 year old can invalidate their </v>

2812
02:04:09.061 --> 02:04:13.170
<v Speaker 8>thesis with one of the simplest </v>
<v Speaker 8>scientific devices known to me,</v>

2813
02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:18.980
<v Speaker 8>a thermometer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they get colder each year since the </v>

2814
02:04:20.041 --> 02:04:25.041
<v Speaker 8>film's release.</v>
<v Speaker 8>God certainly has a wonderful sense of </v>

2815
02:04:25.041 --> 02:04:29.601
<v Speaker 8>irony.</v>
<v Speaker 8>President obama knows it's getting </v>

2816
02:04:29.601 --> 02:04:32.991
<v Speaker 8>colder,</v>
<v Speaker 8>was blame our recent economic growth on </v>

2817
02:04:33.151 --> 02:04:37.230
<v Speaker 8>record freezing weather,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and then he turned around and launched a</v>

2818
02:04:37.231 --> 02:04:42.231
<v Speaker 8>new debate on global warming and the </v>
<v Speaker 8>obama administration down is up.</v>

2819
02:04:43.530 --> 02:04:47.400
<v Speaker 8>Two plus two equals five,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and ignorance is strength.</v>

2820
02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:52.530
<v Speaker 8>Last summer and article reached the </v>
<v Speaker 8>coldest temperature in recorded history.</v>

2821
02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:56.550
<v Speaker 8>There's record,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she eyes and a 60 percent rise of ice in</v>

2822
02:04:56.551 --> 02:04:57.340
<v Speaker 8>the arctic.</v>
<v Speaker 8>See,</v>

2823
02:04:57.900 --> 02:05:02.220
<v Speaker 8>polar bears have been forced out of </v>
<v Speaker 8>their habitat because of overpopulation.</v>

2824
02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:07.400
<v Speaker 8>Liberals for vas that global warming </v>
<v Speaker 8>would cause an increase in severe </v>

2825
02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:11.721
<v Speaker 8>weather systems such as hurricanes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and they blamed global warming every </v>

2826
02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:16.971
<v Speaker 8>time these dangerous storms take place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The experts agree over the last several </v>

2827
02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:19.800
<v Speaker 8>years.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Storms have decreased.</v>

2828
02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:22.800
<v Speaker 8>Perhaps the biggest clue that this is </v>
<v Speaker 8>one big scam.</v>

2829
02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:25.560
<v Speaker 8>We swept under the rug by the lapdog </v>
<v Speaker 8>medium.</v>

2830
02:05:26.010 --> 02:05:31.010
<v Speaker 8>A computer hacker obtained access to the</v>
<v Speaker 8>mail server at the climate research </v>

2831
02:05:31.010 --> 02:05:35.631
<v Speaker 8>center of east anglia in the uk and </v>
<v Speaker 8>downloaded over 1000 emails proving </v>

2832
02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:42.260
<v Speaker 8>without a shadow of a doubt that these </v>
<v Speaker 8>so called scientists had falsified data.</v>

2833
02:05:42.690 --> 02:05:47.490
<v Speaker 8>That conspiracy of global warming has </v>
<v Speaker 8>had a devastating effect on the american</v>

2834
02:05:47.491 --> 02:05:48.000
<v Speaker 8>dream.</v>

2835
02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:53.360
<v Speaker 8>The rise of modern society since the </v>
<v Speaker 8>first refinement of crude oil in 18,</v>

2836
02:05:53.731 --> 02:05:58.731
<v Speaker 8>47 is no coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 8>America's energy producers have fueled </v>

2837
02:05:58.731 --> 02:06:03.411
<v Speaker 8>the industrial revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which caused never before seen advances </v>

2838
02:06:03.411 --> 02:06:06.360
<v Speaker 8>in living standards for the masses of </v>
<v Speaker 8>ordinary people.</v>

2839
02:06:06.810 --> 02:06:11.670
<v Speaker 8>It was the burning of oil that energized</v>
<v Speaker 8>the foundation of a real middle class.</v>

2840
02:06:11.671 --> 02:06:16.671
<v Speaker 8>In the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 8>giving them access to new luxuries such </v>

2841
02:06:16.671 --> 02:06:19.560
<v Speaker 8>as electric lights,</v>
<v Speaker 8>refrigeration and automobiles,</v>

2842
02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:24.060
<v Speaker 8>it was free market capitalism that </v>
<v Speaker 8>created the wealthiest society the earth</v>

2843
02:06:24.061 --> 02:06:29.061
<v Speaker 8>had ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but now both capitalism and our energy </v>

2844
02:06:29.061 --> 02:06:32.510
<v Speaker 8>industry are under attack and the hopes </v>
<v Speaker 8>of global for dad.</v>

2845
02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:39.880
<v Speaker 3>It's exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck you imagine if you had </v>

2846
02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:41.520
<v Speaker 3>that check over for a dinner party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just keeps.</v>

2847
02:06:41.521 --> 02:06:46.260
<v Speaker 3>She started hitting you with that garden</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's reading off fucking cute cards</v>

2848
02:06:46.290 --> 02:06:47.600
<v Speaker 3>because that did not sound like her </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

2849
02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:48.660
<v Speaker 3>She was reading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2850
02:06:48.661 --> 02:06:50.820
<v Speaker 3>it might've been her ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was definitely reading something</v>

2851
02:06:50.821 --> 02:06:52.800
<v Speaker 3>that was written out in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do notice,</v>

2852
02:06:52.801 --> 02:06:56.070
<v Speaker 3>and this is like total nitpicking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're quoting this movie.</v>

2853
02:06:56.071 --> 02:06:59.160
<v Speaker 3>They're shitting on this movie an </v>
<v Speaker 3>inconvenient truth.</v>

2854
02:06:59.180 --> 02:07:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got the title wrong.</v>

2855
02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:03.450
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said the inconvenient truth,</v>

2856
02:07:03.451 --> 02:07:05.730
<v Speaker 3>and I know I'm nitpicking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like if that's your main argument,</v>

2857
02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:08.370
<v Speaker 3>like you'd still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird that they're not going,</v>

2858
02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:09.900
<v Speaker 3>they're not looking it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2859
02:07:09.901 --> 02:07:11.100
<v Speaker 3>I have a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

2860
02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:12.660
<v Speaker 3>I think she's dumb as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2861
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:18.350
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the best fuck but not </v>

2862
02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:18.350
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2863
02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:19.050
<v Speaker 3>That was the best take they got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fuck it.</v>

2864
02:07:19.051 --> 02:07:20.970
<v Speaker 3>It's the inconvenient truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dumb as fuck.</v>

2865
02:07:20.971 --> 02:07:21.750
<v Speaker 3>But not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not uh,</v>

2867
02:07:22.411 --> 02:07:24.270
<v Speaker 3>not available,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not aware.</v>

2868
02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:25.680
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's dumb as fuck.</v>

2869
02:07:25.710 --> 02:07:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like probably thinks she's pretty smart.</v>

2870
02:07:27.570 --> 02:07:30.750
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God has a wonderful sense of humor.</v>

2871
02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Like a thermometer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like women.</v>

2872
02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Obama was stressed out about the cold.</v>

2873
02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very stressed out.</v>

2874
02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:44.820
<v Speaker 1>He gets dressed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting cold every year and he </v>

2875
02:07:44.820 --> 02:07:44.820
<v Speaker 1>knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2876
02:07:44.820 --> 02:07:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Picture of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama knows it.</v>

2877
02:07:44.820 --> 02:07:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2878
02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:46.570
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love how they,</v>

2879
02:07:46.571 --> 02:07:50.050
<v Speaker 1>like they throw back to 100 years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>

2880
02:07:50.051 --> 02:07:51.760
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this worked 100 years ago.</v>

2881
02:07:51.761 --> 02:07:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem?</v>

2882
02:07:52.750 --> 02:07:57.750
<v Speaker 1>The reason why ordinary people it raised</v>
<v Speaker 1>the life standard for ordinary people.</v>

2883
02:07:58.930 --> 02:08:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Ordinary people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's an ordinary?</v>

2884
02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:03.490
<v Speaker 1>What's an ordinary person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ordinary.</v>

2885
02:08:04.290 --> 02:08:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Like she's like making a plea towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ordinary.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plead,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like me.</v>

2888
02:08:10.870 --> 02:08:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Mediocre small minded people with shitty</v>
<v Speaker 1>synopses like myself.</v>

<v Speaker 1>she's pro industry.</v>

2892

<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not understand what that means.</v>

2893
02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:37.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what gives people jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Full charge keeps America strong.</v>

2894
02:08:37.811 --> 02:08:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is a bunch.</v>

2895
02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a bunch of great things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about America.</v>

2896
02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:45.460
<v Speaker 1>America is pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No burgers,</v>

2897
02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:51.240
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of dumb shit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America that likes to call itself </v>

2898
02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:51.940
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2899
02:08:52.090 --> 02:08:53.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>american values,</v>

2900
02:08:54.070 --> 02:08:59.070
<v Speaker 1>american standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the free and it's people that have that </v>

2901
02:08:59.070 --> 02:09:03.571
<v Speaker 1>sort of this kind of mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sorta just low voltage sludgy </v>

2902
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:09.160
<v Speaker 1>sludgy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sloppy thinking.</v>

2903
02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's hot enough that she'll probably </v>

2904
02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:15.760
<v Speaker 1>get in just based on looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pro chicks are highs.</v>

2905
02:09:15.761 --> 02:09:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Louisiana dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's great.</v>

2906
02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Women are hot as fuck down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chief got no chance with the.</v>

2907
02:09:21.410 --> 02:09:23.290
<v Speaker 1>If a hot one runs against her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2908
02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all she has to do is show up at </v>

2909
02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:28.340
<v Speaker 1>like farmer's markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to people.</v>

2910
02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:31.960
<v Speaker 1>She's in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on hotness alone.</v>

2911
02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:34.150
<v Speaker 1>So what about what she's saying though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where she's like,</v>

2912
02:09:34.650 --> 02:09:36.580
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is colder this year and there are.</v>

2913
02:09:36.581 --> 02:09:38.860
<v Speaker 1>There is more ice in antarctica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

2914
02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell him no.</v>

2915
02:09:39.881 --> 02:09:42.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like everyone is global warming </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

2916
02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody believes it's real.</v>

2917
02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone kind of brings their own facts.</v>

2918
02:09:47.171 --> 02:09:52.171
<v Speaker 1>The only arguments that I've heard at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that make any sense whatsoever is </v>

2919
02:09:52.171 --> 02:09:56.791
<v Speaker 1>that human addition to global warming is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one factor and that there's a cycle</v>

2920
02:09:58.571 --> 02:10:01.390
<v Speaker 1>that happens all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but humans are accelerating that cycle.</v>

2921
02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes a lot of sense.</v>

2922
02:10:03.970 --> 02:10:08.970
<v Speaker 1>That means that makes more sense to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>than humans have no effect on it and it </v>

2923
02:10:08.970 --> 02:10:11.650
<v Speaker 1>makes more sense to me than humans are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cause of it entirely.</v>

2924
02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I have a feeling that if you look at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

2925
02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:20.940
<v Speaker 1>you know those when those guys do those </v>
<v Speaker 1>core samples and they find out the </v>

2926
02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:23.791
<v Speaker 1>temperature of a thousand years ago when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start examining the earth and the </v>

2927
02:10:23.791 --> 02:10:26.280
<v Speaker 1>crust for all these different layers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them they can,</v>

2928
02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:31.320
<v Speaker 1>they could tell temperatures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroidal impacts and all this </v>

2929
02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:31.320
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

2930
02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:32.410
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty obvious that a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff's been happening.</v>

2931
02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:37.680
<v Speaker 1>We've ice ages come and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had hot spells when the dinosaurs </v>

2932
02:10:38.001 --> 02:10:43.001
<v Speaker 1>were alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it was like a completely </v>

2933
02:10:43.001 --> 02:10:43.001
<v Speaker 1>different atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much thicker atmosphere.</v>

2934
02:10:43.001 --> 02:10:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I read this thing about they were trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to speculate as to why the dinosaurs </v>

2935
02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:51.281
<v Speaker 1>were so large and one of the things was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it might have been because the </v>

2936
02:10:51.281 --> 02:10:52.580
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere was different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a thicker,</v>

2937
02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:57.080
<v Speaker 1>more rich atmosphere that just naturally</v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitated larger animals,</v>

2938
02:10:57.170 --> 02:10:59.150
<v Speaker 1>larger creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially lizards.</v>

2939
02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Global warming isn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The global warming controversy is global</v>

2940
02:11:06.531 --> 02:11:10.550
<v Speaker 1>warming real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we know about global warming,</v>

2941
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:16.390
<v Speaker 1>the skeptic society says it's real how </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know global warming is real.</v>

2942
02:11:17.210 --> 02:11:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Human induced climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atmospheric carbon dioxide </v>

2943
02:11:22.210 --> 02:11:25.601
<v Speaker 1>concentrations are higher today than at </v>
<v Speaker 1>any other time in the last 650,000</v>

2944
02:11:26.751 --> 02:11:31.751
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were about 35 percent higher than </v>

2945
02:11:31.751 --> 02:11:34.721
<v Speaker 1>before the industrial revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this increase is caused by human </v>

2946
02:11:34.721 --> 02:11:36.590
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Primarily the burning of fossil fuels.</v>

2947
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas as </v>
<v Speaker 1>our methane nitrous.</v>

2948
02:11:41.451 --> 02:11:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna sneeze.</v>

2949
02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:46.410
<v Speaker 3>What are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

2950
02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:49.140
<v Speaker 3>water vapor and a host of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>horseshit.</v>

2951
02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:51.270
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's global warming.</v>

2952
02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:52.200
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

2953
02:11:52.201 --> 02:11:52.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>

2954
02:11:54.490 --> 02:11:57.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm going with them instead of a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That chick,</v>

2955
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:59.880
<v Speaker 3>was it hard to accept that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that things are gonna change?</v>

2956
02:11:59.910 --> 02:12:00.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2958

<v Speaker 3>We can keep talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that's acceptable?</v>

2963
02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:21.510
<v Speaker 3>And she said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was like shutting them down.</v>

3083
02:18:10.601 --> 02:18:13.780
<v Speaker 3>of those lights that you see in the sky </v>

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3093
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:41.870
<v Speaker 1>That was when they first figured out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that inside every galaxy was a black </v>

3094
02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:41.870
<v Speaker 1>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

3095
02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:45.470
<v Speaker 1>they came up with this new detection </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment and uh,</v>

3096
02:18:45.471 --> 02:18:48.090
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what year it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should probably look it up while we're</v>

3097
02:18:48.091 --> 02:18:51.170
<v Speaker 1>talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when did they invent hyper novas?</v>

3098
02:18:52.110 --> 02:18:57.110
<v Speaker 1>But they found out event discover </v>
<v Speaker 1>hybridomas because he didn't vet them </v>

3099
02:18:58.050 --> 02:19:01.290
<v Speaker 1>hyper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where I get really dumb.</v>

3100
02:19:01.350 --> 02:19:06.350
<v Speaker 1>There's black holes and every galaxy you</v>
<v Speaker 1>said they believe that there are in </v>

3101
02:19:06.391 --> 02:19:07.530
<v Speaker 1>every galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

3102
02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:12.560
<v Speaker 1>and this is a fairly recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over the last decade they believed that </v>

3103
02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:16.560
<v Speaker 1>it at the center of every galaxy is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>supermassive black hole that is one half</v>

3104
02:19:16.561 --> 02:19:19.230
<v Speaker 1>of one percent of the mass of the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy.</v>

3105
02:19:19.230 --> 02:19:24.230
<v Speaker 1>So the bigger the galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bigger the black hole and that </v>

3106
02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:25.620
<v Speaker 1>inside each black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe another universe.</v>

3107
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

3108
02:19:28.940 --> 02:19:31.050
<v Speaker 1>That checks out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bit of a mind fuck yeah,</v>

3109
02:19:31.530 --> 02:19:32.840
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

3110
02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The black hole?</v>

3111
02:19:35.170 --> 02:19:36.340
<v Speaker 1>It was like a fake star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3112
02:19:36.430 --> 02:19:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that.</v>

3113
02:19:38.631 --> 02:19:40.750
<v Speaker 1>What was that like an imitation star </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars movie.</v>

3114
02:19:40.770 --> 02:19:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>

3115
02:19:41.661 --> 02:19:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a raincoat robots in it.</v>

3116
02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Somewhat popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously it wasn't as good as star </v>

3117
02:19:49.660 --> 02:19:50.300
<v Speaker 1>wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember buck rogers?</v>

3118
02:19:50.540 --> 02:19:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the bottom.</v>

3119
02:19:51.890 --> 02:19:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

3120
02:19:52.501 --> 02:19:56.120
<v Speaker 1>It was in 1990,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 nineties that they figured it out</v>

3121
02:19:56.260 --> 02:20:00.500
<v Speaker 1>in 1998 paper suggesting a link between </v>
<v Speaker 1>gamma ray bursts and young,</v>

3122
02:20:00.501 --> 02:20:05.501
<v Speaker 1>massive stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Formerly propo proposed the term hyper </v>

3123
02:20:05.501 --> 02:20:09.911
<v Speaker 1>nova.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had some sort of a measuring </v>

3124
02:20:09.911 --> 02:20:12.281
<v Speaker 1>equipment and they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were detecting so many explosions </v>

3125
02:20:12.281 --> 02:20:15.010
<v Speaker 1>in the sky that they thought that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a war amongst aliens thrill.</v>

3126
02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:20.040
<v Speaker 1>It's just something that was actively </v>
<v Speaker 1>being considered because all throughout </v>

3127
02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:20.570
<v Speaker 1>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently like all day long,</v>

3128
02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:23.060
<v Speaker 1>if you have the proper measuring </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment,</v>

3129
02:20:23.210 --> 02:20:28.210
<v Speaker 1>you can detect hyper novas that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking place way out in the far reaches </v>

3130
02:20:28.210 --> 02:20:31.580
<v Speaker 1>of the galaxy and what they are is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stars that are blowing up,</v>

3131
02:20:32.420 --> 02:20:37.420
<v Speaker 1>so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening like all over the </v>

3132
02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:37.420
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these bursts are so strong.</v>

3133
02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:39.140
<v Speaker 1>If they're anywhere near us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd be dead.</v>

3134
02:20:39.340 --> 02:20:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if they were at a nearby star or </v>

3135
02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:45.200
<v Speaker 1>nearby solar system and it went hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>nova.</v>

3136
02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:47.480
<v Speaker 1>That's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a wrap.</v>

3137
02:20:47.540 --> 02:20:50.960
<v Speaker 1>That's a wrap for this whole galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All lives most likely dead,</v>

3138
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:52.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3139
02:20:52.110 --> 02:20:54.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A nearby hyper nova.</v>

3140
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

3141
02:20:54.830 --> 02:20:59.830
<v Speaker 1>let's google what it would say nearby </v>
<v Speaker 1>was dangerous of a nearby hyper over </v>

3142
02:21:01.010 --> 02:21:02.660
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3143
02:21:02.661 --> 02:21:07.661
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's so many stars out there </v>

3144
02:21:09.140 --> 02:21:10.940
<v Speaker 1>that I don't know if it would be.</v>

3145
02:21:11.090 --> 02:21:13.910
<v Speaker 1>It would be possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it.</v>

3146
02:21:14.270 --> 02:21:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean it certainly would be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how likely it would be,</v>

3147
02:21:17.031 --> 02:21:20.780
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the numbers of stars are just.</v>

3148
02:21:20.781 --> 02:21:25.130
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of billions just in our galaxy.</v>

3149
02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he can even understand.</v>

3150
02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:29.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3151
02:21:29.390 --> 02:21:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

3152
02:21:30.621 --> 02:21:35.621
<v Speaker 1>I can't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Destruction of earth by a nearby </v>

3153
02:21:35.621 --> 02:21:36.830
<v Speaker 1>supernova.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is on the nasa page.</v>

3154
02:21:38.060 --> 02:21:40.400
<v Speaker 1>Be careful job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You destroy the earth itself.</v>

3155
02:21:40.401 --> 02:21:43.460
<v Speaker 1>The sun will have to go supernova,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it never will.</v>

3156
02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:48.760
<v Speaker 1>If you're talking about life on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there is a detailed calculation of </v>

3157
02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:50.810
<v Speaker 1>the risks due to a nearby supernova on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the web.</v>

3158
02:21:50.840 --> 02:21:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a.</v>

3159
02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:54.350
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a thing that calculates</v>
<v Speaker 1>the risks.</v>

3160
02:21:54.650 --> 02:21:59.650
<v Speaker 1>The author concludes that a supernova </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be within 10 parsecs or 30 light </v>

3161
02:21:59.650 --> 02:22:03.821
<v Speaker 1>years to be dangerous to life on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is because the atmosphere shields </v>

3162
02:22:04.521 --> 02:22:09.521
<v Speaker 1>us from most dangerous radiation </v>
<v Speaker 1>radiation astronauts into orbit may be </v>

3163
02:22:09.521 --> 02:22:13.160
<v Speaker 1>in danger if supernova is within a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand parsecs or soul.</v>

3164
02:22:14.030 --> 02:22:19.030
<v Speaker 1>So if they were up in space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be a thousand parsecs,</v>

3165
02:22:19.161 --> 02:22:23.130
<v Speaker 1>so 100 times more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So $300,</v>

3166
02:22:23.131 --> 02:22:26.190
<v Speaker 1>million light years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or three light years rather.</v>

3167
02:22:27.210 --> 02:22:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy man.</v>

3168
02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:34.340
<v Speaker 3>No star currently within 20 parsecs will</v>
<v Speaker 3>go supernova within the next few million</v>

3169
02:22:34.650 --> 02:22:38.430
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a relief.</v>

3170
02:22:38.830 --> 02:22:41.010
<v Speaker 3>I feel so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my biggest fear.</v>

3171
02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:43.590
<v Speaker 3>That would be a motherfucker dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day.</v>

3172
02:22:43.591 --> 02:22:48.591
<v Speaker 3>It all goes bright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listened to the lame stream media all </v>

3173
02:22:48.591 --> 02:22:48.591
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lame stream media,</v>

3174
02:22:48.591 --> 02:22:51.830
<v Speaker 3>constantly paranoid of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could call it a high pernova.</v>

3175
02:22:51.831 --> 02:22:56.831
<v Speaker 3>All.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I know is it's angels coming was </v>

3176
02:22:56.831 --> 02:22:58.950
<v Speaker 3>just latin berg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the angels come,</v>

3177
02:22:59.430 --> 02:23:04.430
<v Speaker 3>the satellites go down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that god has a great sense of evil.</v>

3178
02:23:05.550 --> 02:23:10.550
<v Speaker 3>The lame stream media would want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that the supernovas are to be </v>

3179
02:23:11.821 --> 02:23:14.790
<v Speaker 3>feared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but god's plan includes all of us.</v>

3180
02:23:14.820 --> 02:23:16.060
<v Speaker 3>God's plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amen.</v>

3181
02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:19.170
<v Speaker 3>When is that going to go away?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it will.</v>

3182
02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:21.300
<v Speaker 3>What is that accent going to go away?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3183
02:23:21.460 --> 02:23:23.000
<v Speaker 3>I think people love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they,</v>

3184
02:23:23.001 --> 02:23:28.001
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they love it and they're going to keep </v>

3185
02:23:28.001 --> 02:23:29.331
<v Speaker 3>it going as long as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they should keep it going just </v>

3186
02:23:29.331 --> 02:23:29.331
<v Speaker 3>for the chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3187
02:23:29.331 --> 02:23:29.460
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the chicks alone,</v>

3188
02:23:29.700 --> 02:23:30.210
<v Speaker 3>it's the best.</v>

3189
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:35.160
<v Speaker 3>It's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the best.</v>

3190
02:23:35.161 --> 02:23:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't get any better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for dudes,</v>

3191
02:23:37.291 --> 02:23:39.930
<v Speaker 3>a little hickey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you're a country music fan,</v>

3192
02:23:40.020 --> 02:23:42.810
<v Speaker 3>it could work if the guys gentlemen </v>
<v Speaker 3>could work.</v>

3193
02:23:42.811 --> 02:23:45.450
<v Speaker 3>But if the gods explaining thermo </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear power,</v>

3194
02:23:45.480 --> 02:23:46.410
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>

3195
02:23:46.411 --> 02:23:49.510
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking hickey cock sucker.</v>

3196
02:23:49.530 --> 02:23:54.530
<v Speaker 3>Let's throw some harvard on there that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're working with fusion and the wife </v>

3197
02:23:56.211 --> 02:24:01.211
<v Speaker 3>fusion works is we have the nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you feel feel the water into the </v>

3198
02:24:01.510 --> 02:24:04.110
<v Speaker 3>broads and it's create steam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then this thing,</v>

3199
02:24:04.170 --> 02:24:09.170
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shut this fucking guy up and get a </v>

3200
02:24:09.170 --> 02:24:09.170
<v Speaker 3>real scientist in near get someone from </v>
<v Speaker 3>harvard,</v>

3201

<v Speaker 3>But you listen to people from harvard </v>

3204
02:24:17.380 --> 02:24:17.380
<v Speaker 3>scientists from harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No boston accent whatsoever.</v>

3205
02:24:18.050 --> 02:24:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:13.570
<v Speaker 12>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

3440
02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:15.710
<v Speaker 12>So call me in a week or so.</v>
<v Speaker 12>All right.</v>

3441
02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:18.020
<v Speaker 12>Take it easy.</v>
<v Speaker 12>His</v>

3442
02:34:18.170 --> 02:34:21.370
<v Speaker 3>voice is just music to my ears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3443
02:34:21.460 --> 02:34:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well especially now.</v>

3444
02:34:23.021 --> 02:34:28.021
<v Speaker 3>So after he's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did other ones.</v>

3445
02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:37.500
<v Speaker 3>He's doing bong hits on the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3446
02:34:37.510 --> 02:34:40.900
<v Speaker 3>that's the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what was the other one?</v>

3447
02:34:40.901 --> 02:34:43.360
<v Speaker 3>That jim florentine florentine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His name is special ed,</v>

3448
02:34:43.361 --> 02:34:45.100
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that still legal?</v>

3449
02:34:45.101 --> 02:34:46.750
<v Speaker 3>Can you still do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you call people up?</v>

3450
02:34:46.780 --> 02:34:49.600
<v Speaker 3>It used to be that you could do it as </v>
<v Speaker 3>long as you did it in vegas.</v>

3451
02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:51.340
<v Speaker 3>Debts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's their loophole.</v>

3452
02:34:51.370 --> 02:34:53.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the deal is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This show probably ruined it.</v>

3453
02:34:53.321 --> 02:34:56.560
<v Speaker 3>You know the show what crank crank </v>
<v Speaker 3>wreck.</v>

3454
02:34:56.580 --> 02:34:56.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

3455
02:34:56.950 --> 02:34:59.860
<v Speaker 3>So I wOnder with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I go?</v>

3456
02:35:00.530 --> 02:35:01.450
<v Speaker 12>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>

3457
02:35:01.610 --> 02:35:05.120
<v Speaker 12>I'm trying to track a package that was </v>
<v Speaker 12>supposed to be delivered to my sister</v>

3458
02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:09.020
<v Speaker 3>when was this boat to get to her </v>
<v Speaker 3>address?</v>

3459
02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:13.180
<v Speaker 3>But they didn't make their first </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempt.</v>

3460
02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:16.010
<v Speaker 3>I think the character's name is special </v>
<v Speaker 3>eD,</v>

3461
02:35:16.011 --> 02:35:21.011
<v Speaker 3>but that seems weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she's calling them to try to get a </v>

3462
02:35:21.011 --> 02:35:21.011
<v Speaker 3>package tracked and they're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

3463
02:35:21.011 --> 02:35:25.600
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jim florentine and don jamison do this </v>

3464
02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:28.721
<v Speaker 3>thing called the touchstone terrorists </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have a number thAt a lot of </v>

3465
02:35:28.761 --> 02:35:31.320
<v Speaker 3>people call as the customer service </v>
<v Speaker 3>number and,</v>

3466
02:35:31.520 --> 02:35:35.030
<v Speaker 3>and they also do telemarketers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the people that call,</v>

3467
02:35:35.031 --> 02:35:37.490
<v Speaker 3>they think it's an actual customer </v>
<v Speaker 3>service number.</v>

3468
02:35:37.540 --> 02:35:38.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3470
02:35:43.361 --> 02:35:45.161
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would have so many hands because it </v>

3471
02:35:45.161 --> 02:35:47.081
<v Speaker 3>seemed like that's what she was dOing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seemed like she was calling like she </v>

3472
02:35:47.081 --> 02:35:47.081
<v Speaker 3>had a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3473
02:35:47.081 --> 02:35:48.560
<v Speaker 3>I've heard this one before and it's even</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse than calling somebody,</v>

3474
02:35:48.561 --> 02:35:48.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3475

<v Speaker 3>That's even worse.</v>

3477
02:35:51.831 --> 02:35:56.831
<v Speaker 3>Like if they're calling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got a real issue that needed to </v>

3478
02:35:56.831 --> 02:35:56.831
<v Speaker 3>fix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3480
02:35:57.580 --> 02:36:01.680
<v Speaker 3>he just tapes every conversation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when telemarketers call him he,</v>

3481
02:36:02.010 --> 02:36:04.550
<v Speaker 3>he fucks with them so bad.</v>

<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gun with him,</v>

02:39:41.781 --> 02:39:46.781
<v Speaker 3>when he'd go right back into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should have video that somebody </v>

3571
02:39:46.781 --> 02:39:47.660
<v Speaker 3>released that were like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a mma fight or a small,</v>

3572
02:39:47.690 --> 02:39:52.690
<v Speaker 3>like a some kind of fight and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>judge starts beating up the two guys </v>

3573
02:39:52.690 --> 02:39:57.490
<v Speaker 3>because he's tried to break them up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't break up and then the </v>

3574
02:39:57.490 --> 02:39:58.040
<v Speaker 3>judge just the referee starts just </v>
<v Speaker 3>beating them up.</v>

3575
02:39:58.740 --> 02:40:00.290
<v Speaker 3>I'll find it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see it.</v>

3576
02:40:00.350 --> 02:40:01.490
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3577
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:06.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so great that we have so much </v>

3578
02:40:06.670 --> 02:40:09.101
<v Speaker 3>footage of so much nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw bad worldstar one the other day </v>

3579
02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:12.410
<v Speaker 3>where some guy knocked this guy out onto</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hood of a car.</v>

3580
02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 3>He just steps</v>

3581
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:16.770
<v Speaker 1>up to this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the guy sitting there and he steps.</v>

3582
02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:21.800
<v Speaker 1>He's like sitting next to a car and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>steps up and smashes them in the face,</v>

3583
02:40:22.140 --> 02:40:27.140
<v Speaker 1>knocking them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold the goggles flying back into the </v>

3584
02:40:27.140 --> 02:40:27.570
<v Speaker 1>grill of the car and then crumbles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guy's yelling,</v>

3585
02:40:27.610 --> 02:40:30.160
<v Speaker 1>worldstar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3586
02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:32.910
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the humanity.</v>

3587
02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:38.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain segment of the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>race that doesn't give a fuck about the </v>

3588
02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:39.570
<v Speaker 1>rest of the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

3589
02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:41.520
<v Speaker 1>They really don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

3590
02:40:42.180 --> 02:40:47.180
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of scary and you could find </v>
<v Speaker 1>that segment represented well on </v>

3591
02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:48.300
<v Speaker 1>worldstar hip hop.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3592
02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:52.050
<v Speaker 1>They don't mind punching each other in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face or punching you in the face.</v>

3593
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

3594
02:40:53.100 --> 02:40:55.140
<v Speaker 1>It's just part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the one the other day?</v>

3595
02:40:55.230 --> 02:40:57.450

<v Speaker 1>then jumped back on the bike and </v>

3603
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:18.180
<v Speaker 1>runaway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These little kids tried to sucker punch </v>

3604
02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:18.180
<v Speaker 1>me one time in baltimore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was lifeguard and this pool really?</v>

3605
02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:18.960
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came up,</v>

3606
02:41:18.990 --> 02:41:20.850
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to go swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they just walked up.</v>

3607
02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:22.230
<v Speaker 1>They were like eight years old and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

3608
02:41:22.231 --> 02:41:22.590
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dude goes to punch me.</v>

3610
02:41:25.770 --> 02:41:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I move out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all jumped in the pool,</v>

3611
02:41:27.631 --> 02:41:30.270
<v Speaker 1>jump out and run away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3612
02:41:30.750 --> 02:41:34.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jump out and run away.</v>

3613
02:41:34.380 --> 02:41:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want to jump in the pool for a</v>

3614
02:41:35.641 --> 02:41:37.890
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they show the kid picking on the kid</v>

3615
02:41:37.891 --> 02:41:38.970
<v Speaker 1>first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3616
02:41:38.971 --> 02:41:41.070
<v Speaker 1>At first there was here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say the whole thing.</v>

3617
02:41:43.990 --> 02:41:44.810
<v Speaker 2>We don't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brian,</v>

3618
02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:59.440
<v Speaker 2>so he rides off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got upset.</v>

3619
02:41:59.470 --> 02:42:04.470
<v Speaker 2>The smaller guy rides off on his bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's also the one that used the n word </v>

3620
02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:09.450
<v Speaker 2>and he turns around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts back down the road.</v>

3621
02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:12.150
<v Speaker 2>It seems like he planned this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's playing.</v>

3622
02:42:14.740 --> 02:42:19.740
<v Speaker 2>It goes rides the bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He chases his bike and then jumps back.</v>

3623
02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the eight year old worldstar.</v>

3624
02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what that is.</v>

3625
02:42:29.870 --> 02:42:31.460
<v Speaker 1>That's where world start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he can knock people out,</v>

3626
02:42:31.461 --> 02:42:36.461
<v Speaker 1>yet he punched people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get desperately hurt like </v>

3627
02:42:36.461 --> 02:42:36.461
<v Speaker 1>they do in the other video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just get mildly annoyed.</v>

3628
02:42:36.500 --> 02:42:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of it's more fucked up because you </v>

3629
02:42:41.500 --> 02:42:41.540
<v Speaker 1>know they're eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of it's way better because they</v>

3630
02:42:41.541 --> 02:42:42.770
<v Speaker 1>can't do as much damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3631
02:42:43.100 --> 02:42:48.100
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of you knows they'll be doing that </v>

3632
02:42:48.100 --> 02:42:48.100
<v Speaker 1>at 80.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

3633
02:42:48.100 --> 02:42:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they could stick in that </v>

3634
02:42:52.540 --> 02:42:52.540
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could stick it out.</v>

3635
02:42:52.540 --> 02:42:56.380
<v Speaker 1>They'll be doing something way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy will be in a way better video </v>

3636
02:42:56.380 --> 02:42:56.380
<v Speaker 1>10 years from now with a better bike </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3637
02:42:56.380 --> 02:42:59.060
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like solar power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think?</v>

<v Speaker 1>She couldn't believe that anybody would </v>

3792
02:50:00.021 --> 02:50:00.021
<v Speaker 1>pay to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like there was no passion to it.</v>

3793
02:50:00.021 --> 02:50:02.880
<v Speaker 1>It was numb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just saying nothing.</v>

3794
02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:07.530
<v Speaker 1>And he just spoke for an hour about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there any topic.</v>

3795
02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:09.330

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3800
02:50:20.251 --> 02:50:25.080

<v Speaker 1>very detailed argument against pulling </v>

3860
02:52:43.711 --> 02:52:45.910
<v Speaker 1>it down and he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He demanded to know like,</v>

3861
02:52:45.940 --> 02:52:48.120
<v Speaker 1>what about what I'm saying is </v>

<v Speaker 1>please explain if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're so concerned that you pulled </v>

3863
02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:56.461
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these are real things like talking </v>

3865
02:52:58.921 --> 02:53:01.291
<v Speaker 1>people can experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The science behind the experience is </v>

3866
02:53:01.291 --> 02:53:01.490
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The history behind the experiences.</v>

3867
02:53:01.520 --> 02:53:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Real document against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting.</v>

3868
02:53:03.791 --> 02:53:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an ancient and it's his theory.</v>

3869
02:53:05.621 --> 02:53:10.621
<v Speaker 1>These are his theories about knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>being gained from taking these </v>

3870
02:53:11.380 --> 02:53:13.960
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they pulled him down.</v>

02:53:13.961 --> 02:53:17.350
<v Speaker 1>But that the eddie wong thing is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing to me that they told him that</v>

3872
02:53:17.351 --> 02:53:22.351
<v Speaker 1>they will not more disturbing but almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>more disturbing because they made him </v>

3873
02:53:22.351 --> 02:53:23.980
<v Speaker 1>sleep with another person in a room </v>

<v Speaker 1>up and have to make a speech.</v>

3885
02:53:53.081 --> 02:53:56.590
<v Speaker 1>You want a little bit of relaxation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of privacy beforehand.</v>

02:54:19.450 --> 02:54:24.450
<v Speaker 1>and we'll wrap this bitch up and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>go home with this because it's kind of </v>

3896
02:54:24.450 --> 02:54:24.640
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious that uh,</v>

3897
02:54:26.750 --> 02:54:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what year this was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did this,</v>

3898
02:54:28.751 --> 02:54:29.050
<v Speaker 1>I hope,</v>

3899
02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.800
<v Speaker 13>a drink of water.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Given that the housewife.</v>

3900
02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:36.230
<v Speaker 13>No.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Twenty five soldiers later,</v>

3901
02:54:36.420 --> 02:54:38.470
<v Speaker 13>the first effect of the drug became a </v>
<v Speaker 13>pattern.</v>

3902
02:54:39.400 --> 02:54:44.320
<v Speaker 13>The men began to relax them to giggle.</v>
<v Speaker 13>But this man was more seriously affected</v>

3903
02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:46.620
<v Speaker 13>and had to be removed.</v>
<v Speaker 13>TheY exercise,</v>

3904
02:54:46.810 --> 02:54:51.810
<v Speaker 13>they're all up to 35 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 13>One of the radIo operators had become </v>

3905
02:54:51.810 --> 02:54:55.770
<v Speaker 13>incapable of using his set and the </v>
<v Speaker 13>efficiency of the rocket launcher team </v>

3906
02:54:55.770 --> 02:54:56.980
<v Speaker 13>was that impact.</v>

3907
02:54:57.010 --> 02:54:58.160
<v Speaker 1>They have rocket launches</v>

3908
02:54:59.740 --> 02:55:02.190
<v Speaker 13>attacking section had lost all sense of </v>
<v Speaker 13>urgency,</v>

3909
02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:03.680
<v Speaker 13>noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 13>bunching,</v>

3910
02:55:03.710 --> 02:55:08.710
<v Speaker 13>and indecision is they enter the would </v>
<v Speaker 13>occupied by the enemy almost </v>

3911
02:55:08.710 --> 02:55:10.010
<v Speaker 13>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 13>The section commander,</v>

3912
02:55:10.020 --> 02:55:15.020
<v Speaker 13>I tried to use a map to find the </v>
<v Speaker 13>location of our headquarters and the </v>

3913
02:55:15.020 --> 02:55:16.490
<v Speaker 13>prisoners escalade had to have the way </v>
<v Speaker 13>pointed out to him.</v>

3914
02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:20.630
<v Speaker 13>Although he was in plain sight,</v>
<v Speaker 13>700 yards away over open country,</v>

3915
02:55:21.740 --> 02:55:26.740
<v Speaker 13>50 minutes off to taking the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Radio communication had become </v>

3916
02:55:26.740 --> 02:55:26.960
<v Speaker 13>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 13>if not impossible,</v>

3917
02:55:27.170 --> 02:55:29.510
<v Speaker 13>but the men are still capable and that's</v>
<v Speaker 13>the stain,</v>

3918
02:55:29.520 --> 02:55:34.520
<v Speaker 13>the physical effort.</v>
<v Speaker 13>However constructive action was till </v>

3919
02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:37.690
<v Speaker 13>attempted by those retaining a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 13>responsibility in spite of physical </v>

3920
02:55:37.690 --> 02:55:39.980
<v Speaker 13>symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but one hour and 10 minutes after taking</v>

3921
02:55:39.981 --> 02:55:43.460
<v Speaker 13>the drug was one man climbing a tree to </v>
<v Speaker 13>feed the birds.</v>

3922
02:55:43.940 --> 02:55:48.940
<v Speaker 13>The troop commander I gave up admitting </v>
<v Speaker 13>that he could no longer control himself </v>

3923
02:55:48.940 --> 02:55:49.400
<v Speaker 13>or his men</v>

3924
02:55:52.730 --> 02:55:54.980
<v Speaker 1>and they're all laughing and shit.</v>

3925
02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
<v Speaker 13>Self then relapsed into laughter.</v>

3926
02:56:00.650 --> 02:56:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all his weapons.</v>

3927
02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Weapons on acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know about asset back then.</v>
