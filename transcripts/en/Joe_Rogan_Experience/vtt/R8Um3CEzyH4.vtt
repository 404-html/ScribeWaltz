<v Speaker 1>Rogan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>flashlight,</v>

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>flesh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flesh.</v>

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>How dare you did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

9
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't need a flashlight.</v>

10
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I said flesh.</v>

11
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little too few people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little too high to be doing this </v>

12
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm too high and I heard it.</v>

13
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>Flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

14
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>the fleshlight is an excellent product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is for real.</v>

15
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stray off the script.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>let's get everybody needs masturbation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit's important is important.</v>

17
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>It seems ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very embarrassing,</v>

18
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.130
<v Speaker 1>but it is sexual maintenance and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>important and you shoot way bigger </v>

19
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.610
<v Speaker 1>loads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion with the flashlight,</v>

20
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>that it's powerful.</v>

21
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because your girlfriend gets mad at it.</v>

22
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Now I've lost at least more than one </v>
<v Speaker 1>flashlight just vanish.</v>

24
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>It got thrown away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown away.</v>

25
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Not even like a fake part of a person.</v>

29
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I think I pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's more that she's </v>

30
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:35.561
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed that I've got a can with an </v>

<v Speaker 1>before we even got started and we might </v>

34
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.800
<v Speaker 1>be too high to talk in public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give it a fucking country.</v>

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.820

<v Speaker 1>country work ethic automatically.</v>

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.640
<v Speaker 1>You'll you,</v>

44
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:19.480
<v Speaker 1>He could just shut his fucking mouth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some hay around.</v>

45
00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:21.130
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that.</v>

46
00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:22.300
<v Speaker 1>That's admirable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

47
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

48
00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:28.501
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like some wild west type movie </v>

49
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:28.501
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:30.670
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a great life guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets up early in the morning,</v>

51
00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:35.530
<v Speaker 1>just fucking milks cows till he can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk anymore and the day goes to sleep.</v>

52
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Something admirable about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever found an attorney,</v>

53
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

54
00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I think I have on fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure a goat one.</v>

55
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Squeeze it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I did it.</v>

56
00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:47.050
<v Speaker 1>I might be imagining this was so long </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

57
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had people suck on goat tits.</v>

58
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.910
<v Speaker 1>They had actually suck on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very phallic.</v>

59
00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:56.911
<v Speaker 1>It was really weird to watch like girls </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking on this tit like sucking milk </v>

60
00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:58.540
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This looks like a black deck.</v>

61
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a deformed,</v>

62
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.160
<v Speaker 3>like a short fat black Dick and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls and these girls were suck at all </v>

63
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 3>of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pulling milk out of guys were to,</v>

64
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

65
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

66
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 3>That goat is experiencing what is </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially a ufo abduction.</v>

67
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 3>It's mind cannot process what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

68
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.830
<v Speaker 3>Whereas they're used to getting milked </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently because they milk them every </v>

69
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.830
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

70
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 3>they squeeze on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:30.751
<v Speaker 3>But if you imagine having just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>fading on you and you don't know what </v>

72
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 3>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So demonic,</v>

73
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.670
<v Speaker 3>Trapped in a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

75
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 3>Attached by color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there were attached by a chain </v>

76
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.010
<v Speaker 3>trying to make sense on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they must in some way be trying </v>

77
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.010
<v Speaker 3>to process what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

78
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 3>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were elevated as well.</v>

79
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:53.851
<v Speaker 3>How weird was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were up on the platform so that </v>

80
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:53.851
<v Speaker 3>people could get out of them with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>

81
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have to go under him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm pretty sure,</v>

82
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 3>if I remember that correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be imagining that as well,</v>

83
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.620
<v Speaker 3>but I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine I remember being there thinking </v>

84
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 3>how bizarre it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just people are sucking on these animal </v>

85
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 3>parts on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

86
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.470
<v Speaker 4>It feels real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you ever feel cow one.</v>

87
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.920
<v Speaker 4>I just wonder if there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>farmers,</v>

88
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.720
<v Speaker 4>but it feels real like it feels like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're holding something.</v>

89
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.630
<v Speaker 4>That's the only thing that you've ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>felt like that before is your Dick.</v>

90
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.560
<v Speaker 4>So it feels like it just feels like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a flashlight for men.</v>

91
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 3>When you mean a delta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.310
<v Speaker 3>This fucking strains that we drink the </v>
<v Speaker 3>milk out of other animals.</v>

93
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:34.311
<v Speaker 3>So we make them make milk and then we </v>
<v Speaker 3>drank it and we sell it and it's super </v>

94
00:04:34.311 --> 00:04:35.460
<v Speaker 3>common milk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally normal.</v>

95
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're parasites or cow </v>

96
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 3>parasite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We extract some,</v>

97
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.580
<v Speaker 3>some they're fluid and we sell it and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>add weird shit till we put chocolate in </v>

98
00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:52.071
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently a lot of people believe </v>

99
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:54.261
<v Speaker 3>that eating dairy is not healthy for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>human body and that you'll feel better.</v>

100
00:04:55.771 --> 00:04:59.070
<v Speaker 3>Your energy levels will be better if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just cut dairy out of your life.</v>

101
00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:02.400
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that from so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way it can't be true,</v>

102
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.810
<v Speaker 3>but milk is delicious and so as ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>cream and you can go fuck yourself.</v>

103
00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:08.040
<v Speaker 3>I liked cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

104
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm not cutting dairy out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just went to a.</v>

105
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.070
<v Speaker 3>I just went to Paris and she got super </v>
<v Speaker 3>stoned.</v>

106
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.220
<v Speaker 3>And how'd you get stoned in Paris?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk about it after the podcast.</v>

107
00:05:20.221 --> 00:05:21.720
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to mention on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast?</v>

108
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.650
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good move.</v>

109
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Good move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

110
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.970
<v Speaker 3>just a friend out in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

111
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 3>That's lucky break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

112
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.180
<v Speaker 3>but weed is illegal and parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how illegal is it?</v>

113
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was standing next to someone openly </v>

114
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 3>smoking hash in the subway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So really?</v>

115
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know how illegal.</v>

116
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

117
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.350
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I hadn't eaten there yet and I was </v>

118
00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:47.591
<v Speaker 3>super stoned and it was the first time </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd ever eaten like French cheese and I </v>

119
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.980
<v Speaker 3>almost passed out because it tasted so </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

120
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.130
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God I got a momentary vertigo</v>
<v Speaker 3>or it's like I've been eating prison </v>

121
00:05:57.501 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 3>cafeteria food for my entire life </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the food over there is better.</v>

122
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.570
<v Speaker 3>Food in Paris is better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes straight from the countryside </v>

123
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.570
<v Speaker 3>right now though.</v>

124
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.090
<v Speaker 5>Hundreds and thousands of dudes tweeting</v>
<v Speaker 5>for all over the country going,</v>

125
00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:11.350
<v Speaker 5>why don't you fucking move?</v>

126
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 3>I would if I could really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always thought they had the worst </v>

127
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.420
<v Speaker 3>food until he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said this because I always.</v>

128
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.360
<v Speaker 3>I worked at a French restaurant once and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the worst food ever.</v>

129
00:06:21.361 --> 00:06:26.361
<v Speaker 3>Like the lobster bisque or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that was the only thing that I </v>

130
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:26.361
<v Speaker 3>thought was decent on the whole menu.</v>

131
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:29.100
<v Speaker 5>What is it like a low end restaurant or </v>
<v Speaker 5>was it a nice place?</v>

132
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.190
<v Speaker 5>French place?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

133
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

134
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not as much as much of a food </v>

135
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.530
<v Speaker 5>efficient auto that I could tell you </v>
<v Speaker 5>what French food really is.</v>

136
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.660
<v Speaker 5>I know there's a place down the street </v>
<v Speaker 5>from here I really liked.</v>

137
00:06:40.661 --> 00:06:43.000
<v Speaker 5>That's supposedly French because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have fog law.</v>

138
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.620
<v Speaker 5>That's the French way of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

139
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.520
<v Speaker 5>this duck liver,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's delicious.</v>

140
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.090
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the rude as fuck they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were the mouth.</v>

141
00:06:51.091 --> 00:06:52.390
<v Speaker 5>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Poor goose.</v>

142
00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:54.060
<v Speaker 5>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean their mouth.</v>

143
00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:56.430
<v Speaker 5>Fuck this goose and force feed them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of crazy.</v>

144
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a horrible,</v>

145
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 3>horrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

146
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:00.380
<v Speaker 3>Their liver?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

147
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.410
<v Speaker 3>it's their liver mixed in with the shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>base spray into them and it like </v>

148
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 3>flavors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is,</v>

149
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:12.131
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It flavors the liver so that it tastes </v>

150
00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:12.131
<v Speaker 3>really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's so good.</v>

151
00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Here's the weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the guy.</v>

152
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:18.761
<v Speaker 3>I think this is going to piss everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>off if they're not already mad about me </v>

153
00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:19.760
<v Speaker 3>saying French fruit's better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is better.</v>

154
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.940
<v Speaker 5>Like it's defined better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

155
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:22.870
<v Speaker 5>What makes it better?</v>

156
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.150
<v Speaker 3>They just use more butters that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>more like I don't give no,</v>

157
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:33.310
<v Speaker 3>but I mean in France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to imagine it's it just on </v>

158
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 3>another level of like it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more intense.</v>

159
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think of a great way to </v>

160
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.510
<v Speaker 3>explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the volume is turned up a </v>

161
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.510
<v Speaker 3>little bit more on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's flavor wise.</v>

162
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.660
<v Speaker 3>The flavor's better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

163
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 3>it's like they like the way they cook </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

164
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 3>The place that we went to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were cooking.</v>

165
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.670
<v Speaker 3>We ordered this rib platter for two and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they cook this giant slab of meat on an </v>

166
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 3>open fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like above a fireplace and you can watch</v>

167
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:03.821
<v Speaker 3>it in the restaurant and the restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 3>feels like something out of the 16 </v>

168
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:06.530
<v Speaker 3>hundreds or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know why it feels like that?</v>

169
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 3>Because it's been around since the 16 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds.</v>

170
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 3>Like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's old,</v>

171
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>

172
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:17.651
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like you're in this place where </v>

173
00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:20.111
<v Speaker 3>so many human lives have happened and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that's why the food </v>

174
00:08:20.111 --> 00:08:20.111
<v Speaker 3>tastes better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's your insurance.</v>

175
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.590
<v Speaker 3>It's so good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

176
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:22.860
<v Speaker 3>It was really good.</v>

177
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 5>Or kind of make a word one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One thing that I never appreciated,</v>

178
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:31.211
<v Speaker 5>I think before watch sort of watching </v>
<v Speaker 5>that no reservations show was that that </v>

179
00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 5>food for the preparation of food is </v>
<v Speaker 5>really an art form.</v>

180
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 5>It really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>truly is an art form.</v>

181
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean I kind of knew that abstractly </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I always like appreciated good </v>

182
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.080
<v Speaker 5>chefs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but until I watched that show not,</v>

183
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.600
<v Speaker 5>you see that guy's passion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how he describes food,</v>

184
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.500
<v Speaker 5>how um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how uh,</v>

185
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.010
<v Speaker 5>how addictive it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

186
00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:53.630
<v Speaker 5>what's the word I'm looking for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Addictive.</v>

187
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

188
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

189
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.670
<v Speaker 6>it just gets you hungry like it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it starts like the way he describes </v>

190
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.351
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I never get more hungry than when </v>

191
00:09:06.351 --> 00:09:07.851
<v Speaker 6>I'm watching that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you realize that people are </v>

192
00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 6>really bad ass chefs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All these guys,</v>

193
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.820
<v Speaker 6>they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they all have ideas and thoughts and </v>

194
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a method to how they prepare things and,</v>

195
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.320
<v Speaker 6>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's so fascinating that it's just to </v>

196
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.721
<v Speaker 6>maximize the impact that it has on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>pallet and it's just strange art form </v>

197
00:09:23.721 --> 00:09:28.551
<v Speaker 6>the art form of flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I never really appreciated that </v>

198
00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 6>until I watched that show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then when then you what you see like</v>

199
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 6>a really well prepared dish and you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

200
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.850
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that guy just fucked me up with some </v>

201
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.220
<v Speaker 6>crazy crab with squid ink pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you realize that like these </v>

202
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:43.560
<v Speaker 6>creations of textures and combinations </v>
<v Speaker 6>of flavors,</v>

203
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 6>it really is a bad ass art form.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I never appreciated it before.</v>

204
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:48.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

205
00:09:48.461 --> 00:09:51.100
<v Speaker 3>And you get this when you taste </v>
<v Speaker 3>something really good like that,</v>

206
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.200
<v Speaker 3>you get a glimpse at how there's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this spectrum of sense gratification and</v>

207
00:09:56.201 --> 00:10:01.201
<v Speaker 3>some people in some parts of the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and figured out ways to hit the higher </v>

208
00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:06.181
<v Speaker 3>ends up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're only experiencing life at </v>

209
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:09.511
<v Speaker 3>this one spectrum of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then when you do get something super </v>

210
00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:10.870
<v Speaker 3>high end like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really intense.</v>

211
00:10:10.871 --> 00:10:15.871
<v Speaker 3>It's just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing to think people eat like </v>

212
00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:18.571
<v Speaker 3>that every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also the weird thing about a lot of </v>

213
00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:21.361
<v Speaker 3>people in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fucking eat so much and they eat </v>

214
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:24.751
<v Speaker 3>all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like everything there is about </v>

215
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:24.751
<v Speaker 3>eating or going out to eat with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

216
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:29.050
<v Speaker 3>And it's this very serious ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you go to a restaurant,</v>

217
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:34.620
<v Speaker 3>it has the same energy of like you feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're in an air traffic control </v>

218
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:34.620
<v Speaker 3>tower.</v>

219
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.270
<v Speaker 3>People are eating in the serious way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

220
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 3>like they're taking in an art or </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to a symphony and some of </v>

221
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 3>these restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all of them,</v>

222
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.310
<v Speaker 3>but some of them it's intense and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like four waiters,</v>

223
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:50.490
<v Speaker 3>they're dressed like super formally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's kids being trained since they </v>

224
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.740
<v Speaker 3>were like 15 to be waiters and so it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>this cultural,</v>

225
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 3>it's embedded into their culture and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've really refined it and it's </v>

226
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.850
<v Speaker 3>really fucking cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but French people that are the ones that</v>

227
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.030
<v Speaker 3>you don't see fat people there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're eating all the fucking time,</v>

228
00:11:04.031 --> 00:11:07.120
<v Speaker 3>but most of them are thin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of them seem like they're in shape.</v>

229
00:11:07.121 --> 00:11:09.220
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do they do that?</v>

230
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.530
<v Speaker 3>People say because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>preservatives in the food they eat,</v>

231
00:11:11.531 --> 00:11:14.530
<v Speaker 3>like food that comes straight from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>countryside.</v>

232
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:15.700
<v Speaker 3>That's what people say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

233
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.120
<v Speaker 3>I'd heard all this stuff by the way I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard it before I went.</v>

234
00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.230
<v Speaker 3>I read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The food,</v>

235
00:11:20.231 --> 00:11:25.231
<v Speaker 3>there's better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are like thin people are living </v>

236
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:26.470
<v Speaker 3>life and I was extremely skeptical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>link,</v>

237
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.750
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that Buddhist quote,</v>

238
00:11:28.751 --> 00:11:33.751
<v Speaker 3>I think I've said it on here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people will tell you this place is </v>

239
00:11:33.751 --> 00:11:36.781
<v Speaker 3>better than that place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This country is better than this </v>

240
00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:36.910
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's smarter people here than there,</v>

241
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.660
<v Speaker 3>but I say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole world is on fire.</v>

242
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.900
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are consumed with the same fears </v>

243
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.901
<v Speaker 3>and worries and it's all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Buddha did not eat ribs and fucking </v>

244
00:11:48.971 --> 00:11:53.971
<v Speaker 3>Paris because that place is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking nice man.</v>

245
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 3>For subway signs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all look like the lettering,</v>

246
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:01.350
<v Speaker 3>the font.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They use an absence bottles like,</v>

247
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking trippy and cool.</v>

248
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:06.260
<v Speaker 3>And I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll shut up about Paris because I might</v>

249
00:12:06.261 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 3>sound like an Asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>

250
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:10.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know about the catacombs of Paris.</v>

251
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.580
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were describing this to me.</v>

252
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 4>This is the most scariest Shit I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>seen in my life that did it.</v>

253
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.590
<v Speaker 4>I did not know existed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's more than one.</v>

254
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.860
<v Speaker 4>I've soft photos once of a church,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just explain to everybody what it </v>

255
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:22.860
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

256
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.990
<v Speaker 3>So underneath Paris basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know the exact history </v>

257
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.891
<v Speaker 3>behind this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what happened is I think because of </v>

258
00:12:30.891 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 3>the black plague,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone starts dying.</v>

259
00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:34.530
<v Speaker 3>They're having these mass die offs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were.</v>

260
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:39.620
<v Speaker 3>They ran out of room and the cemeteries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they had to dig up all the bones from</v>

261
00:12:39.991 --> 00:12:44.991
<v Speaker 3>the cemetery surrounding Paris and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>took them under Paris into these </v>

262
00:12:44.991 --> 00:12:48.450
<v Speaker 3>limestone quarries and created these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things called Ossuarys,</v>

263
00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:53.451
<v Speaker 3>which are these open air crips and </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone has gone and basically.</v>

264
00:12:53.521 --> 00:12:58.521
<v Speaker 3>So to get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go down these winding steps that go </v>

265
00:12:58.521 --> 00:13:02.361
<v Speaker 3>down and down and down and down and down</v>
<v Speaker 3>and down and down and down and down and </v>

266
00:13:02.461 --> 00:13:07.080
<v Speaker 3>down to a point where you start feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're going crazy because you just</v>

267
00:13:07.081 --> 00:13:12.081
<v Speaker 3>keep seeing more steps and more steps </v>
<v Speaker 3>and more steps and more steps in your </v>

268
00:13:12.081 --> 00:13:14.310
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Starts saying you are going deep,</v>

269
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:15.420
<v Speaker 3>deep underground.</v>

270
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:20.450
<v Speaker 3>Like we're talking like out of breath on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stairmaster steps like way down to </v>

271
00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:25.941
<v Speaker 3>the quarries under the city and you sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of walk around and then suddenly you </v>

272
00:13:25.941 --> 00:13:30.861
<v Speaker 3>come out and do hallways of bones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just yellowed old French bonds that </v>

273
00:13:32.731 --> 00:13:37.731
<v Speaker 3>someone is stacked into a patterns like </v>
<v Speaker 3>crucifixes and it looks like the Texas </v>

274
00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:43.851
<v Speaker 3>chainsaw massacre house when you went in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the movie where they have bone </v>

275
00:13:43.851 --> 00:13:44.490
<v Speaker 3>sculptures everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that.</v>

276
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:49.491
<v Speaker 3>They've just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone just took like a shitload of </v>

277
00:13:49.491 --> 00:13:52.641
<v Speaker 3>femurs and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I could make a crucifix out of </v>

278
00:13:52.641 --> 00:13:53.010
<v Speaker 3>this and like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a cross in the middle.</v>

279
00:13:53.011 --> 00:13:58.011
<v Speaker 3>There's stacks of skulls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say there's 9 million skeletons </v>

280
00:13:58.201 --> 00:14:00.540
<v Speaker 3>down there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>9 million.</v>

281
00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:05.690
<v Speaker 3>So 9 million lives are completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>anonymous now.</v>

282
00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:08.640
<v Speaker 3>No one knows who the fuck they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you see is just,</v>

283
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.880
<v Speaker 3>there's no names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a wall listing who's down </v>

284
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:13.880
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

285
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.240
<v Speaker 3>It's just row upon row upon row of </v>
<v Speaker 3>skulls and skulls and I swear to God,</v>

286
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.160
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be the worst job on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>

287
00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:25.161
<v Speaker 3>I pass this French kid whose job is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sit in a lawn chair down there and </v>

288
00:14:25.161 --> 00:14:27.540
<v Speaker 3>observed people to make sure they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>steal bones.</v>

289
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:32.930
<v Speaker 3>And I walked by the kid and he was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>hail and sick because it's damp down </v>

290
00:14:32.941 --> 00:14:36.000
<v Speaker 3>there and it kinda sounded like he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to himself and French.</v>

291
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.570
<v Speaker 3>He kind of seemed out of his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just sits in bones all day.</v>

292
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Best place to rape ever though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

293
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.620
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to rape and murder </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>

294
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.420
<v Speaker 3>take them down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be perfect.</v>

295
00:14:45.421 --> 00:14:46.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets weirder,</v>

296
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.620
<v Speaker 3>so as it turns out under Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the catacombs at the are in.</v>

297
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:56.830
<v Speaker 3>That's only a fraction of the catacombs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is miles and miles and miles of </v>

298
00:14:57.561 --> 00:15:02.561
<v Speaker 3>wining catacombs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of our waiters told us that people </v>

299
00:15:02.561 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 3>go down there and they get lost and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>find them down there and they've starved</v>

300
00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 3>to death in the and catacombs fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>

301
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.990
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last.</v>

302
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.150
<v Speaker 3>You go down there and the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flashlight runs out.</v>

303
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 3>No one's coming down there and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking so much.</v>

304
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Gets even weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These fucking French police.</v>

305
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:26.411
<v Speaker 3>It's on the Internet and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 3>freaking out and thinking about dying </v>

306
00:15:26.411 --> 00:15:30.611
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine your fucking slash </v>

307
00:15:30.611 --> 00:15:33.691
<v Speaker 3>light goes out and it's so far down like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a basement of earth that just </v>

308
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:37.790
<v Speaker 3>that last moment and then nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blackness.</v>

309
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.340
<v Speaker 3>You start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would start hearing,</v>

310
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.200
<v Speaker 3>start hearing things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start seeing things.</v>

311
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.110
<v Speaker 3>You probably don't send people down </v>
<v Speaker 3>there looking for folks.</v>

312
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.100
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not some.</v>

313
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Not some French mime who got depressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and decided he was going to go down and </v>

314
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:58.031
<v Speaker 3>take a break in the category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is it open to anyone yet that the </v>

315
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Parisian teenagers have their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>entrances and they bring turntables and </v>

316
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:06.590
<v Speaker 3>speakers down there and have dance </v>
<v Speaker 3>parties?</v>

317
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.590
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

318
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.680
<v Speaker 3>So fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to go down there and take </v>

319
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:13.680
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

320
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.311
<v Speaker 3>So we're not going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you imagine what a terrific </v>

321
00:16:17.311 --> 00:16:18.340
<v Speaker 3>combination that would you adopt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

322
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

323
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.560
<v Speaker 6>Well you would definitely never be seen </v>
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

324
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.710
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You would probably just be absorbed with</v>

325
00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:29.711
<v Speaker 6>the energy of what it must have been </v>
<v Speaker 6>like to see millions of people just </v>

326
00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:33.461
<v Speaker 6>right in front of you by some incurable </v>
<v Speaker 6>disease that was inescapable and you had</v>

327
00:16:33.471 --> 00:16:36.540
<v Speaker 6>just had a hope that some of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>genetics would carry on it.</v>

328
00:16:36.541 --> 00:16:39.620
<v Speaker 6>Some people would be able to live </v>
<v Speaker 6>through this shit.</v>

329
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.720
<v Speaker 3>If you ever get serious about your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a.</v>

330
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.290
<v Speaker 3>A cure is the c nine millions goals to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Emr.</v>

331
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:47.380
<v Speaker 6>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

332
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.910
<v Speaker 6>Does it really make you less serious </v>
<v Speaker 6>about your life?</v>

333
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.230
<v Speaker 6>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

334
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.940
<v Speaker 6>it just lets you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

335
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.430
<v Speaker 6>it lets you know that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>

336
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.800
<v Speaker 6>we're very fortunate that shit's going </v>
<v Speaker 6>this way.</v>

337
00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.840
<v Speaker 6>We're very fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were born in 2000.</v>

338
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.990
<v Speaker 6>We're alive in 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're very fortunate.</v>

339
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.690
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just a little while ago,</v>

340
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.700
<v Speaker 6>stuff was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

341
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:11.710
<v Speaker 6>I joke around about being on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when we were in Philly and I was </v>

342
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:15.341
<v Speaker 6>going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you know why the streets are so </v>

343
00:17:15.341 --> 00:17:16.781
<v Speaker 6>narrow around here?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because there were made by people </v>

344
00:17:16.781 --> 00:17:18.350
<v Speaker 6>writing fucking horses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like wrap your head around that.</v>

345
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.780
<v Speaker 6>This city was designed by people who </v>
<v Speaker 6>thought,</v>

346
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.000
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we just need a place to put the horses.</v>

347
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.490
<v Speaker 6>This is where the horses are going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>run.</v>

348
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.010
<v Speaker 6>Like everybody got around it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll fucking city on horses.</v>

349
00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Well there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

350
00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:35.090
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this thing I just read about </v>

351
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:35.090
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a famous,</v>

352
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.020
<v Speaker 3>I think he was an obstetrician and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>died in a mental asylum.</v>

353
00:17:37.021 --> 00:17:38.940
<v Speaker 3>It was unready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He died in a mental asylum.</v>

354
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.010
<v Speaker 3>This is way back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the exact time,</v>

355
00:17:41.011 --> 00:17:44.130
<v Speaker 3>but it was when they still believed in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the humors of the body,</v>

356
00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:46.230
<v Speaker 3>their idea of the way the body worked </v>
<v Speaker 3>was based on,</v>

357
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:51.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bloodletting and they didn't know they </v>

358
00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:51.410
<v Speaker 3>thought</v>

359
00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.980
<v Speaker 7>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They didn't know that flies came from </v>

360
00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.591
<v Speaker 7>fly eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They thought there was something called </v>

361
00:17:57.591 --> 00:17:58.020
<v Speaker 7>spontaneous generation where if you had </v>
<v Speaker 7>the right elements in one place,</v>

362
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.630
<v Speaker 7>it would produce a fly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He,</v>

363
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:05.631
<v Speaker 7>they didn't know there were eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they had these really fascinating </v>

364
00:18:05.631 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 7>ways of understanding the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What year was this?</v>

365
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.900
<v Speaker 7>I don't know the exact year.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you look up spontaneous generation,</v>

366
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.150
<v Speaker 7>it'll pop up the year that they believed</v>
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>

367
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

368
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:19.580
<v Speaker 7>there was a obstetrician who suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 7>came up with this crazy idea.</v>

369
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:25.040
<v Speaker 7>He thought that if doctors wash their </v>
<v Speaker 7>hands between handling,</v>

370
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.480
<v Speaker 7>like doing an autopsy or handling a dead</v>
<v Speaker 7>body and delivering a baby,</v>

371
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.080
<v Speaker 7>then maybe the mothers wouldn't die as </v>
<v Speaker 7>much as they were dying of this </v>

372
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.880
<v Speaker 7>infection called fluorosis.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So he's like,</v>

373
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.070
<v Speaker 7>we should start maybe washing her hands </v>
<v Speaker 7>guys,</v>

374
00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:46.071
<v Speaker 7>after you handle the a rotting corpse </v>
<v Speaker 7>and then put your hand in that lady's </v>

375
00:18:46.071 --> 00:18:46.071
<v Speaker 7>Pussy.</v>

376
00:18:46.071 --> 00:18:50.820
<v Speaker 7>Why don't you wash your hands and um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>doctors were like,</v>

377
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.330
<v Speaker 7>you're a fucking lunatic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You think washing,</v>

378
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.450
<v Speaker 7>you think if we wash our hands after we </v>
<v Speaker 7>handle a corpse and touch a woman's </v>

379
00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.960
<v Speaker 7>open,</v>
<v Speaker 7>open dilated pussy that it's going to </v>

380
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:02.960
<v Speaker 7>keep her from getting the infections </v>
<v Speaker 7>they've been getting.</v>

381
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.960
<v Speaker 7>A gentleman's hands are always clean.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what the doctor said.</v>

382
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.730
<v Speaker 7>No joke.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So this guy,</v>

383
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.610
<v Speaker 7>I tried all these experiments and he </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

384
00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:16.611
<v Speaker 7>he dropped the death rate and one of </v>
<v Speaker 7>these like wards where women are giving </v>

385
00:19:16.611 --> 00:19:20.151
<v Speaker 7>birth to one percent where it was 30 </v>
<v Speaker 7>percent and other places and he kept </v>

386
00:19:20.151 --> 00:19:21.030
<v Speaker 7>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You've got to wash your hands.</v>

387
00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:24.270
<v Speaker 7>You wash it with this kind of chemical </v>
<v Speaker 7>mix and the people won't die.</v>

388
00:19:24.271 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 7>You should wash your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 7>germs are getting into people.</v>

389
00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:28.560
<v Speaker 7>But they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think they knew what germs were.</v>

390
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.160
<v Speaker 7>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the guy died,</v>

391
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.340
<v Speaker 6>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We didn't think it was germs.</v>

392
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.240
<v Speaker 6>Just poison</v>

393
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.620
<v Speaker 7>with evil,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which was.</v>

394
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:41.860
<v Speaker 7>I don't know the explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's really interesting because you </v>

395
00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:41.860
<v Speaker 7>could,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's kind of logical.</v>

396
00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.700
<v Speaker 7>You could see why they would think that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they couldn't accept the idea that </v>

397
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.180
<v Speaker 7>there was microscopic things floating </v>
<v Speaker 7>around,</v>

398
00:19:47.181 --> 00:19:50.390
<v Speaker 7>like even though I guess you could see </v>
<v Speaker 7>them in a microscope for some reason,</v>

399
00:19:50.391 --> 00:19:53.030
<v Speaker 7>they really wanted to deny this in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>same way.</v>

400
00:19:53.031 --> 00:19:58.031
<v Speaker 7>Now when you talk about the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 7>there might be an extra dimensional </v>

401
00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:01.601
<v Speaker 7>aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there are interdimensional beings that </v>

402
00:20:01.601 --> 00:20:01.601
<v Speaker 7>you're seeing through the lens of a </v>
<v Speaker 7>psychedelic.</v>

403
00:20:01.601 --> 00:20:05.720
<v Speaker 7>You tell that to anyone or most people </v>
<v Speaker 7>in there like you are fucking crazy.</v>

404
00:20:05.721 --> 00:20:07.490
<v Speaker 7>You new age.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fucking read it.</v>

405
00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.940
<v Speaker 7>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so the point is the guy died in an </v>

406
00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:12.940
<v Speaker 7>insane asylum for suggesting people </v>
<v Speaker 7>washing,</v>

407
00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.530
<v Speaker 7>wash their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's how dirty everything was back </v>

408
00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:19.991
<v Speaker 7>then.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's how it effected everything was </v>

409
00:20:19.991 --> 00:20:23.040
<v Speaker 7>done in insane.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This guy out of his mind and as you </v>

410
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:23.040
<v Speaker 7>know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>towards the end of his life,</v>

411
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.951
<v Speaker 7>they said he got dementia,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think it was just because he knew </v>

412
00:20:26.951 --> 00:20:30.370
<v Speaker 7>that he had discovered this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that he proved he could save so many </v>

413
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.100
<v Speaker 7>lives and no one will listen to UNC.</v>

414
00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.530
<v Speaker 6>Could you imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

415
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.800
<v Speaker 6>if you were an advanced human and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>were stuck in an advanced age that just </v>

416
00:20:38.171 --> 00:20:43.171
<v Speaker 6>refused to change,</v>
<v Speaker 6>could you imagine if you were a </v>

417
00:20:43.171 --> 00:20:45.871
<v Speaker 6>scientist from 2011 and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>sudden you found yourself in the middle </v>

418
00:20:45.871 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Speaker 6>of the Spanish inquisition?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were.</v>

419
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:52.710
<v Speaker 6>Everyone was ridiculous and people were </v>
<v Speaker 6>just killing people and it was just </v>

420
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.280
<v Speaker 6>insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He couldn't talk to anybody.</v>

421
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:59.281
<v Speaker 6>Just religious fanaticism completely out</v>
<v Speaker 6>of control and murder and all kinds of </v>

422
00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:00.850
<v Speaker 6>crazy shit was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Could you imagine?</v>

423
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was your reality.</v>

424
00:21:02.051 --> 00:21:02.590
<v Speaker 6>All of a sudden,</v>

425
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.910
<v Speaker 7>religious fanaticism,</v>
<v Speaker 7>violent wars raging everywhere.</v>

426
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:08.100
<v Speaker 7>Talla,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tarian,</v>

427
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.290
<v Speaker 7>presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 7>corporations running everything.</v>

428
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.940
<v Speaker 6>This Michele Bachmann lady won the Iowa </v>
<v Speaker 6>Straw poll.</v>

429
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is that?</v>

430
00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.950
<v Speaker 6>He's a fucking dominatrix public and </v>
<v Speaker 6>boys like to get spanked.</v>

431
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 6>We are living in fascinating times.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's when it's ripples like this,</v>

432
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:32.870
<v Speaker 6>like when you hear things like this to </v>
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>

433
00:21:32.871 --> 00:21:36.530
<v Speaker 6>they look like little little ripples on </v>
<v Speaker 6>your universe,</v>

434
00:21:36.531 --> 00:21:38.840
<v Speaker 6>like wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pay attention.</v>

435
00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.060
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot more dumb people that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>think,</v>

436
00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:47.140
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more painfully stupid people in this </v>

437
00:21:47.151 --> 00:21:49.010
<v Speaker 6>country.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of them,</v>

438
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:54.640
<v Speaker 6>tons of them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can't see that she's dumb because </v>

439
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.310
<v Speaker 6>they're way dumber than her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're way dumber than her.</v>

440
00:21:55.311 --> 00:21:56.690
<v Speaker 6>They have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's dumb.</v>

441
00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.720
<v Speaker 6>They think she's got a good message and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they they.</v>

442
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.840
<v Speaker 6>They don't mind her crazy eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't see the crazy eyes.</v>

443
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.670
<v Speaker 6>They don't see the gay husband.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't see him.</v>

444
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.200
<v Speaker 6>He seems like a Nice Fella.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's praying,</v>

445
00:22:07.201 --> 00:22:07.270
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

446
00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.830
<v Speaker 8>gay away.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Grave.</v>

447
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:13.850
<v Speaker 8>The gay away we'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We'll go to bunch of them and hold them </v>

448
00:22:14.811 --> 00:22:18.160
<v Speaker 8>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're going to pray in their underwear,</v>

449
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.780
<v Speaker 6>were hugging each other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shooting loads in their pants.</v>

450
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.180
<v Speaker 6>This is a ridiculous institution.</v>

451
00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:29.610
<v Speaker 7>You have to learn how to shoot a load in</v>
<v Speaker 7>front of men without wanting men.</v>

452
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.550
<v Speaker 6>What is it so hard for people to accept </v>
<v Speaker 6>that people are gay?</v>

453
00:22:33.551 --> 00:22:37.360
<v Speaker 6>What do you give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're gay.</v>

454
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.870
<v Speaker 6>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let them enjoy it.</v>

455
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:42.370
<v Speaker 6>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if it doesn't affect you?</v>

456
00:22:42.371 --> 00:22:43.630
<v Speaker 6>As long as they're not trying to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

457
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.360
<v Speaker 6>Who cares what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't get it.</v>

458
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.720
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to pray it away where </v>

459
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.200
<v Speaker 6>you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The gangway prelude,</v>

460
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:58.790
<v Speaker 7>but you gotta see gotTa.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You gotta understand that relationship </v>

461

482
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:59.861
<v Speaker 7>Like he should be on the front of his </v>
<v Speaker 7>own float in a gay pride parade,</v>

<v Speaker 7>New Jersey.</v>

00:24:43.631 --> 00:24:48.631
<v Speaker 7>I guarantee that place is covered in </v>
<v Speaker 7>pictures of the sick erotic Jesus,</v>

500
00:24:49.121 --> 00:24:50.320
<v Speaker 7>the six pack.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jesus.</v>

501
00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.830
<v Speaker 7>You ever seen those where Jesus has </v>
<v Speaker 7>painted with a six pack on the Cross,</v>

502
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.590
<v Speaker 7>like a Jersey shore situation happening,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he's getting cruised.</v>

503
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.710
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's tons out there.</v>

504
00:24:58.711 --> 00:25:01.300
<v Speaker 7>It's supposed to be starvation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we look at it as like,</v>

505
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:04.600
<v Speaker 7>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's like hardcore crunches.</v>

506
00:25:04.601 --> 00:25:09.601
<v Speaker 7>That's not starvation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but what happens is a lot of these </v>

507
00:25:09.601 --> 00:25:12.241
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>back when they were painting those </v>

508
00:25:12.241 --> 00:25:13.861
<v Speaker 7>pictures were just artists who are </v>
<v Speaker 7>getting paid by the church and they </v>

509
00:25:13.861 --> 00:25:15.980
<v Speaker 7>needed to make money,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they liked the male form and so they</v>

510
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:19.000
<v Speaker 7>were painting like they are making Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 7>hot sex.</v>

511
00:25:19.001 --> 00:25:24.001
<v Speaker 7>Jesus erotic Jesus Christianity's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Christianity is a lot of Christianity's </v>

512
00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:29.370
<v Speaker 7>fucking s and and think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The son of God comes down to the world </v>

513
00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:35.130
<v Speaker 7>and what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 7>He tells the truth and he gets spanked </v>

514
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:37.600
<v Speaker 7>and a crown of thorns and whipped with </v>
<v Speaker 7>lashes and nailed to a fucking cross and</v>

515
00:25:37.601 --> 00:25:40.930
<v Speaker 7>everyone's into it like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>did you see the passion of the Christ?</v>

516
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.300
<v Speaker 7>That's an snm movie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

517
00:25:43.301 --> 00:25:48.301
<v Speaker 7>I've been to the SNM clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tie guys up to fucking crucifixes and </v>

518
00:25:48.941 --> 00:25:51.400
<v Speaker 7>whip him there all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I like black Jesus better.</v>

519
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:52.210
<v Speaker 7>The whole theory of them.</v>

520
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the black Jesus theory,</v>

521
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.460
<v Speaker 1>but because Jesus was supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>sephardic,</v>

522
00:25:56.461 --> 00:25:57.460
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that.</v>

523
00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that the idea?</v>

524
00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.710
<v Speaker 7>I don't know who's hotter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who's hotter.</v>

525
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:06.670
<v Speaker 7>I think it's what I think it goes from </v>
<v Speaker 7>is that everything has to start from </v>

526
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:06.670
<v Speaker 7>black.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not White,</v>

527
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:10.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fascinating that people </v>

528
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.261
<v Speaker 1>want to a lay claim to something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to like that black people </v>

529
00:26:12.541 --> 00:26:14.060
<v Speaker 1>would go like Jesus was black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

530
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.820
<v Speaker 1>like it makes some handle that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life if Jesus was even real,</v>

531
00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.090
<v Speaker 1>but it makes your life today in 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can lay claim to that.</v>

532
00:26:21.091 --> 00:26:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Like we did that we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How annoying is that?</v>

533
00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Like you lay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click like Italians,</v>

534
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.150
<v Speaker 1>like hey with Allianz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

535
00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.600
<v Speaker 1>we built that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did that.</v>

536
00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:28.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did that.</v>

537
00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:34.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not really we dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's we really in this group together </v>

538
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:34.740
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black Jesus,</v>

539
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:35.730
<v Speaker 1>babies lack a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

540
00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.430
<v Speaker 1>let's find Jesus Dot Com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well hate man.</v>

541
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.490
<v Speaker 1>That's just as likely black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus is just as likely as white.</v>

542
00:26:41.491 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Jesus both of were just so squirrely</v>

543
00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:49.290
<v Speaker 5>and so you're just supposed to believe </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the dude came back from the dead </v>

544
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.510
<v Speaker 5>and the and that anybody would write </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he would come back from the dead.</v>

545
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.660
<v Speaker 5>Anything else that you would read from </v>
<v Speaker 5>them would not be equally ridiculous </v>

546
00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.190
<v Speaker 5>because we understand dad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we understand that now and you're,</v>

547
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:04.310
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're saying that we must discount at </v>

548
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:06.741
<v Speaker 5>all scientific knowledge ever just </v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's an ancient book that </v>

549
00:27:07.591 --> 00:27:11.550
<v Speaker 5>says some some stuff and if you go along</v>
<v Speaker 5>with it,</v>

550
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:15.990
<v Speaker 5>you have to just assume that this was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>one time thing and that this one time,</v>

551
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:21.140
<v Speaker 5>these amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>miraculous things that defy science </v>

552
00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.740
<v Speaker 5>happened and we just have to assume that</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people who barely could write shit</v>

553
00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:24.810
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're super accurate about it.</v>

554
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.740
<v Speaker 5>Like it's ridiculous.</v>

555
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.490
<v Speaker 7>Let's even think one step before that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is the religion that they've built</v>

556
00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:35.550
<v Speaker 7>around this thing that based on all </v>
<v Speaker 7>scientific evidence is possibly a myth.</v>

557
00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.350
<v Speaker 7>They have their religion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They based around this character.</v>

558
00:27:41.351 --> 00:27:46.351
<v Speaker 7>Jesus is nowhere close to the things the</v>
<v Speaker 7>character said in the book that they </v>

559
00:27:48.071 --> 00:27:50.290
<v Speaker 7>read.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jesus didn't walk around saying,</v>

560
00:27:50.291 --> 00:27:52.570
<v Speaker 7>you need to go to church.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here's an idea.</v>

561
00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:57.810
<v Speaker 7>Go to build a church and every Sunday go</v>
<v Speaker 7>to the church and sit down and an </v>

562
00:27:58.931 --> 00:28:03.931
<v Speaker 7>uncomfortable seat and read prayers </v>
<v Speaker 7>prewritten from people that you barely </v>

563
00:28:03.931 --> 00:28:08.101
<v Speaker 7>understand and then give 10 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 7>your income to this group of people and </v>

564
00:28:08.141 --> 00:28:10.180
<v Speaker 7>just trust that they're going to use it </v>
<v Speaker 7>in the right way.</v>

565
00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.700
<v Speaker 7>Jesus never said anything like that in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

566
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.140
<v Speaker 7>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

567
00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:15.580
<v Speaker 7>New Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you read this stuff,</v>

568
00:28:15.581 --> 00:28:20.581
<v Speaker 7>mostly the idea of the thing seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you love the people around you as </v>

569
00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:25.780
<v Speaker 7>much as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and if you're tuned into God or the love</v>

570
00:28:25.781 --> 00:28:27.970
<v Speaker 7>force of the universe and you love that </v>
<v Speaker 7>too,</v>

571
00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.790
<v Speaker 7>then you are going to have a great life.</v>

572
00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:33.370
<v Speaker 7>That seems to be the message.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't need a priest.</v>

573
00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.980
<v Speaker 7>You don't need a church.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't need anybody.</v>

574
00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:38.470
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to follow the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the time he was,</v>

575
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:43.500
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in Judaism there are very strict rules </v>

576
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:43.500
<v Speaker 7>about how you're supposed to live.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he was saying,</v>

577
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.151
<v Speaker 7>we don't have to follow these rules.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't have to do anything that you're </v>

578
00:28:48.151 --> 00:28:48.151
<v Speaker 7>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have my own direct connection with the</v>

579
00:28:48.151 --> 00:28:53.041
<v Speaker 7>super intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 7>super abundance of the universe and </v>

580
00:28:53.041 --> 00:28:53.290
<v Speaker 7>that's all I need,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so then they killed them.</v>

581
00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.520
<v Speaker 7>So you've got that and then what builds </v>
<v Speaker 7>up around it?</v>

582
00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.870
<v Speaker 7>Fucking Michelle Bachman,</v>
<v Speaker 7>pray away the gay,</v>

583
00:29:00.871 --> 00:29:05.871
<v Speaker 7>just like Jesus want to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jesus didn't want somebody sticking </v>

584
00:29:05.871 --> 00:29:08.870
<v Speaker 7>their technical and somebody excretory,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a tube and the bid.</v>

585
00:29:08.871 --> 00:29:11.220
<v Speaker 7>They.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jesus wanted people straight.</v>

586
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.980
<v Speaker 7>Only fucking vaginas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The creator of the universe.</v>

587
00:29:13.981 --> 00:29:16.800
<v Speaker 7>It gives them a migraine headache to </v>
<v Speaker 7>know on this planet.</v>

588
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.310
<v Speaker 7>People are sticking their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>genitals and the other people,</v>

589
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.620
<v Speaker 7>the assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's how does that get trends?</v>

590
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:27.940
<v Speaker 7>How does that get translated from </v>
<v Speaker 7>basically the first hippie?</v>

591
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.510
<v Speaker 7>Love each other.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tune into this superintelligence.</v>

592
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.000
<v Speaker 7>It's really creepy and weird.</v>

593
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.880
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever you have some obscure,</v>

594
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to say obscure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but very difficult to put</v>

595
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:47.010
<v Speaker 6>into modern words statement like </v>
<v Speaker 6>whenever you read any of the any </v>

596
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.490
<v Speaker 6>chapters of the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>any,</v>

597
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:53.670
<v Speaker 6>any passages,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he thinks that people quote all the </v>

598
00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:53.670
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of the stuff.</v>

599
00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:53.860
<v Speaker 6>You'll read it and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

600
00:29:53.861 --> 00:29:56.350
<v Speaker 6>what exactly does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what is,</v>

601
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.240
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to back up and,</v>

602
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:03.310
<v Speaker 6>and decipher that into modern language.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was it originally,</v>

603
00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:04.270
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

604
00:30:04.271 --> 00:30:09.271
<v Speaker 6>we know it all came from ancient Hebrew </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then they kind of take it from </v>

605
00:30:09.271 --> 00:30:11.170
<v Speaker 6>ancient Hebrew to Latin Greek.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what the fuck was,</v>

606
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:13.660
<v Speaker 6>what would you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's totally different language.</v>

607
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:15.250
<v Speaker 6>What was the original meaning behind it?</v>

608
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.630
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you got like,</v>

609
00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I used to,</v>

610
00:30:20.771 --> 00:30:25.771
<v Speaker 7>when I was in college,</v>
<v Speaker 7>take lsd and I read the New Testament </v>

611
00:30:25.771 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 7>and it was the most awesome psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing ever because you're reading it and</v>

612
00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:33.790
<v Speaker 7>you're thinking like this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No matter what this is,</v>

613
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:39.450
<v Speaker 7>it's shaped so much of society.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These words are shaped so many people's </v>

614
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:40.570
<v Speaker 7>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so just from that alone,</v>

615
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 7>it's super psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But what did it come from?</v>

616
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.360
<v Speaker 7>What's the original language?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's it based on?</v>

617
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:48.680
<v Speaker 7>There's all these awesome ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

618
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.720
<v Speaker 7>because there's a lot of books of the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the gospels that didn't make it in to</v>

619
00:30:52.721 --> 00:30:57.721
<v Speaker 7>the final cut that are equally valid and</v>
<v Speaker 7>are far more esoteric and uh,</v>

620
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:04.980
<v Speaker 7>have like really weird ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've read stuff that it's based in like </v>

621
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.320
<v Speaker 7>this form of religion called Gnosticism,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I don't know too much about.</v>

622
00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:12.340
<v Speaker 7>I've heard that it's like some weird </v>
<v Speaker 7>desert called called these scenes or </v>

623
00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:16.231
<v Speaker 7>that it's somehow the formulation of all</v>
<v Speaker 7>these different desert mysticisms kind </v>

624
00:31:16.231 --> 00:31:17.020
<v Speaker 7>of merging into the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

625
00:31:17.021 --> 00:31:22.021
<v Speaker 7>they embodied it in the form of this </v>
<v Speaker 7>person to transmit this bigger </v>

626
00:31:22.021 --> 00:31:23.500
<v Speaker 7>information about the idea that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

627
00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:28.210
<v Speaker 7>we're all children of some super </v>
<v Speaker 7>intelligence and that if we give up our,</v>

628
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:33.400
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>greed and selfishness and love other </v>

629
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.230
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like we love ourselves,</v>

630
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.240
<v Speaker 7>then that would create like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

631
00:31:37.241 --> 00:31:40.750
<v Speaker 7>if everyone did that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then we would be living on this would be</v>

632
00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.530
<v Speaker 7>utopia.</v>

633
00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 7>We will be in some kind of super </v>
<v Speaker 7>communist,</v>

634
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:49.080
<v Speaker 7>mystical,</v>
<v Speaker 7>spiritual state where everyone's </v>

635
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.661
<v Speaker 7>completely connected with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like imagine really feeling about </v>

636
00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.100
<v Speaker 7>everyone around you the same way you </v>
<v Speaker 7>feel about yourself.</v>

637
00:31:54.101 --> 00:31:56.290
<v Speaker 7>It means don't differentiate other </v>
<v Speaker 7>people from your life.</v>

638
00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.290
<v Speaker 7>No more differentiation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're all the same.</v>

639
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:04.500
<v Speaker 7>We're all completely connected.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're all children of this universe and </v>

640
00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:06.180
<v Speaker 7>so we should treat each other love.</v>

641
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.110
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't work with society though,</v>

642
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.710
<v Speaker 6>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like we would do,</v>

643
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:15.740
<v Speaker 6>they would have to be some gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 6>event that got rid of get rid of </v>

644
00:32:16.821 --> 00:32:21.821
<v Speaker 6>currency or got rid of the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 6>competing for currency because until p,</v>

645
00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.390
<v Speaker 6>as long as people are still competing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>competing for job positions,</v>

646
00:32:26.391 --> 00:32:29.450
<v Speaker 6>competing their company against other </v>
<v Speaker 6>companies,</v>

647
00:32:29.451 --> 00:32:31.990
<v Speaker 6>and as long as there's capitalism going </v>
<v Speaker 6>on that,</v>

648
00:32:31.991 --> 00:32:34.070
<v Speaker 6>that push for money,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that push to make money,</v>

649
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:39.840
<v Speaker 6>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're always going to get this same </v>

650
00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:39.840
<v Speaker 6>kind of Douchey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cunty,</v>

651
00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.700
<v Speaker 6>chimp behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

652
00:32:40.701 --> 00:32:42.150
<v Speaker 6>it's a competition.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a,</v>

653
00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.590
<v Speaker 6>it's obvious way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Obvious that most people are working way</v>

654
00:32:45.591 --> 00:32:50.180
<v Speaker 6>harder than is both healthy and is </v>
<v Speaker 6>desirable.</v>

655
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:55.270
<v Speaker 6>They're working ridiculous hours and </v>
<v Speaker 6>pushing harder than ever because they </v>

656
00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:56.180
<v Speaker 6>need more money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They want more money,</v>

657
00:32:56.181 --> 00:32:58.970
<v Speaker 6>they need more money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like there's a drive,</v>

658
00:32:58.971 --> 00:33:03.050
<v Speaker 6>like a fucking wild machine behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

659
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.590
<v Speaker 6>That's as long as that's there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck man.</v>

660
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:10.760
<v Speaker 6>How are you going to get everybody to </v>
<v Speaker 6>just just have resources available?</v>

661
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:14.360
<v Speaker 6>You're going to trust people to work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to trust everyone to put in</v>

662
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:16.340
<v Speaker 6>their share.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like all of us are going to trust all of</v>

663
00:33:16.341 --> 00:33:18.290
<v Speaker 6>us and what do we do when someone </v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't.</v>

664
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.230
<v Speaker 6>Even if we're supposed to love them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we love ourselves.</v>

665
00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:26.240
<v Speaker 6>We just supposed to let them just fuck </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything up all around them and let </v>

666
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.341
<v Speaker 6>them go into super sabotaged spin out </v>
<v Speaker 6>mode where they destroy everything in </v>

667
00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:32.960
<v Speaker 6>their vicinity and nobody stops him from</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing that because that's like a spoiled</v>

668
00:33:32.961 --> 00:33:33.940
<v Speaker 6>child.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've seen that</v>

669
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.610
<v Speaker 7>before.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

670
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.590
<v Speaker 7>That's the other crazy aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 7>Christianity.</v>

671
00:33:37.591 --> 00:33:42.591
<v Speaker 7>Is it ultra pacifism?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like super positivism and the </v>

672
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:45.510
<v Speaker 7>message of the thing was supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

673
00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:50.540
<v Speaker 7>this being that they're killing is the </v>
<v Speaker 7>physical manifestation of the universe.</v>

674
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.840
<v Speaker 7>It could do a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>could fight back.</v>

675
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.790
<v Speaker 7>It could shoot lasers out of its eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a superhero,</v>

676
00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.820
<v Speaker 7>but it's letting itself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

677
00:33:59.821 --> 00:34:01.890
<v Speaker 7>I'm calling Jesus in net.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whatever he is,</v>

678
00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.660
<v Speaker 7>he's a wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a wedding itself.</v>

679
00:34:03.661 --> 00:34:06.960
<v Speaker 7>Get killed to give a message,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the message is this.</v>

680
00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:12.530
<v Speaker 7>There are some things that are more </v>
<v Speaker 7>important than life and if you want to </v>

681
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:13.680
<v Speaker 7>get caught up in this dimension and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>want to save your body,</v>

682
00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.410
<v Speaker 7>you want to try to save your body,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go ahead.</v>

683
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:18.480
<v Speaker 7>It's going to die no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're dead meat.</v>

684
00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.910
<v Speaker 7>It's like there's no way you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 7>make it through this dimension.</v>

685
00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:23.670
<v Speaker 7>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no one makes it out alive.</v>

686
00:34:23.671 --> 00:34:27.120
<v Speaker 7>Whatever Jim Morrison said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we all know and gets out of this alive.</v>

687
00:34:27.121 --> 00:34:32.121
<v Speaker 7>We all die.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if you want to like focus and fixate </v>

688
00:34:32.121 --> 00:34:32.370
<v Speaker 7>on protecting yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fine.</v>

689
00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:37.610
<v Speaker 7>But the idea is like the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're supposed to completely surrender </v>

690
00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:38.740
<v Speaker 7>to this energy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

691
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.480
<v Speaker 7>And then when in regard and once you </v>
<v Speaker 7>really make that move,</v>

692
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.030
<v Speaker 7>which they say is an act of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I mean,</v>

693
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:46.110
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>by the way,</v>

694
00:34:46.111 --> 00:34:50.670
<v Speaker 7>this is purely speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have not given my heart to Jesus,</v>

695
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:53.740
<v Speaker 7>but I am.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think about,</v>

696
00:34:53.741 --> 00:34:56.310
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what would happen if you did just become</v>

697
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:57.930
<v Speaker 7>completely everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

698
00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.680
<v Speaker 7>What would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean obviously it's not possible,</v>

699
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.180
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But why?</v>

700
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:09.220
<v Speaker 6>But why and who would make cars and how </v>
<v Speaker 6>could there be competition?</v>

701
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.680
<v Speaker 6>How is there this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

702
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.540
<v Speaker 6>how would there be any form of </v>
<v Speaker 6>capitalism?</v>

703
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:14.920
<v Speaker 6>The way we have it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how?</v>

704
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:18.250
<v Speaker 6>How would our society,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the monetary system,</v>

705
00:35:18.251 --> 00:35:20.170
<v Speaker 6>how would it be set up the way that it </v>
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't be?</v>

706
00:35:20.171 --> 00:35:21.520
<v Speaker 6>It couldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's impossible.</v>

707
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:22.640
<v Speaker 6>It's impossible</v>

708
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.360
<v Speaker 7>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The church couldn't exist.</v>

709
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.300
<v Speaker 7>Society couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

710
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.050
<v Speaker 6>so how would we revamp it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How would we,</v>

711
00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.030
<v Speaker 6>how would we put it all into </v>
<v Speaker 6>perspective?</v>

712
00:35:30.031 --> 00:35:35.031
<v Speaker 6>Put it all into order.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How would we ensure that everyone </v>

713
00:35:35.031 --> 00:35:35.460
<v Speaker 6>follows along with it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're not.</v>

714
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:40.910
<v Speaker 6>Is that like a net?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that next stage of evolution is the </v>

715
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:44.031
<v Speaker 6>next stage of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The idea that people have gotten to a </v>

716
00:35:44.031 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 6>point technologically where we can start</v>
<v Speaker 6>to join together as one thing.</v>

717
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I'm saying like that there</v>

718
00:35:48.511 --> 00:35:53.511
<v Speaker 6>had to be a certain peak of competition </v>
<v Speaker 6>to get us to a point where we have </v>

719
00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:58.821
<v Speaker 6>created some really boundary dissolving </v>
<v Speaker 6>technology and when that point happens,</v>

720
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 6>then through that very technology at as </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the Internet,</v>

721
00:36:03.511 --> 00:36:08.511
<v Speaker 6>people slowly start to assimilate to </v>
<v Speaker 6>some level of understanding and </v>

722
00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 6>awareness that wasn't previously </v>
<v Speaker 6>achieved because there was this constant</v>

723
00:36:12.931 --> 00:36:17.420
<v Speaker 6>state of of competition to try to get to</v>
<v Speaker 6>that</v>

724
00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:22.530
<v Speaker 7>technological point and that's where you</v>
<v Speaker 7>run into a problem because once you </v>

725
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.350
<v Speaker 7>start getting to that state that you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>talking about,</v>

726
00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.350
<v Speaker 7>and I think a lot of people are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We add it right now.</v>

727
00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.720
<v Speaker 7>We are right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

728
00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:32.820
<v Speaker 7>and that's when you get to that state </v>
<v Speaker 7>and suddenly you're in Egypt because </v>

729
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.900
<v Speaker 7>you're starting to understand about </v>
<v Speaker 7>what's going on and you're you.</v>

730
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:39.910
<v Speaker 7>You're getting this information from the</v>
<v Speaker 7>Internet showing you what other people </v>

731
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.500
<v Speaker 7>in other parts of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how they are living.</v>

732
00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:46.890
<v Speaker 7>The point is suddenly like a lot of shit</v>
<v Speaker 7>start seeming really like we've been </v>

733
00:36:47.921 --> 00:36:52.921
<v Speaker 7>asked to believe a lot of stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 7>Kinda like you ask your kids to believe </v>

734
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:54.950
<v Speaker 7>a lot of stuff when they're growing up </v>
<v Speaker 7>and you do it to keep them safe.</v>

735
00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:57.160
<v Speaker 7>You tell them these stories and you want</v>
<v Speaker 7>them to believe it,</v>

736
00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:02.370
<v Speaker 7>but eventually your kid knows that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know whatever story you told him </v>

737
00:37:02.831 --> 00:37:07.831
<v Speaker 7>about where the baby came from is coming</v>
<v Speaker 7>from isn't completely real and your </v>

738
00:37:07.831 --> 00:37:08.980
<v Speaker 7>kid's going to start wanting to know the</v>
<v Speaker 7>truth.</v>

739
00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 7>And then at that age you tell your kid </v>
<v Speaker 7>the truth and it's uncomfortable or </v>

740
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 7>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even tell them the truth.</v>

741
00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:18.730
<v Speaker 7>But now it's like we still have kings.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have kings and Queens.</v>

742
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:23.790
<v Speaker 7>Their king.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's still serious kings and you're </v>

743
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:27.061
<v Speaker 7>expecting people to keep believing this </v>
<v Speaker 7>king is any more special than anyone </v>

744
00:37:27.061 --> 00:37:27.061
<v Speaker 7>else.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I.</v>

745
00:37:27.061 --> 00:37:31.590
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you want me to keep buying this thing </v>

746
00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:31.590
<v Speaker 7>about the king,</v>
<v Speaker 7>about how he gets to wear the throne and</v>

747
00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:35.761
<v Speaker 7>gets to have the giant fucking a mansion</v>
<v Speaker 7>that he lives in and all this property </v>

748
00:37:35.761 --> 00:37:38.230
<v Speaker 7>lives in because he's a king and he's in</v>
<v Speaker 7>the bloodline is somewhat.</v>

749
00:37:38.231 --> 00:37:41.050
<v Speaker 7>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're all the same man.</v>

750
00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.990
<v Speaker 7>I got to keep playing this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>masquerade party with you.</v>

751
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:44.510
<v Speaker 7>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

752
00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:47.920
<v Speaker 7>How much longer do I have to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because I'm hungry.</v>

753
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.860
<v Speaker 7>It's like that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People are like,</v>

754
00:37:50.861 --> 00:37:52.090
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

755
00:37:52.091 --> 00:37:53.350
<v Speaker 7>so you're a president.</v>

756
00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:55.120
<v Speaker 7>Oh I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

757
00:37:55.121 --> 00:37:57.610
<v Speaker 7>So I guess I'm supposed to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a government,</v>

758
00:37:57.611 --> 00:38:01.030
<v Speaker 7>which is mostly just like 120 year old </v>
<v Speaker 7>men in a room.</v>

759
00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:06.660
<v Speaker 7>I'm supposed to believe they're the ones</v>
<v Speaker 7>who know how to do everything and that </v>

760
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:06.700
<v Speaker 7>system the right way and it's like all </v>
<v Speaker 7>that stuff starts,</v>

761
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.620
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>spreading or people like,</v>

762
00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:10.630
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if I can believe the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're a cop.</v>

763
00:38:10.631 --> 00:38:13.390
<v Speaker 7>I'm a person thing getting kind of hard </v>
<v Speaker 7>for me.</v>

764
00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:18.391
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I believe it because you got a billy </v>

765
00:38:18.391 --> 00:38:18.910
<v Speaker 7>club and you're fucking beating my </v>
<v Speaker 7>friend in a wheelchair to death,</v>

766
00:38:18.911 --> 00:38:23.020
<v Speaker 7>but I'm not sure if you really represent</v>
<v Speaker 7>the real authority of the world.</v>

767
00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:28.200
<v Speaker 7>And so that kind of stuff starts </v>
<v Speaker 7>emerging in emerging as people evolve </v>

768
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.650
<v Speaker 7>and the authority and the world like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck,</v>

769
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.740
<v Speaker 7>I gotta believe the game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you don't believe it's fucking game,</v>

770
00:38:32.741 --> 00:38:35.200
<v Speaker 7>where did we don't know what to do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What are we gonna do?</v>

771
00:38:35.201 --> 00:38:37.360
<v Speaker 7>We can't just reformat everything all of</v>
<v Speaker 7>a sudden.</v>

772
00:38:37.361 --> 00:38:37.630
<v Speaker 7>I.</v>

773
00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:42.820
<v Speaker 5>So do you think that law enforcement </v>
<v Speaker 5>almost inhibits evolution by creating </v>

774
00:38:42.831 --> 00:38:46.010
<v Speaker 5>this culture where people are getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly in trouble with things?</v>

775
00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:46.550
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

776
00:38:46.551 --> 00:38:48.920
<v Speaker 7>you know what law enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a lot of law enforcement is,</v>

777
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:52.340
<v Speaker 7>it's delivery drivers for the prison </v>
<v Speaker 7>industrial complex.</v>

778
00:38:52.341 --> 00:38:55.220
<v Speaker 7>They deliver fucking bags of gold to the</v>
<v Speaker 7>prisons.</v>

779
00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.530
<v Speaker 7>Drop them off at the door and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucked.</v>

780
00:38:57.531 --> 00:38:59.960
<v Speaker 7>You make so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think we need cops.</v>

781
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.990
<v Speaker 7>We need cops.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No question about it.</v>

782
00:39:02.991 --> 00:39:05.530
<v Speaker 7>Watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Richard Pryor joke about like,</v>

783
00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.890
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we need prisons.</v>

784
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:08.420
<v Speaker 7>Have you ever seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So funny,</v>

785
00:39:08.421 --> 00:39:13.421
<v Speaker 7>but we need.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There are aspects and elements of </v>

786
00:39:13.421 --> 00:39:14.810
<v Speaker 7>society that need to be in a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

787
00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.520
<v Speaker 7>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>

788
00:39:16.521 --> 00:39:18.470
<v Speaker 7>you don't need to be in a cage or </v>
<v Speaker 7>smoking pie.</v>

789
00:39:18.471 --> 00:39:21.290
<v Speaker 7>You don't need to be in a cage for </v>
<v Speaker 7>taking your acid or taking mushrooms.</v>

790
00:39:21.291 --> 00:39:26.291
<v Speaker 7>You don't need to be in a cage because </v>
<v Speaker 7>you told people that the military was </v>

791
00:39:26.541 --> 00:39:29.660
<v Speaker 7>using fucking military choppers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the gun down reporters,</v>

792
00:39:29.661 --> 00:39:31.370
<v Speaker 7>and you had the balls to tell that to </v>
<v Speaker 7>the world.</v>

793
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:33.050
<v Speaker 7>That's no reason to put someone in a </v>
<v Speaker 7>cage.</v>

794
00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:37.940
<v Speaker 7>So it's like it's some point as a </v>
<v Speaker 7>certain number of people realize,</v>

795
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.800
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is like a kid's game.</v>

796
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:44.870
<v Speaker 7>This is a game of make believe that went</v>
<v Speaker 7>way too far and I don't feel like doing </v>

797
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:47.840
<v Speaker 7>this game of make believe anymore </v>
<v Speaker 7>because it's destroying the planet.</v>

798
00:39:47.841 --> 00:39:49.940
<v Speaker 7>So you got to come up with a new game </v>
<v Speaker 7>that works,</v>

799
00:39:49.941 --> 00:39:54.941
<v Speaker 7>but how are you going to convince those </v>
<v Speaker 7>60 or 120 old fucking drooling men </v>

800
00:39:55.610 --> 00:40:00.610
<v Speaker 7>shitting their pants,</v>
<v Speaker 7>getting payoffs from the tobacco </v>

801
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:01.740
<v Speaker 7>companies writing bullshit laws with our</v>
<v Speaker 7>visitation.</v>

802
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:03.470
<v Speaker 7>How are you going to like convince them </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

803
00:40:03.471 --> 00:40:08.471
<v Speaker 7>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do you guys mind going home and </v>

804
00:40:08.471 --> 00:40:12.610
<v Speaker 7>we're going to get some like young </v>
<v Speaker 7>people in here because they understand </v>

805
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:12.610
<v Speaker 7>more.</v>

806
00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:18.350
<v Speaker 5>Do you understand the world?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we don't understand the economic </v>

807
00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:18.350
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

808
00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:20.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure some young people do lose young</v>
<v Speaker 5>people right now protesting,</v>

809
00:40:20.161 --> 00:40:20.790
<v Speaker 5>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>

810
00:40:20.791 --> 00:40:21.960
<v Speaker 5>I know I understand it.</v>

811
00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:23.310
<v Speaker 7>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>

812
00:40:23.311 --> 00:40:24.630
<v Speaker 7>I know I.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>

813
00:40:24.631 --> 00:40:26.310
<v Speaker 7>I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All I understand.</v>

814
00:40:26.311 --> 00:40:28.410
<v Speaker 7>Is that video,</v>
<v Speaker 7>did you see that video I sent you today?</v>

815
00:40:28.411 --> 00:40:29.580
<v Speaker 7>Did you watch that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fucking.</v>

816
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:33.300
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a marine who is like,</v>

817
00:40:33.301 --> 00:40:38.301
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he starts off and kind of dramatically </v>

818
00:40:38.301 --> 00:40:39.630
<v Speaker 7>rips off his is a fucking metals and </v>
<v Speaker 7>he's like,</v>

819
00:40:39.631 --> 00:40:44.631
<v Speaker 7>I'm not gonna do it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then he just starts going into </v>

820
00:40:44.631 --> 00:40:46.761
<v Speaker 7>graphic depictions of the different </v>
<v Speaker 7>innocent people he killed and he was in </v>

821
00:40:46.761 --> 00:40:51.141
<v Speaker 7>Iraq and how like the marines at </v>
<v Speaker 7>completely different when there's </v>

822
00:40:51.141 --> 00:40:54.750
<v Speaker 7>embedded with them a reporter than they </v>
<v Speaker 7>do and how the is now.</v>

823
00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:56.730
<v Speaker 7>Now is this real?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't investigate it.</v>

824
00:40:56.731 --> 00:40:57.940
<v Speaker 7>I hope it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I hope it's.</v>

825
00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.570
<v Speaker 7>It seemed very real and he talked about </v>
<v Speaker 7>how his squad commander,</v>

826
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.810
<v Speaker 7>whatever it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 7>said that they would,</v>

827
00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:09.860
<v Speaker 7>he would congratulate them on their </v>
<v Speaker 7>first kill and he said whichever one of </v>

828
00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.620
<v Speaker 7>you makes your first kill by stabbing </v>
<v Speaker 7>someone to death,</v>

829
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:18.450
<v Speaker 7>I'm giving you four days leave and why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like that kind of shit.</v>

830
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.300
<v Speaker 7>Like how are you going to convince those</v>
<v Speaker 7>guys?</v>

831
00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:23.930
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we should all just love each other.</v>

832
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:25.370
<v Speaker 9>Every general.</v>

833
00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:28.530
<v Speaker 7>How do you stop it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't,</v>

834
00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.270
<v Speaker 7>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no way to stop it.</v>

835
00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:35.330
<v Speaker 7>There's no way to stop it unless </v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody invents something that think </v>

836
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:35.330
<v Speaker 7>would</v>

837
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:36.110
<v Speaker 3>change the world and I'd be glad to tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>you what it is.</v>

838
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:37.070
<v Speaker 3>What is it</v>

839
00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:43.780
<v Speaker 9>had genetic scientist needs to figure </v>
<v Speaker 9>out a way to put lsd and have a common </v>

840
00:41:46.571 --> 00:41:49.010
<v Speaker 9>cold so that any.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So the.</v>

841
00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:49.530
<v Speaker 9>So the</v>

842
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.690
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experience would spread like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a virus through society.</v>

843
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:55.580
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then like,</v>

844
00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.370
<v Speaker 3>but the problem with it is you'd have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to design it.</v>

845
00:41:58.371 --> 00:42:00.920
<v Speaker 3>So it only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tolerance is really huge.</v>

846
00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Civil a person only gets at once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem with it.</v>

847
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's a doctor.</v>

848
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.830
<v Speaker 3>The problem with it is I think there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>several problems with that.</v>

849
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:16.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some other problems I suppose </v>

850
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.870
<v Speaker 3>really up to you to decide whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>people should be getting,</v>

851
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:18.960
<v Speaker 3>but you're trying to invent this right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now in your house right now,</v>

852
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a chemist.</v>

853
00:42:20.151 --> 00:42:22.430
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just throwing it out there.</v>

854
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:23.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He threw it out there.</v>

855
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:25.280
<v Speaker 3>You really did you fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

856
00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:30.281
<v Speaker 3>Way To.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody might be actually thinking </v>

857
00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:30.281
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

858
00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:30.281
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So look,</v>

859
00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:30.281
<v Speaker 3>here's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

860
00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:35.021
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's just keep running things the </v>

861
00:42:35.021 --> 00:42:35.021
<v Speaker 3>way they're running.</v>

862
00:42:35.021 --> 00:42:35.021
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that's going on either,</v>

863
00:42:35.021 --> 00:42:35.860
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you're.</v>

864
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:39.080
<v Speaker 6>You're not happy with the pace that </v>
<v Speaker 6>things are accelerating too.</v>

865
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.400
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking you can genetically </v>
<v Speaker 6>engineer it on your own or can you?</v>

866
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:46.460
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that's what you're there for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe the guy who does that.</v>

867
00:42:46.461 --> 00:42:49.820
<v Speaker 6>That really is his purpose in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>evolutionary chain.</v>

868
00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:55.060
<v Speaker 6>He was supposed to step in and just see </v>
<v Speaker 6>a new leap that others weren't willing </v>

869
00:42:55.491 --> 00:43:00.491
<v Speaker 6>to take and so he dragged everyone along</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he was responsible for the next </v>

870
00:43:00.491 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 6>hiccup in evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just gave someone a manifesto.</v>

871
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.840
<v Speaker 6>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's some fucking dude living in one </v>

872
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.510
<v Speaker 6>of those loft apartments where you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>drive your car up in an elevator and </v>

873
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:12.020
<v Speaker 6>he's by himself right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Carving is bullied of his knife.</v>

874
00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.760
<v Speaker 3>Invest in tie dye and Hendrix now.</v>

875
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:20.260
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's an interesting fucking idea </v>

876
00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.830
<v Speaker 6>that someone could engineer a virus that</v>
<v Speaker 6>would induce a psychedelic state.</v>

877
00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or some kind of state.</v>

878
00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:25.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that possible?</v>

879
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.700
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

880
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.990
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

881
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.280
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

882
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:28.220
<v Speaker 6>it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems like if it.</v>

883
00:43:28.221 --> 00:43:31.090
<v Speaker 6>It can affect your body the way some </v>
<v Speaker 6>things can.</v>

884
00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:36.170
<v Speaker 6>Some codes can affect your body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>should be able to engineer something </v>

885
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.170
<v Speaker 6>that should affect it affects you</v>

886
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:39.910
<v Speaker 3>something that is a byproduct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It creates a tryptamine.</v>

887
00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:41.580
<v Speaker 6>When you think about a man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you,</v>

888
00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:46.640
<v Speaker 6>when you do Mtma and the next day you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you sort of feel like you came down </v>

889
00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:46.650
<v Speaker 6>from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from a cold,</v>

890
00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:50.700
<v Speaker 6>you sort of feel like you had a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so like your body was fighting something</v>

891
00:43:50.701 --> 00:43:51.040
<v Speaker 6>unless</v>

892
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.650
<v Speaker 4>you use roll off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that stuff work?</v>

893
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:54.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does work.</v>

894
00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:59.780
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't really work well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like he doesn't want to </v>

895
00:43:59.780 --> 00:43:59.780
<v Speaker 4>completely bring you to a 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't,</v>

896
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:04.051
<v Speaker 4>I haven't done much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I haven't done mdm made much or </v>

897
00:44:04.051 --> 00:44:04.940
<v Speaker 4>molly or whatever it's called a much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

898
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:09.990
<v Speaker 4>I did once without having that and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>once with having it and it was totally </v>

899
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:11.080
<v Speaker 4>big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big,</v>

900
00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.910
<v Speaker 4>big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no hangover at all,</v>

901
00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:17.970
<v Speaker 4>like the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's just like you take it before </v>

902
00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.311
<v Speaker 4>you do it and then after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right before you go to roll on and roll </v>

903
00:44:20.311 --> 00:44:20.311
<v Speaker 4>off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a.</v>

904
00:44:20.311 --> 00:44:23.050
<v Speaker 4>So you really didn't feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything funky?</v>

905
00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:24.210
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

906
00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.560
<v Speaker 4>you're going to probably have a hangover</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter what,</v>

907
00:44:26.561 --> 00:44:29.320
<v Speaker 4>but I definitely felt that felt way </v>
<v Speaker 4>better than the last time I did.</v>

908
00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 4>I hate that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So not only did that stuff</v>

909
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 6>once because the feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was too much though.</v>

910
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:37.910
<v Speaker 6>That feeling was too terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just felt I was in,</v>

911
00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 6>I was in a coffee shop the next day and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I bought a magazine with me sitting </v>

912
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:47.241
<v Speaker 6>there drinking a cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to read this magazine I couldn't </v>

913
00:44:47.241 --> 00:44:47.241
<v Speaker 6>read,</v>
<v Speaker 6>couldn't focus,</v>

914
00:44:47.241 --> 00:44:50.450
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't focus on the words.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't put my head into a paragraph,</v>

915
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:51.840
<v Speaker 6>couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I was like,</v>

916
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.370
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is terrible.</v>

917
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.550
<v Speaker 6>This is terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>terrible place for your brain to be.</v>

918
00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:00.030
<v Speaker 6>And I went on stage and I felt that it </v>
<v Speaker 6>was like 80 percent.</v>

919
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 6>Even though I hit all the beats,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

920
00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:07.650
<v Speaker 6>I did all my material correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I felt like it was only like 80 percent,</v>

921
00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:12.651
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like my brain was just not capable of </v>

922
00:45:12.651 --> 00:45:14.330
<v Speaker 6>totally connecting to an,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the material I was.</v>

923
00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:15.150
<v Speaker 6>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

924
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:16.980
<v Speaker 6>like you know how it is when you're in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the groove,</v>

925
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:22.040
<v Speaker 6>when you're onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're totally connected to the </v>

926
00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:22.040
<v Speaker 6>material.</v>

927
00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.150
<v Speaker 6>You know where the beats are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you feel it,</v>

928
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.610
<v Speaker 6>you're in the jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know you're in there,</v>

929
00:45:26.611 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

930
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 6>you're totally in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but sometimes not.</v>

931
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:34.910
<v Speaker 6>And then this time I just could not </v>
<v Speaker 6>force myself into it as I was saying </v>

932
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:35.940
<v Speaker 6>everything correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I couldn't quite keep up with it.</v>

933
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:38.460
<v Speaker 6>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is terrible for your brain.</v>

934
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:41.810
<v Speaker 6>I've never had that feeling before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like a feeling of like a,</v>

935
00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:43.770
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a dullness,</v>

936
00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:47.910
<v Speaker 6>like a dying battery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I felt awful.</v>

937
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:49.860
<v Speaker 6>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not worth it,</v>

938
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.320
<v Speaker 6>but I did learn a lot when I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

939
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.980
<v Speaker 6>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got a big lesson about,</v>

940
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:56.650
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

941
00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:00.170
<v Speaker 6>insecurity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing that hit me the most is</v>

942
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.110
<v Speaker 6>that God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if everybody was like,</v>

943
00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:07.350
<v Speaker 6>like in some sort of a way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the way people are during an acid trip </v>

944
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:08.910
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or an MDM may trip,</v>

945
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:14.090
<v Speaker 6>it's like you would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you never would have to worry about </v>

946
00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:14.090
<v Speaker 6>fights ever again.</v>

947
00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:15.900
<v Speaker 6>You would never have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 6>people being douchey to each other.</v>

948
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:21.080
<v Speaker 6>If somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the brain can be engineered to operate </v>

949
00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.140
<v Speaker 6>those rpms on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like as now the idea is that you take </v>

950
00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:24.630
<v Speaker 6>this Mtma,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you take ecstasy,</v>

951
00:46:24.631 --> 00:46:29.631
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck it is and it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it makes you high for a brief moment and</v>

952
00:46:29.821 --> 00:46:34.821
<v Speaker 6>then brings you down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But what if the mind could sustain those</v>

953
00:46:35.971 --> 00:46:39.030
<v Speaker 6>levels of those chemicals on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 6>basis?</v>

954
00:46:39.031 --> 00:46:41.580
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that not possible?</v>

955
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:45.510
<v Speaker 6>Why would anyone assume we could not </v>
<v Speaker 6>evolve to that?</v>

956
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:50.511
<v Speaker 6>If we've come to this point from some </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit throwing know tree swinging little </v>

957
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:57.080
<v Speaker 6>monkey people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if that's what we used to be and we've </v>

958
00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:00.411
<v Speaker 6>come this far,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we can't take that other leap to have </v>

959
00:47:00.411 --> 00:47:04.250
<v Speaker 6>the levels of chemicals in our brains </v>
<v Speaker 6>operate so that you would be like you </v>

960
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:08.361
<v Speaker 6>were on ecstasy all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That would be the way to engineer a </v>

961
00:47:08.611 --> 00:47:11.210
<v Speaker 6>loving culture because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

962
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:16.250
<v Speaker 6>I did not feel stupid when I was on it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which was very amazing that I could </v>

963
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.240
<v Speaker 6>think very clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I remember thinking,</v>

964
00:47:18.241 --> 00:47:23.241
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how silly is our or my insecurities and </v>

965
00:47:23.241 --> 00:47:26.630
<v Speaker 6>my silly imagine like in another </v>
<v Speaker 6>universe where instead of building an </v>

966
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:29.130
<v Speaker 6>atomic bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Einstein,</v>

967
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 6>these scientists</v>

968
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:35.100
<v Speaker 7>had come up with these theories in </v>
<v Speaker 7>physics have a way to create like a,</v>

969
00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:40.780
<v Speaker 7>some kind of device that blasts pure </v>
<v Speaker 7>love and the people so that when it goes</v>

970
00:47:40.781 --> 00:47:45.781
<v Speaker 7>off the city that it's in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone in the city gets filled with </v>

971
00:47:45.781 --> 00:47:48.430
<v Speaker 7>like as though you are on the best </v>
<v Speaker 7>ecstasy on the planet,</v>

972
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:53.460
<v Speaker 7>that level of love.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you're at war with a country and </v>

973
00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.911
<v Speaker 7>instead of destroying them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're just blasting them with love </v>

974
00:47:56.911 --> 00:48:00.571
<v Speaker 7>chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that there's no way that they can </v>

975
00:48:00.571 --> 00:48:00.571
<v Speaker 7>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's going to poison a big population of</v>

976
00:48:00.571 --> 00:48:03.950
<v Speaker 4>people with us are setting yourself up </v>
<v Speaker 4>as that guy.</v>

977
00:48:03.951 --> 00:48:08.951
<v Speaker 4>You're Johnny appleseed for Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're good at it.</v>

978
00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:11.660
<v Speaker 4>I think I actually said Johnny appleseed</v>
<v Speaker 4>incorrectly,</v>

979
00:48:11.661 --> 00:48:16.661
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have we ever discussed to Johnny </v>

980
00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:18.401
<v Speaker 4>appleseed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it existed then what did he do </v>

981
00:48:18.401 --> 00:48:21.071
<v Speaker 4>again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He spread out apples throughout the </v>

982
00:48:21.071 --> 00:48:21.071
<v Speaker 4>midwest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't be,</v>

983
00:48:21.071 --> 00:48:22.610
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't be the Johnny appleseed of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ecstasy,</v>

984
00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.470
<v Speaker 4>Ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

985
00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't mind.</v>

986
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:27.980
<v Speaker 7>That's what would be a great,</v>
<v Speaker 7>great claim to fame.</v>

987
00:48:27.981 --> 00:48:32.981
<v Speaker 7>But I'm not going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I really obviously would never poison </v>

988
00:48:32.981 --> 00:48:33.800
<v Speaker 7>people if I.</v>
<v Speaker 7>even if I had the opportunity,</v>

989
00:48:33.801 --> 00:48:36.300
<v Speaker 7>but at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

990
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:39.350
<v Speaker 7>are drastic measures have to be taken.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what I'm saying.</v>

991
00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.110
<v Speaker 5>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're saying,</v>

992
00:48:41.111 --> 00:48:46.111
<v Speaker 5>you're saying that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>comfortable with the speed at which </v>

993
00:48:46.111 --> 00:48:46.111
<v Speaker 5>evolution is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

994
00:48:46.111 --> 00:48:51.000
<v Speaker 5>it's obvious that people are evolving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're not comfortable that people </v>

995
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.601
<v Speaker 5>haven't reached your level yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So fucking solution is to engineer some </v>

996
00:48:54.601 --> 00:48:54.601
<v Speaker 5>way to poison them.</v>

997
00:48:54.601 --> 00:48:59.490
<v Speaker 4>Let me just dose them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to use them as Guinea pigs </v>

998
00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:03.360
<v Speaker 4>and I'm for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on time for it to you for it.</v>

999
00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.460
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1000
00:49:05.461 --> 00:49:08.190
<v Speaker 4>if it was 100 percent safe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1001
00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.920
<v Speaker 4>but they would have to be all kids and </v>
<v Speaker 4>black kids blankets.</v>

1002
00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:11.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1003
00:49:11.491 --> 00:49:12.780
<v Speaker 4>Even if just kidding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will not be.</v>

1004
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:16.630
<v Speaker 4>But what if it wasn't a hundred percent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say Yeah,</v>

1005
00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:17.900
<v Speaker 4>the 80 percent</v>

1006
00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.530
<v Speaker 5>they have to dig acid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right?</v>

1007
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:26.650
<v Speaker 5>Some people are happy as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Living a simple life and that is their </v>

1008
00:49:27.321 --> 00:49:30.200
<v Speaker 5>prerogative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a temporary experience.</v>

1009
00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 5>And just because you see some great </v>
<v Speaker 5>depth into it doesn't mean you can pose </v>

1010
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.920
<v Speaker 5>those ideals on other people that love a</v>
<v Speaker 5>simple life.</v>

1011
00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:42.090
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's people that are genuinely like </v>

1012
00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:44.200
<v Speaker 5>country music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They like feeding animals and they're </v>

1013
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:44.900
<v Speaker 5>like making fucking sweet potato pie and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's cool.</v>

1014
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:48.990
<v Speaker 4>They're called my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are Those your parents?</v>

1015
00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:51.140
<v Speaker 4>Try and tickling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>

1016
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.960
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing I'm not talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>like literally you have.</v>

1017
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:56.670
<v Speaker 4>It's never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's never going to happen.</v>

1018
00:49:56.671 --> 00:49:58.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But who could draw pictures of it?</v>

1019
00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.750
<v Speaker 4>An interest?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have diagrams.</v>

1020
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:03.690
<v Speaker 4>At what point do you</v>

1021
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:08.720
<v Speaker 7>do what anonymous is doing?</v>
<v Speaker 7>At what point do you go from looking at </v>

1022
00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.180
<v Speaker 7>the world and seeing some fucked up shit</v>
<v Speaker 7>going down?</v>

1023
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:17.400
<v Speaker 7>What point do you go from talking about </v>
<v Speaker 7>this shit going down to actively trying </v>

1024
00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:19.560
<v Speaker 7>to fight against it?</v>

1025
00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:21.890
<v Speaker 5>See the Warren Buffet thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1026
00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:27.310
<v Speaker 5>Warren Buffet just wrote some big </v>
<v Speaker 5>article on corporate taxes and why do</v>

1027
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:33.040
<v Speaker 10>I have to pay so little taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Why do all my super rich friends get to </v>

1028
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.010
<v Speaker 10>bed taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Any described in detail.</v>

1029
00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:39.220
<v Speaker 10>A bunch of crazy clauses that are in </v>
<v Speaker 10>place that allowed these guys to only </v>

1030
00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:42.761
<v Speaker 10>have like 17 percent taxes and </v>
<v Speaker 10>especially people that make their money </v>

1031
00:50:42.761 --> 00:50:43.840
<v Speaker 10>with money and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's,</v>

1032
00:50:43.841 --> 00:50:48.841
<v Speaker 10>there's all sorts of things that can be </v>
<v Speaker 10>factored in and because of that they </v>

1033
00:50:48.841 --> 00:50:49.280
<v Speaker 10>paid leave in less taxes and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this is crazy.</v>

1034
00:50:49.281 --> 00:50:51.140
<v Speaker 10>Like this is all engineered.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Ridiculous.</v>

1035
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:53.390
<v Speaker 10>Like why are you protecting this super </v>
<v Speaker 10>rich?</v>

1036
00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.240
<v Speaker 10>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 10>really fascinating.</v>

1037
00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:57.970
<v Speaker 10>It's really fascinating because he </v>
<v Speaker 10>stepped up and,</v>

1038
00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:02.180
<v Speaker 10>and set and it uses the terms,</v>
<v Speaker 10>like my mega rich friends,</v>

1039
00:51:02.181 --> 00:51:04.280
<v Speaker 10>my super rich friends,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1040
00:51:04.281 --> 00:51:05.040
<v Speaker 10>he,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1041
00:51:05.041 --> 00:51:07.760
<v Speaker 10>it really just kind of laid it all out.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's fascinating.</v>

1042
00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:10.690
<v Speaker 7>Were you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when do we do something about it?</v>

1043
00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.610
<v Speaker 7>What do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because you got to do something.</v>

1044
00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:14.350
<v Speaker 7>At some point,</v>

1045
00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:17.520
<v Speaker 10>you bring it down.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Do we know who's going to build it?</v>

1046
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:18.560
<v Speaker 7>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't.</v>

1047
00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:20.520
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to bring it down,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but at some point you.</v>

1048
00:51:20.521 --> 00:51:23.940
<v Speaker 7>I just heard this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's this guy that guy's a rant on.</v>

1049
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:28.990
<v Speaker 7>I don't even remember this show,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it went viral and it's this guy </v>

1050
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:31.050
<v Speaker 7>steamed up about Republican or Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't matter.</v>

1051
00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:36.260
<v Speaker 7>There's a system in place that is </v>
<v Speaker 7>pulling the wealth of the nation into </v>

1052
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.750
<v Speaker 7>the overseas banking community or it was</v>
<v Speaker 7>like really intense and it went viral.</v>

1053
00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:44.490
<v Speaker 7>It went super viral,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then the question is,</v>

1054
00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:49.820
<v Speaker 7>do we dose the irs or not?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Know at what point at what point your </v>

1055
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:53.400
<v Speaker 7>bad trips,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they would have math trips.</v>

1056
00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:58.410
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a vision where they just literally </v>

1057
00:51:58.410 --> 00:51:59.340
<v Speaker 7>stole their money and they weren't poor </v>
<v Speaker 7>and it couldn't fucking food themselves,</v>

1058
00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.580
<v Speaker 7>but when do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>When do you see?</v>

1059
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:01.430
<v Speaker 7>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this guy said,</v>

1060
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.000
<v Speaker 7>we have a BOT congress.</v>

1061
00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:08.360
<v Speaker 7>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the congress is in the pocket of </v>

1062
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:08.360
<v Speaker 7>corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whether this is true or not,</v>

1063
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.120
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I did read,</v>

1064
00:52:09.121 --> 00:52:12.440
<v Speaker 7>if you go to a banners wikipedia page,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1065
00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:16.290
<v Speaker 7>it's felt boner,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but painter b o e h n e r,</v>

1066
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:18.870
<v Speaker 7>if you go to his wikipedia page,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it talks about one of these cons.</v>

1067
00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:23.900
<v Speaker 7>One of the controversies around him was </v>
<v Speaker 7>that there was a big vote coming up </v>

1068
00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:29.880
<v Speaker 7>against big tobacco and right before the</v>
<v Speaker 7>vote happened,</v>

1069
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000
<v Speaker 7>he went and passed out checks from big </v>
<v Speaker 7>tobacco on the floor to all these like </v>

1070
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.470
<v Speaker 7>senators or I don't want to passed it </v>
<v Speaker 7>out publicly and I don't know why,</v>

1071
00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:44.820
<v Speaker 7>what this exactly was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but so that guys bought.</v>

1072
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:49.910
<v Speaker 7>He's passing out checks from tobacco </v>
<v Speaker 7>companies in our government like that </v>

1073
00:52:50.221 --> 00:52:51.360
<v Speaker 7>guys bought.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's on Wikipedia,</v>

1074
00:52:51.361 --> 00:52:54.230
<v Speaker 7>look it up and maybe someone can really </v>
<v Speaker 7>explain to me why I did that or what,</v>

1075
00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:55.320
<v Speaker 7>what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what has happened there.</v>

1076
00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.650
<v Speaker 7>So we have what's called a Bot congress.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have our leaders,</v>

1077
00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:01.890
<v Speaker 7>many of them are in the pockets of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>corporations.</v>

1078
00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:04.050
<v Speaker 7>Their decisions are based on the will of</v>
<v Speaker 7>the people.</v>

1079
00:53:04.051 --> 00:53:07.110
<v Speaker 7>Their decisions are based on what's </v>
<v Speaker 7>better for the corporations and the Mega</v>

1080
00:53:07.111 --> 00:53:10.510
<v Speaker 7>Rich and fucking warren buffet just went</v>
<v Speaker 7>out and talked about it.</v>

1081
00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:15.660
<v Speaker 7>At what point do we as a people make </v>
<v Speaker 7>that stop?</v>

1082
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:17.970
<v Speaker 7>When does it happen?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Guess what?</v>

1083
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.220
<v Speaker 7>Democracy didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 7>didn't work.</v>

1084
00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.510
<v Speaker 7>They beat it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They figured it out.</v>

1085
00:53:21.511 --> 00:53:22.400
<v Speaker 7>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they figured it out.</v>

1086
00:53:22.401 --> 00:53:24.680
<v Speaker 7>It's like the Rubik's cube.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You do it enough time.</v>

1087
00:53:24.681 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 7>Somebody's going to fucking figure out a</v>
<v Speaker 7>beat.</v>

1088
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:28.230
<v Speaker 7>The Rubik's cube.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They figured it out.</v>

1089
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.860
<v Speaker 7>The fucking founding fathers talked </v>
<v Speaker 7>about this very thing,</v>

1090
00:53:31.861 --> 00:53:33.600
<v Speaker 7>the possibility of this kind of thing </v>
<v Speaker 7>happening.</v>

1091
00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:36.030
<v Speaker 7>It happened.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now what do we do?</v>

1092
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:41.120
<v Speaker 7>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you sit and drink starbucks and buy </v>

1093
00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.401
<v Speaker 7>your fucking iphone and and and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>play video games and get on a podcast </v>

1094
00:53:43.471 --> 00:53:47.730
<v Speaker 7>from time to time and wine or do you </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking pig?</v>

1095
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.640
<v Speaker 7>When do you do something?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what I want to know.</v>

1096
00:53:50.641 --> 00:53:54.630
<v Speaker 7>When do people act like and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm so fascinated with fucking anonymous</v>

1097
00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:57.120
<v Speaker 7>right now because they're acting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're,</v>

1098
00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.500
<v Speaker 7>no matter what people said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1099
00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.110
<v Speaker 7>they're just a bunch of 14 year olds at </v>
<v Speaker 7>the basement of their Bob's house.</v>

1100
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.300
<v Speaker 7>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They just fucking did it.</v>

1101
00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:07.140
<v Speaker 7>They shut down train stations.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're shutting shit down there.</v>

1102
00:54:07.141 --> 00:54:07.810
<v Speaker 7>Like black.</v>

1103
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One one step away is Obama is going to </v>

1104
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:13.040
<v Speaker 4>go on television going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1105
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:17.140
<v Speaker 4>just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're now considering these guys </v>

1106
00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:17.140
<v Speaker 4>terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all it's going to happen.</v>

1107
00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:19.400
<v Speaker 4>And then these 14 year olds that are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>basements who are thinking they're doing</v>

1108
00:54:19.401 --> 00:54:20.330
<v Speaker 4>a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are now going,</v>

1109
00:54:20.331 --> 00:54:25.331
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now we're going to get in prison for 60 </v>

1110
00:54:25.331 --> 00:54:25.331
<v Speaker 4>years and now federal crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1111
00:54:25.331 --> 00:54:28.991
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not worth them going back to work </v>

1112
00:54:28.991 --> 00:54:30.590
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's all that stuff all they need </v>

1113
00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:30.590
<v Speaker 4>to do to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for the rest of the history,</v>

1114
00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:31.530
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for the rest of history,</v>

1115
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.890
<v Speaker 7>if every member of whatever this </v>
<v Speaker 7>mysterious weird group is,</v>

1116
00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:38.100
<v Speaker 7>gets arrested tomorrow for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 7>time,</v>

1117
00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.940
<v Speaker 7>they still will exist as an </v>
<v Speaker 7>organization.</v>

1118
00:54:41.941 --> 00:54:46.941
<v Speaker 7>That was one of the first emergent,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a revolutionary organizations in the </v>

1119
00:54:46.941 --> 00:54:49.710
<v Speaker 7>technological age and to me that is </v>
<v Speaker 7>amazing.</v>

1120
00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.370
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's super amazing and I,</v>

1121
00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:56.380
<v Speaker 4>I completely support them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that they're just better watch out </v>

1122
00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:57.920
<v Speaker 4>because I think that's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're doing it.</v>

1123
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:59.420
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be considered </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrorists.</v>

1124
00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:00.850
<v Speaker 7>The second course,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1125
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:05.550
<v Speaker 7>our country considers anything that goes</v>
<v Speaker 7>against their ideals,</v>

1126
00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:08.500
<v Speaker 7>terrorism to the point where it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>obvious that certain people aren't there</v>

1127
00:55:08.501 --> 00:55:11.070
<v Speaker 7>in surgeons.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Those are insurgents.</v>

1128
00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:12.860
<v Speaker 7>What the fuck's an insurgent?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1129
00:55:12.861 --> 00:55:15.420
<v Speaker 7>Those are people who don't want you </v>
<v Speaker 7>invading their country.</v>

1130
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:17.180
<v Speaker 7>They're not insurgents.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're gonna.</v>

1131
00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.830
<v Speaker 7>Call them an insurgent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you know how many fucking kids?</v>

1132
00:55:19.831 --> 00:55:23.250
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Afghanistan died from a drone attacks.</v>

1133
00:55:23.251 --> 00:55:26.910
<v Speaker 7>They just released it like 168 kids.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dad from drone attacks.</v>

1134
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:32.390
<v Speaker 7>A lot of insurgents apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't understand why you got to blow up </v>

1135
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:33.970
<v Speaker 7>toddlers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the question is when,</v>

1136
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:35.230
<v Speaker 7>when,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when did people choose?</v>

1137
00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.820
<v Speaker 6>I can imagine if you were living over </v>
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>

1138
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.950
<v Speaker 6>if that's your role,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the dice.</v>

1139
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:45.430
<v Speaker 6>You're a fucking mountain goat herder in</v>
<v Speaker 6>Afghanistan and you literally are under </v>

1140
00:55:46.521 --> 00:55:51.521
<v Speaker 6>the power of various warlords.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one city in the entire country cobble</v>

1141
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:56.330
<v Speaker 6>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Assist warlords,</v>

1142
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:59.680
<v Speaker 6>warlords,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude or Lord,</v>

1143
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:04.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know how they get the information </v>

1144
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.730
<v Speaker 6>from the warlords?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They give him Viagra.</v>

1145
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:06.710
<v Speaker 6>That's how they find out where the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Taliban is.</v>

1146
00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:09.140
<v Speaker 6>They give him Viagra.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the number one move.</v>

1147
00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:15.290
<v Speaker 4>July.</v>

00:56:57.090 --> 00:57:02.090
<v Speaker 5>It's fucked up that we can use those </v>
<v Speaker 5>drones and other countries that we're </v>

1171
00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:02.090
<v Speaker 5>not even supposed to be at war with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Pakistan.</v>

1172
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:04.660
<v Speaker 5>Just sneak a drone over there and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 5>some shit.</v>

1173
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:10.990
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

1183
00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.510
<v Speaker 7>It's so creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

1184
00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.000
<v Speaker 7>If you think about that stuff too much </v>
<v Speaker 7>god,</v>

1185
00:57:30.001 --> 00:57:35.001
<v Speaker 7>especially if you man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you eat mushrooms and your brain </v>

1186
00:57:35.001 --> 00:57:36.750
<v Speaker 7>decides to start thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Taliban.</v>

1187
00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:39.330
<v Speaker 7>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the worst.</v>

1188
00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:44.360
<v Speaker 7>You just.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've rolled against the wall of my </v>

1189
00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:47.480
<v Speaker 7>fucking apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>clutching my head with visions of </v>

1190
00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:51.440
<v Speaker 7>bearded strangers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>strapping suicide bombs to their bodies </v>

1191
00:57:51.631 --> 00:57:54.690
<v Speaker 7>and wandering into the streets to blow </v>
<v Speaker 7>up other people.</v>

1192
00:57:54.691 --> 00:57:59.610
<v Speaker 7>When you really consider that this </v>
<v Speaker 7>happens at this very second,</v>

1193
00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.430
<v Speaker 7>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's two things happening.</v>

1194
00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:07.730
<v Speaker 7>There's a guy at fucking Halliburton </v>
<v Speaker 7>who's screwing the top on a hell fire </v>

1195
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:12.231
<v Speaker 7>missile that no doubt will land in some </v>
<v Speaker 7>playground in Afghanistan and a center </v>

1196
00:58:12.231 --> 00:58:13.260
<v Speaker 7>eight some toddlers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and he's like,</v>

1197
00:58:13.261 --> 00:58:13.590
<v Speaker 7>ah,</v>

1198
00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:14.840
<v Speaker 3>almost off work</v>

1199
00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:17.330
<v Speaker 7>these.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got a screw on.</v>

1200
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:22.510
<v Speaker 7>There's that guy and then there's some </v>
<v Speaker 7>guy in the Middle East right now </v>

1201
00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:26.351
<v Speaker 7>strapping a fucking belt around his </v>
<v Speaker 7>waist and he's got a little time or a </v>

1202
00:58:26.351 --> 00:58:29.900
<v Speaker 7>phone and he's buttoning everything up </v>
<v Speaker 7>and he knows that any second,</v>

1203
00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:33.560
<v Speaker 7>like in the next hour or two,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's going to be hamburger meat all over</v>

1204
00:58:33.561 --> 00:58:37.430
<v Speaker 7>some fucking cafe or hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's so weird.</v>

1205
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.000
<v Speaker 7>We live in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These are the two insane people and I </v>

1206
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.720
<v Speaker 7>frankly think one's a lot crazier than </v>
<v Speaker 7>the other and it ain't the fucking guy </v>

1207
00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:46.720
<v Speaker 7>with a bomb belt.</v>

1208
00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.330
<v Speaker 3>It's the fucking Weirdos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just screw in the top side.</v>

1209
00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Ms Dot wonder where these are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

1210
00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:58.650
<v Speaker 3>Keep pushing these bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's another box of Gloucester.</v>

1211
00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:02.070
<v Speaker 3>Oops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

1212
00:59:02.071 --> 00:59:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

1213
00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.350
<v Speaker 7>I wonder why it malfunctioned like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Perhaps we should analyze the four.</v>

1214
00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.870
<v Speaker 7>13 chip a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You just killed toddlers.</v>

1215
00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:09.590
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of course.</v>

1216
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:11.360
<v Speaker 7>But I wonder what it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What it is.</v>

1217
00:59:11.361 --> 00:59:15.560
<v Speaker 7>Maybe the battery malfunctioned </v>
<v Speaker 7>batteries malfunctioning in your heart.</v>

1218
00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:17.270
<v Speaker 7>Murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing.</v>

1219
00:59:17.271 --> 00:59:18.470
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why are we doing this?</v>

1220
00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:23.920
<v Speaker 7>The fuck's going on that poppy field </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing on internet where you're talking </v>

1221
00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:23.920
<v Speaker 7>about</v>

1222
00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:23.960
<v Speaker 3>the soldiers standing in the poppy </v>
<v Speaker 3>fields,</v>

1223
00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.920
<v Speaker 3>yet another thing not to listen to when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking begged,</v>

1224
00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:32.240
<v Speaker 3>that'll send you a hireling into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>paranoid episode quicker than seeing </v>

1225
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:32.240
<v Speaker 3>your grandmother.</v>

1226
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:36.570
<v Speaker 5>That has never been a more clear </v>
<v Speaker 5>indication that they're in on it than </v>

1227
00:59:37.811 --> 00:59:41.440
<v Speaker 5>soldiers guarding poppy fields.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>in order to get information for these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1236
00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:57.580
<v Speaker 5>we have to let them live their way of </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's all.</v>

1241

1254
01:00:28.681 --> 01:00:32.260
<v Speaker 5>Why the fuck would they put the </v>
<v Speaker 5>resources of those soldiers?</v>

1255
01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:34.900
<v Speaker 5>Why would they put them to use in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>area like that?</v>

<v Speaker 5>Do you know what happened with now?</v>

1265
01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.940
<v Speaker 5>Supposedly this is all supposedly the </v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>they just got some giant crazy contract </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the United Arab Emirates and </v>

1267
01:00:58.980 --> 01:00:59.650
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1268
01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.060
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like an Abu Dhabi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe I not.</v>

1269
01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:04.450
<v Speaker 5>They're starting like a private </v>
<v Speaker 5>military.</v>

1270
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:10.150
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's putting together some crazy </v>

1271
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:11.070
<v Speaker 5>mercenary group to shut down uprisings </v>
<v Speaker 5>and make sure that no,</v>

1272
01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.820
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody shit happens and they'll lose all</v>

1273
01:01:12.821 --> 01:01:13.120
<v Speaker 5>their money.</v>

1274
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:14.680
<v Speaker 3>I heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually heard about this.</v>

1275
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:16.420
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it called Cobra?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1276
01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1277
01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.680
<v Speaker 3>Called Cobra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cobra.</v>

1278
01:01:20.681 --> 01:01:25.681
<v Speaker 3>I made that up as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy</v>

1279
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.580
<v Speaker 5>who was the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1280
01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.760
<v Speaker 5>the guy that was the head of Blackwater </v>
<v Speaker 5>is apparently got some huge deal to go </v>

1281
01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.890
<v Speaker 5>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I read a line that would make sense,</v>

1282
01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:36.590
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I was some fucking dude in the Middle</v>

1283
01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:37.630
<v Speaker 5>East like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1284
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:38.810
<v Speaker 5>I was a king.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1285
01:01:38.811 --> 01:01:41.220
<v Speaker 5>I need to protect this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to hire them.</v>

1286
01:01:41.221 --> 01:01:43.670
<v Speaker 5>And once you get to that position,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we ain't going to let that go.</v>

1287
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.290
<v Speaker 5>No one's letting that go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would you let that go?</v>

1288
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:50.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm the king to shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a new army where we got shit a </v>

1289
01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:54.051
<v Speaker 5>lock down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're going to resist any form of </v>

1290
01:01:54.051 --> 01:01:54.051
<v Speaker 5>the simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't</v>

1291
01:01:54.051 --> 01:01:56.650
<v Speaker 3>care what you song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google a palace.</v>

1292
01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:01.660
<v Speaker 3>I got to keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would it be like to be a king and </v>

1293
01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.050
<v Speaker 3>have an acid trip?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really deep acid trip.</v>

1294
01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:04.280
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>

1295
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:10.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like having a fucking Harem tripping on </v>

1296
01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.260
<v Speaker 3>acid and knowing you had access to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harem and things got weird.</v>

1297
01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.900
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think you would freak out </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about all the people that hated</v>

1298
01:02:14.901 --> 01:02:17.140
<v Speaker 3>you and all the people that wanted you </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead,</v>

1299
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.100
<v Speaker 3>all the people that wanted your throne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1300
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.220
<v Speaker 3>You just get the joke to dance</v>

1301
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:25.220
<v Speaker 5>for you and you'll forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean just being living in any sort of </v>

1302
01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.790
<v Speaker 5>a place where there's one person that is</v>
<v Speaker 5>thought to be the king,</v>

1303
01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:30.990
<v Speaker 5>the king king,</v>
<v Speaker 5>King of Jordan and the King of Egypt,</v>

1304
01:02:30.991 --> 01:02:35.991
<v Speaker 5>the king and the queen of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's got to be a terrifying position </v>

1305
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.330
<v Speaker 5>to be the king.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1306
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:39.510
<v Speaker 5>You must be totally paranoid all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1307
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

1308
01:02:40.441 --> 01:02:40.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at that.</v>

1309
01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:46.090
<v Speaker 5>Look at President Obama has got to ride </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's got to ride into kind of </v>

1310
01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:47.910
<v Speaker 5>bulletproof fucking hearst thing course </v>
<v Speaker 5>also because he's black.</v>

1311
01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:49.690
<v Speaker 5>Let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the real reason.</v>

1312
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:54.830
<v Speaker 5>The real reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big reason why people try to </v>

1313
01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:54.830
<v Speaker 5>kill Ronald Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>

1314
01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:58.720
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people would think someone there wasn't </v>

1315
01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.370
<v Speaker 5>there some sort of a thwarted attempt </v>
<v Speaker 5>against,</v>

1316
01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:02.350
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was something about George w dot,</v>

1317
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:04.560
<v Speaker 5>but they got it like way before anything</v>
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>

1318
01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.650
<v Speaker 5>It was a grenade I think were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>elaborate on stage.</v>

1319
01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:09.390
<v Speaker 5>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

1320
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:10.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's always,</v>

1321
01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:16.140
<v Speaker 5>there's always one crazy faction of </v>
<v Speaker 5>society that wants this,</v>

1322
01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:20.190
<v Speaker 5>this president dead or the United States</v>
<v Speaker 5>president did for whatever reason.</v>

1323
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:25.330
<v Speaker 5>But I always feel like with Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the shit that I hear online and the</v>

1324
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:27.810
<v Speaker 5>things that I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like the racism.</v>

1325
01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:29.190
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1326
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.780
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people don't just not </v>
<v Speaker 5>like him as a person.</v>

1327
01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:36.850
<v Speaker 5>They don't like him because he's black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1328
01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:41.930
<v Speaker 5>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Talk about it pretty openly and calm a </v>

1329
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:42.450
<v Speaker 5>monkey and calm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's like,</v>

1330
01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.480
<v Speaker 5>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really fucking fascinating.</v>

1331
01:03:45.481 --> 01:03:47.910
<v Speaker 5>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the level of disrespect.</v>

1332
01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:48.900
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea.</v>

1333
01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:54.070
<v Speaker 5>You just imagine right now the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to feel the day after </v>

1334
01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:57.951
<v Speaker 5>Michele Bachmann gets elected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if she kinda liked to imagine how you </v>

1335
01:03:57.951 --> 01:03:57.951
<v Speaker 5>going to feel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to feel,</v>

1336
01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:03.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to feel how much money does it</v>
<v Speaker 5>cost me every year to live in Vancouver </v>

1337
01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.080
<v Speaker 5>and I called my accountant and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to say,</v>

1338
01:04:04.081 --> 01:04:04.560
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

1339
01:04:04.561 --> 01:04:05.520
<v Speaker 5>tell me what I would have to do.</v>

1340
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.900
<v Speaker 5>I'd have to pay taxes in both places.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1341
01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:10.020
<v Speaker 5>I can do that though and I can live </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and I keep.</v>

1342
01:04:10.021 --> 01:04:11.580
<v Speaker 5>I can still be United States Senate </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

1343
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:14.010
<v Speaker 5>let's fucking do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would just do it.</v>

1344
01:04:14.011 --> 01:04:19.011
<v Speaker 5>I just moved the fuck up there is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way racist felt when Obama got elected.</v>

1345
01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:25.080
<v Speaker 5>Of course that's been rocking sense of </v>
<v Speaker 5>like horror that some people had,</v>

1346
01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:27.630
<v Speaker 5>not because of his views,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not getting his ideas,</v>

1347
01:04:27.631 --> 01:04:29.160
<v Speaker 5>but because he's black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>

1348
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:30.830
<v Speaker 5>oh my fucking God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is it.</v>

1349
01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:34.050
<v Speaker 5>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Charlie over sudden.</v>

1350
01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:34.710
<v Speaker 5>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1351
01:04:34.711 --> 01:04:36.810
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah man,</v>

1352
01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:41.790
<v Speaker 5>it's completely out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you add onto that the fact that</v>

1353
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:46.200
<v Speaker 5>he fucking didn't exactly hit a home run</v>
<v Speaker 5>to put it lightly duty.</v>

1354
01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:49.440
<v Speaker 5>He stepped up to plate and got hit with </v>
<v Speaker 5>a meteor shower.</v>

1355
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:54.710
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think any president had any </v>

1356
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.710
<v Speaker 5>chance of making any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look good.</v>

1357
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:59.750
<v Speaker 5>There was a gigantic scheme going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It collapsed and created this vortex of </v>

1358
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:06.651
<v Speaker 5>suck and unemployment and home </v>
<v Speaker 5>foreclosures and anybody stepping into </v>

1359
01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:10.290
<v Speaker 5>that vortex would have been sucked into </v>
<v Speaker 5>its momentum.</v>

1360
01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:15.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ducks that while he was in that fucking </v>

1361
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 5>vortex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he like started</v>

1362
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.170
<v Speaker 10>saying that people could start rating </v>
<v Speaker 10>medicinal marijuana.</v>

1363
01:05:20.171 --> 01:05:23.050
<v Speaker 10>Dispensary is again under him.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They started doing that.</v>

1364
01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:28.620
<v Speaker 10>Did they say that they rated them </v>
<v Speaker 10>because they violated both state and </v>

1365
01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:32.671
<v Speaker 10>federal law?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Do you know because that was one of the </v>

1366
01:05:32.671 --> 01:05:35.941
<v Speaker 10>claims that Obama says.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He never said that he would stop rating </v>

1367
01:05:35.941 --> 01:05:37.720
<v Speaker 10>medical marijuana clinics.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think the,</v>

1368
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:42.750
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the language they used was they were </v>

1369
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:45.421
<v Speaker 10>going to stop unless they were violating</v>
<v Speaker 10>both state and federal law.</v>

1370
01:05:45.461 --> 01:05:49.930
<v Speaker 10>So if someone was selling marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you automatically violating federal law,</v>

1371
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 10>but are you staying within the state </v>
<v Speaker 10>guidelines?</v>

1372
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.940
<v Speaker 10>If so,</v>
<v Speaker 10>then we're going to leave you alone,</v>

1373
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:57.460
<v Speaker 10>but if not,</v>
<v Speaker 10>then we're gonna go after you and that's</v>

1374
01:05:57.461 --> 01:05:58.610
<v Speaker 10>what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's what he said.</v>

1375
01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.280
<v Speaker 10>Because I heard there was a new thing </v>
<v Speaker 10>that's.</v>

1376
01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:02.020
<v Speaker 10>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I heard I heard that too,</v>

1377
01:06:02.021 --> 01:06:05.410
<v Speaker 10>but I didn't investigate it enough to be</v>
<v Speaker 10>talking about it,</v>

1378
01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:08.470
<v Speaker 10>but very hard for me to hate our country</v>
<v Speaker 10>so much.</v>

1379
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.940
<v Speaker 10>Duncan.</v>
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

1380
01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.950
<v Speaker 10>I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but let me be clear about this.</v>

1381
01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:17.460
<v Speaker 10>I don't think we're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm not happy until there's full </v>

1382
01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:21.901
<v Speaker 10>legalization and here's the problem with</v>
<v Speaker 10>this idea of medical is that I believe,</v>

1383
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.730
<v Speaker 10>at least in my,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the way I understand it,</v>

1384
01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:29.731
<v Speaker 10>that it can be interpreted,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that the only way you're supposed to be </v>

1385
01:06:29.731 --> 01:06:32.281
<v Speaker 10>running one of these collectives and </v>
<v Speaker 10>dispensary's is you're not supposed to </v>

1386
01:06:32.281 --> 01:06:35.191
<v Speaker 10>be making any profit.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I believe they're supposed to be not a </v>

1387
01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:38.881
<v Speaker 10>nonprofit sort of a business,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but obviously these people are making a </v>

1388
01:06:38.881 --> 01:06:42.631
<v Speaker 10>fuck load of money,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so it's a very tricky sort of a gray </v>

1389
01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:44.890
<v Speaker 10>area that's going on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so I'm not,</v>

1390
01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:47.410
<v Speaker 10>I'm not even happy with just the medical</v>
<v Speaker 10>distinction.</v>

1391
01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.680
<v Speaker 10>It's silliness.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's 2011.</v>

1392
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:54.650
<v Speaker 10>Any argument about giving any,</v>
<v Speaker 10>any inches or any.</v>

1393
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.920
<v Speaker 10>Just anything at all in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Like,</v>

1394
01:06:56.921 --> 01:06:58.840
<v Speaker 10>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 10>well maybe we should make it illegal.</v>

1395
01:06:58.841 --> 01:07:00.400
<v Speaker 10>If you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 10>stop it.</v>

1396
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.870
<v Speaker 10>It's a fucking plant.</v>
<v Speaker 10>All right.</v>

1397
01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.690
<v Speaker 10>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You can't make it illegal.</v>

1398
01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:07.060
<v Speaker 10>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's a fucking plant.</v>

1399
01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:11.200
<v Speaker 10>It grows in the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You can't say it's no good if it's not.</v>

1400
01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:16.570
<v Speaker 10>It's not a poison.</v>
<v Speaker 10>How come there's all these plants that </v>

1401
01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:16.570
<v Speaker 10>grow strychnine?</v>
<v Speaker 10>They make strict none.</v>

1402
01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.260
<v Speaker 10>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They don't.</v>

1403
01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:18.220
<v Speaker 10>You can buy them.</v>

1404
01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:23.460
<v Speaker 4>You could sell Salvia at target and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would think that Salvia is way more </v>

1405
01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:23.460
<v Speaker 4>dangerous for kids.</v>

1406
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:27.280
<v Speaker 10>Salvia plants the nursery.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Go check.</v>

1407
01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:30.230
<v Speaker 10>That's the same type of Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't know,</v>

1408
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:35.250
<v Speaker 10>but I do know that they sell the San </v>
<v Speaker 10>Pedro Cactus at like Home Depot San </v>

1409
01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:36.310
<v Speaker 10>Pedro.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Cactus is how you get Mescalin.</v>

1410
01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:38.170
<v Speaker 10>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1411
01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:41.380
<v Speaker 10>That's where pod comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You can take that fucking cactus and you</v>

1412
01:07:41.381 --> 01:07:42.730
<v Speaker 10>can,</v>
<v Speaker 10>if you know how to do it.</v>

1413
01:07:42.731 --> 01:07:44.040
<v Speaker 10>There's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's a bunch of,</v>

1414
01:07:44.041 --> 01:07:45.440
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>like,</v>

1415
01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:50.450
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>forums that will show you how to go </v>

1416
01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:50.620
<v Speaker 10>through step by step process online.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

1417
01:07:50.621 --> 01:07:51.940
<v Speaker 10>man,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's fucked up.</v>

1418
01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:53.590
<v Speaker 10>Fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's ridiculous.</v>

1419
01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.390
<v Speaker 10>It's not just fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's like that.</v>

1420
01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.360
<v Speaker 10>If there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's a one thing that has to happen,</v>

1421
01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:03.630
<v Speaker 10>the first thing that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And people don't put as much stock into </v>

1422
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:04.480
<v Speaker 10>this idea because it seems like a silly </v>
<v Speaker 10>request,</v>

1423
01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.460
<v Speaker 10>but if you could fix anything about the </v>
<v Speaker 10>world,</v>

1424
01:08:06.461 --> 01:08:11.461
<v Speaker 10>what would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'd make psychedelics regularly </v>

1425
01:08:11.461 --> 01:08:14.400
<v Speaker 10>available and legal and have people and </v>
<v Speaker 10>devote energy and money to studying them</v>

1426
01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 10>and</v>

1427
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.840
<v Speaker 6>distributing them correctly and get </v>
<v Speaker 6>people who are showmen to take people in</v>

1428
01:08:20.841 --> 01:08:24.080
<v Speaker 6>authentic trips,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people who have navigated these worlds.</v>

1429
01:08:24.170 --> 01:08:29.170
<v Speaker 6>And then when the people come back and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they need like help with this </v>

1430
01:08:29.170 --> 01:08:30.110
<v Speaker 6>reprogramming.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You sit down with them.</v>

1431
01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:35.111
<v Speaker 6>You have groups of people that have also</v>
<v Speaker 6>had the experience to sit down with </v>

1432
01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:35.111
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Discuss what about it?</v>

1433
01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.130
<v Speaker 6>Did it make you think about yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Was that it?</v>

1434
01:08:36.131 --> 01:08:39.410
<v Speaker 6>Was there anything that like glaringly </v>
<v Speaker 6>obvious you needed to change?</v>

1435
01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.030
<v Speaker 6>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the person would say,</v>

1436
01:08:41.031 --> 01:08:41.520
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll,</v>

1437
01:08:41.521 --> 01:08:43.100
<v Speaker 6>there's this fucking thing that freaks </v>
<v Speaker 6>me out.</v>

1438
01:08:43.101 --> 01:08:45.650
<v Speaker 6>I'm kind of a cheap fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think we need to deal with that.</v>

1439
01:08:45.651 --> 01:08:46.070
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1440
01:08:46.071 --> 01:08:47.030
<v Speaker 6>you're kind of selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1441
01:08:47.031 --> 01:08:47.390
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1442
01:08:47.391 --> 01:08:48.620
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just like,</v>

1443
01:08:48.621 --> 01:08:51.050
<v Speaker 6>it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a force of habit and if you're,</v>

1444
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:56.170
<v Speaker 6>if you have any weird sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>personality tick like that and you do </v>

1445
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:56.170
<v Speaker 6>any psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even eat pot,</v>

1446
01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:57.290
<v Speaker 6>just eat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>eat a cookie,</v>

1447
01:08:57.291 --> 01:08:57.560
<v Speaker 6>Matt.</v>

1448
01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:59.250
<v Speaker 6>That's the first thing that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>hit you.</v>

1449
01:08:59.251 --> 01:09:01.010
<v Speaker 6>You're going to think about being a </v>
<v Speaker 6>creepy person.</v>

1450
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:03.440
<v Speaker 6>Think about your creepy behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1451
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:08.500
<v Speaker 6>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if there's ever a way to reengineer </v>

1452
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:11.590
<v Speaker 6>society,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's to shock people out of their </v>

1453
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:14.060
<v Speaker 6>current pattern of behavior that they </v>
<v Speaker 6>find almost unavoidable.</v>

1454
01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.950
<v Speaker 6>The same patterns that caused people to </v>
<v Speaker 6>overeat or chronic masturbation.</v>

1455
01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:23.390
<v Speaker 6>The we have to figure out a way to blast</v>
<v Speaker 6>people out of those shock you out of the</v>

1456
01:09:23.391 --> 01:09:28.391
<v Speaker 6>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Show you yourself from an angle or </v>

1457
01:09:28.391 --> 01:09:29.990
<v Speaker 6>perspective that's not available without</v>
<v Speaker 6>the psychedelic,</v>

1458
01:09:30.230 --> 01:09:32.480
<v Speaker 6>than bring you back and give you </v>
<v Speaker 6>something to think about.</v>

1459
01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:34.520
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like these little trips,</v>

1460
01:09:34.521 --> 01:09:38.390
<v Speaker 6>these little blasts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the just little bursts of evolution.</v>

1461
01:09:38.391 --> 01:09:41.270
<v Speaker 6>It's society.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You see yourself,</v>

1462
01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.250
<v Speaker 6>you see how you can fit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You see,</v>

1463
01:09:43.251 --> 01:09:44.840
<v Speaker 6>Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you see positive,</v>

1464
01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:46.700
<v Speaker 6>good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll see you in a couple months and just</v>

1465
01:09:46.701 --> 01:09:47.840
<v Speaker 6>keep doing that.</v>

1466
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:50.840
<v Speaker 6>And every couple months people go in and</v>
<v Speaker 6>get blasted,</v>

1467
01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.430
<v Speaker 6>talk to people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

1468
01:09:52.431 --> 01:09:56.510
<v Speaker 6>talk them through situations and tell </v>
<v Speaker 6>them about ego.</v>

1469
01:09:56.511 --> 01:09:59.360
<v Speaker 6>And then it's all a trick and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 6>temporary anyway,</v>

1470
01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:00.230
<v Speaker 6>men,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the most,</v>

1471
01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:05.260
<v Speaker 6>the best feeling you'll ever get is to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be really cool to as many people as you </v>

1472
01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:05.930
<v Speaker 6>can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the best feeling you'll ever get.</v>

1473
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.270
<v Speaker 6>It's just to be nice to as many people </v>
<v Speaker 6>as you can.</v>

1474
01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.250
<v Speaker 6>Be friendly to them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shake their hand,</v>

1475
01:10:10.251 --> 01:10:15.251
<v Speaker 6>hug them if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and just be someone that other people </v>

1476
01:10:15.251 --> 01:10:16.790
<v Speaker 6>enjoy to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you do that,</v>

1477
01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:19.640
<v Speaker 6>you create positive energy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You create love.</v>

1478
01:10:19.641 --> 01:10:20.930
<v Speaker 6>You create this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

1479
01:10:20.931 --> 01:10:25.931
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this burst comes from you and you </v>

1480
01:10:25.931 --> 01:10:29.471
<v Speaker 6>attracted and you bring it into your </v>
<v Speaker 6>seeing a couple of months and then the </v>

1481
01:10:30.941 --> 01:10:35.941
<v Speaker 6>guy goes back every couple of months,</v>
<v Speaker 6>did one trip after another and a year </v>

1482
01:10:35.941 --> 01:10:37.540
<v Speaker 6>later you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't even recognize this guy.</v>

1483
01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:42.780
<v Speaker 6>A year later,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy is fucking eating organic food </v>

1484
01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:45.370
<v Speaker 6>and drinking coconut water and go into </v>
<v Speaker 6>cross fit and reading about the Bhagavad</v>

1485

<v Speaker 6>Gita and he become a different human </v>
<v Speaker 6>being.</v>

1486
01:10:47.051 --> 01:10:49.210
<v Speaker 6>You become a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

1487
01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.550
<v Speaker 6>that's actualized.</v>

1488
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:53.800
<v Speaker 11>That's a good word.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's a good word.</v>

1489
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:57.020
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is possible.</v>

1490
01:10:57.110 --> 01:11:02.110
<v Speaker 6>You can evolve without drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can evolve just with hard work and </v>

1491
01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:06.340
<v Speaker 6>focus and attention in meditation or you</v>
<v Speaker 6>can just take the drugs and get there </v>

1492
01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:06.950
<v Speaker 6>way quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's up to you man.</v>

1493
01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.050
<v Speaker 6>Go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And combined it two,</v>

1494
01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't.</v>

1495
01:11:10.131 --> 01:11:12.290
<v Speaker 6>It's not like we can only do one or the </v>
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>

1496
01:11:12.291 --> 01:11:14.250
<v Speaker 6>Actually I found the combination of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>two</v>

1497
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:19.170
<v Speaker 7>is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Getting really high and chanting is such</v>

1498
01:11:19.171 --> 01:11:21.250
<v Speaker 7>a perfect synergy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the,</v>

1499
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.780
<v Speaker 7>it's so fun to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I mean getting high,</v>

1500
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.770
<v Speaker 7>doing anything,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's pretty</v>

1501
01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:27.320
<v Speaker 6>to be the most amazing is getting high </v>
<v Speaker 6>and doing yoga.</v>

1502
01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:30.380
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love to get super big.</v>

<v Speaker 6>do yoga.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I got like some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a few dvds and I got one thing that I've</v>

01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:47.650
<v Speaker 6>So you're just in tune with every fiber </v>
<v Speaker 6>of your muscles and you're holding these</v>

1507

<v Speaker 6>fucking poses and I'm holding him in his</v>
<v Speaker 6>hotel room and then after I'm done,</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's super clean and it's like you sit </v>

1512
01:12:11.781 --> 01:12:16.781
<v Speaker 6>here in this new room and just this is </v>
<v Speaker 6>just relax a little until the yoga wears</v>

1513
01:12:16.941 --> 01:12:18.470
<v Speaker 6>off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you can go right back in.</v>

1514
01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:23.060
<v Speaker 6>It's like it puts you in some crazy new </v>
<v Speaker 6>high room or you're like,</v>

1515
01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:27.530

<v Speaker 6>It's like my body's in balance.</v>

1516
01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.670
<v Speaker 6>My mind is imbalanced.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can see things so clearly.</v>

<v Speaker 12>I agree with the CGI was fucking cool </v>

1556
01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:25.740
<v Speaker 12>and there were some really cool moments,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but what bothered me about the movie or </v>

1557
01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:27.590
<v Speaker 12>really bothered me about the movie,</v>

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.720
<v Speaker 12>was the penis and what made it,</v>
<v Speaker 12>what made it kind of what made me really</v>

1559
01:14:31.721 --> 01:14:35.740
<v Speaker 12>start eating it a halfway through and </v>
<v Speaker 12>get embarrassed by it and just think,</v>

01:14:35.741 --> 01:14:40.741
<v Speaker 12>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'll never go see a fucking movie again </v>

1561
01:14:40.741 --> 01:14:40.741
<v Speaker 12>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 12>beginning fucking News Corp and I was </v>

1566
01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:52.260
<v Speaker 12>These chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 12>these fucking chimps who have been </v>

1567
01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:54.451
<v Speaker 12>tortured in laboratories who I've,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I told you by the time I almost got </v>

1568
01:14:54.451 --> 01:14:55.420
<v Speaker 12>killed by a chimpanzee already,</v>
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>

1569
01:14:55.930 --> 01:14:58.510
<v Speaker 12>I told you that story.</v>
<v Speaker 12>When was this?</v>

1570
01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:03.870
<v Speaker 12>I didn't tell you that story.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Even if you did tell him to tell me </v>

1571
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:06.481
<v Speaker 12>again.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm sure a lot of people never heard of </v>

1572
01:15:06.481 --> 01:15:06.481
<v Speaker 12>it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Tell me.</v>

1573
01:15:06.481 --> 01:15:08.200
<v Speaker 12>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 12>for this pilot I did for comedy central,</v>

1574
01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:13.710
<v Speaker 12>we had a chimpanzee as one of the gags </v>
<v Speaker 12>where I was playing chess with a </v>

1575
01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.880
<v Speaker 12>chimpanzee and the chimpanzee beat me at</v>
<v Speaker 12>a move.</v>

1576
01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:18.050
<v Speaker 12>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 12>so I go,</v>

1577
01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.560
<v Speaker 12>I'm smarter than me.</v>
<v Speaker 12>She's a stupid quick gag,</v>

1578
01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:22.950
<v Speaker 12>like a computer hooked up to the champ </v>
<v Speaker 12>and like the,</v>

1579
01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:24.350
<v Speaker 12>it says checkmate,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the commuters that.</v>

1580
01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:29.460
<v Speaker 12>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So I was really excited about this day </v>

1581
01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:29.600
<v Speaker 12>and my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

1582
01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:34.980
<v Speaker 12>Tom Janice,</v>
<v Speaker 12>who was the co creator of the show and </v>

1583
01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:34.980
<v Speaker 12>directed it was,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1584
01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:35.530
<v Speaker 12>he,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

1585
01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.300
<v Speaker 12>he kept telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 12>Dunkin,</v>

1586
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:38.830
<v Speaker 12>is that you?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Do you think there's any way we could do</v>

1587
01:15:38.831 --> 01:15:41.710
<v Speaker 12>this without a chimp or do you really </v>
<v Speaker 12>want to have a chimpanzee?</v>

1588
01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:46.710
<v Speaker 12>Because I've worked with chimpanzees </v>
<v Speaker 12>before and they're really hard to </v>

1589
01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:48.280
<v Speaker 12>control on set and they're dangerous and</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm like,</v>

1590
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:50.930
<v Speaker 12>no,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I want to work with a chimp man.</v>

1591
01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:56.160
<v Speaker 12>I'm not going to say no to Oregon with a</v>
<v Speaker 12>chimp and they're not dangerous and </v>

1592
01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.771
<v Speaker 12>they're going to sense that I'm a nice </v>
<v Speaker 12>guy and the chimpanzee is going to know </v>

1593
01:15:58.771 --> 01:16:02.281
<v Speaker 12>I'm okay and it's going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I was looking forward to this for days </v>

1594
01:16:02.281 --> 01:16:03.610
<v Speaker 12>because I've always wanted to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 12>hold a chimpanzee.</v>

1595
01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:06.640
<v Speaker 12>So a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The chimp gets here,</v>

1596
01:16:06.641 --> 01:16:11.641
<v Speaker 12>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I know the chimps there cause it's </v>

1597
01:16:11.641 --> 01:16:13.420
<v Speaker 12>punching.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The hardwood floor is hard as it can,</v>

1598
01:16:13.421 --> 01:16:16.750
<v Speaker 12>as it's coming down through to where </v>
<v Speaker 12>we're shooting.</v>

1599
01:16:16.751 --> 01:16:18.970
<v Speaker 12>It's just punching the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 12>punching the floor,</v>

1600
01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.590
<v Speaker 12>punching the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 12>Bang,</v>

1601

<v Speaker 12>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 12>Bang.</v>

1602
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:27.390
<v Speaker 12>This fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It looks like if you took a toddler and </v>

1603
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:29.671
<v Speaker 12>just blasted it with steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's like imagine the most muscular </v>

1604
01:16:29.671 --> 01:16:31.270
<v Speaker 12>toddler with the worst case of add on </v>
<v Speaker 12>the planet.</v>

1605
01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.600
<v Speaker 12>That's a chimpanzee.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And so right before we started shooting,</v>

1606
01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.250
<v Speaker 12>the guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 12>okay,</v>

01:16:36.251 --> 01:16:39.250
<v Speaker 12>just so you guys know this,</v>
<v Speaker 12>a very friendly monkey.</v>

1608
01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.730
<v Speaker 12>I'm cold monkey or I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 12>chimp,</v>

1609
01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:43.200
<v Speaker 12>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I've,</v>

1610
01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:48.220
<v Speaker 12>I'm going to get trainers sucks too </v>
<v Speaker 12>much.</v>

1611
01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:50.830
<v Speaker 12>I'm trying to determine is there a </v>
<v Speaker 12>Harvard for chimp trainers?</v>

1612
01:16:50.831 --> 01:16:53.260
<v Speaker 12>You just fucking get a chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If you say you're a trainer,</v>

1613
01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.830
<v Speaker 12>you can rent the thing out.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Don't you have to be a problem at all?</v>

1614
01:16:55.831 --> 01:16:56.980
<v Speaker 12>Just or something.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I don't know.</v>

1615
01:16:57.150 --> 01:16:59.080
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So this fucking monkey.</v>

1616
01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:00.500
<v Speaker 12>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>just,</v>

1617
01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:02.200
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the chimpanzees,</v>

1618
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:07.201
<v Speaker 12>the most strongest person in the room if</v>
<v Speaker 12>he comes up to you,</v>

1619
01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:09.670
<v Speaker 12>he just wants to say hi.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He's very friendly,</v>

1620
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:14.680
<v Speaker 12>just don't make any quick movements.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And so suddenly this chimp is sitting in</v>

1621
01:17:15.141 --> 01:17:18.430
<v Speaker 12>front of me and it goes from being like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>oh,</v>

1622
01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:23.570
<v Speaker 12>this is going to be cute to being like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>this is no different than being with a </v>

1623
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:23.570
<v Speaker 12>tiger.</v>

1624
01:17:23.690 --> 01:17:28.690
<v Speaker 12>This thing is fucking strong.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It seems kind of focused in core right </v>

1625
01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:30.350
<v Speaker 12>now.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But it was being a little weird earlier.</v>

1626
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:32.210
<v Speaker 12>How big was it?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>

1627
01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:33.530
<v Speaker 12>I,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I don't,</v>

1628
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:38.590
<v Speaker 12>I don't know the weight of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It was probably like a little higher </v>

1629
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:38.590
<v Speaker 12>than my waist,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like with a,</v>

1630
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:42.080
<v Speaker 12>with a chimp crouch happening.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So you say maybe 70 pounds,</v>

1631
01:17:42.081 --> 01:17:43.790
<v Speaker 12>80 pounds?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>

1632
01:17:43.791 --> 01:17:47.570
<v Speaker 12>I'd say like a,</v>
<v Speaker 12>probably 80 pounds or something.</v>

1633
01:17:47.571 --> 01:17:48.440
<v Speaker 12>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I don't know.</v>

1634
01:17:48.441 --> 01:17:49.910
<v Speaker 12>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So it's not a baby?</v>

1635
01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:50.920
<v Speaker 12>No,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's a,</v>

1636
01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.150
<v Speaker 12>it's a middle aged little guy wearing </v>
<v Speaker 12>blue jeans.</v>

1637
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:55.850
<v Speaker 12>I think it's more than 100.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I don't.</v>

1638
01:17:55.930 --> 01:17:56.810
<v Speaker 12>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It wasn't.</v>

1639
01:17:56.811 --> 01:17:57.260
<v Speaker 12>No,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I could.</v>

1640
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:58.730
<v Speaker 12>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I could've picked it up.</v>

1641
01:17:58.760 --> 01:17:59.630
<v Speaker 12>Muscular Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Right.</v>

1642
01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:02.330
<v Speaker 12>So the real muscular.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So we're,</v>

1643
01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:04.460
<v Speaker 12>we're starting to do the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Chimps.</v>

1644
01:18:04.461 --> 01:18:05.660
<v Speaker 12>Got to move a piece,</v>
<v Speaker 12>by the way,</v>

1645
01:18:05.661 --> 01:18:07.040
<v Speaker 12>for animal rights people out there.</v>

1646
01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.390
<v Speaker 12>I will never,</v>
<v Speaker 12>ever,</v>

1647
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:13.450
<v Speaker 12>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 12>ever use a chimpanzee again in anything </v>

1648
01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:14.210
<v Speaker 12>that I ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I don't advocate it.</v>

1649
01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:16.070
<v Speaker 12>It's cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's a horrible thing.</v>

1650
01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:21.220
<v Speaker 12>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 12>These creatures belong and habitats are </v>

1651
01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:22.310
<v Speaker 12>in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They do not belong on a movie set.</v>

1652
01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.350
<v Speaker 12>They're very cool,</v>
<v Speaker 12>very cool creatures.</v>

1653
01:18:24.351 --> 01:18:25.850
<v Speaker 12>But that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's a terrible thing.</v>

1654
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:27.320
<v Speaker 12>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Totally.</v>

1655
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:32.350
<v Speaker 12>I'm fucking sitting there and the </v>
<v Speaker 12>basically in like two seconds,</v>

1656
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:39.750
<v Speaker 12>the chimp went from being calm and kind </v>
<v Speaker 12>of focused to screaming at the top of </v>

1657
01:18:41.321 --> 01:18:46.270
<v Speaker 12>its lungs and shooting past me.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It may be 20 miles per hour,</v>

1658
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.540
<v Speaker 12>like like there's no way I could have </v>
<v Speaker 12>reacted if it wanted to pounce on me.</v>

1659
01:18:49.541 --> 01:18:52.570
<v Speaker 12>I couldn't have blocked it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It was just this bang,</v>

1660
01:18:52.571 --> 01:18:56.770
<v Speaker 12>like a whitening bullet shoots by me and</v>
<v Speaker 12>runs to the top of this divider.</v>

1661
01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:59.140
<v Speaker 12>So now it's pulling like a King Kong.</v>

1662
01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:03.220
<v Speaker 12>It's like it's screaming at all of us </v>
<v Speaker 12>and I'm like,</v>

1663
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:06.820
<v Speaker 12>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm feeling the worst sense of guilt and</v>

1664
01:19:06.821 --> 01:19:08.260
<v Speaker 12>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Anyway,</v>

1665
01:19:08.530 --> 01:19:10.330
<v Speaker 12>we'll get it back down.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Holy Shit.</v>

1666
01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:12.430
<v Speaker 12>We get it back down.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Everything's fine again.</v>

1667
01:19:12.610 --> 01:19:17.610
<v Speaker 12>It's like nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I didn't just freak out and just have </v>

1668
01:19:17.610 --> 01:19:17.610
<v Speaker 12>it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's cool.</v>

1669
01:19:17.610 --> 01:19:17.610
<v Speaker 12>Gets off.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's like,</v>

1670
01:19:17.610 --> 01:19:17.610
<v Speaker 12>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 12>Whoa,</v>

1671
01:19:17.610 --> 01:19:17.610
<v Speaker 12>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Hold on.</v>

1672
01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.410
<v Speaker 12>This thing freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And you went back to work with it again.</v>

1673
01:19:20.411 --> 01:19:21.970
<v Speaker 12>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Oh my God.</v>

1674
01:19:21.971 --> 01:19:25.310
<v Speaker 12>I went back to work,</v>
<v Speaker 12>went back to work to get the shot.</v>

1675
01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:27.130
<v Speaker 12>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's low budget and fuck it man.</v>

1676
01:19:27.131 --> 01:19:29.440
<v Speaker 12>Let's go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So what if I lose my hockey?</v>

1677
01:19:29.441 --> 01:19:34.441
<v Speaker 12>And I was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It was a bad decision in retrospect to </v>

1678
01:19:34.441 --> 01:19:34.441
<v Speaker 12>them in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I decided to do it.</v>

1679
01:19:35.650 --> 01:19:40.650
<v Speaker 12>So things in front of me again and it's </v>
<v Speaker 12>calmed down and it's kind of cool.</v>

1680
01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:47.520
<v Speaker 12>Now I look over,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the trainer is sweating like,</v>

1681
01:19:47.571 --> 01:19:48.790
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>nervous sweat,</v>

1682
01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:50.110
<v Speaker 12>like nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 12>nervous sweat.</v>

1683
01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:54.730
<v Speaker 12>And I swear I hear the guy who's with </v>
<v Speaker 12>him whisper to him.</v>

1684
01:19:56.410 --> 01:20:01.020
<v Speaker 12>Should we go ahead relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Not yet.</v>

1685
01:20:01.410 --> 01:20:03.210
<v Speaker 12>He yells,</v>
<v Speaker 12>yells at the guy.</v>

1686
01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:08.540
<v Speaker 12>So I'm thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>did he just suggest that they dart the </v>

1687
01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:12.130
<v Speaker 12>big dark the chimp or something?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Like they calm it down like something's </v>

1688
01:20:12.130 --> 01:20:12.570
<v Speaker 12>not right with the chimp right now.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So anyway,</v>

1689
01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.050
<v Speaker 12>thing goes for me again,</v>
<v Speaker 12>not for me,</v>

1690
01:20:16.051 --> 01:20:19.410
<v Speaker 12>but shoots out of the chair again.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The guy tackles it.</v>

1691
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.770
<v Speaker 12>Football tackles the chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>

1692
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:25.350
<v Speaker 12>Football tackles this poor fucking </v>
<v Speaker 12>creature.</v>

1693
01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:31.130
<v Speaker 12>The guy hits his head on a chair,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he hits his nose on a chair from </v>

1694
01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:33.000
<v Speaker 12>tackling the champ.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The chimp didn't,</v>

1695
01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.010
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the chimp didn't bite him,</v>

1696
01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:36.450
<v Speaker 12>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he,</v>

1697
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:38.190
<v Speaker 12>he hit his nose.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I saw him do it.</v>

1698
01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:41.850
<v Speaker 12>So because he tackled the champ,</v>
<v Speaker 12>why do you tackle the chimp?</v>

1699
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:45.630
<v Speaker 12>He saw something in the chimps eyes that</v>
<v Speaker 12>made him think,</v>

1700
01:20:45.631 --> 01:20:48.060
<v Speaker 12>I got to tackle this chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So he tackles the chimp.</v>

1701
01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.820
<v Speaker 12>He stands up every,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I look around,</v>

1702
01:20:50.821 --> 01:20:54.990
<v Speaker 12>the crew is like white faced.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm sitting here frozen in terror.</v>

1703
01:20:55.290 --> 01:21:00.290
<v Speaker 12>I look over the chimp is projectile </v>
<v Speaker 12>vomiting bananas because that's what </v>

1704
01:21:00.811 --> 01:21:03.270
<v Speaker 12>they do and they get anxious and the was</v>
<v Speaker 12>like,</v>

1705
01:21:03.271 --> 01:21:04.080
<v Speaker 12>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we can go on.</v>

1706
01:21:04.081 --> 01:21:05.520
<v Speaker 12>Everything's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Everything's fine.</v>

1707
01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:09.630
<v Speaker 12>Blood running down his face from where </v>
<v Speaker 12>he slammed into the chair,</v>

1708
01:21:09.631 --> 01:21:12.270
<v Speaker 12>just blood just gushing down the guy's </v>
<v Speaker 12>face.</v>

1709
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:14.250
<v Speaker 9>And uh,</v>

1710
01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:15.730
<v Speaker 12>no.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm like,</v>

1711
01:21:15.731 --> 01:21:16.180
<v Speaker 12>no,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know what?</v>

1712
01:21:16.181 --> 01:21:17.470
<v Speaker 12>I think we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Let's,</v>

1713
01:21:17.530 --> 01:21:19.630
<v Speaker 12>let's call us.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Let's call this a day.</v>

1714
01:21:20.230 --> 01:21:22.120
<v Speaker 12>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that happened man.</v>

1715
01:21:22.121 --> 01:21:27.121
<v Speaker 12>Those fucking things are fast and deadly</v>
<v Speaker 12>and dangerous and fucking kind of half </v>

1716
01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.580
<v Speaker 12>insane because they're out of their </v>
<v Speaker 12>environment.</v>

1717
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:35.790
<v Speaker 12>So when I went to see planet of apes and</v>
<v Speaker 12>the first time one of those chimps went </v>

1718
01:21:37.541 --> 01:21:40.300
<v Speaker 12>to kill someone and the chimps like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>no,</v>

1719
01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:42.200
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>

1720
01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:43.930
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we mustn't kill.</v>

1721
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:46.750
<v Speaker 12>Let's let these humans live.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm like,</v>

1722
01:21:46.751 --> 01:21:51.751
<v Speaker 12>fuck that chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If they were superintelligent they'd be </v>

1723
01:21:51.751 --> 01:21:54.310
<v Speaker 12>ripping people to like fucking Turkey on</v>
<v Speaker 12>Thanksgiving.</v>

1724
01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:56.530
<v Speaker 12>That's what annoyed me about it should </v>
<v Speaker 12>have been brutal.</v>

1725
01:21:56.531 --> 01:22:01.531
<v Speaker 12>It was more real that you wanted to be </v>
<v Speaker 12>more realistic to see monkeys like </v>

1726
01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:03.280
<v Speaker 12>written,</v>
<v Speaker 12>not just by the way,</v>

1727
01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:08.400
<v Speaker 12>like all these monkeys seem really good </v>
<v Speaker 12>at jumping through a office glass.</v>

1728
01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:10.710
<v Speaker 12>If they.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If they weren't,</v>

1729
01:22:10.711 --> 01:22:15.711
<v Speaker 12>it would be the most boring movie ever.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If they're all hitting the glass and </v>

1730
01:22:15.711 --> 01:22:18.290
<v Speaker 12>falling back,</v>
<v Speaker 12>grabbing the workers in the office and </v>

1731
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:19.890
<v Speaker 12>slamming their bodies into the glass,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like bean bags,</v>

1732
01:22:19.891 --> 01:22:23.700
<v Speaker 12>it's splitting them like fucking so you </v>
<v Speaker 12>didn't have fun with the movie at all.</v>

1733
01:22:23.701 --> 01:22:28.701
<v Speaker 12>You couldn't look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I did think that some of that jump into </v>

1734
01:22:28.701 --> 01:22:31.401
<v Speaker 12>the glass shit was ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but I was willing to let it go because </v>

1735
01:22:31.401 --> 01:22:31.401
<v Speaker 12>it was a fun movie.</v>

1736
01:22:31.401 --> 01:22:31.401
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that's what I would think.</v>

1737
01:22:31.401 --> 01:22:31.890
<v Speaker 12>So me.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It was just so fun.</v>

1738
01:22:31.891 --> 01:22:34.130
<v Speaker 12>Bad ass moving.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Listen,</v>

1739
01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:35.970
<v Speaker 12>there is that part of my brains here </v>
<v Speaker 12>that's like,</v>

1740
01:22:35.971 --> 01:22:37.050
<v Speaker 12>well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>this is fucking cool,</v>

1741
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:38.640
<v Speaker 12>but I'm not discounting what you're </v>
<v Speaker 12>saying.</v>

1742
01:22:38.641 --> 01:22:41.070
<v Speaker 12>I completely agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If they went full chimpanzee,</v>

1743
01:22:41.071 --> 01:22:42.620
<v Speaker 12>what a.</v>
<v Speaker 12>What a champ would really be lucky.</v>

1744
01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.880
<v Speaker 12>As intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Who would be a horror film?</v>

1745
01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:48.750
<v Speaker 12>A horror film of epic proportions with </v>
<v Speaker 12>the chimps would storm the town and just</v>

1746
01:22:48.751 --> 01:22:50.350
<v Speaker 12>kill all the people.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Exactly.</v>

1747
01:22:50.351 --> 01:22:52.530
<v Speaker 12>Utilize them.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's really what would happen.</v>

1748
01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:56.410
<v Speaker 12>I saw this really cool picture on this </v>
<v Speaker 12>website.</v>

1749
01:22:56.411 --> 01:23:00.700
<v Speaker 12>I go to call this information and that </v>
<v Speaker 12>sounds like a real credible source.</v>

1750
01:23:00.701 --> 01:23:01.810
<v Speaker 12>It's a great website,</v>
<v Speaker 12>man.</v>

1751
01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:04.930
<v Speaker 12>They put up here the invitation dot.</v>
<v Speaker 12>What did you.</v>

1752
01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 12>Where'd you get the article?</v>

1753
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.680
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was on disinformation.com.</v>

1754
01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:12.870
<v Speaker 5>That sounds like you immediately just </v>
<v Speaker 5>fall into one of those people that are </v>

1755
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:14.130
<v Speaker 5>constantly searching for the truth </v>
<v Speaker 5>behind the lies.</v>

1756
01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:16.600
<v Speaker 5>It's not a conspiracy side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's more like it's a good site.</v>

1757
01:23:16.601 --> 01:23:21.601
<v Speaker 5>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying like I've go to her it </v>

1758
01:23:21.601 --> 01:23:23.821
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying that if that's one of </v>

1759
01:23:23.821 --> 01:23:26.400
<v Speaker 5>those like hot buttons like </v>
<v Speaker 5>disinformation dot Com Info.</v>

1760
01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:31.440
<v Speaker 5>It's like a website cause we lie to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have the book to the people that </v>

1761
01:23:32.231 --> 01:23:33.370
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're being lied to.</v>

1762
01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:38.380
<v Speaker 5>Is that the people that produce that </v>
<v Speaker 5>book right in and the whole series of </v>

1763
01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:38.380
<v Speaker 5>those books,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which are great.</v>

1764
01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:39.190
<v Speaker 5>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

1765
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:41.230
<v Speaker 5>books you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You realize.</v>

1766
01:23:41.231 --> 01:23:44.380
<v Speaker 5>How many times do you have been lied to?</v>
<v Speaker 5>All throughout history and it's like,</v>

1767
01:23:44.381 --> 01:23:47.370
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell about that too?</v>

1768
01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:50.870
<v Speaker 12>Everything,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but there's a picture on this site,</v>

1769
01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:55.900
<v Speaker 12>have a painting.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Someone did a planet of the apes and </v>

1770
01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:58.241
<v Speaker 12>it's these apes with guns standing in </v>
<v Speaker 12>front of a pile of dead human bodies </v>

1771
01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:02.150
<v Speaker 12>like their hunters posing with like </v>
<v Speaker 12>things that they've killed.</v>

1772
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:04.550
<v Speaker 12>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's cool when I see that because then</v>

1773
01:24:04.551 --> 01:24:07.460
<v Speaker 12>they're really playing that like we flip</v>
<v Speaker 12>the script.</v>

1774
01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:12.700
<v Speaker 12>Here's what we years that planet of the </v>
<v Speaker 12>apes by showing monkeys behaving like </v>

1775
01:24:13.581 --> 01:24:18.581
<v Speaker 12>humans do.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It was a cool creative way to amplify </v>

1776
01:24:18.581 --> 01:24:20.900
<v Speaker 12>the cruelty and humanity and brutality </v>
<v Speaker 12>of humans.</v>

1777
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:26.110
<v Speaker 12>That was an important aspect of it is </v>
<v Speaker 12>the monkeys were supposed to be a cruel </v>

1778
01:24:26.991 --> 01:24:28.460
<v Speaker 12>to things that they didn't think were </v>
<v Speaker 12>smart,</v>

1779
01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:34.060
<v Speaker 12>so the fact that these are distant </v>
<v Speaker 12>ancestors started off as like what </v>

1780
01:24:35.031 --> 01:24:40.031
<v Speaker 12>appears to be.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It seems like while that chimp was </v>

1781
01:24:40.031 --> 01:24:42.491
<v Speaker 12>getting educated,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he got a nice heavy dose of like some </v>

1782
01:24:42.491 --> 01:24:45.020
<v Speaker 12>form of like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>this is no spoilers by the way.</v>

1783
01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:50.050
<v Speaker 12>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 12>You're not going to drop some spoilers </v>

1784
01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:50.050
<v Speaker 12>on us because I haven't seen it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's planted the fucking names.</v>

1785
01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:51.050
<v Speaker 12>If you don't know what's about talking </v>
<v Speaker 12>monkeys.</v>

1786
01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:55.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a little bit of a spoiler.</v>

1787
01:24:55.991 --> 01:24:56.920
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

1788
01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.310
<v Speaker 5>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

1789
01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.460
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1790
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:01.030
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1791
01:25:01.090 --> 01:25:02.440
<v Speaker 5>That movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was fun for me.</v>

1792
01:25:02.710 --> 01:25:07.710
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy the shit out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you could make a movie where it </v>

1793
01:25:07.710 --> 01:25:10.180
<v Speaker 5>would be all of the scenes from King </v>
<v Speaker 5>Kong and from the hulk,</v>

1794
01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:13.480
<v Speaker 5>whether they were just smashing </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything and I would watch that movie.</v>

1795
01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:18.680
<v Speaker 5>You'd be like 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would pay $20 to go see just a video </v>

1796
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:23.440
<v Speaker 5>of the whole fucking shit up for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 5>minutes and fucking shit up.</v>

1797
01:25:23.710 --> 01:25:24.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so fun.</v>

1798
01:25:24.731 --> 01:25:27.400
<v Speaker 5>The people screaming when he's stepping </v>
<v Speaker 5>on them.</v>

1799
01:25:27.401 --> 01:25:29.920
<v Speaker 5>The last King Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>

1800
01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.860
<v Speaker 5>I just love the idea of the special </v>
<v Speaker 5>effects.</v>

1801
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:35.290
<v Speaker 5>Did you like Godzilla as much?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1802
01:25:35.291 --> 01:25:37.150
<v Speaker 5>I liked that when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1803
01:25:37.151 --> 01:25:39.820
<v Speaker 5>What were those movies back then were so</v>
<v Speaker 5>stupid.</v>

1804
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:41.050
<v Speaker 5>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1805
01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:43.150
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we all agreed that we're stupid.</v>

1806
01:25:43.151 --> 01:25:45.070
<v Speaker 5>We didn't think that was like a real </v>
<v Speaker 5>monster.</v>

1807
01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:47.170
<v Speaker 5>There was no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was not a real monster,</v>

1808
01:25:47.171 --> 01:25:50.830
<v Speaker 5>but we were willing to go along with it </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it was kind of fun.</v>

1809
01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:54.670
<v Speaker 5>There was no doubt the water would not </v>
<v Speaker 5>move that way if it was really the ocean</v>

1810
01:25:54.671 --> 01:25:56.830
<v Speaker 5>that's a goddamn bathtub,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no doubt,</v>

1811
01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:00.880
<v Speaker 5>but we were willing to accept it because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was kind of cool movie.</v>

1812
01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.340
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's fun for me now is I just love</v>

1813
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:09.340
<v Speaker 10>watching these artificially created </v>
<v Speaker 10>creatures that have been rendered on a </v>

1814
01:26:11.031 --> 01:26:14.030
<v Speaker 10>computer and people are interacting with</v>
<v Speaker 10>them.</v>

1815
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:16.250
<v Speaker 10>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 10>like the King Kong scene,</v>

1816
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:20.870
<v Speaker 10>when when King Kong falls down in the </v>
<v Speaker 10>newest king county falls down in between</v>

1817
01:26:20.871 --> 01:26:25.871
<v Speaker 10>these two into a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>like a big crater or something like </v>

1818
01:26:25.871 --> 01:26:26.450
<v Speaker 10>that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's a big canyon.</v>

1819
01:26:26.451 --> 01:26:31.451
<v Speaker 10>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 10>he falls down to this big crack and </v>

1820
01:26:31.451 --> 01:26:32.090
<v Speaker 10>there's all these vines and shit and </v>
<v Speaker 10>he's duking it out with trx is all along</v>

1821
01:26:32.091 --> 01:26:37.091
<v Speaker 10>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Wally's like juggling this chick and </v>

1822
01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:37.091
<v Speaker 10>while you're watching it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>God damn,</v>

1823
01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:40.760
<v Speaker 10>this is a motion picture piece of art.</v>
<v Speaker 10>This is a masterpiece.</v>

1824
01:26:40.761 --> 01:26:45.761
<v Speaker 10>What they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 10>This really does look like a giant </v>

1825
01:26:45.761 --> 01:26:48.560
<v Speaker 10>gorilla fighting off t rexes that's </v>
<v Speaker 10>fucking bad ass and it's really.</v>

1826
01:26:48.561 --> 01:26:50.780
<v Speaker 10>It really does look like kids </v>
<v Speaker 10>interacting with trees.</v>

1827
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:55.930
<v Speaker 10>It really does.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's amazing when the fucking gorilla </v>

1828
01:26:55.930 --> 01:26:59.420
<v Speaker 10>gets to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 10>starts duking it out with them and it's </v>

1829
01:26:59.420 --> 01:26:59.420
<v Speaker 10>like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that really looks like a really.</v>

1830
01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:03.790
<v Speaker 10>This is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Blown away by that shit blown away </v>

1831
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:06.770
<v Speaker 10>because I can't I when you hear about </v>
<v Speaker 10>like computer languages,</v>

1832
01:27:06.771 --> 01:27:11.771
<v Speaker 10>like I've watched John Carmax do this,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this speech about the new technology in </v>

1833
01:27:11.771 --> 01:27:16.300
<v Speaker 10>their game rage and like all the </v>
<v Speaker 10>different cool tweaks and different </v>

1834
01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:17.390
<v Speaker 10>things that they've done with it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Remember when we went there,</v>

1835
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:19.760
<v Speaker 10>when we were in Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we got a chance to go.</v>

1836
01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:24.940
<v Speaker 10>It's software.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They let us go walk around the studio </v>

1837
01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:24.940
<v Speaker 10>and look at the game before it was ever </v>
<v Speaker 10>made.</v>

1838
01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:29.800
<v Speaker 10>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you will listen to him talk and it's </v>

1839
01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.990
<v Speaker 10>like my brain is so far removed from any</v>
<v Speaker 10>of this knowledge.</v>

1840
01:27:32.890 --> 01:27:37.890
<v Speaker 10>I his what he's discussing with how they</v>
<v Speaker 10>created video game moves,</v>

1841
01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:43.360
<v Speaker 10>how they,</v>
<v Speaker 10>how they have changed the way the game </v>

1842
01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.761
<v Speaker 10>interacts with people and I know he's </v>
<v Speaker 10>doing this with ones and zeros or </v>

1843
01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:47.810
<v Speaker 10>numbers on white paper.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's so far.</v>

1844
01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:50.120
<v Speaker 10>He's my.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He might as well be an alien.</v>

1845
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:53.390
<v Speaker 10>He might as well be an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He might as well be a different species.</v>

1846
01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:59.290
<v Speaker 7>They May.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Somebody was just telling me that </v>

1847
01:27:59.290 --> 01:28:02.600
<v Speaker 7>programmers brain start working </v>
<v Speaker 7>differently because they're constantly </v>

1848
01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.160
<v Speaker 7>thinking and coding language and it </v>
<v Speaker 7>creates this difference in the way their</v>

1849
01:28:05.161 --> 01:28:07.230
<v Speaker 7>brains work,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I didn't really understand,</v>

1850
01:28:07.231 --> 01:28:08.700
<v Speaker 7>but that totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1851
01:28:08.701 --> 01:28:13.701
<v Speaker 7>When I just want.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I use photoshop and I think like </v>

1852
01:28:13.701 --> 01:28:16.670
<v Speaker 7>somebody built this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like somebody figured out how to do </v>

1853
01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:16.670
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

1854
01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:19.650
<v Speaker 7>that is insane to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's who are these people?</v>

1855
01:28:19.651 --> 01:28:24.651
<v Speaker 7>It's like we're giving academy awards </v>
<v Speaker 7>and like huge awards and accolades to </v>

1856
01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:30.380
<v Speaker 7>like symmetrical people who are really </v>
<v Speaker 7>good at like reciting lines in a </v>

1857
01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:34.251
<v Speaker 7>specific way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How come like the famous people in our </v>

1858
01:28:34.251 --> 01:28:36.690
<v Speaker 7>society aren't these super geniuses who </v>
<v Speaker 7>are building phones?</v>

1859
01:28:36.691 --> 01:28:41.691
<v Speaker 7>Why don't we have like awards for people</v>
<v Speaker 7>who make the crazy shit that makes our </v>

1860
01:28:41.701 --> 01:28:43.440
<v Speaker 7>life so much better?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's really weird,</v>

1861
01:28:43.441 --> 01:28:44.850
<v Speaker 7>Jonny Lynn's fit flair.</v>

1862
01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:46.770
<v Speaker 10>It is very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

1863
01:28:46.771 --> 01:28:49.580
<v Speaker 10>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Because our society is sort of developed</v>

1864
01:28:49.581 --> 01:28:54.581
<v Speaker 10>and evolved without much planning.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's sort of just happened and as we are</v>

1865
01:28:54.891 --> 01:28:59.891
<v Speaker 10>this weird combination of evolving being</v>
<v Speaker 10>an animal with needs and instincts,</v>

1866
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:06.590
<v Speaker 10>there's a lot of variables that don't </v>
<v Speaker 10>get it accounted for as it'd behavior </v>

1867
01:29:07.591 --> 01:29:12.591
<v Speaker 10>forms into patterns and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and cultures evolve around giant masses </v>

1868
01:29:12.591 --> 01:29:17.391
<v Speaker 10>of land that it doesn't get planned out.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But I always feel just like a field with</v>

1869
01:29:18.271 --> 01:29:21.420
<v Speaker 10>any pattern that is established in </v>
<v Speaker 10>nature.</v>

1870
01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:24.180
<v Speaker 10>I always feel that the most fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 10>human behavior,</v>

1871
01:29:24.181 --> 01:29:29.181
<v Speaker 10>all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The whole pile of it all has got to all </v>

1872
01:29:29.181 --> 01:29:30.030
<v Speaker 10>be natural.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's all almost unavoidable.</v>

1873
01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:35.031
<v Speaker 10>That this is just what the human being </v>
<v Speaker 10>does and as we are older and have much </v>

1874
01:29:35.521 --> 01:29:38.460
<v Speaker 10>less responsibility than most people,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1875
01:29:38.461 --> 01:29:40.380
<v Speaker 10>30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1876
01:29:40.381 --> 01:29:44.910
<v Speaker 10>or rather a 300 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 10>our age were literally dying,</v>

1877
01:29:45.090 --> 01:29:46.740
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>500 years ago.</v>

1878
01:29:46.741 --> 01:29:48.560
<v Speaker 10>How long,</v>
<v Speaker 10>how long do people live in,</v>

1879
01:29:48.561 --> 01:29:49.920
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and it was,</v>

1880
01:29:49.921 --> 01:29:51.180
<v Speaker 10>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it was normal.</v>

1881
01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.560
<v Speaker 10>It was normal a thousand years ago.</v>

1882
01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.120
<v Speaker 12>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I looked at that.</v>

1883
01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:59.420
<v Speaker 12>I think it's like 32 years.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If you can look up the lifespan of </v>

1884
01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:02.340
<v Speaker 12>people,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's like a thousand years ago.</v>

1885
01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.020
<v Speaker 12>It's like 18 hundreds.</v>

1886
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:09.310
<v Speaker 10>It's almost to me like we're not </v>
<v Speaker 10>supposed to get old enough to see the </v>

1887
01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:09.920
<v Speaker 10>hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Right?</v>

1888
01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:14.930
<v Speaker 10>It's almost like we're.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We're designed to die off right?</v>

1889
01:30:14.931 --> 01:30:15.890
<v Speaker 10>When we start going,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what?</v>

1890
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:17.990
<v Speaker 10>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what the fuck are we doing?</v>

1891
01:30:17.991 --> 01:30:18.270
<v Speaker 10>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 10>hey,</v>

1892
01:30:18.271 --> 01:30:18.780
<v Speaker 10>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 10>hey.</v>

1893
01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.840
<v Speaker 10>Everybody settled down.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What do we.</v>

1894
01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:24.880
<v Speaker 10>What exactly are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 10>But that's when we were supposed to </v>

1895
01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:24.880
<v Speaker 10>heart failure.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's what,</v>

1896
01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:26.900
<v Speaker 10>that's what it should supposed to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But we're,</v>

1897
01:30:26.901 --> 01:30:30.920
<v Speaker 10>we're alive so much longer now because </v>
<v Speaker 10>of nutrition and medicine and people are</v>

1898
01:30:30.921 --> 01:30:32.690
<v Speaker 10>just,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they're more,</v>

1899
01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:38.690
<v Speaker 10>they're more conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 10>A first person like yourself has more </v>

1900
01:30:38.690 --> 01:30:39.740
<v Speaker 10>free time as well and more free time to </v>
<v Speaker 10>contemplate,</v>

1901
01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:44.770
<v Speaker 10>and you're in a nonconformist occupation</v>
<v Speaker 10>where you're not constantly pressured </v>

1902
01:30:44.770 --> 01:30:49.331
<v Speaker 10>every day to thinking along certain </v>
<v Speaker 10>lines because as a real issue with the </v>

1903
01:30:49.331 --> 01:30:53.141
<v Speaker 10>American worker,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you think you're given eight hours a </v>

1904
01:30:53.141 --> 01:30:53.141
<v Speaker 10>day,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but you're not given eight hours a day.</v>

1905
01:30:53.141 --> 01:30:56.060
<v Speaker 10>You're given eight hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 10>plus your behavior outside of work can't</v>

1906
01:30:56.061 --> 01:31:01.061
<v Speaker 10>get much too crazy in comparison to your</v>
<v Speaker 10>behavior inside of work or it's gonna </v>

1907
01:31:01.061 --> 01:31:06.020
<v Speaker 10>Affect your performance at work.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You can't be partying too much and </v>

1908
01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:08.741
<v Speaker 10>coming into work hung over,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so the whole thing must be regulated so </v>

1909
01:31:08.741 --> 01:31:12.491
<v Speaker 10>everybody has to stay in La.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You can get crazy and say sexist jokes </v>

1910
01:31:12.491 --> 01:31:14.810
<v Speaker 10>around female coworkers or you'll go to </v>
<v Speaker 10>jail.</v>

1911
01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:16.220
<v Speaker 10>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you'll be arrested.</v>

1912
01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:21.320
<v Speaker 10>You.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You'll lose money because of sexual </v>

1913
01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:21.320
<v Speaker 10>harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know if you fire her,</v>

1914
01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:21.320
<v Speaker 10>you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you,</v>

1915
01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:24.440
<v Speaker 10>you're going to get sued and these are </v>
<v Speaker 10>all that.</v>

1916
01:31:24.450 --> 01:31:28.550
<v Speaker 10>This is all like an impossible thing to </v>
<v Speaker 10>avoid.</v>

1917
01:31:28.551 --> 01:31:31.100
<v Speaker 10>If you're not a normal person working a </v>
<v Speaker 10>normal job,</v>

1918
01:31:31.101 --> 01:31:36.101
<v Speaker 10>it's impossible for you to avoid your </v>
<v Speaker 10>behavior being altered just so that you </v>

1919
01:31:36.291 --> 01:31:36.950
<v Speaker 10>can work</v>

1920
01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:37.440
<v Speaker 12>well.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

1921
01:31:37.441 --> 01:31:42.240
<v Speaker 12>you're you heirs the game.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If people forgot they were playing.</v>

1922
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:45.870
<v Speaker 12>It's called Western society and most </v>
<v Speaker 12>people,</v>

1923
01:31:45.871 --> 01:31:48.210
<v Speaker 12>the way they play that game is they have</v>
<v Speaker 12>to.</v>

1924
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:51.900
<v Speaker 12>There's different roles they take.</v>
<v Speaker 12>There's the worker in the boss,</v>

1925
01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:57.320
<v Speaker 12>there's the executive as the president </v>
<v Speaker 12>police officers,</v>

1926
01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:00.810
<v Speaker 12>and it's all a game.</v>
<v Speaker 12>When you go and buy,</v>

1927
01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:03.190
<v Speaker 12>buy a starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I learned this.</v>

1928
01:32:03.191 --> 01:32:07.540
<v Speaker 12>There's a really cool meditative </v>
<v Speaker 12>technique you can do that's part of this</v>

1929
01:32:07.630 --> 01:32:09.640
<v Speaker 12>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 12>this guy gurdjieff talks about,</v>

1930
01:32:09.641 --> 01:32:14.641
<v Speaker 12>but it's basically shows you how you're </v>
<v Speaker 12>essentially just a series of automatic </v>

1931
01:32:14.641 --> 01:32:15.310
<v Speaker 12>functions throughout the day.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You're not even there,</v>

1932
01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:17.650
<v Speaker 12>but at what you do is when you go to buy</v>
<v Speaker 12>something,</v>

1933
01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:21.100
<v Speaker 12>just be aware of the way you buy </v>
<v Speaker 12>something.</v>

1934
01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:23.050
<v Speaker 12>Watch the way your hand gets your </v>
<v Speaker 12>wallet.</v>

1935
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:24.850
<v Speaker 12>Watch the way the money or the card </v>
<v Speaker 12>comes out.</v>

1936
01:32:24.851 --> 01:32:27.270
<v Speaker 12>Watch the way you swipe the card,</v>
<v Speaker 12>watch the way you talk to the person and</v>

1937
01:32:27.271 --> 01:32:32.271
<v Speaker 12>watch the way the person talks to you </v>
<v Speaker 12>and what you'll see happening is </v>

1938
01:32:32.271 --> 01:32:35.851
<v Speaker 12>something you've been doing for years </v>
<v Speaker 12>and years and years and years and years </v>

1939
01:32:35.851 --> 01:32:38.850
<v Speaker 12>and years,</v>
<v Speaker 12>over and over and over again to buying </v>

1940
01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:38.850
<v Speaker 12>shit because you live in America and </v>
<v Speaker 12>that's how he fucking survive.</v>

1941
01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:43.650
<v Speaker 12>It's buying shit at the cash register.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's a just a great way to see how when </v>

1942
01:32:43.650 --> 01:32:47.611
<v Speaker 12>you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>your body goes into this automated </v>

1943
01:32:47.611 --> 01:32:47.611
<v Speaker 12>function.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Get the wall,</v>

1944
01:32:47.611 --> 01:32:47.611
<v Speaker 12>pull the card,</v>
<v Speaker 12>say thanks in a weird way.</v>

1945
01:32:47.611 --> 01:32:52.501
<v Speaker 12>Look at the person.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If you look at the person you're seeing </v>

1946
01:32:52.501 --> 01:32:52.501
<v Speaker 12>an Automaton,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you're seeing a person who has put their</v>

1947
01:32:52.501 --> 01:32:57.450
<v Speaker 12>consciousness on the shelf,</v>
<v Speaker 12>why they like all day long process </v>

1948
01:32:57.450 --> 01:32:57.450
<v Speaker 12>people's cards,</v>
<v Speaker 12>process people cards.</v>

1949
01:32:57.450 --> 01:33:01.891
<v Speaker 12>So what you're seeing is two machines </v>
<v Speaker 12>having this interaction and it's really </v>

1950
01:33:01.891 --> 01:33:05.230
<v Speaker 12>fucking a great exercise to do because </v>
<v Speaker 12>what you're seeing is a game that you've</v>

1951
01:33:05.231 --> 01:33:07.720
<v Speaker 12>been playing so long you've forgotten </v>
<v Speaker 12>you've.</v>

1952
01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:12.960
<v Speaker 12>You're playing that game.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You learned out a bit pot by shit at a </v>

1953
01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:13.660
<v Speaker 12>cash register.</v>
<v Speaker 12>There was a time when you'd never bought</v>

1954
01:33:13.661 --> 01:33:18.661
<v Speaker 12>something at the cash register when you </v>
<v Speaker 12>were a kid and then your parents taught </v>

1955
01:33:18.661 --> 01:33:18.661
<v Speaker 12>you how to do it.</v>

1956
01:33:18.661 --> 01:33:20.650
<v Speaker 12>You learned how to exchange money for </v>
<v Speaker 12>goods and that crystallized,</v>

1957
01:33:20.651 --> 01:33:23.830
<v Speaker 12>do this ritual that you don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 12>as a ritual.</v>

1958
01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:28.831
<v Speaker 12>It's just this automatic thing,</v>
<v Speaker 12>so this fucking game of Western society.</v>

1959
01:33:29.410 --> 01:33:34.410
<v Speaker 12>It invites people to become automatons </v>
<v Speaker 12>to get through the day when you're like,</v>

1960
01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:39.720
<v Speaker 12>I used to wash dishes at applebee's and </v>
<v Speaker 12>I can remember like the way that you </v>

1961
01:33:40.001 --> 01:33:45.001
<v Speaker 12>would get through the day of washing </v>
<v Speaker 12>dishes is you just go into this </v>

1962
01:33:45.001 --> 01:33:45.130
<v Speaker 12>automatic trans.</v>
<v Speaker 12>She's a trans,</v>

1963
01:33:45.131 --> 01:33:46.890
<v Speaker 12>spray the dish,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but in thing wash,</v>

1964
01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:47.800
<v Speaker 12>scrub up,</v>
<v Speaker 12>put it in anything.</v>

1965
01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:50.560
<v Speaker 12>It's just an automatic trance.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You're there,</v>

1966
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:53.770
<v Speaker 12>but you're not really there.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You're just in a trance and you do it as</v>

1967
01:33:53.771 --> 01:33:57.220
<v Speaker 12>an escape from the monotony and dullness</v>
<v Speaker 12>of the job.</v>

1968
01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be one person is cleaning </v>

1969
01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:02.860
<v Speaker 1>their own plate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it should be,</v>

1970
01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:03.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be.</v>

1971
01:34:03.941 --> 01:34:07.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a giant stack of plates in </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's job.</v>

1972
01:34:07.091 --> 01:34:09.820
<v Speaker 1>It is to clean those things because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when things start to suck.</v>

1973
01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:15.060
<v Speaker 1>That's when jobs start to suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing all this shit for </v>

1974
01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:18.451
<v Speaker 1>money that no one wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference between that </v>

1975
01:34:18.451 --> 01:34:22.111
<v Speaker 1>kind of a job and the kind of a job </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you actually have a career and do </v>

1976
01:34:22.111 --> 01:34:24.100
<v Speaker 1>things you enjoy like you and you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid to be a professional comedian.</v>

1977
01:34:24.101 --> 01:34:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1978
01:34:25.130 --> 01:34:25.960
<v Speaker 1>that's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1979
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:31.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't even be classified as a </v>

1980
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:31.000
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1981
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.450
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And call it a career if you want to get </v>

1982
01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:34.450
<v Speaker 1>pretentious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1983
01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:34.450
<v Speaker 1>it's your thing.</v>

1984
01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:35.980
<v Speaker 12>The career thing is a horrible word,</v>
<v Speaker 12>man.</v>

1985
01:34:36.010 --> 01:34:38.470
<v Speaker 12>It's a weird word because it makes you </v>
<v Speaker 12>feel like,</v>

1986
01:34:38.471 --> 01:34:42.040
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm fucking serious grindstone.</v>

1987
01:34:42.190 --> 01:34:45.550
<v Speaker 12>But it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's comes the derivation of the word is</v>

1988
01:34:45.551 --> 01:34:49.000
<v Speaker 12>a track.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Horses ran on really circle.</v>

1989
01:34:49.001 --> 01:34:51.100
<v Speaker 12>You'd never get anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You just run into fucking circle.</v>

1990
01:34:52.210 --> 01:34:55.340
<v Speaker 12>That's what a career is.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm working on my career.</v>

1991
01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:57.070
<v Speaker 12>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the,</v>

1992
01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:58.490
<v Speaker 12>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>yeah.</v>

1993
01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:01.610
<v Speaker 12>I think that I feel very lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I feel incredibly lucky.</v>

1994
01:35:01.611 --> 01:35:03.080
<v Speaker 12>And also I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

1995
01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:05.720
<v Speaker 12>always on the precipice of absolute </v>
<v Speaker 12>disaster.</v>

1996
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:10.721
<v Speaker 12>There's something really quite a,</v>
<v Speaker 12>a peaceful about having a regular </v>

1997
01:35:10.791 --> 01:35:11.540
<v Speaker 12>paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Man,</v>

1998
01:35:11.541 --> 01:35:13.040
<v Speaker 12>there's something really nice about </v>
<v Speaker 12>that.</v>

1999
01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:18.041
<v Speaker 12>That's fucking cool to now.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Every two weeks you're getting a </v>

2000
01:35:18.041 --> 01:35:18.041
<v Speaker 12>paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's bad ass,</v>

2001
01:35:18.041 --> 01:35:20.510
<v Speaker 12>so that life of working a job and having</v>
<v Speaker 12>a regular job,</v>

2002
01:35:20.511 --> 01:35:22.430
<v Speaker 12>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 12>There's sweetness to it,</v>

2003
01:35:22.431 --> 01:35:27.431
<v Speaker 12>man,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and it facilitates having babies and it </v>

2004
01:35:27.431 --> 01:35:29.771
<v Speaker 12>facilitates a lot of aspects of life </v>
<v Speaker 12>that I think are quite pleasurable on a </v>

2005
01:35:31.551 --> 01:35:34.220
<v Speaker 12>really high level,</v>
<v Speaker 12>so I totally get it.</v>

2006
01:35:34.221 --> 01:35:35.630
<v Speaker 12>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2007
01:35:35.631 --> 01:35:40.631
<v Speaker 12>is there a way that this process that </v>
<v Speaker 12>we're all engaged in this gigantic game </v>

2008
01:35:42.411 --> 01:35:47.411
<v Speaker 12>that we're all in this crazy dance of </v>
<v Speaker 12>Western civilization that we're all </v>

2009
01:35:47.411 --> 01:35:51.821
<v Speaker 12>engaged in.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Is there a way that we can take it up a </v>

2010
01:35:51.821 --> 01:35:54.101
<v Speaker 12>level?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Is there a way we can make it a little </v>

2011
01:35:54.101 --> 01:35:54.830
<v Speaker 12>more aware of itself?</v>
<v Speaker 12>A little more cognizant of itself,</v>

2012
01:35:54.831 --> 01:35:58.120
<v Speaker 12>a little less embedded in superstition,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and</v>

2013
01:35:58.370 --> 01:36:03.370
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got to go to what I said before is </v>

2014
01:36:03.370 --> 01:36:06.020
<v Speaker 6>that I think that things are evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just are not happy with the pace.</v>

2015
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:11.350
<v Speaker 6>I think that we live in such a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 6>frame as tiny window of time and the </v>

2016
01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:18.851
<v Speaker 6>amount of progress that we're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 6>just from a thousand years to now is </v>

2017
01:36:19.011 --> 01:36:23.180
<v Speaker 6>monumental 2000 years to now and human </v>
<v Speaker 6>behavior,</v>

2018
01:36:23.190 --> 01:36:26.960
<v Speaker 6>knowledge and access to information off </v>
<v Speaker 6>the charts,</v>

2019
01:36:27.050 --> 01:36:31.790
<v Speaker 6>how much it's progress and we're just </v>
<v Speaker 6>caught in the middle of it and it's key.</v>

2020
01:36:31.791 --> 01:36:36.791
<v Speaker 6>It's not going to stop with with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Internet and with the the access to </v>

2021
01:36:36.801 --> 01:36:39.650
<v Speaker 6>information that's available now and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>ability to communicate now.</v>

2022
01:36:39.651 --> 01:36:43.580
<v Speaker 6>Truth is getting through more often than</v>
<v Speaker 6>not.</v>

2023
01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:48.940
<v Speaker 6>Truth is piling on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of bullshit out there </v>

2024
01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:51.731
<v Speaker 6>still,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's way easier to cut the bullshit </v>

2025
01:36:51.731 --> 01:36:52.790
<v Speaker 6>off with the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's evolving.</v>

2026
01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:56.480
<v Speaker 6>It's just not evolving up to your speed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the what you would like to see,</v>

2027
01:36:56.750 --> 01:37:01.750
<v Speaker 6>but just look at the way people think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>act and behave now as composed as </v>

2028
01:37:01.881 --> 01:37:06.881
<v Speaker 6>compared to the way they did turn truck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no question and that's not even </v>

2029
01:37:06.881 --> 01:37:08.960
<v Speaker 6>a blink of an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not even a blink of an eye.</v>

2030
01:37:09.230 --> 01:37:12.170
<v Speaker 6>It's unquestionably moving in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 6>direction and yeah,</v>

2031
01:37:12.171 --> 01:37:17.030
<v Speaker 6>it's quagmired in greed and built on a </v>
<v Speaker 6>foundation of unfixable bullshit,</v>

2032
01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:22.240
<v Speaker 6>but it still spiraling towards the </v>
<v Speaker 6>technological singularity question about</v>

2033
01:37:24.651 --> 01:37:24.770
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2034
01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:29.780
<v Speaker 12>Some of the advancements that you're </v>
<v Speaker 12>talking about are some of the things </v>

2035
01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:29.780
<v Speaker 12>that you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>wow,</v>

2036
01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:32.811
<v Speaker 12>things have really advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's because groups of people made </v>

2037
01:37:32.811 --> 01:37:35.900
<v Speaker 12>active efforts to push against the and </v>
<v Speaker 12>a,</v>

2038
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:37.290
<v Speaker 12>the anti evolutionary for</v>

2039
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:42.390
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's their role in this </v>

2040
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.390
<v Speaker 6>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's their role in this,</v>

2041
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.390
<v Speaker 6>this process,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

2042
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.610
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2043
01:37:42.611 --> 01:37:43.720
<v Speaker 6>their,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their role is to,</v>

2044
01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:45.870
<v Speaker 6>to push things in that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2045
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:50.910
<v Speaker 6>I mean I think it's all an ingredient in</v>
<v Speaker 6>a gigantic metaphysical sort of a soup </v>

2046
01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:57.420
<v Speaker 6>and it's all piled in together there and</v>
<v Speaker 6>know when everyone's doing their little </v>

2047
01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:59.820
<v Speaker 6>part,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's changing slow for our,</v>

2048
01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:02.190
<v Speaker 6>our ideas and our tastes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But in,</v>

<v Speaker 6>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in compared to history that the rapid </v>

2050
01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.120
<v Speaker 6>pace of evolution and the evolution of </v>
<v Speaker 6>progress,</v>

2051
01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:14.480
<v Speaker 6>the complexification of our society,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's blowing up in our face.</v>

<v Speaker 6>That's why when you have all these Wacko</v>

<v Speaker 6>decade old invention.</v>

2082
01:40:01.650 --> 01:40:06.650
<v Speaker 6>Two decades is a fucking a fraction of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the time it takes for your eyes to </v>

2087
01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:19.740
<v Speaker 12>people into the streets and overthrows </v>
<v Speaker 12>governments like in Egypt.</v>

01:40:41.341 --> 01:40:43.020
<v Speaker 6>You're not allowed to shut off the </v>
<v Speaker 6>phones.</v>

2098
01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:45.420
<v Speaker 6>What if someone's fucking mother was </v>
<v Speaker 6>dying?</v>

<v Speaker 6>couldn't call fucking ambulance because </v>

2100
01:40:50.690 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 6>you can't use your phone because you </v>
<v Speaker 6>assholes are afraid of criticism because</v>

2101
01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:59.060
<v Speaker 6>you assholes are afraid of people </v>
<v Speaker 6>yelling and screaming and telling you </v>

2102
01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:00.010
<v Speaker 6>that you fucked up so you cut off the </v>
<v Speaker 6>phone lines.</v>

2103
01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:03.730
<v Speaker 6>You should go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You should go to jail.</v>

2104
01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:08.820
<v Speaker 6>If you shut off the phones in America in</v>
<v Speaker 6>2011 to avoid a protest,</v>

2105
01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:14.070
<v Speaker 6>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's ridiculous for you to say that </v>

2106
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:18.541
<v Speaker 6>you want to maintain order so badly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you will cut off communication between </v>

2107
01:41:19.570 --> 01:41:24.570
<v Speaker 6>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tax payers with good people that have </v>

2108
01:41:24.570 --> 01:41:26.710
<v Speaker 6>done no wrong without a single spot on </v>
<v Speaker 6>their record.</v>

2109
01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:30.100
<v Speaker 6>You deny them use of the phone to </v>
<v Speaker 6>blanketly.</v>

2110
01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:31.390
<v Speaker 6>Fuck you.</v>

2111
01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:33.280

<v Speaker 12>What?</v>

2112
01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:36.040
<v Speaker 12>Humans have American,</v>
<v Speaker 12>have a right to free speech,</v>

2113
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:39.280
<v Speaker 12>but they also have a right to get to </v>
<v Speaker 12>where they want to go on time.</v>

2114
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:40.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2115
01:41:40.301 --> 01:41:41.740
<v Speaker 6>how about if someone's dying suit?</v>

2116
01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:43.180
<v Speaker 12>No,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I think it's the worst.</v>

2117
01:41:43.181 --> 01:41:44.680
<v Speaker 12>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's fucking.</v>

2118
01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:47.260
<v Speaker 12>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 12>to me it's scary.</v>

2119
01:41:47.261 --> 01:41:48.580
<v Speaker 12>It's terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 12>terrifying,</v>

2120
01:41:48.610 --> 01:41:50.290
<v Speaker 12>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's scary because it's like,</v>

2121
01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:52.400
<v Speaker 6>which you're supposed to do is you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to have to hire more cops,</v>

2122
01:41:52.401 --> 01:41:53.750
<v Speaker 6>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you gonna have to,</v>

2123
01:41:53.751 --> 01:41:55.580
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>keep peace in a,</v>

2124
01:41:55.581 --> 01:41:57.860
<v Speaker 6>in a very respectful manner.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

2125
01:41:57.861 --> 01:41:58.490
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>

2126
01:41:58.491 --> 01:42:02.570
<v Speaker 6>there's a whole fucking bad history </v>
<v Speaker 6>which we cops and people up there,</v>

2127
01:42:02.571 --> 01:42:03.620
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

2128
01:42:03.621 --> 01:42:06.290
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying that the cops are 100 </v>
<v Speaker 6>percent in the wrong,</v>

2129
01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:08.960
<v Speaker 6>but there's been some shit they did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

2130
01:42:08.961 --> 01:42:13.961
<v Speaker 6>Like the cop that shot the guy because </v>
<v Speaker 6>he thought it was tasering him instead </v>

2131
01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:15.410
<v Speaker 6>he shot them and it's all on video.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean look what the fuck,</v>

2132
01:42:15.411 --> 01:42:20.411
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's been a lot of nonsense like </v>

2133
01:42:20.411 --> 01:42:22.331
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And just when you shut the fucking </v>

2134
01:42:22.331 --> 01:42:22.331
<v Speaker 6>phones off and keep people from </v>
<v Speaker 6>protesting,</v>

2135
01:42:22.331 --> 01:42:22.920
<v Speaker 6>people just got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

2136
01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:24.650
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

2137
01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.510
<v Speaker 6>And who the fuck are you?</v>

2138
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:31.570
<v Speaker 12>That's why it's so incredible what </v>
<v Speaker 12>anonymous did by creating a protest that</v>

2139
01:42:32.331 --> 01:42:37.040
<v Speaker 12>got broadcast nationally to every </v>
<v Speaker 12>internationally people saw that shit.</v>

2140
01:42:37.170 --> 01:42:39.230
<v Speaker 12>And,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and if they hadn't have done that,</v>

2141
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:43.130
<v Speaker 12>if they'd been content with just having </v>
<v Speaker 12>conversations about it,</v>

2142
01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:46.140
<v Speaker 12>it wouldn't have escalated to the level </v>
<v Speaker 12>that it is escalated to.</v>

2143
01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:51.180
<v Speaker 12>And a lot of those guys got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Like they put freedom of information in </v>

2144
01:42:51.981 --> 01:42:55.460
<v Speaker 12>front of their own freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That is heroic.</v>

2145
01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:58.010
<v Speaker 12>That's bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

2146
01:42:58.011 --> 01:43:03.011
<v Speaker 12>I'm saying at some point you people have</v>
<v Speaker 12>got to like stand up because if you </v>

2147
01:43:03.531 --> 01:43:05.600
<v Speaker 12>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If no one had stood up,</v>

2148
01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:07.340
<v Speaker 12>no one had done that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If there'd been no protests,</v>

2149
01:43:07.341 --> 01:43:12.341
<v Speaker 12>if Bart didn't know that every time they</v>
<v Speaker 12>tried to shut the fucking phone lines </v>

2150
01:43:12.341 --> 01:43:12.530
<v Speaker 12>down,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they're gonna get swarmed.</v>

2151
01:43:12.810 --> 01:43:14.360
<v Speaker 12>Was the,</v>
<v Speaker 12>what was the protest over,</v>

2152
01:43:14.361 --> 01:43:16.080
<v Speaker 12>do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 12>I don't know that it was.</v>

2153
01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:21.370
<v Speaker 12>They were putting the,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the anonymous protest was after another </v>

2154
01:43:21.370 --> 01:43:24.881
<v Speaker 12>protest that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And I do not know why the first protest </v>

2155
01:43:24.881 --> 01:43:24.881
<v Speaker 12>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I just know they shut the fuck up.</v>

2156
01:43:24.881 --> 01:43:26.940
<v Speaker 6>Did it have to do with that guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 6>murdered?</v>

2157
01:43:26.941 --> 01:43:29.410
<v Speaker 6>I think that the guys getting out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>jail a column,</v>

2158
01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:34.540
<v Speaker 6>maybe I might be completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I thought the whole thing </v>

2159
01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:39.210
<v Speaker 6>was about the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just so satisfying the world.</v>

2160
01:43:39.230 --> 01:43:44.230
<v Speaker 6>And when you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone lost their life because of </v>

2161
01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:46.320
<v Speaker 6>something so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the guy who did it,</v>

2162
01:43:46.570 --> 01:43:51.000
<v Speaker 6>the one fucking stupid mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his life is fucked forever too.</v>

2163
01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:53.000
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's got to deal with that for the rest.</v>

2164
01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.150
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can you imagine what it is?</v>

2165
01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:57.800
<v Speaker 6>How stupid you must feel to make that </v>
<v Speaker 6>mistake.</v>

2166
01:43:58.670 --> 01:44:00.500
<v Speaker 6>You're so panicked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You thought you had your Taser,</v>

2167
01:44:00.501 --> 01:44:02.030
<v Speaker 6>but you had your gun and you shot the </v>
<v Speaker 6>guy.</v>

2168
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:04.080
<v Speaker 12>That weight of that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Think of the weight of that.</v>

2169
01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:05.730
<v Speaker 12>I always think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the weight,</v>

2170
01:44:05.850 --> 01:44:09.690
<v Speaker 12>because it's like when you fuck over a </v>
<v Speaker 12>friend or if you do something stupid,</v>

2171
01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:11.910
<v Speaker 12>eventually you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm sorry.</v>

2172
01:44:11.911 --> 01:44:14.790
<v Speaker 12>That was stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You can apologize and you can get it off</v>

2173
01:44:14.791 --> 01:44:17.400
<v Speaker 12>your chest when you kill somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You can't do it.</v>

2174
01:44:17.401 --> 01:44:19.650
<v Speaker 12>You can apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Someone back to live.</v>

2175
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:24.870
<v Speaker 12>There's nothing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You can say you're sorry to their </v>

2176
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.870
<v Speaker 12>family,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but that's not going to bring the person</v>

2177
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:27.960
<v Speaker 12>back.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's so terrible.</v>

2178
01:44:29.230 --> 01:44:30.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty crazy idea.</v>

2179
01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:33.670
<v Speaker 6>We're so connected to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

2180
01:44:33.671 --> 01:44:36.730
<v Speaker 6>You lose someone in your life so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so painful.</v>

2181
01:44:37.870 --> 01:44:40.690
<v Speaker 6>The idea that other people can take </v>
<v Speaker 6>people away from people.</v>

2182
01:44:40.990 --> 01:44:45.990
<v Speaker 6>That's like the ultimate attack on them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So strange because we all know are </v>

2183
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:48.700
<v Speaker 6>temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We all know we're going to die.</v>

2184
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:51.580
<v Speaker 6>We just don't want to right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not ready yet.</v>

2185
01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:55.600
<v Speaker 6>Now I'm moving too much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm enjoying this.</v>

2186
01:44:55.601 --> 01:44:57.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just getting this thing mastered.</v>

2187
01:44:58.190 --> 01:45:00.250
<v Speaker 6>I'm just getting it figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know how to enjoy it.</v>

2188
01:45:00.251 --> 01:45:02.170
<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I figured it out.</v>

2189
01:45:02.171 --> 01:45:03.940
<v Speaker 6>I figured out how to enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't let me die yet.</v>

2190
01:45:03.970 --> 01:45:05.050
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not yet.</v>

2191
01:45:05.250 --> 01:45:06.540
<v Speaker 12>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Mr Rogen.</v>

2192
01:45:06.541 --> 01:45:08.520
<v Speaker 12>We've got to move you onto the next </v>
<v Speaker 12>experiment.</v>

2193
01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.380
<v Speaker 12>You can't stay here.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's,</v>

2194
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:11.400
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that's like.</v>

2195
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:14.220
<v Speaker 12>Maybe that's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's like when they give like the planet</v>

2196
01:45:14.221 --> 01:45:16.440
<v Speaker 12>of the Apes,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know when they have that,</v>

2197
01:45:16.441 --> 01:45:19.940
<v Speaker 12>the spoiler alert,</v>
<v Speaker 12>your fingers in your ears don't do it.</v>

2198
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:25.310
<v Speaker 12>It's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I can talk about the tests that they </v>

2199
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.310
<v Speaker 12>did.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Right.</v>

2200
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.310
<v Speaker 12>Can I talk about it?</v>

2201
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.710
<v Speaker 6>Talk about the plot is probably not </v>
<v Speaker 6>smart.</v>

2202
01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:26.820
<v Speaker 6>That's rude.</v>

2203
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:28.510
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So forget planet of the apes.</v>

2204
01:45:29.110 --> 01:45:34.110
<v Speaker 12>But sometimes the kids you give them </v>
<v Speaker 12>like intelligence tests where they have </v>

2205
01:45:34.110 --> 01:45:35.130
<v Speaker 12>to like do like certain things you know </v>
<v Speaker 12>and,</v>

2206
01:45:35.131 --> 01:45:38.020
<v Speaker 12>and imagine if that's what this whole </v>
<v Speaker 12>thing is,</v>

2207
01:45:38.350 --> 01:45:43.000
<v Speaker 12>some kind of alien intelligence tests </v>
<v Speaker 12>where after you solve the puzzle,</v>

2208
01:45:43.330 --> 01:45:47.370
<v Speaker 12>you get moved along and the way it looks</v>
<v Speaker 12>when you get moved along is you,</v>

2209
01:45:47.371 --> 01:45:49.930
<v Speaker 12>you're gone day taking a bullet in the </v>
<v Speaker 12>chest or your,</v>

2210
01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:50.710
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>your,</v>

2211
01:45:50.711 --> 01:45:55.711
<v Speaker 12>some,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you're someone who just like maybe you </v>

2212
01:45:55.711 --> 01:45:57.661
<v Speaker 12>just have a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Like sometimes I've thought I wonder if </v>

2213
01:45:57.661 --> 01:46:01.021
<v Speaker 12>there's like a thought you can have or a</v>
<v Speaker 12>place you can get to where you just get </v>

2214
01:46:01.361 --> 01:46:04.300
<v Speaker 12>it to the point where you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 12>stick around here.</v>

2215
01:46:04.450 --> 01:46:09.450
<v Speaker 12>Like they say that some yogis through </v>
<v Speaker 12>meditation have just like meditated and </v>

2216
01:46:10.001 --> 01:46:12.520
<v Speaker 12>meditated and they can willfully just </v>
<v Speaker 12>leave their body.</v>

2217
01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:17.760
<v Speaker 12>They call it dropping your body.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They don't call it death dropping your </v>

2218
01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:17.760
<v Speaker 12>body.</v>

2219
01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:22.540
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't put that past the realm of </v>

2220
01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:24.911
<v Speaker 6>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you considered the fact that your </v>

2221
01:46:24.911 --> 01:46:26.981
<v Speaker 6>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we know produces a bunch of different </v>

2222
01:46:26.981 --> 01:46:29.201
<v Speaker 6>psychedelic chemicals?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who's to say that it's not some way to </v>

2223
01:46:29.201 --> 01:46:30.110
<v Speaker 6>trigger those are not the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some way to stimulate those,</v>

2224
01:46:30.111 --> 01:46:35.111
<v Speaker 6>but putting yourself into a frequency </v>
<v Speaker 6>through meditation where you force the </v>

2225
01:46:35.111 --> 01:46:39.011
<v Speaker 6>brain to accept a certain vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a certain just a certain frequency,</v>

2226
01:46:39.201 --> 01:46:44.201
<v Speaker 6>and in doing so you can actually force </v>
<v Speaker 6>your brain into producing certain </v>

2227
01:46:44.201 --> 01:46:46.790
<v Speaker 6>chemicals and then you'd fucking blast </v>
<v Speaker 6>off in the brain.</v>

2228
01:46:46.791 --> 01:46:49.470
<v Speaker 6>Makes psychedelics fact,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fact.</v>

2229
01:46:49.530 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 6>The human</v>

2230
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:53.160
<v Speaker 5>body makes psychedelics fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know it does.</v>

2231
01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:54.870
<v Speaker 5>It makes a bunch of things that affect </v>
<v Speaker 5>your behavior.</v>

2232
01:46:54.871 --> 01:46:56.560
<v Speaker 5>It makes adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 5>makes dopamine,</v>

2233
01:46:56.710 --> 01:47:01.710
<v Speaker 5>Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so all these different things that </v>

2234
01:47:01.710 --> 01:47:04.050
<v Speaker 5>oxytocin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's all sorts of things that </v>

2235
01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:04.050
<v Speaker 5>stimulate you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>affect you,</v>

2236
01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:05.790
<v Speaker 5>and we know it makes all the crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>chemicals that exist,</v>

2237
01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:10.800
<v Speaker 5>that create the dream state kind of been</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking this Fuckin Alpha brain shit and </v>

2238
01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.030
<v Speaker 5>having the nuttiest dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man and I had a werewolf,</v>

2239
01:47:12.570 --> 01:47:17.570
<v Speaker 5>gorilla sex dream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the strangest fucking dream of </v>

2240
01:47:17.570 --> 01:47:22.041
<v Speaker 5>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so bizarre because it was so </v>

2241
01:47:22.041 --> 01:47:24.411
<v Speaker 5>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but so real and so easy to recall this,</v>

2242
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:26.970
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these Alpha brain things.</v>

2243
01:47:26.971 --> 01:47:29.120
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that a bunch of people</v>

2244

<v Speaker 5>tweeted me about this too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that when you,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like a bulging and breaking piece of </v>

<v Speaker 5>to run away and hide.</v>

<v Speaker 5>backs and they were right behind this </v>

2267
01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:37.110
<v Speaker 5>thin piece of wallboard and I had to </v>
<v Speaker 5>inject them with this,</v>

2268
01:48:37.230 --> 01:48:38.010
<v Speaker 5>the sedative.</v>

2269
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:43.070
<v Speaker 5>I had to get them with it and I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>quite get to them and I pulled it out </v>

2270
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:46.970
<v Speaker 5>and he came through the wall and I ran </v>
<v Speaker 5>as I ran out and then he runs into the </v>

2271
01:48:46.970 --> 01:48:47.130
<v Speaker 5>little girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>

2272
01:48:47.250 --> 01:48:51.300
<v Speaker 5>it went from 69 became completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>

2273
01:48:51.450 --> 01:48:56.450
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the way they looked became </v>

2274
01:48:56.450 --> 01:48:59.301
<v Speaker 5>completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They went from being like a terrifying </v>

2275
01:48:59.301 --> 01:49:02.841
<v Speaker 5>looking silver back gorilla to some sort</v>
<v Speaker 5>of curious George halfway into,</v>

2276
01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:07.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>goofy looking like smiling gorilla,</v>

2277
01:49:07.681 --> 01:49:10.150
<v Speaker 5>getting his dick sucked by a Werewolf,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2278
01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:14.070
<v Speaker 5>It became completely cartoonish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so strange.</v>

2279
01:49:14.071 --> 01:49:19.071
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't even wrap my head around how </v>

2280
01:49:19.071 --> 01:49:21.771
<v Speaker 5>anybody would try to describe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how are you going to tell me what's </v>

2281
01:49:21.771 --> 01:49:22.620
<v Speaker 5>going on in my head?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how are you going to,</v>

2282
01:49:22.630 --> 01:49:25.830
<v Speaker 5>to when it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything became a big gay joke.</v>

2283
01:49:26.030 --> 01:49:31.030
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're running from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're running from a terrifying </v>

2284
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:34.880
<v Speaker 5>superior physical specimen in a giant </v>
<v Speaker 5>silver back gorilla that you're trying </v>

2285
01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:39.261
<v Speaker 5>to sedate through a wall with a needle </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you run away and then a </v>

2286
01:49:39.261 --> 01:49:43.640
<v Speaker 5>werewolf turns a corner and smashes into</v>
<v Speaker 5>the grill and then they start blowing </v>

2287
01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:44.210
<v Speaker 5>each other the fuck man.</v>

2288
01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:46.800
<v Speaker 5>Better get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you do believe in those dream books</v>

2289
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:49.860
<v Speaker 4>that's not in there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe it.</v>

2290
01:49:50.910 --> 01:49:53.400
<v Speaker 4>That's in a dream book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll and I'll tell you what,</v>

2291
01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:55.770
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking straight as they come.</v>

2292
01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:57.870
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what this is about.</v>

2293
01:49:58.190 --> 01:50:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am just a not responsible for a lot of</v>

2294
01:50:02.101 --> 01:50:04.380
<v Speaker 1>the thoughts that spin around in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

2295
01:50:04.381 --> 01:50:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't believe I am.</v>

2296
01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2297
01:50:07.501 --> 01:50:10.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not that I was thinking that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a real thing.</v>

2298
01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:13.620
<v Speaker 1>It was like my brain just created the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidest idea for them</v>

2299
01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:17.310
<v Speaker 4>movie in the middle of a horrifying </v>
<v Speaker 4>scenario scenario.</v>

2300
01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:19.870
<v Speaker 4>Like now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you join into the,</v>

2301
01:50:20.190 --> 01:50:25.190
<v Speaker 4>into the monkeys at all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you start having sex with them or </v>

2302
01:50:25.190 --> 01:50:29.460
<v Speaker 4>trying to get away?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to get away and they were </v>

2303
01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:29.460
<v Speaker 4>just blowing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh wait,</v>

2304
01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:29.460
<v Speaker 4>no escape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2305
01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:30.610
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They started blowing each other and then</v>

2306
01:50:30.611 --> 01:50:31.000
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2307
01:50:31.050 --> 01:50:33.850
<v Speaker 4>I can get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it became like cartoon.</v>

2308
01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:37.650
<v Speaker 4>Should you walk away slow like watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole time here.</v>

2309
01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:40.640
<v Speaker 4>I tiptoed so it didn't shock them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2310
01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:43.490
<v Speaker 4>I feel like if you move too fast they </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't help but chase,</v>

2311
01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:43.750
<v Speaker 4>you</v>

2312
01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.610
<v Speaker 1>roll a ball of yarn past a kitten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they run after it.</v>

2313
01:50:48.611 --> 01:50:50.770
<v Speaker 1>They can't help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just instinctual.</v>

2314
01:50:51.010 --> 01:50:52.960
<v Speaker 1>They say that's what also happens with </v>
<v Speaker 1>bikers,</v>

2315
01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:58.080
<v Speaker 1>mountain bikers and mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes mountain lions is see them </v>

2316
01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:58.080
<v Speaker 1>moving fast and they literally can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>help themselves.</v>

2317
01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:59.090
<v Speaker 1>They just chase after him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2318
01:50:59.410 --> 01:51:00.640
<v Speaker 1>So you want to make sure you don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2319
01:51:00.641 --> 01:51:02.590
<v Speaker 1>So I walked away real slow and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing each other.</v>

2320
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:03.800
<v Speaker 1>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys.</v>

2321
01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:07.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a survival tip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2322
01:51:07.241 --> 01:51:12.241
<v Speaker 1>If you ever come upon a werewolf </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing a gorilla gorilla sucking each </v>

2323
01:51:12.241 --> 01:51:13.550
<v Speaker 1>other's cocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same.</v>

2324
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that?</v>

2325
01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Good luck,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>

2328
01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:22.270
<v Speaker 1>But the weird thing is that it was so </v>

<v Speaker 1>These pills,</v>

2333
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:31.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Telling everybody to take them.</v>

<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>

2339
01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:46.890
<v Speaker 4>It is that stuff that you give to dogs.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it gets black underneath their eyes.</v>

2342
01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:54.540
<v Speaker 4>Angel Eyes is something that you put in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their food when they eat,</v>

2343
01:51:54.541 --> 01:51:59.541
<v Speaker 4>so it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes that away and people on online </v>

<v Speaker 1>like people are going to serve with </v>

2346
01:52:05.150 --> 01:52:05.150
<v Speaker 1>their dogs tiers.</v>

2347
01:52:05.150 --> 01:52:09.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you get like a white dog and it's </v>

<v Speaker 4>but what the fuck are you doing to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dog?</v>

2350
01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:13.680
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're protein.</v>

2351
01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:16.120
<v Speaker 4>It's like a too much zinc or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird like that.</v>

2352
01:52:16.130 --> 01:52:18.540
<v Speaker 4>So it's just sort of holistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

01:52:18.630 --> 01:52:20.100
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2360
01:52:36.421 --> 01:52:37.830
<v Speaker 4>I think we got to work on it a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>

2361
01:52:38.250 --> 01:52:39.050
<v Speaker 4>Working on it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is what I've decided to do.</v>

2364

<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to be totally honest with</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I feel them.</v>

2365

<v Speaker 10>That's my.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to give my pr.</v>

2366
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:49.310
<v Speaker 10>I'm not a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Obviously,</v>

2367
01:52:49.311 --> 01:52:51.740
<v Speaker 10>if you're listening to any medical </v>
<v Speaker 10>advice I'd give you.</v>

2368
01:52:51.741 --> 01:52:56.741
<v Speaker 10>You're a silly person.</v>
<v Speaker 10>There's plenty of valid sources on the </v>

2369
01:52:56.741 --> 01:52:59.381
<v Speaker 10>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but I am a person with an objective </v>

2370
01:52:59.381 --> 01:53:02.141
<v Speaker 10>experience and what I'll do is I'll take</v>
<v Speaker 10>these fucking pills and I'll tell you </v>

2371
01:53:02.141 --> 01:53:04.160
<v Speaker 10>what I feel like and what I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 10>right now is I feel like they make.</v>

2372
01:53:04.161 --> 01:53:08.330
<v Speaker 10>My mind feels clearer and clearer is a </v>
<v Speaker 10>very subjective term obviously,</v>

2373
01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.480
<v Speaker 10>but I feel like I have more energy,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but it doesn't feel like a run on sort </v>

2374
01:53:13.581 --> 01:53:16.790
<v Speaker 10>of a spiky caffeine energy.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It feels like it.</v>

2375
01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:21.770
<v Speaker 10>I hate the word crisp and cleaner,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but that's for lack of better word.</v>

2376
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:23.270
<v Speaker 10>Enough of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

01:53:25.221 --> 01:53:30.221
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I enjoy it and it gives me very </v>

2379
01:53:30.221 --> 01:53:32.291
<v Speaker 10>memorable dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Not all of them involving gorillas and </v>

2380
01:53:32.291 --> 01:53:32.291
<v Speaker 10>wearable.</v>

2381
01:53:32.291 --> 01:53:35.490
<v Speaker 10>If some of them been weird.</v>
<v Speaker 10>People dreams have some science fiction </v>

2382
01:53:35.490 --> 01:53:35.660
<v Speaker 10>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

2383
01:53:35.661 --> 01:53:37.370
<v Speaker 10>I've had some.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I've had some crazy ones.</v>

2384
01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:43.360
<v Speaker 10>I had this crazy dream about a world </v>
<v Speaker 10>with a thousand Nikola Tesla's that </v>

2385
01:53:44.211 --> 01:53:47.310
<v Speaker 10>instead of just one super genius </v>
<v Speaker 10>oddball,</v>

2386
01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:48.930
<v Speaker 10>crazy man like tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this,</v>

2387
01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:54.040
<v Speaker 10>it was like a subsect of the species and</v>
<v Speaker 10>it was like a thousand of them and they </v>

2388
01:53:54.711 --> 01:53:59.711
<v Speaker 10>just in a matter of a few years time had</v>
<v Speaker 10>these giant metal floating ships all </v>

2389
01:54:01.191 --> 01:54:06.191
<v Speaker 10>throughout cities and everything was run</v>
<v Speaker 10>through wireless electricity and this </v>

2390
01:54:06.191 --> 01:54:08.840
<v Speaker 10>was me somehow or another in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 10>fifties,</v>

2391
01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:13.960
<v Speaker 10>this 1000 teslas had moved society so </v>
<v Speaker 10>rapidly before anybody could even </v>

2392
01:54:14.631 --> 01:54:17.060
<v Speaker 10>control it because they were so far </v>
<v Speaker 10>advanced.</v>

2393
01:54:17.061 --> 01:54:20.150
<v Speaker 10>It was like a thousand of them </v>
<v Speaker 10>altogether creating all this shit.</v>

2394
01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:23.890
<v Speaker 10>And in the 19 fifties there was flying </v>
<v Speaker 10>ships and you know,</v>

2395
01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:28.960
<v Speaker 10>there was a type of electronic </v>
<v Speaker 10>connectivity that was very similar to </v>

2396
01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:29.330
<v Speaker 10>the way we're doing it now,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but different.</v>

2397
01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:34.680
<v Speaker 10>It was just everyone could talk to </v>
<v Speaker 10>people from these handsets that we're </v>

2398
01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:35.030
<v Speaker 10>all throughout the city.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Like there were,</v>

2399
01:54:35.031 --> 01:54:35.870
<v Speaker 10>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there were,</v>

2400
01:54:35.930 --> 01:54:38.030
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>everyone was congested at this one place</v>

2401
01:54:38.180 --> 01:54:41.360
<v Speaker 10>and you could move to any handset and </v>
<v Speaker 10>constantly be contacting people.</v>

2402
01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:42.890
<v Speaker 10>It's very trippy,</v>
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

2403
01:54:42.891 --> 01:54:46.430
<v Speaker 10>It was really weird because it was like </v>
<v Speaker 10>19 fifties aesthetic,</v>

2404
01:54:46.670 --> 01:54:51.670
<v Speaker 10>like the way people dress and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a man going to work with a leather </v>

2405
01:54:51.670 --> 01:54:51.670
<v Speaker 10>briefcase and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and,</v>

2406
01:54:51.670 --> 01:54:53.270
<v Speaker 10>and,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and even like the certain type of hats,</v>

2407
01:54:53.271 --> 01:54:54.530
<v Speaker 10>they would wear it with their glasses </v>
<v Speaker 10>on.</v>

2408
01:54:54.531 --> 01:54:59.531
<v Speaker 10>Father knows best for me.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Mother is flying metal ships and no </v>

2409
01:54:59.531 --> 01:55:03.670
<v Speaker 10>electricity in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Now Tesla wanted to broadcast </v>

2410
01:55:03.670 --> 01:55:04.310
<v Speaker 10>electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He wanted it to be like,</v>

2411
01:55:04.311 --> 01:55:09.311
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>radio signals and have it just fly </v>

2412
01:55:09.311 --> 01:55:09.740
<v Speaker 10>through the air.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But then anybody could just like radio,</v>

2413
01:55:09.741 --> 01:55:11.660
<v Speaker 10>just all you need is a receiver to take </v>
<v Speaker 10>it.</v>

2414
01:55:11.690 --> 01:55:13.400
<v Speaker 10>There was no fucking money in that.</v>

2415
01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:14.880
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that's right.</v>

2416
01:55:14.910 --> 01:55:19.910
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He had a lot of shit that he invented </v>

2417
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.910
<v Speaker 12>that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that,</v>

2418
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:23.480
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they took away his trunks that all his </v>

2419
01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:23.480
<v Speaker 12>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

2420
01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:25.160
<v Speaker 10>It's Kinda fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Fascinating dude.</v>

2421
01:55:25.161 --> 01:55:30.161
<v Speaker 10>But in this crazy dream,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the dream like almost had a title of a </v>

2422
01:55:30.161 --> 01:55:31.700
<v Speaker 10>thousand Teslas has it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>There was all these little crazy looking</v>

2423
01:55:31.701 --> 01:55:34.610
<v Speaker 10>dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 10>eccentric looking super geniuses running</v>

2424
01:55:34.611 --> 01:55:39.611
<v Speaker 10>around all together.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Like if I was creating all this nutty </v>

2425
01:55:39.611 --> 01:55:40.040
<v Speaker 10>shit and no one could keep up with what </v>
<v Speaker 10>the effects,</v>

2426
01:55:40.041 --> 01:55:43.350
<v Speaker 10>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it was nothing like the slower pace that</v>

2427
01:55:43.351 --> 01:55:44.700
<v Speaker 10>we've had to endure over,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2428
01:55:44.710 --> 01:55:49.710
<v Speaker 10>and really,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and you think about an extra half of a </v>

2429
01:55:49.710 --> 01:55:52.371
<v Speaker 10>century and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's really not that much time ever to </v>

2430
01:55:52.371 --> 01:55:52.371
<v Speaker 10>have all this,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

2431
01:55:52.371 --> 01:55:56.630
<v Speaker 10>new technology together.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But if at all burst together in the 19 </v>

2432
01:55:56.630 --> 01:55:56.630
<v Speaker 10>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 10>if we had every,</v>

2433
01:55:56.630 --> 01:55:59.910
<v Speaker 10>all the access to,</v>
<v Speaker 10>to all the different disciplines that we</v>

2434
01:55:59.911 --> 01:56:01.650
<v Speaker 10>have today,</v>
<v Speaker 10>if we have them in the 19 fifties,</v>

2435
01:56:01.651 --> 01:56:06.651
<v Speaker 10>if there was really like that kind of an</v>
<v Speaker 10>evolutionary growth like immediately </v>

2436
01:56:06.651 --> 01:56:06.660
<v Speaker 10>from 1900 dash,</v>
<v Speaker 10>1950,</v>

2437
01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:09.180
<v Speaker 10>that'd be incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That'd be so fascinating.</v>

2438
01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:14.300
<v Speaker 10>If in a lifetime we go from 1900 to us </v>
<v Speaker 10>right now or advance or even more </v>

2439
01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:15.630
<v Speaker 10>advanced in 50 years.</v>

2440
01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:21.200
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Like if the singularity happens in the </v>

2441
01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:21.200
<v Speaker 12>fifties.</v>

2442
01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:23.520
<v Speaker 10>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Do you believe in the multiverse stuff?</v>

2443
01:56:24.450 --> 01:56:27.510
<v Speaker 10>I'm stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm too stupid to argue about it.</v>

2444
01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:28.790
<v Speaker 10>I read,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

2445
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:33.950
<v Speaker 10>some new thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I forget what it was that made them </v>

2446
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:35.800
<v Speaker 10>believe that some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>some sort of sound,</v>

2447
01:56:35.801 --> 01:56:37.350
<v Speaker 10>something vibration.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What was the,</v>

2448
01:56:37.351 --> 01:56:42.351
<v Speaker 10>the latest.</v>
<v Speaker 10>There's some latest evidence of a </v>

2449
01:56:42.351 --> 01:56:42.351
<v Speaker 10>multiverse.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What do you know,</v>

2450
01:56:42.351 --> 01:56:43.650
<v Speaker 10>what it is now on the Internet?</v>

2451
01:56:44.450 --> 01:56:46.230
<v Speaker 12>It's all still.</v>
<v Speaker 12>What if though I.</v>

2452
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:47.840
<v Speaker 12>that's the only bad thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 12>whole thing.</v>

2453
01:56:47.841 --> 01:56:50.810
<v Speaker 12>We're never going to probably find out </v>
<v Speaker 12>in our lifetime.</v>

2454
01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:53.010
<v Speaker 12>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>man.</v>

2455
01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:58.240
<v Speaker 12>If you look back,</v>
<v Speaker 12>if you want to see how much we've </v>

2456
01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.341
<v Speaker 12>advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 12>just go back like we were talking about </v>

2457
01:57:00.341 --> 01:57:00.950
<v Speaker 12>earlier and check out the medical idea.</v>
<v Speaker 12>People have this scientific ideas.</v>

2458
01:57:00.951 --> 01:57:02.360
<v Speaker 12>People at here it is right here.</v>

2459
01:57:02.410 --> 01:57:05.040
<v Speaker 10>First observational test of the </v>
<v Speaker 10>multiverse.</v>

2460
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:10.270
<v Speaker 10>The theory that our universe is </v>
<v Speaker 10>contained inside a bubble and that </v>

2461
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:13.491
<v Speaker 10>bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that multiple alternate universes exist </v>

2462
01:57:13.491 --> 01:57:18.111
<v Speaker 10>inside their own bubbles making up the </v>
<v Speaker 10>multiverse is for the first time being </v>

2463
01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:23.480
<v Speaker 10>tested by physicists to research papers </v>
<v Speaker 10>published in physical review letters and</v>

2464
01:57:25.291 --> 01:57:30.291
<v Speaker 10>physical review.</v>
<v Speaker 10>D are the first detail how to search for</v>

2465
01:57:30.451 --> 01:57:35.451
<v Speaker 10>signatures of other universes.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Physicists are now searching for </v>

2466
01:57:35.451 --> 01:57:36.210
<v Speaker 10>disliked patterns in the cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 10>microwave.</v>

2467
01:57:36.211 --> 01:57:38.280
<v Speaker 10>Background,</v>
<v Speaker 10>relic,</v>

2468
01:57:38.281 --> 01:57:40.560
<v Speaker 10>heat radiation leftover from the Big </v>
<v Speaker 10>Bang,</v>

2469
01:57:40.561 --> 01:57:45.561
<v Speaker 10>which could provide telltale evidence of</v>
<v Speaker 10>collisions between other universes in </v>

2470
01:57:45.561 --> 01:57:48.210
<v Speaker 10>our own whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Collisions,</v>

2471
01:57:48.930 --> 01:57:53.930
<v Speaker 10>evidence of collisions of universes.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What the fuck dude collisions.</v>

2472
01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:59.190
<v Speaker 10>That's the alternative concept to the </v>
<v Speaker 10>Big Bang as well.</v>

2473
01:57:59.370 --> 01:58:04.370
<v Speaker 10>The idea that our universe,</v>
<v Speaker 10>whether it's in a bubble like the </v>

2474
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:05.160
<v Speaker 10>multiverse or the people that proposed </v>
<v Speaker 10>membranes,</v>

2475
01:58:05.161 --> 01:58:10.161
<v Speaker 10>they proposed that the brains collide at</v>
<v Speaker 10>certain points and that creates like a </v>

2476
01:58:10.161 --> 01:58:12.030
<v Speaker 10>recycling of the of the world.</v>

2477
01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:17.120
<v Speaker 10>We just can't wrap our head around </v>
<v Speaker 10>something that's that far or that long,</v>

2478
01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:19.250
<v Speaker 10>that much longer,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

2479
01:58:19.251 --> 01:58:24.251
<v Speaker 10>a period of existence than our own life.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The idea of this cycle that's billions </v>

2480
01:58:25.050 --> 01:58:30.050
<v Speaker 10>and billions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We are so important in our own lives </v>

2481
01:58:30.050 --> 01:58:32.670
<v Speaker 10>that the idea that that's how small </v>
<v Speaker 10>apart we play for real.</v>

2482
01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:37.880
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to exist for 80 years inside </v>
<v Speaker 10>some weird biological body and some </v>

2483
01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:41.700
<v Speaker 10>crazy process that happens every 16,</v>
<v Speaker 10>$17,</v>

2484
01:58:41.701 --> 01:58:44.560
<v Speaker 10>billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 10>These things collide with each other and</v>

2485
01:58:44.561 --> 01:58:48.430
<v Speaker 10>everything starts completely from new.</v>
<v Speaker 10>No planets,</v>

2486
01:58:48.431 --> 01:58:49.450
<v Speaker 10>man,</v>
<v Speaker 10>no nothing.</v>

2487
01:58:49.451 --> 01:58:54.451
<v Speaker 10>Just particles and gas and heat and </v>
<v Speaker 10>nuclear explosions and fucking mass </v>

2488
01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:56.950
<v Speaker 10>connects all these different objects </v>
<v Speaker 10>together.</v>

2489
01:58:56.951 --> 01:59:00.910
<v Speaker 10>And they slowly formed planets and then </v>
<v Speaker 10>live grows on them,</v>

2490
01:59:00.911 --> 01:59:03.790
<v Speaker 10>and then life becomes complex.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Life becomes intelligent,</v>

2491
01:59:03.930 --> 01:59:06.280
<v Speaker 10>self-aware,</v>
<v Speaker 10>life creates technology,</v>

2492
01:59:06.281 --> 01:59:09.310
<v Speaker 10>goes to war,</v>
<v Speaker 10>blows up the fucking universe,</v>

2493
01:59:09.810 --> 01:59:12.400
<v Speaker 10>and then they collide again and more </v>
<v Speaker 10>collide all around.</v>

2494
01:59:12.401 --> 01:59:16.360
<v Speaker 10>And it's a constant cycle of you </v>
<v Speaker 10>society,</v>

2495
01:59:16.361 --> 01:59:17.680
<v Speaker 10>life.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Everything in the universe,</v>

2496
01:59:17.681 --> 01:59:21.280
<v Speaker 10>complexity gets to a certain peak and </v>
<v Speaker 10>then just they just hit each other.</v>

2497
01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:25.720
<v Speaker 12>Maybe it's not that much time in between</v>
<v Speaker 12>each collision.</v>

2498
01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:31.020
<v Speaker 12>Maybe it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Maybe a genius thought are really great </v>

2499
01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:31.510
<v Speaker 12>idea when people have like super great </v>
<v Speaker 12>ideas,</v>

2500
01:59:31.810 --> 01:59:35.080
<v Speaker 12>maybe that's a collision,</v>
<v Speaker 12>a collision that's happened,</v>

2501
01:59:35.081 --> 01:59:37.030
<v Speaker 12>maybe like maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

2502
01:59:37.330 --> 01:59:42.330
<v Speaker 12>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 12>maybe it happens on the micro scale and </v>

2503
01:59:42.330 --> 01:59:45.271
<v Speaker 12>not just on the macro scale.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's like perhaps there's like super </v>

2504
01:59:45.271 --> 01:59:46.990
<v Speaker 12>tiny universe is that bubble again and </v>
<v Speaker 12>again,</v>

2505
01:59:46.991 --> 01:59:51.991
<v Speaker 12>stars and like manifest in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 12>somebody who came up with the theory of </v>

2506
01:59:52.181 --> 01:59:57.181
<v Speaker 12>relativity or some kind of Gullah </v>
<v Speaker 12>culture shaping idea like communism or </v>

2507
01:59:58.421 --> 02:00:03.421
<v Speaker 12>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Maybe that every great idea is just a </v>

2508
02:00:03.421 --> 02:00:07.050
<v Speaker 12>projection of the multiverse coming </v>
<v Speaker 12>through people and manifesting here is </v>

2509
02:00:07.050 --> 02:00:11.761
<v Speaker 12>massive global change and maybe we're </v>
<v Speaker 12>getting hit by more of them now like a </v>

2510
02:00:11.761 --> 02:00:15.880
<v Speaker 12>media or swarm of these multi.</v>
<v Speaker 12>These other universes bumping into ours.</v>

2511
02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:20.050
<v Speaker 12>Falcon Mckenna wrote this awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 12>weird story.</v>

2512
02:00:20.050 --> 02:00:25.050
<v Speaker 12>Did you ever read this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 12>He talked about how it is right around </v>

2513
02:00:25.050 --> 02:00:28.880
<v Speaker 12>when Christianity started,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the universe ripped into a multiverse </v>

2514
02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:32.941
<v Speaker 12>and there's another advanced dimension </v>
<v Speaker 12>right next to ours that's concerned over</v>

2515
02:00:33.551 --> 02:00:38.320
<v Speaker 12>the fact that we have nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but like normally we can be ignored,</v>

2516
02:00:38.321 --> 02:00:43.321
<v Speaker 12>but the fact we have nuclear weapons </v>
<v Speaker 12>kind of like makes things in multiverse </v>

2517
02:00:44.071 --> 02:00:46.300
<v Speaker 12>is next to us that are aware of is </v>
<v Speaker 12>worried,</v>

2518
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:49.360
<v Speaker 12>but he wrote it not like it was really </v>
<v Speaker 12>wrote it in this strange way.</v>

2519
02:00:49.361 --> 02:00:52.600
<v Speaker 12>Like I couldn't tell if he was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 12>write a metaphor or something.</v>

2520
02:00:52.601 --> 02:00:54.880
<v Speaker 12>I just don't want to find it is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 12>cool,</v>

2521
02:00:55.330 --> 02:00:58.240
<v Speaker 12>but this tesla thing you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 12>about.</v>

2522
02:00:59.050 --> 02:01:00.610
<v Speaker 12>It's so funny because you have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 12>okay,</v>

2523
02:01:00.611 --> 02:01:05.611
<v Speaker 12>well I guess my brain just completely </v>
<v Speaker 12>manufactured this alternate reality or </v>

2524
02:01:05.611 --> 02:01:07.960
<v Speaker 12>super intelligent people that invented </v>
<v Speaker 12>all these things.</v>

2525
02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:13.320
<v Speaker 12>That's like one version of it or the </v>
<v Speaker 12>other version which a lot of I think </v>

2526
02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:16.351
<v Speaker 12>shamans talk about his idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 12>spirit world where that moment your </v>

2527
02:01:16.351 --> 02:01:21.061
<v Speaker 12>astral body went to some alternate </v>
<v Speaker 12>dimension and sow one possibility of the</v>

2528
02:01:22.331 --> 02:01:27.331
<v Speaker 12>way our universe could have turned out </v>
<v Speaker 12>and then came back here and now you're </v>

2529
02:01:27.331 --> 02:01:27.340
<v Speaker 12>broadcasting that.</v>

2530
02:01:27.590 --> 02:01:29.860
<v Speaker 12>Say as many people as listening,</v>
<v Speaker 12>listen to the show.</v>

2531
02:01:31.010 --> 02:01:36.010
<v Speaker 12>You're a leak of some weird,</v>
<v Speaker 12>some weird coordinate of the multiverse </v>

2532
02:01:38.350 --> 02:01:43.350
<v Speaker 12>is coming through you now as you talk </v>
<v Speaker 12>about this thing that's like it's a </v>

2533
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:45.821
<v Speaker 12>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Maybe there's some fucking part of the </v>

2534
02:01:45.821 --> 02:01:47.651
<v Speaker 12>multiverse where where will 69 gorillas </v>
<v Speaker 12>stay the fuck away</v>

2535
02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:50.720
<v Speaker 5>away from there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just.</v>

2536
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:54.360
<v Speaker 5>To me it was almost like a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>message that everything is preposterous.</v>

2537
02:01:55.800 --> 02:02:00.450
<v Speaker 5>Do you take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever stop and wonder how much</v>

2538
02:02:01.770 --> 02:02:02.220
<v Speaker 2>of</v>

2539
02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:07.950
<v Speaker 5>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much of the things that you go </v>

2540
02:02:07.950 --> 02:02:10.771
<v Speaker 5>through are real and how much of it may </v>
<v Speaker 5>be some sort of a background noise going</v>

2541
02:02:12.191 --> 02:02:17.191
<v Speaker 5>on in this weird play that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>creating for yourself to your </v>

2542
02:02:17.191 --> 02:02:20.731
<v Speaker 5>imagination has put forth and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>Sunday you're going to understand it </v>

2543
02:02:20.731 --> 02:02:23.551
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but right now it's all the people that </v>

2544
02:02:23.551 --> 02:02:25.651
<v Speaker 5>are in front of you or the bit players </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're supposed to be trying to </v>

2545
02:02:25.651 --> 02:02:28.141
<v Speaker 5>figure this thing out as you move along.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All that stuff that's going on in the </v>

2546
02:02:28.141 --> 02:02:28.141
<v Speaker 5>background car accidents</v>

2547
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:33.430
<v Speaker 12>or seems like there's so many pieces </v>
<v Speaker 12>going together to like too to too many </v>

2548
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:34.050
<v Speaker 12>times.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm like,</v>

2549
02:02:34.051 --> 02:02:36.390
<v Speaker 12>that's just weird that that just </v>
<v Speaker 12>happened like that.</v>

2550
02:02:36.391 --> 02:02:37.740
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like it just seems like it's just</v>

2551
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:39.940
<v Speaker 5>manifesting things in your own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2552
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:40.980
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2553
02:02:41.450 --> 02:02:42.580
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not a fault.</v>

2554
02:02:42.610 --> 02:02:44.140
<v Speaker 5>It's not foolproof.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2555
02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:46.000
<v Speaker 5>It's not like he could prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2556
02:02:46.030 --> 02:02:47.170
<v Speaker 5>but there's something going on.</v>

2557
02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:49.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it is.</v>

2558
02:02:49.391 --> 02:02:53.560
<v Speaker 5>I think there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there there's something to the idea that</v>

2559
02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:58.600
<v Speaker 5>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you know someone's going to call </v>

2560
02:02:58.600 --> 02:02:58.600
<v Speaker 5>you and then you pick up the phone and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's them.</v>

2561
02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.880
<v Speaker 5>That's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something to that.</v>

2562
02:03:00.881 --> 02:03:03.040
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

2563
02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:05.890
<v Speaker 5>but I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just coincidence.</v>

2564
02:03:06.490 --> 02:03:11.490
<v Speaker 5>It may be coincidence sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've had sharp moments where I </v>

2565
02:03:11.490 --> 02:03:13.780
<v Speaker 5>thought of somebody and I looked at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>phone.</v>

2566
02:03:13.810 --> 02:03:17.020
<v Speaker 5>It started ringing and it was like sharp</v>
<v Speaker 5>moments.</v>

2567
02:03:17.410 --> 02:03:20.860
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what it is.</v>

2568
02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:25.980
<v Speaker 5>You could say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just luck in anticipation of </v>

2569
02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:28.181
<v Speaker 5>meeting each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that I was hoping that person </v>

2570
02:03:28.181 --> 02:03:28.181
<v Speaker 5>called me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not even man.</v>

2571
02:03:28.181 --> 02:03:30.280
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you don't even think about </v>
<v Speaker 5>that person for a long time.</v>

2572
02:03:30.281 --> 02:03:31.600
<v Speaker 5>Then all sudden you think about them </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2573
02:03:31.601 --> 02:03:36.601
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't talked to him in fucking 10 </v>

2574
02:03:36.601 --> 02:03:39.031
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he leaves you an email and </v>

2575
02:03:39.031 --> 02:03:39.031
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is that?</v>

2576
02:03:39.031 --> 02:03:39.031
<v Speaker 5>What is</v>

2577
02:03:39.031 --> 02:03:39.730
<v Speaker 12>it just happened to me?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Dude,</v>

2578
02:03:39.731 --> 02:03:42.640
<v Speaker 12>I just on the lab under our.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I just did.</v>

2579
02:03:43.230 --> 02:03:48.230
<v Speaker 12>My friend Brendan Walsh came in and we </v>
<v Speaker 12>both go to the same medicinal marijuana </v>

2580
02:03:48.230 --> 02:03:51.961
<v Speaker 12>dispensary and we're both talking about </v>
<v Speaker 12>how awesome it is and the people that </v>

2581
02:03:51.961 --> 02:03:54.580
<v Speaker 12>work there really fucking cool and so </v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm like,</v>

2582
02:03:54.581 --> 02:03:59.581
<v Speaker 12>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm going to do a commercial for this </v>

2583
02:03:59.581 --> 02:04:01.681
<v Speaker 12>dispensary.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Like I want to do like a all the way </v>

2584
02:04:01.681 --> 02:04:01.681
<v Speaker 12>commercial should be.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm not getting paid.</v>

2585
02:04:01.681 --> 02:04:06.211
<v Speaker 12>They don't even know who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm just going to do this commercial </v>

2586
02:04:06.211 --> 02:04:06.211
<v Speaker 12>because they're cool people and a cool </v>
<v Speaker 12>fucking place.</v>

2587
02:04:06.211 --> 02:04:07.030
<v Speaker 12>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I did like little,</v>

2588
02:04:07.031 --> 02:04:10.840
<v Speaker 12>like there's a character on a Webinar or</v>
<v Speaker 12>a teacup pig is basically little Hobo.</v>

2589
02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:15.610
<v Speaker 12>I,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I did this stupid commercial for them.</v>

2590
02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.000
<v Speaker 12>The next day I went in there to get my </v>
<v Speaker 12>medicine and I walked in and the guy's </v>

2591
02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:21.280
<v Speaker 12>like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>Hey,</v>

2592
02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:23.050
<v Speaker 12>I look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 12>look at this,</v>

2593
02:04:23.530 --> 02:04:27.370
<v Speaker 12>and he just pulled up on the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the lavender,</v>

2594
02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:29.590
<v Speaker 12>our episode where I did the </v>
<v Speaker 12>advertisement.</v>

2595
02:04:29.591 --> 02:04:34.090
<v Speaker 12>Now what the fuck are the odds that the </v>
<v Speaker 12>odds of that are pretty God damn slim.</v>

2596
02:04:34.091 --> 02:04:34.720
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's.</v>

2597
02:04:35.050 --> 02:04:38.460
<v Speaker 12>I think the odds that that guy would </v>
<v Speaker 12>even hear it are pretty slim.</v>

2598
02:04:38.461 --> 02:04:42.060
<v Speaker 12>But if you consider the idea of me </v>
<v Speaker 12>coming there at the exact time,</v>

2599
02:04:42.061 --> 02:04:43.890
<v Speaker 12>you just pull it up on the computer.</v>

2600
02:04:43.940 --> 02:04:46.110
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you have any idea how many</v>

2601
02:04:46.111 --> 02:04:51.111
<v Speaker 5>people listened to you on this podcast.</v>

2677
02:07:49.361 --> 02:07:54.361
<v Speaker 5>trying to conform to what they like </v>

2682
02:08:03.250 --> 02:08:06.340
<v Speaker 12>It's an illusion of being scary because </v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

2688
02:08:12.391 --> 02:08:17.110
<v Speaker 12>Then then you're connected forever.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You're chained to a person who's this </v>

2689
02:08:17.110 --> 02:08:20.390
<v Speaker 12>satisfied with you as a human,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but here's the thing.</v>

<v Speaker 12>phases and they're going to be some </v>

2692
02:08:29.630 --> 02:08:31.990
<v Speaker 12>phases that people are in it maybe </v>
<v Speaker 12>you're not so cool with,</v>

2693
02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:35.530
<v Speaker 12>you know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 12>this person or am I dissatisfied with </v>
<v Speaker 12>some core aspect of this human or are </v>

2697
02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:45.690

<v Speaker 5>you and your chick or unusual in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're both in the same line of business</v>

<v Speaker 12>and I make her laugh and she's got one </v>
<v Speaker 12>of the greatest lines I've ever heard.</v>

2717
02:09:41.070 --> 02:09:46.070
<v Speaker 12>And so that keeps me wanting to be funny</v>
<v Speaker 12>around her and instead of it like her </v>

2718
02:09:46.171 --> 02:09:49.950
<v Speaker 12>rejecting me being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 12>She embraces it.</v>

2719
02:09:49.951 --> 02:09:51.960
<v Speaker 12>And so then you've got girls reject you </v>
<v Speaker 12>being funny.</v>

2720
02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:52.980
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I would,</v>

2721
02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:55.260
<v Speaker 12>I wouldn't say like reject me being </v>
<v Speaker 12>funny,</v>

2722
02:09:55.261 --> 02:09:58.950
<v Speaker 12>but I think it's more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's more with her.</v>

2723
02:09:58.980 --> 02:10:01.320
<v Speaker 12>Is it a conformity thing?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Like they wanted you to like,</v>

2724
02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:04.440
<v Speaker 12>I know it's always crazy power,</v>
<v Speaker 12>man.</v>

2725
02:10:04.770 --> 02:10:09.770
<v Speaker 12>It's not a conformity thing.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's like you're either in a </v>

2726
02:10:09.770 --> 02:10:12.021
<v Speaker 12>relationship with somebody where you can</v>
<v Speaker 12>create a symbiosis and merge your power </v>

2727
02:10:12.021 --> 02:10:15.861
<v Speaker 12>together and you both want each other to</v>
<v Speaker 12>be successful or you're in a situation </v>

2728
02:10:15.861 --> 02:10:16.170
<v Speaker 12>with someone where somebody wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 12>on top.</v>

2729
02:10:16.171 --> 02:10:21.171
<v Speaker 12>Somebody wants to be at.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Someone wants to be literally on top in </v>

2730
02:10:21.171 --> 02:10:24.240
<v Speaker 12>every single way.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And so if you're in a relationship where</v>

2731
02:10:24.241 --> 02:10:27.540
<v Speaker 12>somebody is trying to repress your </v>
<v Speaker 12>creativity out of fear,</v>

2732
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:30.390
<v Speaker 12>then as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you have to,</v>

2733
02:10:30.750 --> 02:10:32.220
<v Speaker 12>you have to get out of that </v>
<v Speaker 12>relationship.</v>

2734
02:10:32.221 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 12>But it's not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You're in love with somebody.</v>

2735
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:39.100
<v Speaker 6>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you mean by what you were just </v>

2736
02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:39.380
<v Speaker 6>saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone that always wants to be on top,</v>

2737
02:10:39.890 --> 02:10:40.430
<v Speaker 6>on top,</v>

2738
02:10:41.330 --> 02:10:42.530
<v Speaker 7>on top of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on,</v>

2739
02:10:42.990 --> 02:10:45.110
<v Speaker 7>on top of you in every way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dominant.</v>

2740
02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:46.790
<v Speaker 7>The dominant one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The if,</v>

2741
02:10:46.810 --> 02:10:49.490
<v Speaker 7>if you're with someone who you've had </v>
<v Speaker 7>that man.</v>

2742
02:10:49.970 --> 02:10:52.220
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would say you did want to hear</v>

2743
02:10:52.490 --> 02:10:57.490
<v Speaker 6>that one's full on someone just </v>
<v Speaker 6>constantly fucking with you.</v>

2744
02:10:58.610 --> 02:10:59.120
<v Speaker 6>Constantly.</v>

2745
02:10:59.190 --> 02:11:00.540
<v Speaker 7>Time for that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Really,</v>

2746
02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:06.460
<v Speaker 7>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think the important thing to realize </v>

2747
02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:08.230
<v Speaker 7>that she has a vagina is not a life of </v>
<v Speaker 7>hell,</v>

2748
02:11:08.231 --> 02:11:13.231
<v Speaker 7>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're fucking shades of this that </v>

2749
02:11:13.231 --> 02:11:13.231
<v Speaker 7>we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's shades of this and,</v>

2750
02:11:13.231 --> 02:11:15.880
<v Speaker 7>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the reason it's kind of a common,</v>

2751
02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:21.240
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a common thing when you see in a </v>

2752
02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:22.420
<v Speaker 7>sitcom or a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The theme of that got yes,</v>

2753
02:11:22.421 --> 02:11:24.820
<v Speaker 7>dear.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whatever she wants is what goes.</v>

2754
02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:30.000
<v Speaker 7>It's because we're talking about a some </v>
<v Speaker 7>form of interaction that happens between</v>

2755
02:11:31.090 --> 02:11:32.890
<v Speaker 7>the masculine and feminine</v>

2756
02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:33.810
<v Speaker 6>energies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Will,</v>

2757
02:11:33.811 --> 02:11:35.010
<v Speaker 6>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's really interesting.</v>

2758
02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:36.000
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

2759
02:11:36.001 --> 02:11:37.950
<v Speaker 6>you've grown more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's true.</v>

2760
02:11:38.220 --> 02:11:40.740
<v Speaker 6>You've grown more as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2761
02:11:40.741 --> 02:11:45.741
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've always been a guy who's really </v>

2762
02:11:45.741 --> 02:11:47.670
<v Speaker 6>pretty introspective and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>brutally honest about yourself,</v>

2763
02:11:47.730 --> 02:11:52.730
<v Speaker 6>pro or con.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when you're in a steady </v>

2764
02:11:52.730 --> 02:11:52.920
<v Speaker 6>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always feel like,</v>

2765
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:55.050
<v Speaker 6>especially like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you're in a healthy one,</v>

2766
02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:56.940
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're in a,</v>

2767
02:11:57.110 --> 02:11:59.280
<v Speaker 6>you're in a way different place </v>
<v Speaker 6>creatively.</v>

2768
02:11:59.430 --> 02:12:03.420
<v Speaker 6>Like you're able to express yourself </v>
<v Speaker 6>without the burden of.</v>

2769
02:12:03.450 --> 02:12:08.450
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of psychological fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>warfare that goes on and constantly bad </v>

2770
02:12:08.611 --> 02:12:10.830
<v Speaker 6>relationships that really clouds up the </v>
<v Speaker 6>mind.</v>

2771
02:12:11.070 --> 02:12:12.720
<v Speaker 6>And when you're in a healthy </v>
<v Speaker 6>relationship,</v>

2772
02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:14.280
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you are,</v>

2773
02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:17.070
<v Speaker 6>it allows you to think about things much</v>
<v Speaker 6>clearer.</v>

2774
02:12:17.310 --> 02:12:22.310
<v Speaker 6>Your ability to describe reality just </v>
<v Speaker 6>over the past few years,</v>

2775
02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:25.080
<v Speaker 6>you've gotten so much better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>

2776
02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:27.150
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're writing's gotten better.</v>

2777
02:12:27.151 --> 02:12:30.690
<v Speaker 6>Your comedies gotten better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've always been a super smart dude,</v>

2778
02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:35.400
<v Speaker 6>but I think that when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're in a position where you,</v>

2779
02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:40.580
<v Speaker 6>you find someone who doesn't try to </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking change who you are is so </v>

2780
02:12:40.711 --> 02:12:43.440
<v Speaker 6>important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So worst thing in the world,</v>

2781
02:12:43.441 --> 02:12:48.441
<v Speaker 6>is he one of your friends stuck in some </v>
<v Speaker 6>situation where someone's trying to get </v>

2782
02:12:48.441 --> 02:12:51.771
<v Speaker 6>him to be something that he's not right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not encourage them to do what he wants </v>

2783
02:12:51.771 --> 02:12:51.771
<v Speaker 6>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but to get them to.</v>

2784
02:12:51.771 --> 02:12:53.370
<v Speaker 6>You're never going to make it as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>comedian.</v>

2785
02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:54.180
<v Speaker 6>Just give this up.</v>

2786
02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:56.980
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The thing about you can write books.</v>

2787
02:12:57.010 --> 02:12:58.440
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I get encouraged like that.</v>

2788
02:12:58.460 --> 02:13:03.460
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a very cool relationship because </v>

2789
02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:03.520
<v Speaker 7>the income I get encouraged to go on </v>
<v Speaker 7>stage more.</v>

02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:06.150
<v Speaker 7>You got to go on stage more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You gotta go up all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 7>You gotta work harder.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why you get onstage?</v>

2792
02:13:08.140 --> 02:13:09.670

2830
02:14:51.250 --> 02:14:54.420
<v Speaker 5>a container that says it's pasteurizer </v>
<v Speaker 5>modular as they have people that will do</v>

2831
02:14:54.421 --> 02:14:57.060
<v Speaker 5>it for them because it's stinks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was kind of was bacteria in it,</v>

2832
02:14:57.310 --> 02:14:59.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's so good.</v>

2833
02:14:59.861 --> 02:15:01.110
<v Speaker 5>And that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>

2834
02:15:01.111 --> 02:15:03.780
<v Speaker 5>But that's what blue cheese is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You look at those crumbles.</v>

2835
02:15:03.781 --> 02:15:05.070
<v Speaker 5>The blue cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the blue part.</v>

2836
02:15:05.071 --> 02:15:05.660
<v Speaker 5>That's like fun.</v>

2837
02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:07.510
<v Speaker 3>Can Mold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would it be illegal though?</v>

2838
02:15:07.511 --> 02:15:09.610
<v Speaker 3>Just because it's considered like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>poison or something?</v>

2839
02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:10.780
<v Speaker 5>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2840
02:15:10.781 --> 02:15:14.170
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think just for public health concerns,</v>

2841
02:15:14.350 --> 02:15:15.370
<v Speaker 5>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2842
02:15:15.490 --> 02:15:17.770
<v Speaker 5>when you like raw milk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like real dangerous.</v>

2843
02:15:17.771 --> 02:15:19.390
<v Speaker 5>You can only keep it for a certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of time.</v>

2844
02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:20.470
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how long is it good.</v>

2845
02:15:20.471 --> 02:15:22.270
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>regular milk is good for like a month.</v>

2846
02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:27.600
<v Speaker 5>Raw milk can be good for more than like </v>
<v Speaker 5>seven or nine days or something like </v>

2847
02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:27.600
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine.</v>

2848
02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:29.320
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people can get sick,</v>

2849
02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:30.790
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's,</v>

2850
02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:35.980
<v Speaker 5>that's some of the theory behind it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it when you homogenize things </v>

2851
02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:37.600
<v Speaker 5>pasteurized and you can pick them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep them on the shelf longer,</v>

2852
02:15:37.870 --> 02:15:41.080
<v Speaker 5>but that's also how you apparently </v>
<v Speaker 5>cooked the enzymes.</v>

2853
02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:44.230
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the reasons why people </v>
<v Speaker 5>have lactose intolerance,</v>

2854
02:15:44.410 --> 02:15:47.980
<v Speaker 5>but some people with lactose intolerance</v>
<v Speaker 5>can actually drink raw milk and not have</v>

2855
02:15:47.981 --> 02:15:49.990
<v Speaker 5>any problems with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weird.</v>

2856
02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:52.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But raw milk tastes delicious dude.</v>

2857
02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:54.670
<v Speaker 5>Raw whole milk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like really?</v>

2858
02:15:54.730 --> 02:15:57.070
<v Speaker 5>It tastes really good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like with cookies.</v>

2859
02:15:57.130 --> 02:16:02.130
<v Speaker 5>Oh it's the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so like rich and creamy and you </v>

2860
02:16:02.130 --> 02:16:06.271
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems so alive when you drink it as </v>

2861
02:16:06.271 --> 02:16:06.430
<v Speaker 5>opposed to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know when you drink regular,</v>

2862
02:16:06.431 --> 02:16:07.870
<v Speaker 5>homogenized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pasteurized milk.</v>

2863
02:16:07.871 --> 02:16:09.220
<v Speaker 5>This is milk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>body,</v>

2864
02:16:09.790 --> 02:16:11.770
<v Speaker 5>dead milk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>water,</v>

2865
02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:16.810
<v Speaker 5>Whitewater thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not so weird but comes from a cow.</v>

2866
02:16:16.900 --> 02:16:19.180
<v Speaker 3>This cheese that I got in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2867
02:16:19.181 --> 02:16:20.740
<v Speaker 3>you sound like a jerk when you talk like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2868
02:16:20.741 --> 02:16:22.490
<v Speaker 3>You sound like such a jerk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this cheese I had,</v>

2869
02:16:22.930 --> 02:16:25.000
<v Speaker 3>it was like talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was not,</v>

2870
02:16:25.030 --> 02:16:28.090
<v Speaker 3>it was not just like a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mold.</v>

2871
02:16:28.091 --> 02:16:29.710
<v Speaker 3>Like you'll get cheesy and you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 3>the green stuff.</v>

2872
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:32.980
<v Speaker 3>It was like flourishing more like when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you leave,</v>

2873
02:16:32.981 --> 02:16:37.981
<v Speaker 3>like just rising above the cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like blowing with mold and it was </v>

2874
02:16:38.111 --> 02:16:43.111
<v Speaker 3>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just ate the whole diarrhea or weird</v>

2875
02:16:44.261 --> 02:16:47.860
<v Speaker 3>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to talk about.</v>

2876
02:16:47.880 --> 02:16:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to talk about what I </v>

2877
02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:52.880
<v Speaker 3>did do at June.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you even eat that?</v>

2878
02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:56.740
<v Speaker 3>You made so you had all this delicious </v>
<v Speaker 3>food and you got mad diarrhea and you're</v>

2879
02:16:56.741 --> 02:16:58.690
<v Speaker 3>trying to get us to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't diarrhea.</v>

2880
02:16:58.691 --> 02:17:03.580
<v Speaker 3>It was something worse for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you do your girl get it to.</v>

2881
02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:04.780
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

2882
02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:06.430
<v Speaker 3>Did she eat the same stuff you ate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2883
02:17:06.431 --> 02:17:08.110

2944
02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:47.870
<v Speaker 4>This might be the craziest fucking place</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever to go to.</v>

2945
02:19:48.050 --> 02:19:48.990
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got it.</v>

2946
02:19:49.010 --> 02:19:51.500
<v Speaker 4>And then you look at their website and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a friendly website,</v>

2947
02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:55.010
<v Speaker 4>like the happiest thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

2948
02:19:56.260 --> 02:19:57.530
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever been there before?</v>
<v Speaker 4>New Orleans?</v>

2949
02:19:58.090 --> 02:20:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A long time ago I was there,</v>

2950
02:20:00.251 --> 02:20:01.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a UFC.</v>

2951
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:07.150
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows God when nobody knew what the </v>

2952
02:20:07.150 --> 02:20:08.290
<v Speaker 1>UFC was back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was during the news radio days.</v>

2953
02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember much,</v>

2954
02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:15.750
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll put on some fights and left when </v>

2955
02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:15.750
<v Speaker 1>we were eight of the restaurant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were saying,</v>

2956
02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:15.750
<v Speaker 1>be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous.</v>

2957
02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:16.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what I kept hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blah.</v>

2958
02:20:16.690 --> 02:20:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous.</v>

2959
02:20:18.050 --> 02:20:20.320
<v Speaker 1>People kept saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be careful.</v>

2960
02:20:20.321 --> 02:20:21.520
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get robbed.</v>

2961
02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:25.750
<v Speaker 1>There's apparently a extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of crime around New Orleans.</v>

2962
02:20:25.850 --> 02:20:28.760
<v Speaker 3>My Dad would take me to New Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd go to a bar,</v>

2963
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:34.150
<v Speaker 3>he gave me like 60 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get fucking drunk and wander down the </v>

2964
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:36.410
<v Speaker 3>street and just take nitrous oxide </v>
<v Speaker 3>heads.</v>

2965
02:20:36.530 --> 02:20:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old are you?</v>

2966
02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:42.440
<v Speaker 3>I think I was like 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15.</v>

2967
02:20:42.441 --> 02:20:44.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I used to do.</v>

2968
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:45.800
<v Speaker 3>16 to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2969
02:20:45.860 --> 02:20:50.860
<v Speaker 3>I would go down the street and get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you could buy nitrous oxide </v>

2970
02:20:50.860 --> 02:20:51.100
<v Speaker 3>balloons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

2971
02:20:51.130 --> 02:20:52.580
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2972
02:20:52.581 --> 02:20:57.581
<v Speaker 3>this is how bad kid I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent all my money on a stripper and </v>

2973
02:20:58.731 --> 02:21:01.640
<v Speaker 3>all these nitrous oxide balloons and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some booze.</v>

2974
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:07.270
<v Speaker 3>So I know it money that was supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>last for a couple of days that my dad </v>

2975
02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:09.420
<v Speaker 3>had given me and then I told my dad I </v>
<v Speaker 3>got mugged him.</v>

2976
02:21:09.610 --> 02:21:12.440
<v Speaker 3>More money to spend on more nitrogen </v>
<v Speaker 3>oxide.</v>

2977
02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:16.530
<v Speaker 3>Is that crazy easy with corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half of their profit is just from people</v>

2978
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:19.580
<v Speaker 3>doing balloons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not crazy.</v>

2979
02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:21.310
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Half the profit that.</v>

2980
02:21:21.311 --> 02:21:24.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean that has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to bike,</v>

2981
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:27.620
<v Speaker 3>but you were reading something online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure man.</v>

2982
02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:31.230
<v Speaker 3>I bet it's not even one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

2983
02:21:31.370 --> 02:21:31.910
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2984
02:21:31.911 --> 02:21:34.280
<v Speaker 3>Sixteen year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixteen year olds do it.</v>

2985
02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:39.920
<v Speaker 3>Out of 100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people do you know that make </v>

2986
02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:39.920
<v Speaker 3>their own whipped cream?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2987
02:21:40.130 --> 02:21:40.730
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2988
02:21:43.410 --> 02:21:48.410
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's some homemade whipped cream.</v>

2989
02:21:48.660 --> 02:21:50.660
<v Speaker 3>Everyone enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made this myself</v>

2990
02:21:51.730 --> 02:21:54.110
<v Speaker 1>couple of times and it is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2991
02:21:54.111 --> 02:21:57.020
<v Speaker 1>I think most people by the web stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>

2992
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:59.520
<v Speaker 1>but I've made it a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad.</v>

2993
02:21:59.521 --> 02:21:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2994
02:21:59.850 --> 02:22:04.850
<v Speaker 3>Start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to get one of those blenders </v>

2995
02:22:04.850 --> 02:22:06.431
<v Speaker 3>things was to whisks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They spend with each other and you get </v>

2996
02:22:06.431 --> 02:22:06.690
<v Speaker 3>it a bowl and you add all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ingredients.</v>

2997
02:22:06.700 --> 02:22:08.280
<v Speaker 1>I've done it a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty dope.</v>

2998
02:22:08.610 --> 02:22:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Real whipped cream tastes better because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2999
02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:14.000
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3000
02:22:14.130 --> 02:22:15.390
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ain't making this shit.</v>

3001
02:22:15.970 --> 02:22:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the time for that.</v>

3002
02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:21.750
<v Speaker 3>But the stuff that's in the cans that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't taste as good,</v>

3003
02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:23.650
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's good as trump.</v>

3004
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go to a real restaurant and </v>
<v Speaker 3>get some real whipped cream</v>

3005
02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:27.030
<v Speaker 1>with strawberries.</v>

3006
02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:30.600
<v Speaker 4>When I see a can of whipped cream to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this day,</v>

3007
02:22:31.230 --> 02:22:36.230
<v Speaker 4>all I think about is how it comes to my </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind when I see a can of whipped cream,</v>

3008
02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:40.530
<v Speaker 4>when I will use to my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend in high school introduced</v>

3009
02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:45.560
<v Speaker 4>me to whippets and after that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know if my parents thought I was trying </v>

3010
02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:49.470
<v Speaker 4>to become a pastry chef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck they thought in Ohio,</v>

3011
02:22:49.471 --> 02:22:54.471
<v Speaker 4>they sold it everywhere today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So at video stores whip it's like you </v>

3012
02:22:54.471 --> 02:22:58.401
<v Speaker 4>come in and go buy a cracker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a balloon and the easy web at a video </v>

3013
02:22:58.401 --> 02:22:58.800
<v Speaker 4>store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how popular was in Columbus.</v>

3014
02:22:59.350 --> 02:23:01.780
<v Speaker 1>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

3015
02:23:01.850 --> 02:23:02.920
<v Speaker 1>There's no whip cream in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>

3016
02:23:02.921 --> 02:23:03.490
<v Speaker 1>It's just the air.</v>

3017
02:23:03.570 --> 02:23:03.930
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3018
02:23:03.931 --> 02:23:08.931
<v Speaker 4>it's just the air that you use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the screw on the machines that would </v>

3019
02:23:08.931 --> 02:23:08.931
<v Speaker 4>pump the air out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to go,</v>

3020
02:23:08.931 --> 02:23:10.950
<v Speaker 4>you learn how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't shake it up,</v>

3021
02:23:11.490 --> 02:23:14.490
<v Speaker 4>you buy it and you don't shake it out </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause the gas rises to the top.</v>

3022
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:17.400
<v Speaker 4>So you just do it right off the top when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you first do it.</v>

3023
02:23:17.970 --> 02:23:22.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about these low content </v>
<v Speaker 4>canisters that you put in like a thing </v>

3024
02:23:22.970 --> 02:23:24.540
<v Speaker 4>and they put it balloons talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>cracking the whip cream.</v>

3025
02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:25.830
<v Speaker 4>I never did that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3026
02:23:25.860 --> 02:23:28.440
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that seems more like wasting your task.</v>

3027
02:23:28.441 --> 02:23:31.230
<v Speaker 4>So you're talking about just some </v>
<v Speaker 4>nitrous oxide and sell.</v>

3028
02:23:31.480 --> 02:23:33.300
<v Speaker 4>They sell easy whips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where is that?</v>

3029
02:23:33.301 --> 02:23:34.500
<v Speaker 4>What it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nitrous oxide?</v>

3030
02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:36.720
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two nitrogen,</v>

3031
02:23:37.050 --> 02:23:39.390
<v Speaker 4>I think nitric oxide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

3032
02:23:39.391 --> 02:23:41.160
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they come in these little containers</v>

3033
02:23:41.161 --> 02:23:46.161
<v Speaker 4>and they come you and by the case in </v>
<v Speaker 4>each balloon then you have that metal </v>

3034
02:23:46.161 --> 02:23:49.731
<v Speaker 4>cracker that looks kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like a camping gear thing </v>

3035
02:23:49.731 --> 02:23:50.610
<v Speaker 4>where you unscrew it and you put it in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>close it,</v>

3036
02:23:50.611 --> 02:23:55.611
<v Speaker 4>you put the balloon on one side and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>crack it and it just fills a hole </v>

3037
02:23:55.611 --> 02:23:55.611
<v Speaker 4>balloon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then just take the blind.</v>

3038
02:23:55.611 --> 02:23:55.611
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3039
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:57.900
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked at a,</v>

3040
02:23:58.200 --> 02:23:58.910
<v Speaker 1>one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3041
02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:00.930
<v Speaker 1>ice cream place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called newports creamery.</v>

3042
02:24:01.290 --> 02:24:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Newport Krumrie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They serve like cheeseburgers and shit.</v>

3043
02:24:03.541 --> 02:24:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I was a cook for a little while and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got fucking horrible zits from that.</v>

3044
02:24:06.991 --> 02:24:07.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the nastiest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyber,</v>

3045
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:10.500
<v Speaker 1>but also a scooped ice cream and made </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice cream Sundaes.</v>

3046
02:24:10.620 --> 02:24:12.380
<v Speaker 1>And we would have to go replenish the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3047
02:24:12.381 --> 02:24:14.610
<v Speaker 1>the containers because it would make </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own whipped cream.</v>

3048
02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had these giant fucking </v>

3049
02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:19.720
<v Speaker 1>containers of nitrogen and everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a burnout.</v>

3050
02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:21.330
<v Speaker 1>They would all go back there and get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

3051
02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I only did it once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it.</v>

3052
02:24:23.010 --> 02:24:25.290
<v Speaker 1>That was my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was scared of drugs days.</v>

3053
02:24:25.650 --> 02:24:27.750
<v Speaker 1>That was all my martial arts.</v>

3054
02:24:27.980 --> 02:24:29.330
<v Speaker 4>You know what that sound is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you?</v>

3055
02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:32.650
<v Speaker 4>Helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what happens when you do the,</v>

3056
02:24:32.651 --> 02:24:36.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nitric triple starts going in waves.</v>

3057
02:24:36.590 --> 02:24:39.240
<v Speaker 4>You hear the incident sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That shit was way worse.</v>

3070
02:25:07.540 --> 02:25:10.720
<v Speaker 4>the spray that you spray on keyboards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think they have any more.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I think that's just canned air.</v>

3076
02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't</v>

3077
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:25.510
<v Speaker 1>think they'd make it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.</v>

3078
02:25:25.570 --> 02:25:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Century duster.</v>

3079
02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of feel a little lightheaded.</v>

3080
02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:32.520
<v Speaker 1>So what would that do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duty.</v>

3081
02:25:32.521 --> 02:25:35.500
<v Speaker 1>You did almost the same thing as </v>
<v Speaker 1>nitrous,</v>

3082
02:25:35.501 --> 02:25:37.930
<v Speaker 1>but it was grocer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like after you're done,</v>

3083
02:25:37.931 --> 02:25:38.170
<v Speaker 1>you're like.</v>

3084
02:25:39.290 --> 02:25:44.290
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing is just oxygen being cut </v>

3085
02:25:44.290 --> 02:25:44.290
<v Speaker 3>out of your bloodstream and your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost</v>

3086
02:25:44.290 --> 02:25:49.210
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about how many different ways </v>

3087
02:25:49.210 --> 02:25:49.210
<v Speaker 1>people have sought to achieve altered </v>
<v Speaker 1>states of consciousness,</v>

3088
02:25:49.210 --> 02:25:53.120
<v Speaker 1>huffing paint themselves and jerking off</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they were at lingerie.</v>

3089
02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

3090
02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I was watching the wonderful whites of </v>
<v Speaker 1>West Virginia again on the plane and uh,</v>

3091
02:25:59.030 --> 02:26:04.030
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that they were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about was Jessica and how much gasoline </v>

3092
02:26:04.030 --> 02:26:04.030
<v Speaker 1>he sniffed that he huffed so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>gasoline.</v>

3093
02:26:04.030 --> 02:26:06.200
<v Speaker 1>He could tell the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular and high test.</v>

3094
02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:14.200
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have to look at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was talking about how you have </v>

3095
02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:14.200
<v Speaker 1>gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>

3096
02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:17.250
<v Speaker 3>My strange addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3097
02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:22.360
<v Speaker 3>what does that show on Tlc?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the episodes is a woman is </v>

3098
02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:24.170
<v Speaker 3>addicted to sniffing gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wake up in the morning,</v>

3099
02:26:24.380 --> 02:26:26.450
<v Speaker 3>sniffed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like super hooked on it.</v>

3100
02:26:26.451 --> 02:26:30.680
<v Speaker 3>So at her house is just filled with like</v>
<v Speaker 3>old bottles of gas and she's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You just addicted to huffing gas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She loves it.</v>

3103
02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:40.430
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that psychological?</v>

3104
02:26:40.431 --> 02:26:41.170
<v Speaker 1>It must be right?</v>

3105
02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:42.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because she's like,</v>

3106
02:26:42.420 --> 02:26:44.240
<v Speaker 3>I get addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean Shit.</v>

3108
02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:48.080
<v Speaker 3>Watch that episode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's addicted or she craves it.</v>

3109
02:26:48.081 --> 02:26:52.280
<v Speaker 3>Kinda like that disease where you crave </v>
<v Speaker 3>and gas for 15 years.</v>

3110
02:26:52.281 --> 02:26:52.850
<v Speaker 3>You're crazy.</v>

3111
02:26:52.850 --> 02:26:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is it become become </v>

3112
02:26:57.850 --> 02:26:57.850
<v Speaker 1>physically addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they think that amy winehouse,</v>

3113
02:26:57.850 --> 02:27:00.920
<v Speaker 1>one of the speculations and amy </v>
<v Speaker 1>winehouse died because she tried to quit</v>

3114
02:27:01.010 --> 02:27:04.400
<v Speaker 1>alcohol cold Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can happen to people,</v>

3115
02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:07.670
<v Speaker 1>but they know that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Council found medication in a room.</v>

3116
02:27:07.671 --> 02:27:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're right.</v>

3117
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:14.710
<v Speaker 1>It's very possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my point is that it is possible for </v>

3118
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:17.201
<v Speaker 1>that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that that's a documentable </v>

3119
02:27:17.201 --> 02:27:17.201
<v Speaker 1>occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people just quit,</v>

3120
02:27:17.201 --> 02:27:21.650
<v Speaker 1>they need to wean yourself off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol to stressing your system to just</v>

3121
02:27:21.651 --> 02:27:22.670
<v Speaker 1>quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can kill you.</v>

3122
02:27:22.730 --> 02:27:23.930
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delirium,</v>

3124
02:27:27.121 --> 02:27:32.121
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably several drugs and shit </v>

3125
02:27:32.121 --> 02:27:32.121
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very addictive drugs that are like.</v>

3126
02:27:32.121 --> 02:27:35.010
<v Speaker 3>There's antidepressants that if you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>off of yield,</v>

3127
02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:38.830
<v Speaker 3>you'll get vertigo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do have you seen the fucking commercials</v>

3128
02:27:38.831 --> 02:27:42.250

<v Speaker 3>Do something x than Walmart,</v>

3129
02:27:42.270 --> 02:27:45.400
<v Speaker 3>like people cyborgs and it's a new video</v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

3130
02:27:45.401 --> 02:27:46.540
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's an insane.</v>

3132
02:27:48.370 --> 02:27:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Those x x think that's how you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3133
02:27:51.571 --> 02:27:54.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a really old game man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is uh,</v>

3134
02:27:54.900 --> 02:27:59.900
<v Speaker 1>the newest version of this really old </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept that was like a really wicked </v>

3135
02:27:59.900 --> 02:28:04.611
<v Speaker 1>game if I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was made by the same guys that made </v>

3136
02:28:04.611 --> 02:28:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Dika Catana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like this faction of ids </v>

3137
02:28:08.210 --> 02:28:09.480
<v Speaker 1>software that broke off and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>this character,</v>

3138
02:28:09.481 --> 02:28:11.870
<v Speaker 1>I think his name is Romero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

3139
02:28:11.900 --> 02:28:15.240
<v Speaker 1>he started this company and they made </v>
<v Speaker 1>two games.</v>

3140
02:28:15.241 --> 02:28:20.241
<v Speaker 1>One of them had all this hype behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was called dikw autonomy and I </v>

3141
02:28:20.241 --> 02:28:20.241
<v Speaker 1>thought it was pretty bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

3142
02:28:20.241 --> 02:28:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Like death match style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like a quake.</v>

3143
02:28:22.341 --> 02:28:27.341
<v Speaker 1>One Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was with quake from the very </v>

3144
02:28:27.341 --> 02:28:29.321
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this other game they made this dose </v>

3145
02:28:29.321 --> 02:28:31.751
<v Speaker 1>xx.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it's the same company </v>

3146
02:28:31.751 --> 02:28:31.751
<v Speaker 1>and this game was apparently awakened</v>

3147
02:28:31.751 --> 02:28:35.510
<v Speaker 3>dude fucking commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the commercial with the </v>

3148
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.880
<v Speaker 3>cyborgs begging?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they are,</v>

3149
02:28:35.890 --> 02:28:37.540
<v Speaker 3>they're on this drug that you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>honoring.</v>

3150
02:28:37.570 --> 02:28:42.570
<v Speaker 3>Your body rejects the cybernetic part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's all these people with like </v>

3151
02:28:42.570 --> 02:28:46.371
<v Speaker 3>Cyborg arms are like hookers with Cyborg</v>
<v Speaker 3>legs begging because they have to pay </v>

3152
02:28:46.371 --> 02:28:49.050
<v Speaker 3>for this medicine that you have to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep the,</v>

3153
02:28:49.590 --> 02:28:54.590
<v Speaker 3>keep your excel falive and it's got its.</v>

<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This seems like just pure Cgi,</v>

3155
02:28:57.301 --> 02:28:59.340
<v Speaker 3>like movie making.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know what the game plan.</v>

3156
02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Is this a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it an xbox game or a PC game?</v>

3157

3160
02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:20.561
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they also ported it over to </v>

3161
02:29:20.561 --> 02:29:20.561
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a couple of years ago.</v>

3162
02:29:20.561 --> 02:29:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a long one.</v>

3163
02:29:20.860 --> 02:29:23.900
<v Speaker 1>It's coming out this month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one came out a long time ago.</v>

3164
02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:29.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be confused with linking it up </v>

3165
02:29:29.080 --> 02:29:29.080
<v Speaker 1>with the people from China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

3166
02:29:29.080 --> 02:29:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Uber nerds and Geeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I've steered you wrong.</v>

3167
02:29:31.130 --> 02:29:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember dying autonomy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3168
02:29:32.890 --> 02:29:34.640
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fun.</v>

3169
02:29:34.641 --> 02:29:39.641
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It disappointing to a lot of people </v>

3170
02:29:39.641 --> 02:29:39.980
<v Speaker 1>because they thought that it was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a derivative,</v>

3171
02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:41.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of the games that existed,</v>

3172
02:29:41.571 --> 02:29:42.980
<v Speaker 1>but to me it was pretty fucking fun.</v>

3173
02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Especially the death match was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

3174
02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:49.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't need any other game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then starcraft you don't like like fast </v>

3178
02:29:58.170 --> 02:29:59.480
<v Speaker 1>They got a little defensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3179
02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:04.600
<v Speaker 1>He did that game like starcraft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's fast twitch minute,</v>

3180

<v Speaker 1>Two total dork was well for one playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

3182
02:30:12.321 --> 02:30:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Playing starcraft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two is like they think I'm in.</v>

3183
02:30:14.300 --> 02:30:16.370
<v Speaker 1>How much are you playing starcraft?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>

3184
02:30:16.610 --> 02:30:17.960
<v Speaker 1>How often that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As much as a Korean,</v>

3185
02:30:17.961 --> 02:30:19.690
<v Speaker 1>but not as much as the Chinaman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

3186
02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:23.450
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

3187
02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:25.320
<v Speaker 1>three games a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three days.</v>

3188
02:30:25.321 --> 02:30:26.900
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people right now saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's racist,</v>

3189
02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:28.490
<v Speaker 1>but he's meanwhile ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen,</v>

3190
02:30:28.491 --> 02:30:31.190
<v Speaker 1>listen to the context of using him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying it's awesome.</v>

3191
02:30:31.640 --> 02:30:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saying it's awesome.</v>

3192
02:30:33.050 --> 02:30:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's be honest.</v>

3193
02:30:34.400 --> 02:30:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Asians love that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

3194
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.860
<v Speaker 1>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3195
02:30:36.861 --> 02:30:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Koreans love that game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3196
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Don't they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

3197
02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:43.490
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about the other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the first time</v>

3198
02:30:43.940 --> 02:30:46.700
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I've been able to watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>something akin to sports,</v>

3199
02:30:47.450 --> 02:30:52.450
<v Speaker 3>really get excited about it because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>just had this big tournament and they </v>

3200
02:30:52.450 --> 02:30:55.811
<v Speaker 3>have like famous players and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really cool to watch these two famous </v>

3201
02:30:55.811 --> 02:30:55.811
<v Speaker 3>players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3202
02:30:55.811 --> 02:30:57.290
<v Speaker 3>compete against each other and knowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the game,</v>

3203
02:30:57.320 --> 02:31:00.800
<v Speaker 3>having played it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing the crazy tricks they're using in</v>

3204
02:31:00.801 --> 02:31:04.970
<v Speaker 3>the crazy control they have over so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>variables.</v>

3205
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:10.150
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's so funny because I was </v>

3206
02:31:10.150 --> 02:31:10.670
<v Speaker 3>thinking like athletes of the future are</v>
<v Speaker 3>all going to be fat,</v>

3207
02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:15.700
<v Speaker 3>fat and Pale because like they cut to </v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys who just played this insane </v>

3208
02:31:15.700 --> 02:31:18.950
<v Speaker 3>game that's like required so much brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>power to control this.</v>

3209
02:31:19.650 --> 02:31:23.340
<v Speaker 3>And since all they do is play computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of emotionless.</v>

3210
02:31:23.580 --> 02:31:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Like you cut to like a UFC fighter after</v>
<v Speaker 3>each is knock someone out and it's like </v>

3211
02:31:28.801 --> 02:31:32.310
<v Speaker 3>watching Julius Caesar March into a city</v>
<v Speaker 3>that each is defeated.</v>

3212
02:31:32.310 --> 02:31:33.870
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're watching glory.</v>

3213
02:31:34.050 --> 02:31:38.760
<v Speaker 3>When you got cut to a starcraft two </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter player who's just won a game,</v>

3214
02:31:38.761 --> 02:31:43.110
<v Speaker 3>it just kind of like one of them took </v>
<v Speaker 3>his shirt off because underneath that he</v>

3215
02:31:43.111 --> 02:31:45.770
<v Speaker 3>was wearing a shirt that was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>insulting and he's like,</v>

3216
02:31:45.820 --> 02:31:50.820
<v Speaker 3>eh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then walked over and shook the guy's </v>

3217
02:31:50.820 --> 02:31:50.820
<v Speaker 3>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3218
02:31:50.820 --> 02:31:50.820
<v Speaker 3>good job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>

3219
02:31:50.970 --> 02:31:54.400
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile they just did this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing where they were controlled.</v>

3220
02:31:54.401 --> 02:31:56.830
<v Speaker 3>I've never played the game of watched </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best,</v>

3221
02:31:58.320 --> 02:32:03.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't understand what's happening so I </v>

3222
02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:03.320
<v Speaker 3>can appreciate it is the greatest game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3223
02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:05.010
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like Sim city in space.</v>

3224
02:32:05.430 --> 02:32:10.430
<v Speaker 3>It looks pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like you got to do a lot of </v>

3225
02:32:10.430 --> 02:32:13.551
<v Speaker 3>different things and you're moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>around a lot of different shit and </v>

3226
02:32:13.551 --> 02:32:13.551
<v Speaker 3>you're setting things up all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

3227
02:32:13.551 --> 02:32:18.380
<v Speaker 3>You're building the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're building up this economy by </v>

3228
02:32:18.380 --> 02:32:20.010
<v Speaker 3>gathering resources and while you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>building this economy,</v>

3229
02:32:20.250 --> 02:32:25.250
<v Speaker 3>you're also constructing an army that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to be based on what your opponent's </v>

3230
02:32:25.250 --> 02:32:25.290
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

3231
02:32:25.290 --> 02:32:28.410
<v Speaker 3>So you can't just do the same thing over</v>
<v Speaker 3>and over again.</v>

3232
02:32:28.411 --> 02:32:33.411
<v Speaker 3>You have to like scout what your </v>
<v Speaker 3>opponent's doing and from seeing what </v>

3233
02:32:33.411 --> 02:32:37.041
<v Speaker 3>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You understand what their strategy </v>

3234
02:32:37.041 --> 02:32:37.041
<v Speaker 3>probably is and then you have to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>create a perfect,</v>

3235
02:32:38.030 --> 02:32:43.030
<v Speaker 3>a perfect offense to what they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>while building a defense that works </v>

3236
02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:47.451
<v Speaker 3>against the type of troops they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructing because it might not </v>

3237
02:32:47.451 --> 02:32:50.271
<v Speaker 3>always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be completely reactive and </v>

3238
02:32:50.271 --> 02:32:51.420
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to do all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

3239
02:32:51.421 --> 02:32:54.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like juggling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're juggling all these crazy balls at</v>

3240
02:32:54.271 --> 02:32:59.271
<v Speaker 3>once and you have to be able to do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and also instantaneously react to shit </v>

3241
02:32:59.271 --> 02:33:03.921
<v Speaker 3>that you don't expect to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it crazy that the most satisfying </v>

3242
02:33:03.921 --> 02:33:06.540
<v Speaker 3>game is a virtual representative of war?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3243
02:33:07.020 --> 02:33:08.760
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much all our.</v>

3244
02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:10.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that amazing?</v>

3245
02:33:10.231 --> 02:33:15.231
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that battlefield earth call of duty </v>

3246
02:33:15.231 --> 02:33:15.231
<v Speaker 3>quake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mario Brothers,</v>

3247
02:33:15.231 --> 02:33:16.230
<v Speaker 3>unreal tournament.</v>

3248
02:33:16.670 --> 02:33:21.670
<v Speaker 3>The Mario or some sort of a futuristic </v>
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>

3249
02:33:22.380 --> 02:33:27.380
<v Speaker 3>ancient or either like world war two or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like the words fucking </v>

3250
02:33:27.541 --> 02:33:29.040
<v Speaker 3>futuristic something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3251
02:33:29.041 --> 02:33:34.041
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You read that book war by Sebastian </v>

3252
02:33:34.041 --> 02:33:35.610
<v Speaker 3>younger where there isn't a square.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does is he describes what that's like</v>

3253
02:33:35.611 --> 02:33:40.611
<v Speaker 3>to be behind a fucking machine gun </v>
<v Speaker 3>blasting people like he does this </v>

3254
02:33:40.611 --> 02:33:43.731
<v Speaker 3>incredible description of it and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>adrenaline that that creates is like </v>

3255
02:33:43.731 --> 02:33:48.560
<v Speaker 3>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you something else that </v>

3256
02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:51.111
<v Speaker 3>creates adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I do attend pool rush into my </v>

3257
02:33:51.111 --> 02:33:55.071
<v Speaker 3>opponent's face and my fucking speed </v>
<v Speaker 3>links in circle is base and devour it.</v>

3258
02:33:55.790 --> 02:34:00.790
<v Speaker 3>Only she and then he has the audacity to</v>
<v Speaker 3>text me and say that I was doing cheese </v>

3259
02:34:01.561 --> 02:34:04.170
<v Speaker 3>moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the greatest feeling ever.</v>

3260
02:34:04.230 --> 02:34:07.800
<v Speaker 3>I see it and believe it and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I got into it,</v>

3261
02:34:07.801 --> 02:34:12.801
<v Speaker 3>I'd fucking love it too much and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would go there.</v>

3262
02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Now I got a deleted it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm deleting it tomorrow.</v>

3263
02:34:15.571 --> 02:34:17.710
<v Speaker 3>I think pool for me is a form of</v>

3264
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:20.140
<v Speaker 5>like a moving meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I'm running out,</v>

3265
02:34:20.141 --> 02:34:21.100
<v Speaker 5>when I played pool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

3266
02:34:21.101 --> 02:34:24.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm using my body as well and that's one</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the things that I like about the most</v>

3267
02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:29.700
<v Speaker 5>that I'm forcing my mind to control the </v>
<v Speaker 5>exact amount of forest my body exerts on</v>

3268
02:34:30.521 --> 02:34:35.080
<v Speaker 5>a piece of wood that impacts a ball that</v>
<v Speaker 5>collides and into another ball and moves</v>

3269
02:34:35.081 --> 02:34:36.430
<v Speaker 5>around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In order to do it right,</v>

3270
02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:41.640
<v Speaker 5>I have to be in total tune with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of revolutions and causing this </v>

3271
02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:45.991
<v Speaker 5>ball to turn over a nine foot table.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what I'm trying to </v>

3272
02:34:45.991 --> 02:34:49.381
<v Speaker 5>control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So to get like into that like real </v>

3273
02:34:49.381 --> 02:34:52.390
<v Speaker 5>groove of being like dead stroke where </v>
<v Speaker 5>you really feel the movement.</v>

3274
02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:57.600
<v Speaker 5>It really is like a form of meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's why I prefer it over video </v>

3275
02:34:57.600 --> 02:34:58.630
<v Speaker 5>games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had to pick my poison,</v>

3276
02:34:58.810 --> 02:35:03.810
<v Speaker 5>I had to pick like what thing am I </v>
<v Speaker 5>allowing myself to be addicted to and </v>

3277
02:35:03.810 --> 02:35:06.400
<v Speaker 5>that I think I get more out of the pool </v>
<v Speaker 5>than I did out of the video games.</v>

3278
02:35:06.401 --> 02:35:11.401
<v Speaker 5>The Video Games was fun as fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love him to this day but I can't play </v>

3279
02:35:11.401 --> 02:35:11.401
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

3280
02:35:11.401 --> 02:35:14.920
<v Speaker 4>We played any of the connect games like </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a game right now called child of</v>

3281
02:35:14.921 --> 02:35:17.620
<v Speaker 4>Eden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you fucking smoke some good weed or</v>

3282
02:35:17.621 --> 02:35:19.690
<v Speaker 4>take some shrooms and stand in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that game?</v>

3283
02:35:19.691 --> 02:35:21.850
<v Speaker 4>You will fucking feel like you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>virtual.</v>

3284
02:35:21.860 --> 02:35:24.740
<v Speaker 5>If I'm alone at home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll fire up gears a war for a goof.</v>

3285
02:35:24.741 --> 02:35:27.490
<v Speaker 5>Just go on a fucking rampage because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fun because it's just.</v>

3286
02:35:27.491 --> 02:35:30.710
<v Speaker 5>The graphics are so dope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so wild.</v>

3287
02:35:30.711 --> 02:35:32.570
<v Speaker 5>Seeing these fucking monsters they've </v>
<v Speaker 5>created.</v>

3288
02:35:32.571 --> 02:35:34.130
<v Speaker 5>I'll do that for fun on the big screen,</v>

3289
02:35:34.130 --> 02:35:35.930
<v Speaker 3>but yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to moderate it.</v>

3290
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:40.990
<v Speaker 3>That's a province so fucking addictive </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's so easy to lose your mind to </v>

3291
02:35:40.990 --> 02:35:41.380
<v Speaker 3>get lost in it</v>

3292
02:35:41.570 --> 02:35:46.570
<v Speaker 5>really just lost,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yet it's so fucking fun.</v>

3293
02:35:47.850 --> 02:35:51.150
<v Speaker 5>And what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's to say that that fund is less real</v>

3294
02:35:51.210 --> 02:35:54.620
<v Speaker 5>than the fun that you get actually out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there playing basketball then?</v>

3295
02:35:54.621 --> 02:35:55.830
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll say it.</v>

3296
02:35:56.940 --> 02:35:57.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me too.</v>

3297
02:35:57.301 --> 02:35:59.220
<v Speaker 5>I think it's less real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but why?</v>

3298
02:35:59.221 --> 02:36:01.970
<v Speaker 5>What if you're in tune and dominating </v>
<v Speaker 5>you?</v>

3299
02:36:02.130 --> 02:36:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3300
02:36:03.030 --> 02:36:08.030
<v Speaker 3>Because when I get done with an </v>
<v Speaker 3>addictive session of world of warcraft </v>

3301
02:36:08.030 --> 02:36:08.850
<v Speaker 3>and I've been playing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I'm sorry,</v>

3302
02:36:09.300 --> 02:36:12.260
<v Speaker 3>I used to be addicted to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You started to starcraft two.</v>

3303
02:36:12.660 --> 02:36:17.660
<v Speaker 3>When I get up after playing that game </v>
<v Speaker 3>for like three or four hours straight </v>

3304
02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:22.880
<v Speaker 3>and walk outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I feel like I'm like a </v>

3305
02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:26.320
<v Speaker 3>mentally disabled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel drained.</v>

3306
02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:28.890
<v Speaker 3>My sleep sucks when I fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3307
02:36:28.970 --> 02:36:33.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the gym or go jogging or do </v>

3308
02:36:33.970 --> 02:36:33.970
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel great for the rest of the day.</v>

3309
02:36:33.970 --> 02:36:38.010
<v Speaker 3>So video games are amazing and weirdly </v>
<v Speaker 3>games that involve strategy,</v>

3310
02:36:38.011 --> 02:36:43.011
<v Speaker 3>I think you can extrapolate some </v>
<v Speaker 3>information from that that you can use </v>

3311
02:36:43.011 --> 02:36:46.071
<v Speaker 3>in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you got to do it in very small </v>

3312
02:36:46.071 --> 02:36:46.071
<v Speaker 3>doses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that.</v>

3313
02:36:46.071 --> 02:36:47.580
<v Speaker 3>That seems like the responsibility of </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>

3314
02:36:47.790 --> 02:36:52.790
<v Speaker 3>We've got this incredible brand new </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology that's exploding in front of </v>

3315
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:54.360
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The discipline is not to reject it.</v>

3316
02:36:54.361 --> 02:36:56.580
<v Speaker 3>Totally like those assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you hear,</v>

3317
02:36:56.610 --> 02:37:00.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't even have cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not to reject it.</v>

3318
02:37:00.240 --> 02:37:02.460
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that moderate at learn how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to use it,</v>

3319
02:37:02.461 --> 02:37:03.780
<v Speaker 3>like a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you do it?</v>

3320
02:37:03.781 --> 02:37:04.220
<v Speaker 3>That's what every.</v>

3321
02:37:04.310 --> 02:37:05.750
<v Speaker 4>It's like when I said I was addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3322
02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:08.150
<v Speaker 4>city of heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to always fantasize about jumping</v>

3323
02:37:08.151 --> 02:37:13.151
<v Speaker 4>on from building the building just </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I had been playing that video </v>

3324
02:37:13.151 --> 02:37:13.250
<v Speaker 4>game so much and that was something I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was doing repetitively</v>

3325
02:37:13.710 --> 02:37:15.590
<v Speaker 3>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all night.</v>

3326
02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:16.070
<v Speaker 3>If you</v>

3327
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:19.370
<v Speaker 1>dropped me off in the middle of a castle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they look like the scenes from quake</v>

3328
02:37:19.371 --> 02:37:24.371
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might start pretending I started </v>

3329
02:37:25.490 --> 02:37:30.490
<v Speaker 1>talking like one of those quick cuts </v>
<v Speaker 1>running down hallways with rocket </v>

3330
02:37:30.741 --> 02:37:34.130
<v Speaker 1>launchers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking as usual.</v>

3331
02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the best.</v>

3332
02:37:36.550 --> 02:37:39.020
<v Speaker 1>You're the best man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are those too much fun.</v>

3333
02:37:39.380 --> 02:37:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Too Much to interesting and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy all the taped phone conversations </v>

3334
02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:48.430
<v Speaker 1>that the FBI will be tuning into myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ideas here,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3357
02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:52.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll be at the house of Blues and New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orleans and this,</v>

3358
02:38:52.100 --> 02:38:54.740
<v Speaker 1>some of the get there early because some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are gonna have to stand up.</v>

3359
02:38:54.741 --> 02:38:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately there was no other way I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could get a show there.</v>

3360
02:38:57.660 --> 02:39:00.670
<v Speaker 1>There's another place you not get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup states you will hate.</v>

3361
02:39:00.671 --> 02:39:02.140
<v Speaker 1>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sucks standing out.</v>

3362
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:03.880
<v Speaker 1>But I'll try to be as energetic as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

3363
02:39:03.881 --> 02:39:08.881
<v Speaker 1>And I instituted a policy when Brian and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to see doug stanhope when we </v>

3364
02:39:08.881 --> 02:39:10.310
<v Speaker 1>enjoyed the fuck out of Stan hope as </v>
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>

3365
02:39:10.311 --> 02:39:12.680
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't fun to stand and watch a </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

3366
02:39:12.890 --> 02:39:13.730
<v Speaker 1>So I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3367
02:39:13.731 --> 02:39:16.460
<v Speaker 1>what I'm being brewed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking people stand and watch my shows.</v>

3368
02:39:16.461 --> 02:39:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Like from now on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make sure that every show I</v>

3369
02:39:18.621 --> 02:39:20.180
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are seated,</v>

3370
02:39:20.510 --> 02:39:22.640
<v Speaker 1>but there was no places in town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing I could do.</v>

3371
02:39:22.641 --> 02:39:26.360
<v Speaker 1>There was like small places that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 50 seats or um,</v>

3372
02:39:26.420 --> 02:39:27.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the House of Blues.</v>
