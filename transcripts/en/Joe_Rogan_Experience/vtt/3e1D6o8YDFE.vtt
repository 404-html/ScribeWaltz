1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.910
<v Speaker 1>The general good experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I went,</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I went to like a day of media training</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a.</v>

3
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.430
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did and it was the worst part was I've</v>

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>done interviews and I've been fine</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>but I got this guy sitting across from</v>
<v Speaker 1>me who's,</v>

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>who's interviewing me doing this mock</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview and then I've got the</v>

7
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>publicist and my writing partner and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just staring at me and that will</v>

8
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:26.340
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>

9
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the pressures there.</v>

10
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Who's teaching you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's teaching this training?</v>

11
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Here's where they right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

12
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>you kind of suck at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

13
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

14
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>they were really nice about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

15
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's some,</v>

16
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>there's some room for improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

17
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

18
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the worst.</v>

19
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 1>It will seem like a natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's what is there to teach</v>

20
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:48.640
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what?</v>

21
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Well this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing that I'm really</v>

22
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:51.760
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

23
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with us just hanging out here talking.</v>

24
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is what I do is I yammer when</v>

25
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm nervous talker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you asked me a question if I'm</v>

26
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of go and go and go and</v>

27
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez</v>

28
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.460
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy talk man.</v>

29
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>So the thing is I got this guy sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>across me,</v>

30
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>really nice guy and he's The guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>coaching me,</v>

31
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>but I know I'm going to give you like</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake interviews.</v>

32
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Well he probably quote you first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave me.</v>

33
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>He gave me a lot of really good insights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the funny thing is every rule that</v>

34
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>he's saying as he's saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

35
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.743
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do that.</v>

36
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything he's saying that I</v>

37
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

38
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

39
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I always do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is he saying you shouldn't be</v>

40
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that the main thing,</v>

41
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda like what we were getting at</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that when somebody setting a trap</v>

42
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because so much of right now media</v>

43
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>training is just about don't go out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get yourself into trouble by going in</v>

44
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>and just talking about some ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>area that.</v>

45
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody's trying to do</v>

46
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:51.720
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just as a.</v>

47
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a Time magazine interview about</v>

48
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>adoption about a year before we even</v>
<v Speaker 1>made the movie.</v>

49
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.913
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>And it was just because I was in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process of working on the movie and</v>

51
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the whole thing was just about</v>

52
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 1>adoption and my family and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was right when the Harvey</v>

53
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein stuff was blowing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ladies,</v>

54
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>really nice interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end she says,</v>

55
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:14.191
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

56
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since I'm talking to a Hollywood</v>

57
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be remiss if I didn't ask did you</v>

58
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>know about that Harvey Weinstein stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

59
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think about my answer</v>

60
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know the guy was never around</v>

61
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of like more like fancy</v>

62
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

63
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I don't.</v>

64
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never met the guy,</v>

65
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think anything of it.</v>

66
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>I got off the phone and then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

67
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>she didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about this stuff?</v>

68
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you know about that stuff?</v>

69
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>And it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I knew,</v>

70
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>but I kept it a secret for those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just thought right away,</v>

71
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the limiting factor was just like I was</v>

72
00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:52.940
<v Speaker 2>just getting bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't actually breathing when we're</v>

73
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.730
<v Speaker 2>thinking of this is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

74
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.890
<v Speaker 2>you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at any given time,</v>

75
00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 2>any time you had to think of something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was going to be more powerful than</v>

76
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 2>the thought of stopping or fatigue or</v>
<v Speaker 2>clc get deeper into your skin.</v>

77
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 2>And so sometimes it was really easy</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you were swimming with dolphins,</v>

78
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 2>minky whales as one with the basking</v>
<v Speaker 2>shark.</v>

79
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:16.290
<v Speaker 2>Did they come over to you going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this dude?</v>

80
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

81
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:18.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

82
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.010
<v Speaker 2>there was a video of that ages ago with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

83
00:03:20.011 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the minky well,</v>

84
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was filming 12 hours cross the Bristol</v>

85
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 2>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's kind of England to Wales.</v>

86
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>

87
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.340
<v Speaker 2>this was without doubt for all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardship that I've spoke about.</v>

88
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say there were some</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing moments.</v>

89
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:34.110
<v Speaker 2>This one particular moment swimming</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the,</v>

90
00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bristol Channel and all of a sudden</v>

91
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:36.791
<v Speaker 2>minky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

92
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 2>kind of about big as this table breaches</v>
<v Speaker 2>right next to me.</v>

93
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:40.594
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

94
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 2>because I tend to map the captain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

95
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I safe?</v>

96
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

97
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.541
<v Speaker 2>Should I get out the door?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

98
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:46.681
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

99
00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

100
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

101
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:49.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's a monkey wildlife that the</v>

102
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.441
<v Speaker 2>find the friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

103
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:51.274
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>

104
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 2>So I keep swimming and then for the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>five miles,</v>

105
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:56.760
<v Speaker 2>the minky whales circling me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was breaching over the top.</v>

106
00:03:56.761 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 2>It was coming under me and swimming like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

107
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.700
<v Speaker 2>I tend to mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said like,</v>

108
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 2>now what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

109
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been sailing like 40 years.</v>

110
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen this.</v>

111
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I think is happening is I think</v>

112
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:11.700
<v Speaker 2>it's a female and I try to fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

113
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.640
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not mating season.</v>

114
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.151
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

115
00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:15.380
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

116
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.811
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

117
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:16.391
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

118
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:21.170
<v Speaker 2>what are these for later?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have it here.</v>

119
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him for four months in the</v>

120
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fuck mating seasons</v>

121
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 2>probably right around the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

122
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 2>if he sticks around to move on.</v>

123
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a concern of mine.</v>

124
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:38.100
<v Speaker 2>That was a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

125
00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:39.420
<v Speaker 2>And it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

126
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.081
<v Speaker 2>Matt said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

127
00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

128
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.210
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a few more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that she thinks that you're an</v>

129
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:48.211
<v Speaker 2>injured seal and so for the next five</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles she basically guided me all the</v>

130
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 2>way to the shallower water and as I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

131
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 2>it was literally the debt for the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt said,</v>

132
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

133
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Much shallower water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we turned whale breached one more</v>

134
00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 2>time and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then swam off as if to say,</v>

135
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're safe now.</v>

136
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.920
<v Speaker 3>Well why is there so much pushback</v>
<v Speaker 3>against this thing?</v>

137
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Is that I think what's going on as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>people worry that it doesn't look like a</v>

138
00:05:08.101 --> 00:05:10.660
<v Speaker 3>problem to be solved anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you.</v>

139
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.960
<v Speaker 3>When our kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we both have lots of gay friends,</v>

140
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.510
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't know it because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not telling anybody because someone's</v>

141
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:17.490
<v Speaker 3>going to kick their ass if they knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were gay.</v>

142
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.190
<v Speaker 3>Gay people are still discriminated</v>
<v Speaker 3>against,</v>

143
00:05:20.191 --> 00:05:21.960
<v Speaker 3>but it's so much better than it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then.</v>

144
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.480
<v Speaker 3>What you don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I think people are advocates don't</v>

145
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:24.961
<v Speaker 3>want to say is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

146
00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:29.010
<v Speaker 3>there's no problem anymore because then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can allow them to still run into</v>

147
00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:31.620
<v Speaker 3>troubles in various circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though the trouble they run into</v>

148
00:05:31.621 --> 00:05:35.760
<v Speaker 3>today is a thousand times less than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble they ran two and little same</v>

149
00:05:35.761 --> 00:05:38.160
<v Speaker 3>thing holds for racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing holds for sexism.</v>

150
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.690
<v Speaker 3>They've all gotten so much better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but and sexual violence is a perfect</v>

151
00:05:42.691 --> 00:05:43.320
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>

152
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.620
<v Speaker 3>If you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you set,</v>

153
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.840
<v Speaker 3>this isn't pinker's book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you set rape and homicide to you call</v>

154
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:51.450
<v Speaker 3>it both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever level they are in 1970 to 100</v>

155
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.030
<v Speaker 3>and then you track them through to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>early two thousands.</v>

156
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Homicide is in the U.</v>
<v Speaker 3>S homicides dropped to like 50 raves</v>

157
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 3>dropped down to like 25,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you listen to women's advocacy</v>

158
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 3>groups about campus sexual assault and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

159
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:07.440
<v Speaker 3>you'd never know that and the reason you</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't know it is because they.</v>

160
00:06:07.441 --> 00:06:08.600
<v Speaker 3>People worry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

161
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 3>if you think the problem's getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>better on sound,</v>

162
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 3>then you will keep doing anything to</v>
<v Speaker 3>help fix it.</v>

163
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 3>And that's a really unfortunate part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our psychology because it makes people</v>

164
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 3>feel like there's been no progress and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you feel like there's no progress,</v>

165
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 3>then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe we need to completely</v>

166
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:23.120
<v Speaker 3>overturn the whole system and try</v>
<v Speaker 3>something new.</v>

167
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 3>And that's of course the point of</v>
<v Speaker 3>pinker's newest book,</v>

168
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 3>enlightened men now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No things are going freaking great.</v>

169
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Turn it anarchy and all those things are</v>
<v Speaker 3>really bad ideas.</v>

170
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 3>Voting for somebody like trump's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>really bad idea because things are</v>

171
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 3>actually running along really nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that we tend to forget it</v>

172
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 3>because every advocacy group who's all</v>
<v Speaker 3>worried about whatever their particular</v>

173
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:43.210
<v Speaker 3>issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want the word to get out that</v>

174
00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 3>things are a lot better than they used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be because I think at some</v>

175
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 3>fundamental level they think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

176
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.310
<v Speaker 3>25 reps here isn't bad enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We better say that there's 100 or you</v>

177
00:06:50.311 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying they do this consciously,</v>

178
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 3>but of course 25 reps here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the number is,</v>

179
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 3>is bad enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

180
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:58.040
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be the numbers that</v>

181
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 3>it used to be when I was a child to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem at all.</v>

182
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 3>It has to be as a number above zero</v>

183
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.790
<v Speaker 4>for my whole apprenticeship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alcohol was a reward.</v>

184
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.910
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did a good job tonight.</v>

185
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.230
<v Speaker 4>Drink,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

186
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 4>Then it went from a reward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do.</v>

187
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was like a blood bath in the</v>

188
00:07:16.741 --> 00:07:17.551
<v Speaker 4>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

189
00:07:17.551 --> 00:07:19.890
<v Speaker 4>we had to pick up this guy at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hospital.</v>

190
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.330
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not every word.</v>

191
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.070
<v Speaker 4>Let's forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's drink,</v>

192
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.620
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>

193
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.540
<v Speaker 4>it was always there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

194
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.680
<v Speaker 4>it's great service.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's have a drink in the food industry,</v>

195
00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:34.410
<v Speaker 4>but you're also in the wine industry</v>
<v Speaker 4>because 50 percent of what you're doing</v>

196
00:07:34.411 --> 00:07:37.020
<v Speaker 4>is selling food to people and the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 percent of what you're doing is</v>

197
00:07:37.021 --> 00:07:40.500
<v Speaker 4>selling alcohol at the people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so by default you're part of the people</v>

198
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 4>that sell a liquid drug dealer in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in that world every day and you</v>

199
00:07:47.041 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 4>go to wine tastings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd talk with peoples that sell the</v>

200
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:50.430
<v Speaker 4>alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alcoholic bartenders.</v>

201
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 4>You talked to people that sell wine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you or partake in eating and other your</v>

202
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.190
<v Speaker 4>colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurants and drinking wine.</v>

203
00:07:56.191 --> 00:07:58.120
<v Speaker 4>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a little bit of celebrity.</v>

204
00:07:58.121 --> 00:08:03.121
<v Speaker 4>You've been open for 15 years and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>look back and you go to seven days in a</v>

205
00:08:04.411 --> 00:08:09.411
<v Speaker 4>week or seven days in a week and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I drank six of them.</v>

206
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.710
<v Speaker 4>I'll feel good on Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just kind of recovering.</v>

207
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.040
<v Speaker 4>And then what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens is one week turns into two</v>

208
00:08:17.041 --> 00:08:22.041
<v Speaker 4>to four and then you kind of look back</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you realize in 2017 that you may</v>

209
00:08:22.651 --> 00:08:27.651
<v Speaker 4>have drank 48 weeks out of 52,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

210
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.540
<v Speaker 4>and then it goes quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it's 10 years and your tenure</v>

211
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 4>restaurant and you've been drinking five</v>
<v Speaker 4>days out of the week for 10 years and</v>

212
00:08:40.981 --> 00:08:42.480
<v Speaker 4>then all of a sudden you kind of have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

213
00:08:42.481 --> 00:08:47.481
<v Speaker 4>You realize that like my day to day is</v>
<v Speaker 4>based on food and wine.</v>

214
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.010
<v Speaker 4>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want my,</v>

215
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.800
<v Speaker 4>it's not making me happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had all the wines have had all the</v>

216
00:08:52.801 --> 00:08:54.960
<v Speaker 4>foods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

217
00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 4>am I better for it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>

218
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 4>What am I better for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Restriction eating less.</v>

219
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 4>Eating clean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

220
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.830
<v Speaker 4>drinking only on very special occasions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you still drink on special?</v>

221
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm completely sober.</v>

222
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:07.750
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

223
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.300
<v Speaker 5>you see them and I've even seen them</v>
<v Speaker 5>switched teams and you see them switch</v>

224
00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:14.500
<v Speaker 5>teams and I don't buy the</v>
<v Speaker 5>rationalizations when it comes to</v>

225
00:09:14.501 --> 00:09:16.240
<v Speaker 5>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think is what they're doing is</v>

226
00:09:16.241 --> 00:09:19.870
<v Speaker 5>they're switching teams because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>realize there's an end on this team and</v>

227
00:09:19.871 --> 00:09:21.760
<v Speaker 5>they could just say this is the problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the team.</v>

228
00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:24.130
<v Speaker 5>I used to be on those fucking losers and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

229
00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:25.950
<v Speaker 5>they're really benedict arnold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

230
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.220
<v Speaker 5>Like like they probably have as much of</v>
<v Speaker 5>an affinity to the ideas of one side is</v>

231
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:34.900
<v Speaker 5>a do the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just go all in on one side to get</v>

232
00:09:34.901 --> 00:09:37.150
<v Speaker 5>acceptance from the group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just no way.</v>

233
00:09:37.151 --> 00:09:40.480
<v Speaker 5>People change their opinion that much</v>
<v Speaker 5>over two years or something like that.</v>

234
00:09:40.481 --> 00:09:42.940
<v Speaker 5>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like they just decide this group</v>

235
00:09:42.941 --> 00:09:46.090
<v Speaker 5>makes more sense now and I've been</v>
<v Speaker 5>attacked by people on the left so I'm</v>

236
00:09:46.091 --> 00:09:47.560
<v Speaker 5>going to go to the right or vice verse.</v>

237
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.950
<v Speaker 5>And usually what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is even when they say they've been</v>

238
00:09:50.951 --> 00:09:51.521
<v Speaker 5>attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

239
00:09:51.521 --> 00:09:55.420
<v Speaker 5>oh you fucking baby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's 300 million people just in this</v>

240
00:09:55.421 --> 00:09:58.480
<v Speaker 5>country alone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you put something out there publicly</v>

241
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.240
<v Speaker 5>and a thousand people attack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't act like you're being</v>

242
00:10:01.241 --> 00:10:02.200
<v Speaker 5>persecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

243
00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:03.580
<v Speaker 5>You have an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've,</v>

244
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.400
<v Speaker 5>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've launched that idea out into the</v>

245
00:10:06.401 --> 00:10:08.710
<v Speaker 5>Zeit geist and people took a big shit on</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

246
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.510
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's people on the right are</v>

247
00:10:10.511 --> 00:10:12.400
<v Speaker 5>people on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to be able to argue your</v>

248
00:10:12.401 --> 00:10:16.300
<v Speaker 5>point one way or the other and not just</v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately jumped ship when someone who</v>

249
00:10:16.301 --> 00:10:21.301
<v Speaker 5>shares ideas with you decides that your</v>
<v Speaker 5>idea sucks and maybe they're wrong and</v>

250
00:10:21.551 --> 00:10:24.160
<v Speaker 5>maybe you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you've got to argue that through,</v>

251
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:29.250
<v Speaker 5>but this idea of these partisan patterns</v>
<v Speaker 5>that people just seem to automatically</v>

252
00:10:30.251 --> 00:10:33.430
<v Speaker 5>fall into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so detrimental to dialogue</v>

253
00:10:33.431 --> 00:10:35.230
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so detrimental to us and really</v>

254
00:10:35.231 --> 00:10:38.650
<v Speaker 5>understanding each other and really</v>
<v Speaker 5>having some sort of a sense of</v>

255
00:10:38.651 --> 00:10:39.280
<v Speaker 5>community.</v>

256
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.130
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a giant community of 300 million</v>

257
00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:44.170
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it's supposed to be and this</v>

258
00:10:44.171 --> 00:10:47.530
<v Speaker 5>idea that it's this group is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck it up and they're trying to turn us</v>

259
00:10:47.531 --> 00:10:51.340
<v Speaker 5>all Muslims and this one wants everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be gay and this one wants everybody</v>

260
00:10:51.341 --> 00:10:54.460
<v Speaker 5>to have free food and this and this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is nonsense.</v>

261
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.170
<v Speaker 5>This is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need better understanding and,</v>

262
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.060
<v Speaker 5>and you know the word better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Education gets tossed around a lot,</v>

263
00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.730
<v Speaker 5>but it also means better social</v>
<v Speaker 5>understanding,</v>

264
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.020
<v Speaker 5>better social education,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like got an appreciation of who we are</v>

265
00:11:08.021 --> 00:11:12.760
<v Speaker 5>and why we think the way we think and</v>
<v Speaker 5>calling out weasels on both sides of the</v>

266
00:11:12.761 --> 00:11:15.760
<v Speaker 5>pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like calling out weasels on the right</v>

267
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.930
<v Speaker 5>that are pandering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are just trying to like get the</v>

268
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.240
<v Speaker 5>repeating a lot of these like accepted</v>
<v Speaker 5>beliefs because they know that they can</v>

269
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.990
<v Speaker 5>hit this frequency and a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>sing along or the same thing that other</v>

270
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.780
<v Speaker 5>people are doing on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're doing it on both sides.</v>

271
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.960
<v Speaker 5>I think most reasonable people have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>collection of ideas that they share from</v>

272
00:11:34.211 --> 00:11:38.500
<v Speaker 5>both the right and the left and most</v>
<v Speaker 5>reasonable people are reasonably</v>

273
00:11:38.501 --> 00:11:41.830
<v Speaker 5>compassionate and I think that's one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the things that we're missing.</v>

274
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.800
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

275
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:47.700
<v Speaker 4>most places they have them and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>managed and you go out and buy the small</v>

276
00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:50.580
<v Speaker 4>game license for 12 bucks or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get your hunter safety,</v>

277
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:56.030
<v Speaker 4>get yourself a 22 or a shotgun and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can become a squirrel man or a squirrel</v>

278
00:11:56.681 --> 00:12:00.850
<v Speaker 4>lady like your Buddy Kevin Murphy list.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of my favorite guys on your podcast.</v>

279
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 4>He's a squirrel man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy blows a horn in the woods</v>

280
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 4>before every hunt to alert the animals</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's coming.</v>

281
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You blow up?</v>

282
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He carries a cow horn around.</v>

283
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.710
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

284
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:16.300
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in,</v>

285
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a show far.</v>

286
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.420
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that right for you when you blow the</v>

287
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 4>Shofar and like a Jewish synagogue?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

288
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called a show far like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've blown the rams.</v>

289
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 4>They blow a Ram's horn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

290
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.130
<v Speaker 4>it's not a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

291
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.560
<v Speaker 4>It's not a cow harm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ran her near the end of,</v>

292
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:34.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

293
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:36.600
<v Speaker 4>in the end have no country for old men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

294
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.940
<v Speaker 4>Have we talked about this before?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He talks about his father riding out</v>

295
00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:47.790
<v Speaker 4>ahead of him with a Horn of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the end when you get,</v>

296
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.080
<v Speaker 4>he relates the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in the book and it's in the movie</v>

297
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.590
<v Speaker 4>for the Tommy Lee Jones characters</v>
<v Speaker 4>describing a dream in which they're</v>

298
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:57.100
<v Speaker 4>riding through a snowstorm and his</v>
<v Speaker 4>father rides ahead with a Horn of fire.</v>

299
00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.460
<v Speaker 4>And I was wondering how many people</v>
<v Speaker 4>heard that and had no idea what he was</v>

300
00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:06.040
<v Speaker 4>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what a common practice used to be as</v>

301
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:09.100
<v Speaker 4>you take a horn buffalo horn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cow horn,</v>

302
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 4>and it's hollow because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

303
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:14.830
<v Speaker 4>it grows off of protrusion of the skull,</v>
<v Speaker 4>called the horn core.</v>

304
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.930
<v Speaker 4>Then you pop the horn off and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>hollow.</v>

305
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 4>And what people will do is when you left</v>
<v Speaker 4>your campfire in the morning,</v>

306
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.680
<v Speaker 4>you would fill that horn with embers and</v>
<v Speaker 4>cap it,</v>

307
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 4>but there'd be a little pinhole in it</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to let a little bit of air and air</v>

308
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:30.640
<v Speaker 4>so could continue to smolder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you carry that Horn all day full of</v>

309
00:13:30.641 --> 00:13:33.400
<v Speaker 4>embers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at night to start a new fire,</v>

310
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.520
<v Speaker 4>you would dump the horn out and rekindle</v>
<v Speaker 4>your fire.</v>

311
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:40.420
<v Speaker 4>So when he talks about his father riding</v>
<v Speaker 4>out ahead of them with a Horn of fire,</v>

312
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:45.280
<v Speaker 4>what that's meant to say is that he knew</v>
<v Speaker 4>his father will be waiting out ahead of</v>

313
00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:49.060
<v Speaker 4>him with a fire burning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

314
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.820
<v Speaker 4>But Kevin Murphy just blows it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let squirrels noise coming.</v>
