00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:01.050
<v Speaker 1>get in line.</v>

3
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.501

4
00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:01.711
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5
00:00:01.711 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I might have to get in line.</v>

6
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll do whatever I have to do.</v>

7
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.363
<v Speaker 1>What are you,</v>

8
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably get the bug and then just want it badly.</v>

9
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.801
<v Speaker 1>I like it,</v>

10
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

11
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>I'd be willing to wait in line for like an hour.</v>

12
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

13
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.330
<v Speaker 1>half an hour.</v>

14
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

15
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

16
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.871
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

17
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:14.060
<v Speaker 1>let's see which,</v>

18
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>just thinking about how long does it take,</v>

19
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>how long has this line?</v>

20
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Half Hour.</v>

21
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.051
<v Speaker 2>Just order.</v>

22
00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:18.620
<v Speaker 2>If you ordered,</v>

23
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.453
<v Speaker 2>they just ship it to you,</v>

24
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.840
<v Speaker 2>but you got the same day when you wanted them immediately.</v>

25
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 2>But what will hold me over is that Samsung Galaxy s three.</v>

26
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.360
<v Speaker 2>I want to see it yet,</v>

27
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.290
<v Speaker 2>which I've heard good things.</v>

28
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

29
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.011
<v Speaker 2>I'll pull it out.</v>

30
00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:30.631
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you touch it.</v>

31
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.410
<v Speaker 2>Did have somebody at a show.</v>

32
00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:33.244
<v Speaker 2>I want to touch it.</v>

33
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.193
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

34
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>

35
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>take a picture with it and the screen look beautiful.</v>

36
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:38.191
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

37
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>And you know what else it can do?</v>

38
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>It can take a blast of photos.</v>

39
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>I can take our really 10 photos in a row.</v>

40
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.461
<v Speaker 1>Got High speed.</v>

41
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:44.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

42
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>it does some weird thing.</v>

43
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Where can,</v>

44
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>jump up in the air and it'll capture the cow 10 different pictures.</v>

46
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

47
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.591
<v Speaker 1>Like if a,</v>

48
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:53.424
<v Speaker 1>the deer</v>

49
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.771
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

50
00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:56.270
<v Speaker 2>I got my back yard for wanting to get photos of them.</v>

51
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Them went to the bathroom,</v>

52
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.390
<v Speaker 2>they were going full on,</v>

53
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 2>running fast back and forth,</v>

54
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.240
<v Speaker 2>like for no reason.</v>

55
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.950
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

56
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.170
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

57
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.270
<v Speaker 2>What are these guys doing?</v>

58
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.280
<v Speaker 2>This run around your house is surrounded by crazy deer.</v>

59
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

60
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:08.421
<v Speaker 1>but they're a,</v>

61
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>this is like where they feel comfortable cause my dogs can't get Watson.</v>

62
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Then the nice animals,</v>

63
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.270
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

64
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.611
<v Speaker 1>You're ready.</v>

65
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:15.500
<v Speaker 1>You ever said lucky?</v>

66
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.600
<v Speaker 1>They're lucky that uh,</v>

67
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.660
<v Speaker 1>it's not illegal to shoot him.</v>

68
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.163
<v Speaker 1>Would you shoot him?</v>

70
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.543
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

71
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.393
<v Speaker 1>here's a problem.</v>

72
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem with deer.</v>

73
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:26.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not a problem in my neighborhood cause nobody drives fast.</v>

74
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

75
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty quiet area.</v>

76
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.851
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

77
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:31.460
<v Speaker 1>if you have this many deer near a main road,</v>

78
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:32.810
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a real problem.</v>

79
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.180
<v Speaker 1>People all over the world crashing the deer.</v>

80
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

81
00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 1>it's just a fucking really common way that people get injured in cars get fucked</v>

82
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:39.610
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

83
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.301
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

84
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:41.134
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up,</v>

85
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.100
<v Speaker 1>ruined different deer that big.</v>

86
00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you think of that?</v>

87
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 1>How big that Deere was and if that hit the windshield,</v>

88
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>that's break your fucking face man.</v>

89
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.590
<v Speaker 1>And if the thing is still alive and kicking and glasses,</v>

91
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>flying your eyeballs,</v>

92
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>if it was a motorcycle,</v>

93
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.451
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

94
00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:53.681
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

95
00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:55.670
<v Speaker 1>you literally have to kill those things.</v>

96
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 1>You have to kill them.</v>

97
00:01:56.841 --> 00:01:57.381
<v Speaker 1>And there's the,</v>

98
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Peta people don't want to admit this,</v>

99
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 1>but this one of two options.</v>

100
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

101
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>You either assume your position at the top of the food chain and deal with the</v>

102
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:09.950
<v Speaker 1>problem or you bring something else in and you're no longer at the top of the</v>

103
00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 1>food chain because that's the only way you're going to have to deal with this</v>

104
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:12.680
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

105
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.480
<v Speaker 1>What do they pray everywhere.</v>

106
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:16.910
<v Speaker 1>So you either eat it or you bring in predators.</v>

107
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.773
<v Speaker 1>That's all you can do.</v>

108
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're either going to shoot it or you got to bring in mountain lions and</v>

109
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:20.601
<v Speaker 1>wolves.</v>

110
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:24.370
<v Speaker 1>So they propose that we just let deer just exploded in population.</v>

111
00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

112
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Well they,</v>

113
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:26.090
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

115
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.830
<v Speaker 1>they don't want people hunting.</v>

116
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

117
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.300
<v Speaker 1>They don't want people hunting.</v>

118
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:31.790
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know what kind of ideas they have,</v>

119
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.420
<v Speaker 1>the desktop,</v>

120
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.410
<v Speaker 1>the population growth.</v>

121
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't manage that shit,</v>

122
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.080
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that,</v>

123
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:39.800
<v Speaker 1>when I was a young man I thought that like deer hunting.</v>

125
00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:40.281
<v Speaker 1>Like wow,</v>

126
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:41.690
<v Speaker 1>why would you ever want to kill a deer?</v>

127
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think about the irony of wanting a cheeseburger and,</v>

128
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:45.080
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

129
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.860
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>

130
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

131
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>in wondering why anybody would go and kill a deer.</v>

132
00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Like it didn't even make sense to me.</v>

133
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.570
<v Speaker 1>But as you get older and you understand that you have to do something about the</v>

134
00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:57.230
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

135
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do something about the,</v>

136
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>they are like rats.</v>

137
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.301
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

138
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>that's how every there's going to be a disease.</v>

139
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be problems because every population needs to be put in check.</v>

140
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>The cycle has to be the reason why the world so fucked up right now is because</v>

141
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that eats us.</v>

142
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>That's like the main reason we can just dominate.</v>

143
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>We can just run around all willy nilly and nothing puts us in check.</v>

144
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>And if that was the case with Deere,</v>

145
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>we would be fucked.</v>

146
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>We'd go 20 miles an hour everywhere they'd be jumping in front of your car</v>

147
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:27.604
<v Speaker 1>everywhere you went.</v>

148
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>The only good thing is we'd never go hungry.</v>

149
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.701
<v Speaker 1>You just pull over,</v>

150
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>pull out a gun,</v>

151

<v Speaker 1>and just start.</v>

155
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.821
<v Speaker 1>You could eat,</v>

156
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>you would never starve to death,</v>

157
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 1>but there'd be deer everywhere and you wouldn't get anywhere and people would</v>

158
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>die on the highway every day because you would just hit one of those fucking</v>

159
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>dummies kick through your skull.</v>

165
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a man when I eat them.</v>

171
00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm on mountain men.</v>

172
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm living in a cabin.</v>

173
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>You are fear some felling fierce as fuck.</v>

174
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.113
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

175
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Cut.</v>

176
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Deers living in my yard bro.</v>

177
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:08.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a wild person up here.</v>

178
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>A wild person got to be careful about wild though.</v>

179
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.451
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

180
00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I respect that shit.</v>

181
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Gonna keep it in line.</v>

182
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 1>People that think that you shouldn't kill deer are ridiculous.</v>

183
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.551
<v Speaker 1>You're ridiculous.</v>

184
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:21.160
<v Speaker 1>And to do something with them ridiculous and you're dangerous.</v>

185
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.611
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

186
00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:22.444
<v Speaker 1>And it's stupid.</v>

187
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they're going to live forever if you don't shoot them.</v>

188
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.421
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

189
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:30.421
<v Speaker 1>killing deer is a thousand times better than running some ridiculous factory</v>

190
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 1>chicken farm stuff and everything and do a fucking box where it can't move.</v>

191
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Or just thinking about veal,</v>

192
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

193
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:39.050
<v Speaker 1>thinking about how they raise veal and how,</v>

194
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 1>how many pig farms or pigs or stuffed right next to is where the tears are just</v>

195
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>running around man,</v>

196
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 1>just running around.</v>

197
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>I would like to do the bow hunting.</v>

198
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

199
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching a lot of bow hunting.</v>

200
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.111
<v Speaker 1>It's cool,</v>

201
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think,</v>

202
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 1>I can't actually,</v>

203
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

204
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

205
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good at stomaching the,</v>

206
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you something I really won't like.</v>

207
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

208
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.693
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

212
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I've been obsessed with it from a,</v>

213
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.520
<v Speaker 1>to the time I saw them first kill a pig with a knife.</v>

214
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>The dog's hold the pig down and they stabbed in the throat with a knife.</v>

215
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a hunting show.</v>

218
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 1>It's about pigs in rural Texas.</v>

219
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

220
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>pigs in Texas are fucking huge problem and wild pigs are like literally like</v>

221
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>destroying millions of acres.</v>

222
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:24.970
<v Speaker 1>There's millions and millions of wild pigs.</v>

223
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 1>They're ridiculous infestation to the point where they're shooting amount of</v>

224
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>helicopters and that's one of the things they did on pig man.</v>

225
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>This guy gets out a fucking helicopter and shoots like 200 pigs in a day.</v>

226
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Well this is the disturbing.</v>

227
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.451
<v Speaker 1>That was disturbing,</v>

228
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>but the most recent episode was way more mustard disturbing.</v>

229
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.870
<v Speaker 1>He's going,</v>

230
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.870
<v Speaker 1>he goes hunting in Argentina and he's trying to get pigs like these big giant</v>

231
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>pigs and there's no pigs around.</v>

232
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>So he shoots off Fox and he shoots a Fox with a bow and Arrow and the thing</v>

233
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>screams this horrible</v>

234
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>and it was really fucked up man.</v>

235
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>

236
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.610
<v Speaker 1>it was really weird to watch because he nails this thing and it just lets out</v>

237
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>this horrible,</v>

238
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 1>horrible screech and then you realize he's not going to eat that.</v>

239
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>You're not eating that Fox.</v>

240
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Like he just shot that Fox because he could shoot that Fox and I was like,</v>

241
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.901
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

242

245
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>in the fur trapping days.</v>

246
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

247
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 1>you're not really a fur trapper.</v>

248
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess it's worth some money,</v>

249
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:28.770
<v Speaker 1>but you just shot that thing cause you wanted to shoot a fox and I,</v>

250
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 1>when I lived in Colorado,</v>

251
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>mem foxes are cool as fuck cause they're bad ass.</v>

252
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.680
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of cool man.</v>

253
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 1>There's um,</v>

254
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.073
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>

255
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Coyotes that run around the uh,</v>

256
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

257
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 1>like Griffith Park.</v>

258
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 1>The coyotes are different.</v>

259
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Coyotes and creeps.</v>

260
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

261
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.750
<v Speaker 1>It is in my big dangerous creeps.</v>

262
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>

263
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>they're dangerous creeps.</v>

264
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.860
<v Speaker 1>But foxes are not dangerous to people at all.</v>

265
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Coyotes will attack children,</v>

266
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 1>but Fox says won't.</v>

267
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:52.850
<v Speaker 1>The foxes are coming packed.</v>

268
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.773
<v Speaker 1>Very clever.</v>

269
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.280
<v Speaker 1>They do coming back and they come in packs down from you.</v>

270
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 1>They come down from the hillside and you'll all of a sudden,</v>

271
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:01.530
<v Speaker 1>like every few weeks I'll hear that.</v>

272
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 1>That have like a maniacal high pitch barking danger.</v>

273
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Andress.</v>

274
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

275
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.800
<v Speaker 1>they're always in my front yard and they're,</v>

276
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:09.021
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

277
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 1>they like play with my dog through the window.</v>

278
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Like my dog will bargain in that coyote will come out and just stupid.</v>

279
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Would I say about them?</v>

280
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Is that the only reason I don't kill us is because they don't think they can get</v>

281
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 1>away with it.</v>

282
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.213
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

283
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 1>And they'll kill anything else around us,</v>

284
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:24.770
<v Speaker 1>including your children.</v>

285
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 1>They will attack your children.</v>

286
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Was having a bunch of times I've seen,</v>

287
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a dog running like trodding a coyote,</v>

288
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:32.510
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>

289
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.343
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

290
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 1>trodding down fountain with a dog and its mouth.</v>

291
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.763
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

292
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.723
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's what they eat late at night.</v>

295
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 1>They snatch him right off of people's leashes.</v>

296
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.520
<v Speaker 1>People go walking around in Nice neighborhoods like Brentwood that go walking</v>

297
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:49.700
<v Speaker 1>around with a dog on a leash and a coyote will come and snatch that motherfucker</v>

298
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 1>off and run their rights out here.</v>

299
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

300
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.820
<v Speaker 1>The rats just walk on my power lines and you're just going from house to house.</v>

301
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.400
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

302
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.233

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Oof.</v>

305
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.071
<v Speaker 1>I had had,</v>

306
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:01.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

307
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:01.940
<v Speaker 1>some guy,</v>

308
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.840
<v Speaker 1>they had a lockdown,</v>

309
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 1>some house and quarantine it because some people caught some horrible rat</v>

310
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 1>disease from that hoarder show.</v>

311
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Geez.</v>

312
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

313
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:12.170
<v Speaker 1>They're cleaning up people's houses and you know,</v>

314
00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:14.330
<v Speaker 1>these people had a rat infestation in their house,</v>

315
00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:15.890
<v Speaker 1>so they've taught in this disease.</v>

316
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:20.891
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it kills like 20 to 50% of the people who get it and it's incurable.</v>

317
00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 1>There's no cure for it.</v>

318
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.320
<v Speaker 1>So these people were catching this horrible incurable disease from cleaning up</v>

319
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 1>people's shit houses,</v>

320
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Jesus rats everywhere and infestations.</v>

321
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.090
<v Speaker 1>And I used to see those rats on the power lines.</v>

322
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 1>And this is when I worked in like a big corporate building.</v>

323
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 1>And so I talked to the,</v>

324
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 1>they had the guys would,</v>

325
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 1>would come into the offices in the kitchen and like set traps and do this stuff.</v>

326
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:45.261
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

327
00:08:45.261 --> 00:08:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

328
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:46.181
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

329
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:46.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

330
00:08:46.461 --> 00:08:46.680
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

331
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrified of the fucking rats.</v>

332
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

333
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.300
<v Speaker 1>what can I do about rats?</v>

334
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:50.811
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

335
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

336
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:51.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

337
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:52.850
<v Speaker 1>he's telling me the options.</v>

338
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:53.271
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

339
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>he gave me these,</v>

340
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

341
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 1>these like</v>

342
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Gel pad,</v>

343
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 2>like Sticky Gel.</v>

344
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:00.391
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like a,</v>

345
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 2>it's like a big rectangular thing and you just place it and he's like,</v>

346
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 2>there'll be running and then they'll just get stuck in that and then they just</v>

347
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:08.550
<v Speaker 2>rot and then they'll just die.</v>

348
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:09.530
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

349
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.020
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

350
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.450
<v Speaker 2>So I was so scared of them that I said fuck it.</v>

351
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.670
<v Speaker 2>I put it up on the roof and he's like put like a little peanut butter and it'll</v>

352
00:09:16.671 --> 00:09:17.610
<v Speaker 2>just come right there.</v>

353
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.391
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

354
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 2>I lay them out,</v>

355
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 2>I come out the next day they are from the roof.</v>

356
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.430
<v Speaker 2>They're down on the floor now.</v>

357
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Speaker 2>Flipped over and shit on is like the rats pick them up,</v>

358
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.890
<v Speaker 2>flip them over and shit all over them like fuck your trap or real.</v>

359
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah and they just,</v>

360
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 2>they were just kicked over.</v>

361
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.110
<v Speaker 3>It might with rat shit all over them.</v>

362
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.630
<v Speaker 3>I had that really bad mouse problem when I was in college and like it's still</v>

363
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:43.970
<v Speaker 3>about where the mice were just like,</v>

364
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.510
<v Speaker 3>like I would take a blanket off my couch and mice would scurry out and blah.</v>

365
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 1>What do you have like an ancient infrastructure that's been infested,</v>

366
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:55.920
<v Speaker 1>like New York City's infrastructure is really almost no way to eradicate them</v>

367
00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.060
<v Speaker 1>unless you would clean every person out of the city and then just kill</v>

368
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 1>everything alive and the city otherwise,</v>

369
00:10:02.521 --> 00:10:04.140
<v Speaker 1>and even then you're probably going to miss a few.</v>

370
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be in crack somewhere hiding those naval cuts.</v>

371
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 1>There's more brats I think.</v>

372
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Then there are people in New York City.</v>

373
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

374
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.440
<v Speaker 3>So we had one of those traps,</v>

375
00:10:12.441 --> 00:10:13.580
<v Speaker 3>but my mouse,</v>

376
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:13.881
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

377
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:14.181
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

378
00:10:14.181 --> 00:10:15.014
<v Speaker 3>well one day and he's like,</v>

379
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.550
<v Speaker 3>what's that noise in my kitchen?</v>

380
00:10:16.551 --> 00:10:17.091
<v Speaker 3>And I hear like,</v>

381
00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:21.080
<v Speaker 3>like I like just the shuffling noise and there's like just blood and there's a</v>

382
00:10:21.081 --> 00:10:25.010
<v Speaker 3>mouse there that was like biting his leg off and I didn't know what to do.</v>

383
00:10:25.011 --> 00:10:30.011
<v Speaker 3>So I grabbed like one of the scoops that you for the broom and I threw it</v>

384
00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:31.310
<v Speaker 3>outside and I was like,</v>

385
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.473
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what's,</v>

386
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.720
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know what happened to it.</v>

387
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.540
<v Speaker 3>I just never went into my backyard anymore.</v>

388
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.513
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

389
00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:38.261
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

390
00:10:38.261 --> 00:10:39.940
<v Speaker 1>when you got anywhere but this rats,</v>

391
00:10:39.941 --> 00:10:41.260
<v Speaker 1>you just gotta get the fuck out of there.</v>

392
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

393
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.310
<v Speaker 1>you can't win.</v>

394
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.143
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to win.</v>

395
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.650
<v Speaker 1>You need to set up shop in a place.</v>

396
00:10:44.651 --> 00:10:45.840
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have rats like that.</v>

397
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.300
<v Speaker 1>The monoxide house,</v>

398
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.350
<v Speaker 1>same house.</v>

399
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.183
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

400
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:50.651
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

401
00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:55.330
<v Speaker 1>What a shitty house got attacked by rodents and poisoned brain to speaking of</v>

402
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.081
<v Speaker 1>poison brain,</v>

403
00:10:56.081 --> 00:10:57.640
<v Speaker 1>this new sports illustrated.</v>

404
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.830
<v Speaker 1>I know you're a football fan.</v>

405
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.430
<v Speaker 1>She read this shit on Jim McMann.</v>

406
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:01.421
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

407
00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:02.260
<v Speaker 1>I know he's,</v>

408
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.580
<v Speaker 1>he's not doing well.</v>

409
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Not doing well man.</v>

410
00:11:04.661 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 1>The Gym,</v>

411
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.861
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>

412
00:11:05.861 --> 00:11:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I was not a football fan,</v>

413
00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:08.680
<v Speaker 1>but I knew who the fuck Jim Mcmahon was mean.</v>

414
00:11:08.681 --> 00:11:10.660
<v Speaker 1>He was a super famous football player.</v>

415
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Bandanas and he used to wear a bull shark.</v>

416
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:14.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

417
00:11:14.771 --> 00:11:16.390
<v Speaker 1>the Superbowl shuffle while he,</v>

418
00:11:16.391 --> 00:11:18.790
<v Speaker 1>apparently he has dementia and uh,</v>

419
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:19.151
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

420
00:11:19.151 --> 00:11:22.970
<v Speaker 1>his girlfriend takes pictures of them together because one day she's worried</v>

421
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.410
<v Speaker 1>he's going to forget who she is because she sees it slowly slipping away.</v>

422
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Like he'll be,</v>

423
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.940
<v Speaker 1>he'll kiss her goodbye and they'll be downstairs just standing frozen because he</v>

424
00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:32.050
<v Speaker 1>can't remember what he was going to do.</v>

425
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I think football is on the verge of changing dramatically.</v>

426
00:11:35.321 --> 00:11:36.190
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck can you,</v>

427
00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:36.490
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

428
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.600
<v Speaker 1>they were talking to him,</v>

429
00:11:37.601 --> 00:11:40.900
<v Speaker 1>he was on another sports show and they were talking to him about it and he said</v>

430
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.150
<v Speaker 1>leather helmets might be the rule,</v>

431
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.310
<v Speaker 1>like go go to back to Lubbock leather helmets and have no head contact at all.</v>

432
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.910
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

433
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:49.870
<v Speaker 1>but that's not gonna work.</v>

434
00:11:49.871 --> 00:11:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like who's going to accept that?</v>

435
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

436
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:52.811
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

438
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.581
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

439
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:56.200
<v Speaker 2>On real sports on HBO.</v>

440
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

441
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.200
<v Speaker 2>All those old players that come in shaking that,</v>

442
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.121
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that,</v>

443
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:01.811
<v Speaker 2>but they have this,</v>

444
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:02.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

445
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.453
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

446
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad that I forgot his name,</v>

447
00:12:04.821 --> 00:12:09.821
<v Speaker 2>but he played for the saints and he got als at like 34,</v>

448
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.423
<v Speaker 2>35.</v>

449
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.800
<v Speaker 2>And basically they said this is the first edit like time we've ever seen that</v>

450
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:20.150
<v Speaker 2>this traumatic just head door there.</v>

451
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.160
<v Speaker 2>The severe head trauma repeatedly might be a cause of als.</v>

452
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 2>We've never had,</v>

453
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.880
<v Speaker 2>we've never shown evidence that something could lead to als.</v>

454
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 2>What does als stand for?</v>

455
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

456
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.273
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

457
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:34.300
<v Speaker 2>it's a long,</v>

458
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:35.493
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

459
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.230
<v Speaker 2>it's a medical term that I can't pronounce correctly,</v>

460
00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

461
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.221
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

462
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:39.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

463
00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 2>it destroys your muscles and the only thing it doesn't destroy as it eats away</v>

464
00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:44.860
<v Speaker 2>your muscles is your brain.</v>

465
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:49.310
<v Speaker 2>So you're totally aware of how you're physically just brave,</v>

466
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.553
<v Speaker 2>evaporating.</v>

467
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 2>And like they show,</v>

468
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:52.760
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

469
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.070
<v Speaker 2>he played in the,</v>

470
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.930
<v Speaker 2>in the first game after Katrina,</v>

471
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.451
<v Speaker 2>New Orleans was,</v>

472
00:12:57.451 --> 00:12:58.660
<v Speaker 2>was just devastated.</v>

473
00:12:58.661 --> 00:12:58.901
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

474
00:12:58.901 --> 00:12:59.320
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

475
00:12:59.320 --> 00:12:59.850
<v Speaker 2>the super,</v>

476
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.840
<v Speaker 2>the super dome was used to house,</v>

477
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:02.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

478
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.550
<v Speaker 2>the city's residents who didn't have a place to go and they never know if they</v>

479
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 2>were going to even be able to rebuild it.</v>

480
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:08.554
<v Speaker 2>They rebuilt it,</v>

481
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

482
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.420
<v Speaker 2>got it all cleaned up.</v>

483
00:13:10.421 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 2>And then they had their first game since Katrina and it was like a big deal and</v>

484
00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:19.150
<v Speaker 2>he blocked a punt that just like sent the place into.</v>

485
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the craziest,</v>

486
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.270
<v Speaker 2>you see the clip of it is like,</v>

487
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:23.360
<v Speaker 2>it's super emotional place.</v>

488
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Just goes nuts.</v>

489
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.320
<v Speaker 2>They're so excited to have their team back.</v>

490
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.420
<v Speaker 2>And so he was that guy and he retired.</v>

491
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.970
<v Speaker 2>He played like eight or nine years in the league and was like,</v>

492
00:13:30.971 --> 00:13:31.804
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

493
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.420
<v Speaker 2>retired and looking forward to the rest of his life.</v>

494
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 2>How old was he when he retired?</v>

495
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.180
<v Speaker 2>He retired I think,</v>

496
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:37.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

497
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:38.261
<v Speaker 2>like 30,</v>

498
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:39.970
<v Speaker 2>31 years ago.</v>

499
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.020
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

500
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 2>finally retired 31.</v>

502
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

503
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.320
<v Speaker 2>he was just,</v>

504
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:44.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

505
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 2>had his run,</v>

506
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.300
<v Speaker 2>like he wasn't,</v>

507
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:46.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

508
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:47.770
<v Speaker 2>he was a special teams player.</v>

509
00:13:47.771 --> 00:13:48.604
<v Speaker 2>Like he had a good,</v>

510
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.050
<v Speaker 2>a good career.</v>

511
00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:50.884
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

512
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 2>but that seems like there's plenty of years left.</v>

513
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:53.980
<v Speaker 2>And your athletic career,</v>

514
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:54.520

00:13:57.881 --> 00:13:58.750
<v Speaker 2>four years.</v>

520
00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 2>And is it because of physical?</v>

521
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.170
<v Speaker 2>We just set up that you just don't make the cut.</v>

522
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

523
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.130
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of times you'll see guys that they were like big contributors and</v>

524
00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:07.000

<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

528
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.540
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

529
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.620
<v Speaker 2>no team wants them anymore.</v>

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:38.883
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of times.</v>

549
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.530
<v Speaker 2>It's written little practice.</v>

550
00:14:41.531 --> 00:14:42.364
<v Speaker 2>Those cows,</v>

<v Speaker 2>everything counts.</v>

554
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:45.761
<v Speaker 2>And we see,</v>

555
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

556

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

559
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.601
<v Speaker 2>what do you do though?</v>

560
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Do you tell people that got to stop playing for,</v>

561
00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 2>I would not want my kids to play football.</v>

562
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Tell you that I would be reluctant.</v>

563
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.690
<v Speaker 2>I know that like the one thing that,</v>

564
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.710
<v Speaker 2>the only way,</v>

565
00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

566
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.140
<v Speaker 2>the thing that most people agree on is that the proper technique is,</v>

567
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.990
<v Speaker 2>is not being taught from a young age.</v>

568
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:10.580
<v Speaker 2>Now people are no longer like you look at old footage of football.</v>

569
00:15:10.581 --> 00:15:10.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

570
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:14.120
<v Speaker 2>They're different caliber athletes and stuff and they're not like the monsters,</v>

571
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:17.240
<v Speaker 2>but like it was tech and it was more technical tackling people.</v>

572
00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Would you taught when you know,</v>

573
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:18.940
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

574
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.461
<v Speaker 2>you load your,</v>

575
00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Bend your knees,</v>

576
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 2>you put your shoulder into basically somebody's chest,</v>

577
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:24.230
<v Speaker 2>you wrap up and you tackle.</v>

578
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Those are the,</v>

579
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.950
<v Speaker 2>the tackles that rarely do you see that result in like some devastating had</v>

580
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:31.690
<v Speaker 2>drama.</v>

581
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:33.350
<v Speaker 2>But now it's,</v>

582
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.810
<v Speaker 2>and this is now like meaning the last 15,</v>

583
00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:36.740
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>

584
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:37.843
<v Speaker 2>It is like,</v>

585
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.980
<v Speaker 2>you see helmets being lowered,</v>

586
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.070
<v Speaker 2>crown of the head into the other person's helmet.</v>

587
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Just head blows.</v>

588
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 2>People are fucking,</v>

589
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

590
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:47.840
<v Speaker 2>throwing shoulders,</v>

591
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:52.690
<v Speaker 2>helmets and forearms into people's heads and then you see them just there.</v>

592
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like they were just in a car accident man.</v>

593
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:54.951
<v Speaker 2>Like they're just,</v>

594
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:55.790
<v Speaker 2>they can't handle it.</v>

595
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.350
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what type of helmet you wear.</v>

596
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:59.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

597
00:15:59.091 --> 00:15:59.924
<v Speaker 2>there's um,</v>

598
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.700
<v Speaker 2>there's only so much punishment your,</v>

599
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:02.630
<v Speaker 2>your brand can take.</v>

600
00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 2>And I think that there's very few things in life that hit you as hard as a</v>

601
00:16:06.021 --> 00:16:07.070
<v Speaker 2>football player does.</v>

602
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.230
<v Speaker 2>I just think that those dudes,</v>

603
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:11.390
<v Speaker 2>when you look at a 300 pound guy running it,</v>

604
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:15.440
<v Speaker 2>you full clip and charging into your body while another guy hits you over this</v>

605
00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:18.580
<v Speaker 2>way and you collide together and then the guy goes unconscious.</v>

606
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Like is there any other time in life where you see a man completely armored up</v>

607
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 2>just getting knocked unconscious?</v>

608
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:24.884
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

609
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.090
<v Speaker 2>They have helmets on.</v>

610
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.530
<v Speaker 2>They have big arm or padding on their shoulders and they get knocked the fuck</v>

611
00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:33.220
<v Speaker 2>out knocked out and the real problem now there are low,</v>

612
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.910
<v Speaker 2>they're more on top of it cause they have to be.</v>

613
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.850
<v Speaker 2>But the real problem is you look at like eighties and nineties,</v>

614
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.160
<v Speaker 2>the guys who are now 40 to 50.</v>

615
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

616
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.650
<v Speaker 2>And you're seeing a lot of like depression,</v>

617
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

618
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:44.030
<v Speaker 2>dementia,</v>

619
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.570
<v Speaker 2>dementia and you're seeing Alzheimer's and,</v>

620
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.050
<v Speaker 2>and all these different,</v>

621
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.790
<v Speaker 2>a debilitating things take place.</v>

622
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Those guys would get knocked out or you know,</v>

623
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:58.430
<v Speaker 2>they would get like a severe concussion and it would just be like,</v>

624
00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.020
<v Speaker 2>you need to go play right away now.</v>

625
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Like there wasn't like now there's like,</v>

626
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:02.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

627
00:17:02.031 --> 00:17:05.390
<v Speaker 2>they're finally doing like if you even have a sign of this,</v>

628
00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:07.310
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be out for this amount of time.</v>

629
00:17:07.311 --> 00:17:12.311
<v Speaker 2>You have to have those guys played with like full concussion syndromes,</v>

630
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.860
<v Speaker 2>which means that like their brain just went,</v>

631
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:20.180
<v Speaker 2>there's just shook inside their skull and now they're fucking playing again.</v>

632
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:21.043
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

633
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:23.540
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazy that they didn't even know.</v>

634
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.433
<v Speaker 2>It's like they,</v>

635
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.720
<v Speaker 2>that just shows you how recent,</v>

636
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.770
<v Speaker 2>not just the science of brain trauma is where they really kind of understand</v>

637
00:17:30.771 --> 00:17:32.240
<v Speaker 2>what causes real problems,</v>

638
00:17:32.241 --> 00:17:33.300
<v Speaker 2>but also the,</v>

639
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:33.520
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

640
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.600
<v Speaker 2>the idea of this as a sport.</v>

641
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.860
<v Speaker 2>So recent and in the Human Medical Venay,</v>

642
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

643
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:39.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

644
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.573
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

645
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.270
<v Speaker 2>encyclopedia a far as like things that happened to people.</v>

646
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.250
<v Speaker 2>How often did they have to like judge a or,</v>

647
00:17:47.251 --> 00:17:47.551
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

648
00:17:47.551 --> 00:17:48.330
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

649
00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

650
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 2>look at a very specific</v>

651
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.150
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>

652
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.100
<v Speaker 1>like people who do this one thing,</v>

653
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.140
<v Speaker 1>who all come down with traumatic brain injury.</v>

654
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:55.291
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

655
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:56.730
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

656
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.560
<v Speaker 1>What does this one profession,</v>

657
00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:58.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

658
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:00.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not like being a welder does that,</v>

659
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:02.130
<v Speaker 1>but being it's football player thing.</v>

660
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:02.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

661
00:18:02.411 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 1>this whole idea of a football player like a hundred years old,</v>

662
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's super new.</v>

663
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 1>So we did in the medical history of like things that you shouldn't do that are</v>

664
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:11.190
<v Speaker 1>fucked up for you.</v>

665
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 1>This sort of hasn't really been fully,</v>

666
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.033
<v Speaker 1>fully entered,</v>

667
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.500
<v Speaker 1>but neither has fighting man.</v>

668
00:18:16.501 --> 00:18:16.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

669
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:20.700
<v Speaker 1>fighting like in as far as like people have known about punchdrunk boxers</v>

670
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:21.301
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

671
00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:22.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's always been,</v>

672
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:22.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

673
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.860
<v Speaker 1>the box has stuck around too long and that the horrible stories and the,</v>

674
00:18:26.861 --> 00:18:27.694
<v Speaker 1>the list,</v>

675
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.310
<v Speaker 1>so the words that are,</v>

676
00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:30.144
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

677
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.320
<v Speaker 1>stumbling,</v>

678
00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:32.820
<v Speaker 1>slurring out of their mouth.</v>

679
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.150
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

680
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.610
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible to watch that stuff.</v>

681
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.971
<v Speaker 1>But we've,</v>

682
00:18:34.971 --> 00:18:36.570
<v Speaker 1>we've known about that forever,</v>

683
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.570
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to start to see that probably from MMA fighters if they're,</v>

684
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.550
<v Speaker 1>they're not looked after Devin as well.</v>

685
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:41.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

686
00:18:41.761 --> 00:18:41.941
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

687
00:18:41.941 --> 00:18:42.241
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

688
00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:44.250
<v Speaker 1>they're taking shots to the head is wow.</v>

689
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.310
<v Speaker 1>It's all about knowing when to fucking get out.</v>

690
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

691
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.650
<v Speaker 1>It's all about using as much,</v>

692
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

693
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:54.630
<v Speaker 1>intelligence as he can risk as much as you need to,</v>

694
00:18:54.631 --> 00:18:55.560
<v Speaker 1>but no more.</v>

695
00:18:55.561 --> 00:18:59.760
<v Speaker 1>And then get out when you feel like it's slipping away and you got to treat,</v>

696
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:00.780
<v Speaker 1>you've got to treat.</v>

697
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

698
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.280
<v Speaker 1>any real like head trauma,</v>

699
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 1>a concussion,</v>

700
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.610
<v Speaker 1>like a really serious event.</v>

701
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not something to just be like,</v>

702
00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:10.914
<v Speaker 1>well that happens.</v>

703
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.031
<v Speaker 1>It gets really,</v>

704
00:19:12.031 --> 00:19:12.864
<v Speaker 1>really serious.</v>

705
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Well I've heard a dude's get knocked out and training and then go to a fight and</v>

706
00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:22.300
<v Speaker 1>then get hit with like a small shot in the fight and they go unconscious because</v>

707
00:19:22.301 --> 00:19:25.410
<v Speaker 1>they were really like walking around like halfway knocked out already.</v>

708
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

709
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Marvin Eastman fought Travis Luder and Travis Luder hit him on the end of the</v>

710
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:31.680
<v Speaker 1>punch.</v>

711
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.040
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

712
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.090
<v Speaker 1>it was a really weird,</v>

713
00:19:33.091 --> 00:19:33.720
<v Speaker 1>it didn't look,</v>

714
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.553
<v Speaker 1>it looked like,</v>

715
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.690
<v Speaker 1>like he just shut off.</v>

716
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:37.410
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>

717
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.090
<v Speaker 1>he hit him and his whole body and I was like,</v>

718
00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:40.140
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't even make any sense.</v>

719
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.780
<v Speaker 1>But then you talked to the people that trained with and they said he got knocked</v>

720
00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:45.840
<v Speaker 1>out twice in camp for that fight,</v>

721
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.930
<v Speaker 1>which is just fucking crazy.</v>

722
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:54.020
<v Speaker 1>And he was probably right back like the day after fucking taking shots when I</v>

723
00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:56.940
<v Speaker 1>wonder if they're ever going to be able to fix that and wonder if it's ever</v>

724
00:19:56.941 --> 00:19:58.950
<v Speaker 1>going to be anything that can repair.</v>

725
00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Because the thing about brain conditions I think from impact is that the</v>

726
00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:05.250
<v Speaker 1>degenerative and that,</v>

727
00:20:05.251 --> 00:20:06.660
<v Speaker 1>just like with these boxers,</v>

728
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.990
<v Speaker 1>they say that something happened to them 10 years ago and they start to feel the</v>

729
00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:11.130
<v Speaker 1>effects 10 years later.</v>

730
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Well I think,</v>

731
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

732
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:13.501
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

733
00:20:13.501 --> 00:20:16.950
<v Speaker 1>it's so unnatural either to get like the trauma.</v>

734
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

735
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Like most people that have one occurrence like that,</v>

736
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.510
<v Speaker 1>that's the one occurrence they have for their life.</v>

737
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.800
<v Speaker 1>They don't have that.</v>

738
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.110
<v Speaker 1>They don't go through that hundreds of times.</v>

739
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.711
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

740
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:29.790
<v Speaker 1>you have somebody,</v>

741
00:20:29.791 --> 00:20:29.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

742
00:20:29.981 --> 00:20:30.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

743
00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:31.860
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows somebody or you're in a car accident.</v>

744
00:20:31.861 --> 00:20:32.371
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

745
00:20:32.371 --> 00:20:33.300
<v Speaker 1>And it fucked me up.</v>

746
00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:33.930
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

747
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.930
<v Speaker 1>that's that one time that happened and I had headaches,</v>

748
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:37.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

749
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:38.940
<v Speaker 1>for fucking years.</v>

750
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And I went to this type of therapist and I got this type of treatment once,</v>

751
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:43.463
<v Speaker 1>not like,</v>

752
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.040
<v Speaker 1>oh I've,</v>

753
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.440
<v Speaker 1>this is the kind of thing that happens to me every six weeks.</v>

754
00:20:46.441 --> 00:20:51.441
<v Speaker 1>I get fucking just laid out and fucking pass out because somebody's devastated</v>

755
00:20:51.701 --> 00:20:52.534
<v Speaker 1>my head.</v>

756
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.180
<v Speaker 1>A lot of camps that didn't know any better.</v>

757
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:57.730
<v Speaker 1>They thought that that was tough and guys up so guys were getting knocked out</v>

758
00:20:57.731 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 1>and training all the time cause they would go full clip and training.</v>

759
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.100
<v Speaker 1>That was like really common and a lot of camps,</v>

760
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:03.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

761
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to name names,</v>

762
00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:05.980
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

763
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:06.700
<v Speaker 1>people um,</v>

764
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.270
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

765
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.870
<v Speaker 1>don't treat brain trauma with as much respect as they should.</v>

766
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

767
00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 1>they did a lot of things fucked up.</v>

768
00:21:12.641 --> 00:21:17.641
<v Speaker 1>I know they used to not believe that you should give like a football players</v>

769
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.400
<v Speaker 1>water when they're like an August generic like to toughen you up.</v>

770
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Like during practice feel like two and a half hours with no water.</v>

771
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like 98 degrees outside.</v>

772
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.530
<v Speaker 1>They thought that was like the smart thing to do.</v>

773
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.060
<v Speaker 1>They did a lot of stupid shit man.</v>

774
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.500
<v Speaker 1>They did a lot of stupid shit.</v>

775
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.120
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people out there that got a,</v>

776
00:21:35.121 --> 00:21:37.630
<v Speaker 1>their brains ruined because people didn't understand.</v>

777
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.290
<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>

778
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:38.500
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

779
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:38.740
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

780
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.970
<v Speaker 1>but now it comes down to this.</v>

781
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:40.863
<v Speaker 1>Now we know.</v>

782
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Now what do we do?</v>

783
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

784
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.550
<v Speaker 1>It's cause it seems like you can fight in MMA and get out of it without brain</v>

785
00:21:45.551 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 1>trauma.</v>

786
00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the case with football.</v>

787
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:48.790
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

788
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:52.480
<v Speaker 1>There's some guys that clearly have made it out okay.</v>

789
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.990
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

790
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.530
<v Speaker 1>there's guys,</v>

791
00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be this wave,</v>

792
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.310
<v Speaker 1>this wave of guys,</v>

793
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.360
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see where it's not just every once in a while you hear the news</v>

794
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:01.970
<v Speaker 1>of somebody.</v>

795
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be just dozens of people that have severe,</v>

796
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:07.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

797
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

798
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.820
<v Speaker 1>brain injuries from football.</v>

799
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.260
<v Speaker 1>You get rid of the helmets.</v>

800
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:11.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

801
00:22:11.861 --> 00:22:13.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're saying is just that is,</v>

802
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:14.380
<v Speaker 1>we'll look,</v>

803
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a very bright suggestion and people think it's silly.</v>

804
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:17.501
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

805
00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:18.730
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

806
00:22:18.731 --> 00:22:19.750
<v Speaker 1>That's even more dangerous.</v>

807
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:20.740
<v Speaker 1>It's actually not,</v>

808
00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:21.370
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

809
00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:24.730
<v Speaker 1>That was also one of the arguments about MMA that they should switch to bare</v>

810
00:22:24.731 --> 00:22:26.480
<v Speaker 1>knuckles because you can't punch people.</v>

811
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.270
<v Speaker 1>It was hard.</v>

812
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:31.410
<v Speaker 1>The only problem is you cut people a lot easier with your knuckles then he was</v>

813
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:31.651
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

814
00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:32.170
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

815
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.880
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fights would be stopped because of cuts,</v>

816
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.010
<v Speaker 1>elbows and knuckles cut people the most.</v>

817
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:37.121
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

818
00:22:37.121 --> 00:22:39.490
<v Speaker 1>you can punch them and a lot harder if you've got a little gloves on.</v>

819
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.540
<v Speaker 1>If you've got padding on,</v>

820
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

821
00:22:41.201 --> 00:22:43.210
<v Speaker 1>the helmet is used in football as a weapon.</v>

822
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.340
<v Speaker 1>It's just like when you talk about the,</v>

823
00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:45.911
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

824
00:22:45.911 --> 00:22:46.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

825
00:22:46.121 --> 00:22:46.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

826
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.710
<v Speaker 1>the gloves that are dipped,</v>

827
00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:48.544
<v Speaker 1>your hand wrapped.</v>

828
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a web,</v>

829
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking solid weapon and he's protected by all these pads.</v>

830
00:22:53.511 --> 00:22:54.820
<v Speaker 1>So you can brace it against your,</v>

831
00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:55.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

832
00:22:55.361 --> 00:22:58.070
<v Speaker 1>your neck and everything and you're running full into somebody's.</v>

833
00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

834
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.250
<v Speaker 1>So silly sport man.</v>

835
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.020
<v Speaker 1>It's as a human being.</v>

836
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:02.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

837
00:23:02.171 --> 00:23:02.381
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

838
00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:03.310
<v Speaker 1>it's super and if,</v>

839
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:03.640
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

840
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.960
<v Speaker 1>and if that's how you make your living,</v>

841
00:23:04.961 --> 00:23:05.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

842
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.820
<v Speaker 1>a God bless Ya.</v>

843
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:07.511
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

844
00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:08.344
<v Speaker 1>God bless.</v>

845
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.300
<v Speaker 1>But if you've got another option,</v>

846
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:10.481
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

847
00:23:10.481 --> 00:23:14.680
<v Speaker 1>you might want to not slam your body and to dude's as hard as you can because it</v>

848
00:23:14.681 --> 00:23:16.750
<v Speaker 1>seems like that Shit's bad for you and it's pretty it.</v>

849
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.120
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely a good argument against it because like a fighter like</v>

850
00:23:19.121 --> 00:23:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva can go through whole fights and not get touched me.</v>

851
00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Just fucks guys up and doesn't even get hit you and you look at it and go,</v>

852
00:23:26.621 --> 00:23:27.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

853
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.770
<v Speaker 1>if you're super talented and super technical,</v>

854
00:23:29.771 --> 00:23:32.790
<v Speaker 1>you know you can fight and not take that much damage.</v>

855
00:23:32.791 --> 00:23:34.420
<v Speaker 1>He goes through all Anderson's fights,</v>

856
00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:36.250
<v Speaker 1>only the chill son and fight.</v>

857
00:23:36.251 --> 00:23:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Does he ever take like a bunch of punches and they still looked fine at the end</v>

858
00:23:39.431 --> 00:23:40.330
<v Speaker 1>of that and brain?</v>

859
00:23:40.331 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Why'd you think he's all right?</v>

860
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.190
<v Speaker 1>He's fine,</v>

861
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.730
<v Speaker 1>he's fine.</v>

862
00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:43.690
<v Speaker 1>He's 100% fine.</v>

863
00:23:43.691 --> 00:23:44.560
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with him,</v>

864
00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:45.730
<v Speaker 1>but he's a,</v>

865
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:46.221
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

866
00:23:46.221 --> 00:23:47.180
<v Speaker 1>he's delicious.</v>

867
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:52.360
<v Speaker 1>He's a dishing out way more punches and more delicious punches he's taking.</v>

868
00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.340
<v Speaker 1>He's just fucking people up so hard.</v>

869
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

870
00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:55.830
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

871
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.270
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

872
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.661
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

873
00:23:56.661 --> 00:23:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I got a totally different confidence level than them.</v>

874
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.110
<v Speaker 1>He's on a totally different like striking speed wavelength.</v>

875
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.970
<v Speaker 1>He's just putting Beaton's on dudes,</v>

876
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:05.330
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

877
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:06.170
<v Speaker 1>And so because of that,</v>

878
00:24:06.171 --> 00:24:07.700
<v Speaker 1>he's not like taking much damage.</v>

879
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.120
<v Speaker 1>But then you see some other dudes that he's fighting,</v>

880
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:11.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

881
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:13.460
<v Speaker 1>some guys that he's fucking up and you gotta go,</v>

882
00:24:13.461 --> 00:24:13.700
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

883
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 1>how many more fights like this can this guy have?</v>

884
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.050
<v Speaker 1>And every fighter has to sort of decide on their own,</v>

885
00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:19.130
<v Speaker 1>they have to reach this sort of,</v>

886
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.793
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough,</v>

887
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.980
<v Speaker 1>tough thing to come to man.</v>

888
00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Fuck out his time to dip out.</v>

889
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

890
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Especially if that's how you make a living.</v>

891
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.520
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to pay your bills and the um,</v>

892
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.281
<v Speaker 1>not to mention,</v>

893
00:24:28.281 --> 00:24:28.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

894
00:24:28.491 --> 00:24:29.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

895
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:29.541
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

896
00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:32.300
<v Speaker 1>the rush they get of being like in the game,</v>

897
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:32.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

898
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:35.270
<v Speaker 1>being part of like prize fights,</v>

899
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:35.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

900
00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.960
<v Speaker 1>and you're fucking in an arena and people are screaming when you ended up like,</v>

901
00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:39.271
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

902
00:24:39.271 --> 00:24:42.440
<v Speaker 1>that's a rush you can't compare to anything you do in your regular fucking life.</v>

903
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

904
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.490
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing like that.</v>

905
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Nothing like that.</v>

906
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard thing to fucking put down.</v>

907
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.860
<v Speaker 1>It'd be super hard to find something that can come even close.</v>

908
00:24:48.861 --> 00:24:50.600
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to be like a fighter pilot or some shit.</v>

909
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.820
<v Speaker 1>They say that that's a lot of people are saying.</v>

910
00:24:52.821 --> 00:24:53.421
<v Speaker 1>That's what say,</v>

911
00:24:53.421 --> 00:24:54.770
<v Speaker 1>oh like you know,</v>

912
00:24:54.771 --> 00:24:56.450
<v Speaker 1>he played in the NFL for like 16 years,</v>

913
00:24:56.451 --> 00:24:58.490
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much unheard of.</v>

914
00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Especially like as like a linebacker and that like he just was like,</v>

915
00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.900
<v Speaker 1>he was depressed about not getting the,</v>

916
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:07.190
<v Speaker 1>that rush anymore.</v>

917
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:07.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

918
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:08.760
<v Speaker 1>being like in the,</v>

919
00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.120
<v Speaker 1>in the Games we'll also,</v>

920
00:25:11.121 --> 00:25:12.570
<v Speaker 1>he I considerable brain damaged.</v>

921
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

922
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:13.610
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

923
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing man.</v>

924
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 1>They say that brain damage,</v>

925
00:25:15.621 --> 00:25:18.110
<v Speaker 1>they say once it fucks with your pituitary,</v>

926
00:25:18.111 --> 00:25:20.560
<v Speaker 1>your brain's tops producing the right amount of testosterone,</v>

927
00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.860
<v Speaker 1>you get depressed from that.</v>

928
00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:22.271
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

929
00:25:22.271 --> 00:25:22.650
<v Speaker 1>you get that.</v>

930
00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different factors that can lead to like some pretty severe</v>

931
00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:27.200
<v Speaker 1>depression because of brain trauma.</v>

932
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:27.951
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

933
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:31.560
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the arguments against testosterone replacement for um,</v>

934
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:31.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

935
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.960
<v Speaker 1>for fighters actually.</v>

936
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Is the traumatic brain injury a argument?</v>

937
00:25:36.531 --> 00:25:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

938
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't totally completely understand it,</v>

939
00:25:38.751 --> 00:25:41.660
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're saying is if you get hit in the head and now it's like</v>

940
00:25:41.661 --> 00:25:42.230
<v Speaker 1>James,</v>

941
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Tony was an example of it.</v>

942
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.360
<v Speaker 1>You get hit in the head enough and your,</v>

943
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.490
<v Speaker 1>your bond is not going to produce testosterone.</v>

944
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:47.363
<v Speaker 1>Same Way.</v>

945
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.460
<v Speaker 1>But then I've heard other doctors say,</v>

946
00:25:49.461 --> 00:25:50.570
<v Speaker 1>and this kind of makes sense to me,</v>

947
00:25:50.571 --> 00:25:50.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

948
00:25:50.691 --> 00:25:51.350
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

949
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.800
<v Speaker 1>if you can't produce for testosterone anymore because he got hit in the head so</v>

950
00:25:54.801 --> 00:25:55.311
<v Speaker 1>many times,</v>

951
00:25:55.311 --> 00:25:57.440
<v Speaker 1>like maybe you should stop getting hit in the head.</v>

952
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:58.280
<v Speaker 1>That's a great,</v>

953
00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:58.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

954
00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.391
<v Speaker 1>that's a great lesson.</v>

955
00:25:59.391 --> 00:25:59.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

956
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:02.240
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that's the thing you should stop first.</v>

957
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

958
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Like forget about like trying to do anything to supplement your testosterone.</v>

959
00:26:08.391 --> 00:26:10.730
<v Speaker 1>You got to stop getting hit in the head because your brain's going to stop</v>

960
00:26:10.731 --> 00:26:11.440
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>

961
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.110
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

962
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.291
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

963
00:26:12.291 --> 00:26:14.990
<v Speaker 1>my times can you hit your car with a hammer before the engine brakes.</v>

964
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like neat.</v>

965
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Nef you know there's a,</v>

966
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:23.270
<v Speaker 1>there's great footage of James Tony Sparring like a few years back and he's</v>

967
00:26:23.271 --> 00:26:23.481
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

968
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:27.280
<v Speaker 1>he's pretty out of shape in it and he talks shit don't hire time that he's</v>

969
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:27.731
<v Speaker 1>barring.</v>

00:26:27.731 --> 00:26:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

971
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but he's just like bitch ass faggot.</v>

974
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.810
<v Speaker 1>he's sold technically talented James,</v>

976
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.811
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>

977
00:26:38.811 --> 00:26:41.600
<v Speaker 1>his shoulder rolls and his ability to tie,</v>

978
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 1>figure out where you're punching and block you and cover you.</v>

979
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.810
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant boxer,</v>

980
00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:46.470
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

981
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:47.880
<v Speaker 1>If you go back to hid the early days,</v>

982
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:48.990
<v Speaker 1>like when he knocked out Michael,</v>

983
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:49.360
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>

984
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.120
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] James,</v>

985
00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Tony's a God damn animal man.</v>

986
00:26:51.751 --> 00:26:52.260
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

987
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.380
<v Speaker 1>he's a power punch hours dude.</v>

988
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.770
<v Speaker 1>And he became a slick ass boxer.</v>

989
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:03.930
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't have the same motivation to training that like some other guys</v>

990
00:27:03.931 --> 00:27:04.630
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

991
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.230
<v Speaker 1>If he trained like Roy Jones Jr train.</v>

992
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.093
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

993
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.860
<v Speaker 1>What a fight that was him and Roy Jones Jr.</v>

994
00:27:10.861 --> 00:27:12.090
<v Speaker 1>That was a fucking great fight.</v>

995
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

996
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.430
<v Speaker 1>If he would have trained late like Roy Jones.</v>

997
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

998
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:16.800
<v Speaker 1>That was too bad.</v>

999
00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:17.281
<v Speaker 1>It's too bad.</v>

1000
00:27:17.281 --> 00:27:18.810
<v Speaker 1>He never sort of recovered from that.</v>

1001
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Did they fight again?</v>

1002
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Did they ever fight again?</v>

1003
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:21.351
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if,</v>

1004
00:27:21.351 --> 00:27:22.230
<v Speaker 1>if a twice,</v>

1005
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.160
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

1006
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they did it.</v>

1007
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:24.893
<v Speaker 1>Why do I feel like,</v>

1008
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.300
<v Speaker 1>why do I feel like they didn't?</v>

1009
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:32.160
<v Speaker 1>But James Tony was one of the only like major guys that ever tried,</v>

1010
00:27:32.161 --> 00:27:32.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1021
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Randy.</v>

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Go towards just grabbed him and threw him on the ground.</v>

1023
00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Really wrangled them like immediately.</v>

1024
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Was it like a ten second thing?</v>

1025
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:49.283
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1026
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:49.921
<v Speaker 1>yeah it was,</v>

1027
00:27:49.921 --> 00:27:50.511
<v Speaker 1>it was a joke.</v>

1028
00:27:50.511 --> 00:27:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

1029
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:52.860
<v Speaker 1>He took him down with a low,</v>

1030
00:27:52.861 --> 00:27:54.200
<v Speaker 1>a low single.</v>

1031
00:27:54.201 --> 00:27:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Got them in an ankle pick.</v>

1032
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I guess they were trying to plan it.</v>

1033
00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.340
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to plan the second fight.</v>

1034
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1035
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:00.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1036
00:28:00.571 --> 00:28:02.940
<v Speaker 1>but I think James Tony might be a heavyweight now.</v>

1037
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.193
<v Speaker 1>Big Boy.</v>

1038
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1039
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Well they say that t yeah,</v>

1040
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I think you said they might.</v>

1041
00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.380
<v Speaker 1>They say Tony is like 240 pounds and Roy Jones,</v>

1042
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:13.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1043
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:14.730
<v Speaker 1>is still fighting,</v>

1044
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.960
<v Speaker 1>but he fights it like cruiser weight sometimes or light heavyweights.</v>

1045
00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to drop down.</v>

1046
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching Roy John's fight to it.</v>

1047
00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:24.030
<v Speaker 1>It's depressing as shit.</v>

1048
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:24.781
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not,</v>

1049
00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:25.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the old days.</v>

1050
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not just like the old days is getting knocked out a lot.</v>

1051
00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1052
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.970
<v Speaker 1>seen him knocked out a couple of times.</v>

1053
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.200
<v Speaker 1>He's a good analyst.</v>

1054
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.400
<v Speaker 1>He's actually a good analyst.</v>

1055
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why he doesn't just fucking,</v>

1056
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:35.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1057
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.541
<v Speaker 1>he needs money,</v>

1058
00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:36.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1059
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Apparently if you listen to the Internet,</v>

1060
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.580
<v Speaker 1>they say that he's another one of those dudes that didn't pay his taxes.</v>

1061
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.700
<v Speaker 1>He owes millions of dollars.</v>

1062
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:45.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1063
00:28:45.841 --> 00:28:46.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1064
00:28:46.241 --> 00:28:49.800
<v Speaker 1>when someone tells you you don't have to pay or someone's a shitty his financial</v>

1065
00:28:49.801 --> 00:28:53.290
<v Speaker 1>advisor or you think you got everything covered and you know,</v>

1066
00:28:53.291 --> 00:28:53.551
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1067
00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:54.810
<v Speaker 1>this is never gonna go away.</v>

1068
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.820
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those guys don't have good accountants.</v>

1069
00:28:56.821 --> 00:28:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Ma'Am.</v>

1070
00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:58.590
<v Speaker 1>I know you kind of pay your money,</v>

1071
00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.340
<v Speaker 1>you got to pay.</v>

1072
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should pay as much as we pay,</v>

1073
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.140
<v Speaker 1>but I think you've got to fucking pay you gotta pay if get,</v>

1074
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.390
<v Speaker 1>I get a little pissed off when I find out about a guy that's been living high on</v>

1075
00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:08.280
<v Speaker 1>the hog and it was millions of dollars in taxes,</v>

1076
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:09.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1077
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.130
<v Speaker 1>cause like we should all contribute.</v>

1078
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:11.800
<v Speaker 1>We should.</v>

1079
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.300
<v Speaker 1>There's a real,</v>

1080
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:12.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1081
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:13.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1082
00:29:13.141 --> 00:29:16.230
<v Speaker 1>this Obama argument that everybody is upset at him because he said,</v>

1083
00:29:16.231 --> 00:29:16.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1084
00:29:16.531 --> 00:29:17.700
<v Speaker 1>if you run a small business,</v>

1085
00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:18.481
<v Speaker 1>you didn't build that.</v>

1086
00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:19.650
<v Speaker 1>You didn't build the infrastructure.</v>

1087
00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:20.371
<v Speaker 1>He didn't build a street.</v>

1088
00:29:20.371 --> 00:29:20.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what he meant.</v>

1089
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Like you didn't build a streets and everybody was upset by that.</v>

1090
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.713
<v Speaker 1>But in the end,</v>

1091
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.460
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ways that is true.</v>

1092
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:27.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean we do need to pay,</v>

1093
00:29:27.661 --> 00:29:29.400
<v Speaker 1>everybody needs to pay a little bit of something.</v>

1094
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.180
<v Speaker 1>It's just there should be some sort of an accounting should be able to find out</v>

1095
00:29:33.181 --> 00:29:33.750
<v Speaker 1>how you're spending.</v>

1096
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.300
<v Speaker 1>The money shouldn't be so God damn wide open,</v>

1097
00:29:36.301 --> 00:29:39.960
<v Speaker 1>we have to give you money and then you'd do whether if you,</v>

1098
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're guy like him,</v>

1099
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.460
<v Speaker 1>I feel like how much money did that guy give them?</v>

1100
00:29:45.461 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Roy Jones over the years and taxes and millions and millions and millions of</v>

1101
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

1102
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Millions he should have.</v>

1103
00:29:51.041 --> 00:29:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Like if it gets a certain number and you should be able to say,</v>

1104
00:29:54.451 --> 00:29:55.630
<v Speaker 1>or this is what we did with your money,</v>

1105
00:29:55.631 --> 00:29:59.650
<v Speaker 1>we went over it and we use all of your millions to set up a base in Kosovo.</v>

1106
00:29:59.651 --> 00:30:01.180
<v Speaker 1>You actually set up a base over there.</v>

1107
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.420
<v Speaker 1>That'd be really cool and people would be excited to know that shit.</v>

1108
00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.681
<v Speaker 1>What did I really,</v>

1109
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:10.120
<v Speaker 1>would you think about like what Roy Jones spent stretching of acts?</v>

1110
00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:10.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not done.</v>

1111
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.100
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be your shit.</v>

1112
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Segura stretch of the highway.</v>

1113
00:30:15.011 --> 00:30:15.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not done yet.</v>

1114
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:16.421
<v Speaker 1>If you look at,</v>

1115
00:30:16.421 --> 00:30:17.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1116
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:18.460
<v Speaker 1>you know a guy like Roy Jones,</v>

1117
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.900
<v Speaker 1>how much do you think he made?</v>

1118
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.620
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1119
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:21.453
<v Speaker 1>it had to be,</v>

1120
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.060
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1121
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I want to say 100 million.</v>

1122
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I say that's not that.</v>

1123
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:26.800
<v Speaker 1>That's probably accurate probably around that.</v>

1124
00:30:26.801 --> 00:30:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1125
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.470
<v Speaker 1>So it out of $100 million,</v>

1126
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:33.220
<v Speaker 1>let's get super crazy and say you have to pay 48%,</v>

1127
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:36.490
<v Speaker 1>cause that's like the highest you can pay without tax shelters and all that</v>

1128
00:30:36.491 --> 00:30:39.400
<v Speaker 1>stuff that I'm sure a smart person would figure out or a good accountant.</v>

1129
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.030
<v Speaker 1>So let's say he paid $48 million,</v>

1130
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:43.870
<v Speaker 1>so let's just go nutty.</v>

1131
00:30:43.871 --> 00:30:44.620
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>

1132
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.610
<v Speaker 1>he used that as a number.</v>

1133
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.010
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1134
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:51.010
<v Speaker 1>48 million supports and army firmware.</v>

1135
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:52.600
<v Speaker 1>That's like what did he,</v>

1136
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:52.810
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:46.050
<v Speaker 1>well you need to get someone to do a counterpoint to Robb wolf cause Robb Wolf.</v>

1383
00:36:46.051 --> 00:36:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I had the Paleo Diet Guy Peale,</v>

1384
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.260
<v Speaker 1>the author of the Paleo Solution,</v>

1385
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:50.730
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

1386
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:54.090
<v Speaker 1>bacon and eggs for breakfast.</v>

1387
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:54.451
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1388
00:36:54.451 --> 00:36:54.931
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1389
00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:55.764
<v Speaker 1>I want to blow you.</v>

1390
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:58.440
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1391
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating Kale shakes every day trying to stay healthy.</v>

1392
00:37:00.841 --> 00:37:02.930
<v Speaker 1>And this guy says coffee bic and an accident.</v>

1393
00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:03.870
<v Speaker 1>But I tried it,</v>

1394
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:05.730
<v Speaker 1>but I'm telling you it's not correct.</v>

1395
00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.910
<v Speaker 1>The year you have this heavy feeling of like,</v>

1396
00:37:08.911 --> 00:37:09.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1397
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1398
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.290
<v Speaker 1>let's take the cigarettes for</v>

1399
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.070
<v Speaker 1>the coffee's supposed to counteract,</v>

1400
00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:15.840
<v Speaker 1>but it can't fuck with Kale shakes.</v>

1401
00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:16.270
<v Speaker 1>These kit,</v>

1402
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:18.300
<v Speaker 1>the my morning Kale shake is just,</v>

1403
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.550
<v Speaker 1>it's either that for me or hemp shakes,</v>

1404
00:37:20.551 --> 00:37:23.220
<v Speaker 1>that's all I drink in the morning and I have lots of energy,</v>

1405
00:37:23.221 --> 00:37:24.690
<v Speaker 1>like plenty of energy during the day.</v>

1406
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:25.763
<v Speaker 1>I think we have,</v>

1407
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.430
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to be careful about how much stupid shit we put in our bodies.</v>

1408
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:33.210
<v Speaker 1>And I would rather have no like putting nothing in there then stupid shit.</v>

1409
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Not that big and an is necessarily stupid shit.</v>

1410
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.300
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>

1411
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.050
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>

1412
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:39.690
<v Speaker 1>And I think your body processes fat and all that stuff.</v>

1413
00:37:39.691 --> 00:37:40.890
<v Speaker 1>It can process all those things.</v>

1414
00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:41.724
<v Speaker 1>It's all natural,</v>

1415
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:42.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as,</v>

1416
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:47.530
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't give you the same like clean feeling as like starting off with a</v>

1417
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:48.480
<v Speaker 1>vegetable shake.</v>

1418
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1419
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.160

<v Speaker 1>That story too.</v>

1439
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:19.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1440
00:38:19.251 --> 00:38:19.891
<v Speaker 1>it's fantastic.</v>

1441
00:38:19.891 --> 00:38:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1442
00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.070
<v Speaker 1>It was at a friend's house and the dude had an eye dropper and a,</v>

1443
00:38:23.071 --> 00:38:25.770
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know there was acid in the eye dropper and you needed to clean his</v>

1444
00:38:25.771 --> 00:38:26.410
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

1445
00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:28.980
<v Speaker 1>So he was back in Japan because in Japan,</v>

1446
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.830
<v Speaker 1>eight drops of acid in his eyes,</v>

1447
00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:32.311
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

1448
00:38:32.311 --> 00:38:33.270
<v Speaker 1>it's unheard of.</v>

1449
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1450
00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.440
<v Speaker 1>somebody told me the other day,</v>

1451
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:35.691
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1452
00:38:35.691 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1453
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.700
<v Speaker 3>that Joey Diaz did that to Jay more like,</v>

1454
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:42.310
<v Speaker 3>like at a party really tricked him.</v>

1455
00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:46.480
<v Speaker 3>And in saying that that was acid and Jay Moore was like freaking out.</v>

1456
00:38:46.481 --> 00:38:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Like that's some other comic told me to.</v>

1457
00:38:48.251 --> 00:38:49.150
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know if it's true or not.</v>

1458
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:49.984
<v Speaker 3>As long time ago,</v>

1459
00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:50.980
<v Speaker 3>like a long time ago.</v>

1460
00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:51.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1461
00:38:51.391 --> 00:38:52.890
<v Speaker 1>You're going to start another campus.</v>

1462
00:38:52.891 --> 00:38:56.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's a more is going to be mad at you again.</v>

1463
00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.970
<v Speaker 3>Supposedly the story goes that Jay Moore was really freaking out.</v>

1464
00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:00.360
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

1465
00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.320
<v Speaker 3>he was fucking with him though.</v>

1466
00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:01.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1467
00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.150
<v Speaker 3>And Jodi has was fucking with him the whole time.</v>

1468
00:39:03.151 --> 00:39:03.810
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't acid,</v>

1469
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.730
<v Speaker 3>but like Jay Moore was freaking out because he was like,</v>

1470
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.630
<v Speaker 3>what does that really acid?</v>

1471
00:39:06.631 --> 00:39:07.464
<v Speaker 3>What does that really,</v>

1472
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:07.861
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1473
00:39:07.861 --> 00:39:09.450
<v Speaker 1>that's like what we were talking about,</v>

1474
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:09.871
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1475
00:39:09.871 --> 00:39:10.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1476
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:10.951
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1477
00:39:10.951 --> 00:39:12.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what the phobia is.</v>

1478
00:39:12.751 --> 00:39:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Were you there that people,</v>

1479
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:15.643
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1480
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I really wish I could remember the word because I looked up the word that I</v>

1481
00:39:19.231 --> 00:39:19.861
<v Speaker 1>thought it was not,</v>

1482
00:39:19.861 --> 00:39:21.150
<v Speaker 1>it's not Ella phrenia,</v>

1483
00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:22.163
<v Speaker 1>Ella phrenia.</v>

1484
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

1485
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.051
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1486
00:39:23.051 --> 00:39:24.000
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that what I said already,</v>

1487
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.880
<v Speaker 1>that that's about the someone's crazy and you're around them kind of thing,</v>

1488
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:27.540
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1489
00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.373
<v Speaker 1>that thing,</v>

1490
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:29.450
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1491
00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:29.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1492
00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:30.061
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1493
00:39:30.061 --> 00:39:34.560
<v Speaker 1>it kind of makes sense that if someone starts treating you like you're crazy.</v>

1494
00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1495
00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:35.760
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1496
00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.240
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

1497
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:36.481
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1498
00:39:36.481 --> 00:39:38.670
<v Speaker 1>and then you start to maybe a dad,</v>

1499
00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.040
<v Speaker 1>like you start to act in the behavior that they've,</v>

1500
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.060
<v Speaker 1>their conditioning you to acton.</v>

1501
00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:44.183
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1502
00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:45.460
<v Speaker 1>My ex girlfriends.</v>

1503
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:46.583
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you,</v>

1504
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.130
<v Speaker 1>that's how you control them.</v>

1505
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Jets.</v>

1506
00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:49.951
<v Speaker 1>I'm crazy.</v>

1507
00:39:49.951 --> 00:39:52.810
<v Speaker 1>And then grades event and stick your penis inside of them until it,</v>

1508
00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.960
<v Speaker 1>until it doesn't feel good anymore.</v>

1509
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:57.450
<v Speaker 1>And then blame everything on them.</v>

1510
00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:00.030
<v Speaker 1>And then what else is the move?</v>

1511
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.553
<v Speaker 1>Get Fat.</v>

1512
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.280
<v Speaker 1>That's a good move.</v>

1513
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.180
<v Speaker 1>That's how you get rid of him.</v>

1514
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:04.501
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1515
00:40:04.501 --> 00:40:04.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1516
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:05.130
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

1517
00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to offer the Vegan point of view,</v>

1518
00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1519
00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:07.671
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>

1520
00:40:07.671 --> 00:40:08.121
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1521
00:40:08.121 --> 00:40:08.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1522
00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I shit on vegans enough and uh,</v>

1523
00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:11.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people up.</v>

1524
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.180
<v Speaker 3>Why can't people just eat me?</v>

1525
00:40:14.181 --> 00:40:15.320
<v Speaker 3>And if you want to eat a little Vegan,</v>

1526
00:40:15.321 --> 00:40:16.250
<v Speaker 3>like I consider Vegan,</v>

1527
00:40:16.251 --> 00:40:17.660
<v Speaker 3>like I'm eating Italian tonight.</v>

1528
00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:18.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1529
00:40:18.271 --> 00:40:19.051
<v Speaker 1>they don't though.</v>

1530
00:40:19.051 --> 00:40:20.490
<v Speaker 1>That's what's fascinating about it.</v>

1531
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1532
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:21.840
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of,</v>

1533
00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a lifestyle choice.</v>

1534
00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:23.911
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1535
00:40:23.911 --> 00:40:24.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1536
00:40:24.181 --> 00:40:28.890
<v Speaker 1>you're making a decision that you don't want to do anything that's going to harm</v>

1537
00:40:28.891 --> 00:40:29.581
<v Speaker 1>the environment.</v>

1538
00:40:29.581 --> 00:40:33.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to do anything that's gonna make your footprint larger.</v>

1539
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:34.523
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of,</v>

1540
00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.670
<v Speaker 1>I see the point,</v>

1541
00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:36.953
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1542
00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.700
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to kill the animals.</v>

1543
00:40:38.701 --> 00:40:38.831
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1544
00:40:38.831 --> 00:40:39.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1545
00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:40.080
<v Speaker 1>you have to kill them.</v>

1546
00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh glass.</v>

1547
00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:43.440
<v Speaker 1>You're going to start sterilizing them at birth and then who the fuck are you to</v>

1548
00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:44.274
<v Speaker 1>play doctor?</v>

1549
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.740
<v Speaker 1>You can just chop off a deer's balls.</v>

1550
00:40:46.741 --> 00:40:47.460
<v Speaker 1>You've got to kill him.</v>

1551
00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to bring Fogo de Chao that day.</v>

1552
00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to eat this today.</v>

1553
00:40:51.651 --> 00:40:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Who Little Shit did you son of a bitch and said don't do that.</v>

1554
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.070
<v Speaker 1>What about the smell of burning meet is to like a person who's a super hardcore</v>

1555
00:40:59.071 --> 00:40:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Vegan?</v>

1556
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Probably nauseates them.</v>

1557
00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know they're not supposed to have honey.</v>

1558
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

1559
00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Because bees are slave.</v>

1560
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck on that man.</v>

1561
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.673
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that shit.</v>

1562
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:15.120
<v Speaker 1>I got 10 minutes on vegans in my new a new hour.</v>

1563
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1564
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:16.650
<v Speaker 1>it's quite be 10 minutes.</v>

1565
00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:17.491
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

1566
00:41:17.491 --> 00:41:18.150
<v Speaker 1>That's just so,</v>

1567
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.970
<v Speaker 1>there's so much silliness we get.</v>

1568
00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:23.250
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like being a Mormon and vegans like right up there with being a</v>

1569
00:41:23.251 --> 00:41:24.084
<v Speaker 1>Mormon.</v>

1570
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:24.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like at the,</v>

1571
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.590
<v Speaker 1>at the end of it you're like,</v>

1572
00:41:25.591 --> 00:41:25.771
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1573
00:41:25.771 --> 00:41:25.921
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1574
00:41:25.921 --> 00:41:26.051
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

1575
00:41:26.051 --> 00:41:26.171
<v Speaker 1>You wait.</v>

1576
00:41:26.171 --> 00:41:26.461
<v Speaker 1>And what?</v>

1577
00:41:26.461 --> 00:41:27.294
<v Speaker 1>Bees.</v>

1578
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:27.841
<v Speaker 1>Bees.</v>

1579
00:41:27.841 --> 00:41:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Bees are slaves.</v>

1580
00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.150
<v Speaker 1>It seems so extreme.</v>

1581
00:41:30.151 --> 00:41:30.480

1601
00:41:56.781 --> 00:42:00.510

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1603
00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.980
<v Speaker 1>He's just taking the honey from these beans.</v>

1604
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:06.980

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.990
<v Speaker 1>You're telling me that we can't figure out honey and it's delicious.</v>

1607
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Honey is awesome.</v>

1608
00:42:13.401 --> 00:42:14.690
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to make it.</v>

1609
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.680
<v Speaker 1>These dumb cunt insects make it.</v>

1610
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Can we steal it from them?</v>

1611
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:20.420
<v Speaker 1>The way we steal it from there was with smoke,</v>

1612
00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.810
<v Speaker 1>these fucking stupid ass holes and then they will blow smoke on them.</v>

1613
00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Then you scoop them up with a kitty litter shovel and you put them in a box and</v>

1614
00:42:27.771 --> 00:42:31.430
<v Speaker 1>you close the stupid box and they buzz around for a little while and then you</v>

1615
00:42:31.431 --> 00:42:36.050
<v Speaker 1>take all their fucking honey and you hack off those little babies that are</v>

1616
00:42:36.051 --> 00:42:36.681
<v Speaker 1>growing in there.</v>

1617
00:42:36.681 --> 00:42:38.170
<v Speaker 1>You get the fuck out of here.</v>

1618
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.940
<v Speaker 1>This little embryos that are in there cut all that shit out.</v>

1619
00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:41.810
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessary.</v>

1620
00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Just kept me to that honey spot is bare likes.</v>

1621
00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Here's the hive.</v>

1622
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Is all the embryos and the honey altogether in the same thing?</v>

1623
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.520
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1624
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know cause that was always fascinating when I was a kid and I would find</v>

1625
00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.230
<v Speaker 1>a beehive on the ground that you do that and like open them up.</v>

1626
00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1627
00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:58.671
<v Speaker 1>How weird was that?</v>

1628
00:42:58.671 --> 00:43:00.260
<v Speaker 1>When you see them in the little shuttle,</v>

1629
00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:01.700
<v Speaker 1>the little fucking pop.</v>

1630
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.330
<v Speaker 1>They mean they're just like the alien.</v>

1631
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.440
<v Speaker 1>They're just really tired.</v>

1632
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:07.880
<v Speaker 1>They're miniature aliens.</v>

1633
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1634
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you watch them fuck up other insects.</v>

1635
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Queen especially wasps.</v>

1636
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1637
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:18.430
<v Speaker 1>There's a crazy documentary where it details this one wasp attack where they</v>

1638
00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:23.540
<v Speaker 1>came in and killed these honeybees and it was an enormous wasp.</v>

1639
00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:26.960
<v Speaker 1>They were way bigger than the honeybees and it just comes in and just starts</v>

1640
00:43:26.961 --> 00:43:28.520
<v Speaker 1>cutting the heads off the honeybees</v>

1641
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:31.311
<v Speaker 1>and these,</v>

1642
00:43:31.311 --> 00:43:33.080
<v Speaker 1>this one swarm,</v>

1643
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:38.290
<v Speaker 1>this like thousand fucking honeybee colony was killed by like 30 of these wasps.</v>

1644
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.630
<v Speaker 1>And it is fucking tough to watch man.</v>

1645
00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:42.200
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

1646

00:43:43.201 --> 00:43:45.020
<v Speaker 1>what would we do if these things were our size?</v>

1649
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.501
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

1650

<v Speaker 1>I got up,</v>

1653
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:51.800
<v Speaker 1>I walked into a wasp nest one time like in Berwyn was and they just fucking,</v>

1654
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.630

<v Speaker 1>the thing about bees too,</v>

1661
00:43:58.761 --> 00:44:00.710
<v Speaker 1>I found out that the queen has a stinger,</v>

1662
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1663
00:44:01.371 --> 00:44:02.630
<v Speaker 1>the Queen Bee has a stinger,</v>

1664
00:44:02.631 --> 00:44:05.120
<v Speaker 1>but she only uses it to kill Queens.</v>

1665
00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:06.111
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1666

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1667
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:08.720
<v Speaker 1>They use it to kill virgin queens.</v>

1668
00:44:08.721 --> 00:44:10.040
<v Speaker 1>They use it when you,</v>

1669
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:11.510
<v Speaker 1>when you find a new queen,</v>

1670
00:44:11.511 --> 00:44:14.150
<v Speaker 1>like when someone's getting together and putting together a new queen.</v>

1671
00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1672
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:18.080
<v Speaker 1>You got to Jack that bitch or she'll come to take your spot because it can only</v>

1673
00:44:18.081 --> 00:44:19.790
<v Speaker 1>be like one queen the nest.</v>

1674
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.340
<v Speaker 1>So they don't use it just on,</v>

1675
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1676
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:24.590
<v Speaker 1>on Queens when they're out,</v>

1677
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.840
<v Speaker 1>they'll fuck up queen embryos.</v>

1678
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:27.741
<v Speaker 1>They'll fuck up.</v>

1679
00:44:27.741 --> 00:44:28.130

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:29.810
<v Speaker 1>What does it feed is,</v>

1682
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.431
<v Speaker 1>what is the,</v>

1683
00:44:30.431 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the term for an insect fetus and the idea of Brian is it,</v>

1684
00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.630
<v Speaker 1>it's not an embryo rather than write whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1685
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:36.751
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1686
00:44:36.751 --> 00:44:36.980
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1687
00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:37.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1688
00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.230
<v Speaker 1>the infant thing inside the honeycomb,</v>

1689
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:44.250
<v Speaker 1>they stabbed him in the side and that's how they know when they've been attacked</v>

1690
00:44:44.251 --> 00:44:45.210
<v Speaker 1>by another queen.</v>

1691
00:44:45.211 --> 00:44:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Like she knows there's a hooker in that box.</v>

1692
00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:48.000
<v Speaker 1>She's going to go,</v>

1693
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.550
<v Speaker 1>so just stabs it with her ass.</v>

1694
00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.010
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what they're hooked.</v>

1695
00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:53.851
<v Speaker 1>Their stingers for.</v>

1696
00:44:53.851 --> 00:44:54.331
<v Speaker 1>Their stingers,</v>

1697
00:44:54.331 --> 00:44:55.740
<v Speaker 1>not a stinger that injects venom.</v>

1698
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.620
<v Speaker 1>It's just a sore sore to kill the babies.</v>

1699
00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:01.830
<v Speaker 1>We're so lucky.</v>

1700
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:04.140
<v Speaker 1>We're so lucky.</v>

1701
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.570
<v Speaker 1>They're little,</v>

1702
00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:07.470
<v Speaker 1>those huge evil fucking cons.</v>

1706
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:14.400
<v Speaker 1>We need to figure out a way to get honey through little robots,</v>

1707
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.680
<v Speaker 1>little tiny ass robot bees.</v>

1708
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.710
<v Speaker 1>We should make drones that look like bees make honey.</v>

1709
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.850
<v Speaker 1>And how about we make drones and just look like B's except they're way stronger</v>

1710
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:27.380
<v Speaker 1>and harder and they come in and fuck all the bees in front of their boyfriends.</v>

1711
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Imagine it'd be like robot bees with giant robot be dicks like dog,</v>

1712
00:45:31.501 --> 00:45:32.820
<v Speaker 1>like a steaming dog size.</v>

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:37.440

1940
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.320

00:51:20.631 --> 00:51:24.740
<v Speaker 1>You guys are the fucking coolest human beings we've ever come in contact with.</v>

1951
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:25.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1952
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:25.551
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1953
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:26.870
<v Speaker 1>we talk about it all the time.</v>

1954
00:51:26.871 --> 00:51:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1955
00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:28.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1956
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Aubrey talks about it when he deals with customers at on it and,</v>

1957
00:51:31.311 --> 00:51:31.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1958
00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:32.950
<v Speaker 1>we talk about it when,</v>

1959
00:51:32.951 --> 00:51:36.710
<v Speaker 1>when we do these comedy shows where we're lucky as fuck man,</v>

1960
00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:40.010
<v Speaker 1>and just whatever we're sending out there,</v>

1961
00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:44.390
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you guys are picking it up in such a positive way and responding</v>

1962
00:51:44.391 --> 00:51:45.440
<v Speaker 1>in such a positive way.</v>

1963
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1964
00:51:46.041 --> 00:51:48.050
<v Speaker 1>there's no way to say this without sounding Super Corny,</v>

1965
00:51:48.051 --> 00:51:50.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's enriched the fuck out of all of our lives.</v>

1966
00:51:50.301 --> 00:51:55.301
<v Speaker 1>It's made us feel like we're really connected to something that can really help</v>

1967
00:51:55.461 --> 00:51:57.080
<v Speaker 1>and change the way people feel and don't,</v>

1968
00:51:57.081 --> 00:51:59.750
<v Speaker 1>don't think we think that is a,</v>

1969
00:51:59.751 --> 00:52:01.190
<v Speaker 1>in any small way.</v>

1970
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1971
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.593
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1972
00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I did just don't think that we ever take it for granted.</v>

1973
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:08.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1974
00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1975
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing to talk about it because it's,</v>

1976
00:52:10.761 --> 00:52:11.594
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1977
00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:11.890
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1978
00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:12.310
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

1979
00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:12.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1980
00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:12.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1981
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:15.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a very strange situation to find yourself in it when,</v>

1982
00:52:15.861 --> 00:52:16.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1983
00:52:16.161 --> 00:52:20.060
<v Speaker 1>we just started doing this podcast just fucking around and you know,</v>

1984
00:52:20.061 --> 00:52:22.460
<v Speaker 1>thinking we're just going to talk shit and put on the Internet and maybe people</v>

1985
00:52:22.461 --> 00:52:23.120
<v Speaker 1>would giggle.</v>

1986
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.560
<v Speaker 1>And then having people come up to me,</v>

1987
00:52:24.561 --> 00:52:26.180
<v Speaker 1>like everywhere I go telling me now I've,</v>

1988
00:52:26.181 --> 00:52:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I've lost 50 pounds.</v>

1989
00:52:27.261 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 1>I started doing Jujitsu,</v>

1990
00:52:28.341 --> 00:52:29.061
<v Speaker 1>I changed my life,</v>

1991
00:52:29.061 --> 00:52:30.210
<v Speaker 1>started reading the war of art.</v>

1992
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I didn't shoot myself.</v>

1993
00:52:31.701 --> 00:52:32.720
<v Speaker 1>We hear that all the time.</v>

1994
00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:34.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the scary one.</v>

1995
00:52:34.041 --> 00:52:35.090
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the scary ones.</v>

1996
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:35.571
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1997
00:52:35.571 --> 00:52:37.230
<v Speaker 1>people that said they,</v>

1998
00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:40.070
<v Speaker 1>they don't have anybody like us near them.</v>

1999
00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.870
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that they don't think like us,</v>

2000
00:52:41.871 --> 00:52:43.070
<v Speaker 1>they think just like us.</v>

2001
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:43.431
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2002
00:52:43.431 --> 00:52:43.671
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2003
00:52:43.671 --> 00:52:44.690
<v Speaker 1>they're free thinkers.</v>

2004
00:52:44.691 --> 00:52:45.530
<v Speaker 1>They're open minded,</v>

2005
00:52:45.531 --> 00:52:46.760
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to be nice to people.</v>

2006
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:50.720
<v Speaker 1>It's just sometimes we are defined by our environment,</v>

2007
00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.071
<v Speaker 1>but no long,</v>

2008
00:52:52.071 --> 00:52:52.904
<v Speaker 1>you fucks.</v>
