151
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>I felt like it was like he was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>the butcher.</v>

152
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 1>They said he's an asshole on set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in character man.</v>

153
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in character guys.</v>

154
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Two people played a bad motherfucker in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie.</v>

155
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 1>That movie gangs in New York is scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's underrated.</v>

156
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.353
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's scary because you imagine like </v>

157
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 1>what life was like if you were born into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that environment.</v>

158
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Cause those were real on whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that exactly happened with it.</v>

159
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:27.614
<v Speaker 1>Now how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm sure there's some sort of a </v>

160
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 1>dramatic flair that they added to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of that,</v>

161
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.593
<v Speaker 1>but whatever the fuck it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been places on earth that </v>

162
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 1>have existed where people hacked each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other up with axes and swords like that.</v>

163
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Just when you watch that and you realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

164
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.000
<v Speaker 1>that was the only like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 1>a few hundred years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that far.</v>

166
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Not that far in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indians and shit.</v>

167
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean with,</v>

168
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:52.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

169
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 1>I would retaliate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:57.020
<v Speaker 1>cause white man came and tried to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lands so the Indians were like,</v>

171
00:07:57.021 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>

173
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.760

<v Speaker 1>So it was just back and forth.</v>

174
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.590
<v Speaker 1>You got to worry about not just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bears and shit,</v>

175
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:10.424
<v Speaker 1>but you got to worry about an Indian's </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn that if the Indian spot you and </v>

176
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:15.440
<v Speaker 1>they want to fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

177

<v Speaker 1>to the people don't know about,</v>

178
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.310

<v Speaker 1>especially the Nez perce.</v>

179
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.653
<v Speaker 1>I just saw Steve Rinella told me about </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this shit when I was hanging with </v>

<v Speaker 1>went hunting with him.</v>

181
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Are there any stories terrifying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there any stories?</v>

182
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.523
<v Speaker 1>There must be stories of slaves that </v>
<v Speaker 1>escaped and went and hid out with </v>

183
00:08:37.671 --> 00:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well you know what,</v>

194
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:16.140

195
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:17.083
<v Speaker 1>and being on the Indian side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding that that was being taken </v>

213
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.143
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a lot going on there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like to say that the white people </v>

214
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:24.820
<v Speaker 1>feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's true though.</v>

215
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:25.743
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

00:16:28.021 --> 00:16:29.590
<v Speaker 4>she's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

348
00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:32.010
<v Speaker 4>from there I just grabbed him and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't know what to say.</v>

349
00:16:32.011 --> 00:16:32.601
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

350
00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:35.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm so proud of the champ and he just </v>
<v Speaker 4>put a thumbs up.</v>

351
00:16:35.051 --> 00:16:37.800
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably be cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see me like stewie eyes like [inaudible]</v>

352
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.500
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my coach goes,</v>

353
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:41.420
<v Speaker 4>holy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the winner.</v>

354
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.200
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] does some about Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is,</v>

355
00:16:45.201 --> 00:16:49.040
<v Speaker 4>I got a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got an older brother theory and I feel</v>

356
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:53.180
<v Speaker 4>like dudes who have bad ass older </v>
<v Speaker 4>brothers can fucking take it.</v>

357
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.050
<v Speaker 4>Like Weidman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weidman had an older brother and him and</v>

358
00:16:57.051 --> 00:16:59.060
<v Speaker 4>the older brother apparently according </v>
<v Speaker 4>to some of his interviews,</v>

359
00:16:59.061 --> 00:16:59.641
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

360
00:16:59.641 --> 00:17:01.070
<v Speaker 4>and his older brother beat him up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>

361
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.890
<v Speaker 4>man makes you tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Matt Hughes,</v>

362
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.753
<v Speaker 4>two twins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine looking at yourself every day </v>

363
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:11.950
<v Speaker 4>just trying to beat up your shot wrap </v>
<v Speaker 4>and just a dead even every fucking time.</v>

364
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:13.640
<v Speaker 4>Just a war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim Miller,</v>

365
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.400
<v Speaker 4>Dan Miller,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these two guys.</v>

366
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.380
<v Speaker 4>My brother used to beat me up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I never,</v>

367
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not beat me up,</v>

368
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:22.530
<v Speaker 4>but just like a sock my shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like about what?</v>

369
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 4>Fart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He socked me full.</v>

370
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.760
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to sit there and I would take </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

371
00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:28.470
<v Speaker 4>I would never fight back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like in,</v>

372
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.430
<v Speaker 4>in box and there's the Smith family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Liam Smith.</v>

373
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.390
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although Smith,</v>

374
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.253
<v Speaker 4>there's four brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a three are world champions called </v>

375
00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.340
<v Speaker 4>Miller and Michael Miller.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just fuck.</v>

376
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Savages.</v>

377
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.800
<v Speaker 4>Monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man Does a tums on brothers.</v>

378
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:42.840
<v Speaker 4>The lozan brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brothers,</v>

379
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.900
<v Speaker 4>Nogueira brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

380
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.070
<v Speaker 4>Twins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're right too.</v>

381
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.030
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

382
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:49.220
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many mud shogun and Ninja.</v>

383
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.860
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

384
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.400
<v Speaker 4>here's something that fucking rock your </v>
<v Speaker 4>world or not rock your world.</v>

385
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.810
<v Speaker 4>But if John Jones wasn't such,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

386
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 4>a fuck up for lack of better terms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would,</v>

387
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.640
<v Speaker 4>we're not even having this conversation </v>
<v Speaker 4>that mighty mouse is the best ever.</v>

388
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.550
<v Speaker 4>He'd be just going based off his regular</v>
<v Speaker 4>schedule now.</v>

389
00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:08.220
<v Speaker 4>He'd be 13,</v>
<v Speaker 4>14 time world champ if no one beat him.</v>

390
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.233
<v Speaker 4>And he'd probably be fighting that </v>
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight and having that belt to go </v>

391
00:18:11.021 --> 00:18:13.050
<v Speaker 4>down as best ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

392
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.640
<v Speaker 4>he's still got a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

393
00:18:14.641 --> 00:18:15.474
<v Speaker 4>John John's only 30 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is crazy because that means he's </v>

394
00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:21.960
<v Speaker 4>really about to jump into his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say like an athlete's prime for combat</v>

395
00:18:21.961 --> 00:18:22.794
<v Speaker 4>sports.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's somewhere around 30 to </v>

396
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:27.000
<v Speaker 4>32 for heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>

397
00:18:27.001 --> 00:18:28.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't think everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the lighter weight classes,</v>

398
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:30.720
<v Speaker 4>it's earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but look at the welterweights,</v>

399
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.633
<v Speaker 4>the t,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the champs are always aligned around </v>

400
00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:36.060
<v Speaker 4>that age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Except for GSP.</v>

401
00:18:36.061 --> 00:18:40.050
<v Speaker 4>I think he won a title when he was in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his late twenties,</v>

402
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.240
<v Speaker 4>twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When is tyron Woodley's what,</v>

403
00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:44.580
<v Speaker 4>33 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

404
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:45.241
<v Speaker 4>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

405
00:18:45.241 --> 00:18:47.580
<v Speaker 4>he had wrestling background.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Jones,</v>

406
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.700
<v Speaker 4>what was wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How old's Robbie?</v>

407
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm Jon Jones is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his suspension comes up in July.</v>

408
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.850
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear what Dana White said today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I texted to you.</v>

409
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to fight.</v>

410
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.230
<v Speaker 4>There was a Nakamoto,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

411
00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.093
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brett accomo interviewed Dana White and </v>

412
00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.420
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from espn he said that,</v>

413
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>DC,</v>

414
00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.080
<v Speaker 4>we'll fight Jon Jones if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

415
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.280
<v Speaker 4>but if John Jones isn't ready by it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the July card.</v>

416
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.670
<v Speaker 4>Was it July 29th?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

417
00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:12.504
<v Speaker 4>If he's not ready by then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then he's gonna Fight Jimi Manoa and </v>

418
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.160
<v Speaker 4>then they'll fight down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

419
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.440
<v Speaker 4>So no warm up for Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he doesn't want one,</v>

420
00:19:19.441 --> 00:19:22.050
<v Speaker 4>then what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's smart for John?</v>

421
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.730
<v Speaker 4>What do you think John should take a </v>
<v Speaker 4>warm up?</v>

422
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:24.923
<v Speaker 4>He should take a warm up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The UFC should give them a warmup cause </v>

423
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.040
<v Speaker 4>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when has it ever worked when a guy takes</v>

424
00:19:29.041 --> 00:19:31.980
<v Speaker 4>this much time off and just throw them </v>
<v Speaker 4>right to the top of the heap?</v>

425
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.163
<v Speaker 4>Think of chill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sewn in like there's a lot of guys and </v>

426
00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:36.990
<v Speaker 4>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well dominick Cruz,</v>

427
00:19:36.991 --> 00:19:38.490
<v Speaker 4>dominick Cruz didn't fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cody Garbrandt,</v>

428
00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:41.860
<v Speaker 4>Tj dillashaw after all that time he </v>
<v Speaker 4>found up Ms Asakia,</v>

429
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:42.703
<v Speaker 4>who's a tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a cocky and then he went right </v>

430
00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:47.010
<v Speaker 4>into tj.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Still a warm about Tj was,</v>

431
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:48.690
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the teacher was a big gap.</v>

432
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.093
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least he didn't fight that first </v>

433
00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:52.760
<v Speaker 4>fight back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He ain't being tj.</v>

434
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:53.723
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know that he got injured after </v>

435
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:58.730
<v Speaker 4>the Mitzi gawky fight and it was another</v>
<v Speaker 4>year plus [inaudible] fought again.</v>

436
00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.720
<v Speaker 4>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he might be the outlier here,</v>

437
00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:02.550
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just saying he's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

438
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:03.523
<v Speaker 4>but he's not as good in the first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at them at the Tj fight and </v>

439
00:20:06.781 --> 00:20:09.270
<v Speaker 4>then you look at him in the second fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he fought uriah faber,</v>

440
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.790
<v Speaker 4>he's way better in the of fape.</v>

441
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.210
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's more lean.</v>

442
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.640
<v Speaker 4>He's fitter and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he dealt with a lot of the problems that</v>

443
00:20:14.641 --> 00:20:16.820
<v Speaker 4>he has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His serious plantar fasciitis,</v>

444
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.673
<v Speaker 4>ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever had that fucking </v>

445
00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:20.300
<v Speaker 4>nightmare?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had to deal with it.</v>

446
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.970
<v Speaker 4>And you look at his style,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

447
00:20:22.971 --> 00:20:25.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this Fascia in the bottom of your feet,</v>

448
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.510
<v Speaker 4>tears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't even like,</v>

449
00:20:27.511 --> 00:20:30.660
<v Speaker 4>you can't get out of bed to warm up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking nightmare.</v>

450
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.330
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dominick Cruz is all footwork.</v>

451
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.583
<v Speaker 4>And what happened after he tore his acl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He took a long time off and his feet </v>

452
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.263
<v Speaker 4>just weren't strong enough to keep up </v>
<v Speaker 4>with his training because this training </v>

453
00:20:41.971 --> 00:20:44.920
<v Speaker 4>is so foot movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

454
00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.830
<v Speaker 4>That's all my it back to the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should John Get a warm up?</v>

455
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.790
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in the grand scheme of things.</v>

456
00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:52.624
<v Speaker 4>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want these big paydays and you want </v>

457
00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:56.110
<v Speaker 4>them the big rating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he tossed them DC.</v>

458
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.400
<v Speaker 4>John Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a huge raider,</v>

459
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:58.343
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if something happens like Rhonda </v>

460
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.390
<v Speaker 4>Rousey lost weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we gave Rhonda Warmup,</v>

461
00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.910
<v Speaker 4>so you get paid on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's huge drawl.</v>

462
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.030
<v Speaker 4>And then she fights the huge draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you just toss them right to the</v>

463
00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 4>very top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a one and done man.</v>

464
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.140
<v Speaker 4>What does it make sense to me where they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were worried,</v>

465
00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:13.390
<v Speaker 4>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know with the sale,</v>

466
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.060
<v Speaker 4>you know you buy something like $4 </v>
<v Speaker 4>billion,</v>

467
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.160
<v Speaker 4>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to maximize your profits.</v>

468
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:19.023
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just the issue comes up with </v>

469
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.500
<v Speaker 4>purists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think all of us are purists,</v>

470
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.363
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you consider like when you look at </v>

471
00:21:25.421 --> 00:21:26.800
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like at the end of the day,</v>

472
00:21:26.801 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 4>I want to see the number one contender </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight the champ.</v>

473
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.113
<v Speaker 4>I ride the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get the business side from what the </v>

474
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.840
<v Speaker 4>they want to do and then I get from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pure fighter standpoint.</v>

475
00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.693
<v Speaker 4>I was just about to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a hypocrite because I was happy </v>

476
00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:40.360
<v Speaker 4>when Dan Henderson got that shot against</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Bisping.</v>

477
00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:42.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what we want to see or GSB.</v>

478
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 4>It makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fighting Bisbee well,</v>

479
00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:47.470
<v Speaker 4>the problem with the GSP business fi's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it ties up the division.</v>

480
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:51.340
<v Speaker 4>And when you have a guy like Robert </v>
<v Speaker 4>Whitaker who just ice is Jocko roy hole,</v>

481
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:56.260
<v Speaker 4>that's the best adjective to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a killer.</v>

482
00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.350
<v Speaker 4>Winokur's a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Straight killer.</v>

483
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.790
<v Speaker 4>Straight killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who beats him in the top three?</v>

484
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:01.723
<v Speaker 4>I liked his chance to get to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now Yoel Romero is such a freak show </v>

485
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.940
<v Speaker 4>such a free that sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you,</v>

486
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.310
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're 100% right.</v>

487
00:22:12.311 --> 00:22:13.390
<v Speaker 4>That it's a hell of a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

488
00:22:13.391 --> 00:22:14.224
<v Speaker 4>do you see Yoel Romero and chocolate?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think you'll beat jock </v>

489
00:22:16.841 --> 00:22:17.261
<v Speaker 4>gray.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

490
00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:19.570
<v Speaker 4>You could really give some of that fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>to Jock,</v>

491
00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:19.770
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

492
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:21.250
<v Speaker 4>Like you remember it was a split </v>
<v Speaker 4>decision.</v>

493
00:22:21.251 --> 00:22:22.084
<v Speaker 4>He had that one moment where he spun and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jock right with that spinning back fist </v>

494
00:22:25.471 --> 00:22:26.304
<v Speaker 4>and put 'em on Queer Boulevard occur.</v>
<v Speaker 4>May jock caray looked like a fucking </v>

495
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:30.743
<v Speaker 4>amateur.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just fucking hawked them down even at </v>

496
00:22:33.641 --> 00:22:34.474
<v Speaker 4>his back's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck out of here Jujitsu </v>

497
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.440
<v Speaker 4>vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See it.</v>

498
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:37.383
<v Speaker 4>I feel like whittaker is better now than</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever and I think he's only 25 or 26 26 </v>

499
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:43.060
<v Speaker 4>26 I think somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's no,</v>

500
00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:43.923
<v Speaker 4>no older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a young buck and he's coming up </v>

501
00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:47.164
<v Speaker 4>strong and he's another one that went </v>
<v Speaker 4>from one 70 to one 85 and improved </v>

502
00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:51.244
<v Speaker 4>tremendously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as he stopped cutting that </v>

503
00:22:52.631 --> 00:22:53.464
<v Speaker 4>radical amount of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden dude's got vitality and </v>

504
00:22:55.511 --> 00:22:57.880
<v Speaker 4>power is not in the band.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnson fight,</v>

505
00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:58.743
<v Speaker 4>the Bronson fight serious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a big wake up call to people </v>

506
00:23:01.091 --> 00:23:02.560
<v Speaker 4>cause [inaudible] was putting it on him.</v>

507
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.840
<v Speaker 4>Well Brunton rushed Adam Chin first and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

508
00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:06.310
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how's this gonna work out?</v>

509
00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:07.144
<v Speaker 4>And he'd covered up you smart compose </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then just yet those Australian </v>

510
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:11.974
<v Speaker 4>fucking shovel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fan now and I thought he's going </v>

511
00:23:14.981 --> 00:23:16.600
<v Speaker 4>to lose that fight and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>There was me and my man,</v>

514
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.770
<v Speaker 4>a dude from Australia fights a dude who </v>
<v Speaker 4>calls himself the alligator.</v>

515
00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:27.900
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

<v Speaker 4>fun.</v>

520
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:44.463
<v Speaker 4>That's what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we need that heavyweight and light </v>

521
00:23:45.921 --> 00:23:46.630
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight</v>

<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

523
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.363
<v Speaker 5>I guess you know what dc John King has </v>
<v Speaker 5>his fight each other every other </v>

524
00:23:51.591 --> 00:23:52.101
<v Speaker 5>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

525
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:53.570
<v Speaker 5>what did you think about rumble </v>
<v Speaker 5>retirement?</v>

526
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 5>When I went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I saw here's what happened,</v>

527
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They read off the submission.</v>

528
00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.810
<v Speaker 5>DC raised his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

529
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.653
<v Speaker 5>I'm going into interview DC and rumble </v>
<v Speaker 5>and DC are hugging and then DC puts his </v>

530
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:05.980
<v Speaker 5>hand on rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shoulders goes,</v>

531
00:24:05.981 --> 00:24:06.801
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go first,</v>

532
00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:08.000
<v Speaker 5>you go first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a bad idea,</v>

533
00:24:08.001 --> 00:24:08.691
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

534
00:24:08.691 --> 00:24:09.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it was a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

535
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:11.450
<v Speaker 5>I think it was classy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

536
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:14.030
<v Speaker 5>d this is what I think about DC at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>end of the day.</v>

537
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.090
<v Speaker 5>Daniel cormier is a really good man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great Guy.</v>

538
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.100
<v Speaker 5>He's a really good man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

539
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 5>Hate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't get it,</v>

540
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:21.291
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

541
00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:24.410
<v Speaker 5>he's competitive and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in before the fight he's saying,</v>

542
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:25.244
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's too bad that Anthony Johnson's in </v>

543
00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 5>my weight class because they'll never be</v>
<v Speaker 5>champion.</v>

544
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.453
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's saying all this shit that you're </v>

545
00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:30.950
<v Speaker 5>going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at the end of the day,</v>

546
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.360
<v Speaker 5>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a,</v>

547
00:24:32.361 --> 00:24:33.194
<v Speaker 5>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's on another level when it comes to </v>

548
00:24:34.401 --> 00:24:36.950
<v Speaker 5>his ability to compete there level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's another level,</v>

549
00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:38.123
<v Speaker 5>and just to critique the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're a DC looked at in the worst </v>

550
00:24:41.421 --> 00:24:42.254
<v Speaker 5>shape we've seen him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought if Anthony Johnson can beat </v>

551
00:24:44.121 --> 00:24:44.954
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this can be the time.</v>

552
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:45.913
<v Speaker 5>Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know going into it and if </v>

553
00:24:47.081 --> 00:24:48.680
<v Speaker 5>Johnson didn't want to fight or be in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

554
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.900
<v Speaker 5>he had one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you even talking about retiring,</v>

555
00:24:50.901 --> 00:24:53.950
<v Speaker 5>you're fucked with a guy like dc who's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to grind it out.</v>

556
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:54.843
<v Speaker 5>It was just not going to rumble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Johnson was about four inches from a </v>

557
00:24:57.621 --> 00:24:58.454
<v Speaker 5>head kick knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He caught him with the foot in the face </v>

558
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.680
<v Speaker 5>and broke his nose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he caught him with his Shin,</v>

559
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:04.783
<v Speaker 5>if he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know when you mean see where that </v>

560
00:25:05.451 --> 00:25:06.284
<v Speaker 5>kick landed him and you feel like God </v>
<v Speaker 5>damn toes Daniel Cormier can fucking </v>

561
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:10.610
<v Speaker 5>take it.</v>

562
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.030
<v Speaker 5>He can fucking take it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause he,</v>

563
00:25:12.031 --> 00:25:14.840
<v Speaker 5>he took that shot right in the chin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He went back to his corner.</v>

564
00:25:14.841 --> 00:25:17.420
<v Speaker 5>Is Nelson's clearly jack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're looking at an in between rounds.</v>

565
00:25:17.421 --> 00:25:20.360
<v Speaker 5>Like that looks really broken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Went out there like it didn't bother him</v>

566
00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:23.450
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was a good tune up fight for DC</v>

567
00:25:23.451 --> 00:25:25.050
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that Anthony Johnson's a tuneup,</v>

568
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.903
<v Speaker 5>but his game plan was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He obviously didn't execute the game </v>

569
00:25:28.821 --> 00:25:29.654
<v Speaker 5>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think that was good for DC cause I </v>

570
00:25:30.981 --> 00:25:33.440
<v Speaker 5>think if that DC fights John,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's in trouble.</v>

571
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.450
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what would've happened if </v>
<v Speaker 5>rumbled connected.</v>

572
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:38.810
<v Speaker 5>My question is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at this smack,</v>

573
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:40.490
<v Speaker 5>he catches him right with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost better.</v>

574
00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.900
<v Speaker 5>He bent down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his nose absorbs hell.</v>

575
00:25:43.901 --> 00:25:44.734
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those small knows to Jesus Christ in </v>

576
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.563
<v Speaker 5>combination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've never really seen DC with a gut </v>

577
00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:51.530
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well look it,</v>

578
00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:52.940
<v Speaker 5>obviously it wasn't affecting them.</v>

579
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.580
<v Speaker 5>Who knows if he's injured.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He probably was always injured.</v>

580
00:25:55.581 --> 00:25:57.050
<v Speaker 5>He's always doing some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scott,</v>

581
00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.240
<v Speaker 5>he's got a problem with his knee and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's had it.</v>

582
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.610
<v Speaker 5>He's had it worked on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just gets dumped cells in it.</v>

583
00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.300
<v Speaker 5>She's going to have 38 cause he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that kicked fully connected.</v>

584
00:26:05.301 --> 00:26:06.680
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just took out.</v>

585
00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.383
<v Speaker 5>He went down into it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I think you didn't get full </v>

586
00:26:09.561 --> 00:26:12.800
<v Speaker 5>momentum like you said with the Shin </v>
<v Speaker 5>where he met a lot of trouble.</v>

587
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.280
<v Speaker 5>It looked a lot harder than I thought it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>

588
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.070
<v Speaker 5>But it was certainly the foot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the thing about fetus,</v>

589
00:26:19.071 --> 00:26:20.570
<v Speaker 5>you can knock some of the fuck out with </v>
<v Speaker 5>a foot,</v>

590
00:26:20.571 --> 00:26:22.550
<v Speaker 5>no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But a foot gives a little bit.</v>

591
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just going to say it.</v>

592
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:28.040
<v Speaker 5>It gives a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

593
00:26:28.041 --> 00:26:31.190
<v Speaker 5>the first time I ever realized like how </v>
<v Speaker 5>much of a benefit that was.</v>

594
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:35.060
<v Speaker 5>I worked out with Maurice Smith and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Maury Smith was showing me like the,</v>

595
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.850
<v Speaker 5>when Maury Smith faces a heavy bag,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really interesting.</v>

596
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.240
<v Speaker 5>Like if he throws a roundhouse kick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bag goes straight.</v>

597
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 5>Like he hits it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he's hitting straight</v>

598
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:44.963
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like stepping to the side and </v>

599
00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:46.254
<v Speaker 4>hitting straight on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like he's hitting it with a </v>

600
00:26:47.911 --> 00:26:50.790
<v Speaker 4>front kick in terms of how the bag moves</v>
<v Speaker 4>away from him.</v>

601
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 4>And in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the taekwondo and karate days,</v>

602
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.623
<v Speaker 4>everybody went round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's round kicks and it was more like a </v>

603
00:26:57.571 --> 00:26:58.404
<v Speaker 4>slap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't have the same kind of </v>

604
00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:00.234
<v Speaker 4>penetration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you see like a Maury Smith </v>

605
00:27:01.771 --> 00:27:04.680
<v Speaker 4>where Pedro Hisdo to Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you remember when you and I went to,</v>

606
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.220
<v Speaker 4>we went to Beverly Hills Jujitsu way </v>
<v Speaker 4>back in the day,</v>

607
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.143
<v Speaker 4>way back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are purple belt went to Beverly </v>

608
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Hills and Jitsu and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we watched marco who was kicked the bag.</v>

609
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.291
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

610
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:18.060
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pedro Huizar was Pedro.</v>

611
00:27:18.061 --> 00:27:18.341
<v Speaker 4>His,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

612
00:27:18.341 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 4>was kicking the back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who else was too?</v>

613
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 4>But Pedro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

614
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:22.764
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never saw anybody in my life who had </v>

615
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.030
<v Speaker 4>lake kicks that were as scary as Pedro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

616
00:27:28.031 --> 00:27:30.690
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember he kicked Rico Rodriguez once</v>

617
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.673
<v Speaker 4>when they fought and the thud,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sub walk and you looked at it and </v>

620
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.250
<v Speaker 4>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's taking those.</v>

621
00:27:38.251 --> 00:27:41.160
<v Speaker 4>You can only take so many of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even randy couture was like,</v>

622
00:27:41.161 --> 00:27:41.970
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

623
00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:42.803
<v Speaker 4>he was on the show and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at my leg that's from fucking </v>

<v Speaker 4>Like for everybody.</v>

691
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:10.114

<v Speaker 4>beaten by Bj Penn and Bj took the title </v>

692
00:30:13.331 --> 00:30:14.164
<v Speaker 4>from him and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked him about it in the interview </v>

693
00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:17.471
<v Speaker 4>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>honestly,</v>

694
00:30:17.471 --> 00:30:19.780
<v Speaker 4>I have to tell you to relieve the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

696
00:30:21.431 --> 00:30:23.860
<v Speaker 4>everybody coming after you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's honestly a relief.</v>

<v Speaker 4>real,</v>

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.420
<v Speaker 4>it means being completely honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cool man.</v>

700
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.530
<v Speaker 4>Cause,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially as an athlete,</v>

701
00:30:32.531 --> 00:30:36.610
<v Speaker 4>especially for Anthony Johnson guy who </v>
<v Speaker 4>he identifies as being justified or he's</v>

702
00:30:36.611 --> 00:30:38.500
<v Speaker 4>rumble for him to go,</v>

<v Speaker 4>inspiring.</v>

707

<v Speaker 4>power in his hands.</v>

720
00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.403
<v Speaker 4>You got to realize as as a UFC fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a tip of the spear and that it's just </v>

<v Speaker 4>we know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't think doesn't work for her,</v>

726
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:35.770
<v Speaker 4>Which topic you're talking about with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first one with DC and the second one</v>

820
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.513
<v Speaker 4>A friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a student of mine that had a lot of </v>

821
00:35:18.201 --> 00:35:19.034
<v Speaker 4>money on a bet lean because you want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>borrow it for a month and tell a little </v>

<v Speaker 4>story like why he couldn't drive.</v>

827
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:31.783
<v Speaker 4>Because he owned a weed shop and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cops did not like when people were </v>

828
00:35:35.631 --> 00:35:38.010

<v Speaker 3>that they drive.</v>

833
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:46.770
<v Speaker 3>Like he had a whole psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach.</v>

<v Speaker 3>17 pound feet of torque.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is fucking insane.</v>

877
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:49.650
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's going to be clean asylums.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why?</v>

878
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.290
<v Speaker 3>Look at the giant fucking hold on back </v>
<v Speaker 3>that up again.</v>

879
00:37:52.291 --> 00:37:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Where the size tires in the rear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back it up just a little bit there.</v>

880
00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.100
<v Speaker 3>A little bit further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it goes.</v>

881
00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they got forties in the rear.</v>

882
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.553
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what production does that mean at least </v>

883
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:06.160
<v Speaker 3>a hundred is that what they're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Production car.</v>

884
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:08.460
<v Speaker 3>They keep calling it a production of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fastest production car.</v>

885
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.450
<v Speaker 3>It means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like,</v>

886
00:38:09.451 --> 00:38:11.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super like there's not like 10 of them.</v>

887
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:14.010
<v Speaker 3>Why did they put little tiny wheels in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the front?</v>

888
00:38:14.011 --> 00:38:14.844
<v Speaker 3>That's not the original.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the wheels that are coming </v>

889
00:38:16.531 --> 00:38:17.310
<v Speaker 3>with the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

890
00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:19.830
<v Speaker 3>That's what it has to wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to make them do wheelies.</v>

891
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.353
<v Speaker 3>I think they put those little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 3>wheels in the front because they're </v>

892
00:38:22.831 --> 00:38:23.664
<v Speaker 3>trying to make the car do wheelies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm assuming because it does pull a </v>

893
00:38:26.401 --> 00:38:28.570
<v Speaker 3>wheelie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the first production ever.</v>

894
00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need a Wheelie,</v>

895
00:38:31.651 --> 00:38:34.770
<v Speaker 3>but I think one of the ways they get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do a wheelies,</v>

896
00:38:34.771 --> 00:38:36.900
<v Speaker 3>they put little skinny tires on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes,</v>

897
00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.920
<v Speaker 3>it comes with one seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It only comes with one seat saying car.</v>

898
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.690
<v Speaker 3>This is a car that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

899
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:45.790
<v Speaker 3>You just said you get the second seat </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a dollar.</v>

900
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:46.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

901
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.180
<v Speaker 3>But if it comes with one that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dope.</v>

902
00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:52.080
<v Speaker 3>I want my friends to jump in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the biggest fuck you car.</v>

903
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.580
<v Speaker 3>You drive how we got one seat Bro.</v>

904
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:58.483
<v Speaker 3>That way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way you have a good excuse not to </v>

905
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:00.184
<v Speaker 3>bring the wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh it says it costs less than a hundred </v>

906
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:03.610
<v Speaker 3>thousand dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they say.</v>

907
00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:05.410
<v Speaker 3>So hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only be $88,000.</v>

908
00:39:05.411 --> 00:39:08.440
<v Speaker 3>Put the dealers do the markup to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>demand so you're fucked.</v>

909
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh the markups probably going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>

910
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:11.383
<v Speaker 3>You'll get one right now if I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just fucking cruise the streets </v>

911
00:39:14.291 --> 00:39:15.370
<v Speaker 3>shitting on people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>around two to 2018 and I looked at the </v>

<v Speaker 3>numbers like the zero to 60 numbers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really great.</v>

917
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:35.310

920
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.650
<v Speaker 3>But then you compare it to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like this,</v>

921
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.593
<v Speaker 3>all that thing.</v>

922
00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.540
<v Speaker 3>What do you drive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who makes shitty,</v>

923
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.460
<v Speaker 3>shitty cars out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really make shitty cars anymore.</v>

924
00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 3>Can't get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too many.</v>

925
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:50.584
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're making new cars constantly like </v>

926
00:39:51.821 --> 00:39:53.410
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the craziest things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>

927
00:39:53.411 --> 00:39:54.244
<v Speaker 3>They need consistent innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every year there's zero to 60 time gets </v>

928
00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:59.020
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their gs g force get better.</v>

929
00:39:59.021 --> 00:40:03.060
<v Speaker 3>The Mile Mile per gallon get better and </v>
<v Speaker 3>better in your mouth.</v>

930
00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.230
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mary Ross 30 it's been 30 since I was 12</v>

931
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.373
<v Speaker 3>but a porch twin turbo gets 30 when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast cars on the planet and all wheel </v>

932
00:40:12.761 --> 00:40:15.010
<v Speaker 3>drive at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cars are not really,</v>

933
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:15.873
<v Speaker 3>not really it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't try it like funny drove </v>

934
00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.280
<v Speaker 3>supercar gets 24 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

935
00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.413
<v Speaker 3>Put a bull up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nine nine one nine 11 turbo miles per </v>

936
00:40:26.501 --> 00:40:27.334
<v Speaker 3>gallon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be 200 miles to the gallon by </v>

937
00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:31.084
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I smell conspiracy theory </v>

938
00:40:33.521 --> 00:40:34.354
<v Speaker 3>coming up this up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you see him getting ready </v>

939
00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:42.930
<v Speaker 3>to go to for the twister role,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might give you a little towel.</v>

940
00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:44.590
<v Speaker 3>See the seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm crazy.</v>

941
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:48.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He always went with it.</v>

942
00:40:48.481 --> 00:40:49.314
<v Speaker 3>With the Indians.</v>

943
00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.000
<v Speaker 3>Was there ever an md and the Indians </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have let him the slaves,</v>

944
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:55.893
<v Speaker 3>the Indians would have led to this lake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a key and peele movie right </v>

945
00:41:00.131 --> 00:41:00.964
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black Indians and there's a bunch of </v>

946
00:41:03.221 --> 00:41:08.221
<v Speaker 3>butter is a book about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes to been some you fucked up.</v>

947
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:19.930
<v Speaker 3>They fucked up letting big dixon the TPU</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing that it'll be different.</v>

948
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.650
<v Speaker 3>It'll be different now folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you girls are like,</v>

949
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.320
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well but I want to how many,</v>

950
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.170
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how common that was and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder who,</v>

951
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:25.980
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

952
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:26.813
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it was white people or whether </v>

953
00:41:28.751 --> 00:41:29.291
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

954
00:41:29.291 --> 00:41:33.530
<v Speaker 3>White Europeans or slaves who bred with </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist town.</v>

955
00:41:33.531 --> 00:41:34.520
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they escaped</v>

956
00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.570
<v Speaker 5>to the Indians so they can make go 27 </v>
<v Speaker 5>highway,</v>

957
00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:41.080
<v Speaker 5>20 city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have a super car.</v>

958
00:41:41.081 --> 00:41:41.841
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

959
00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:42.950
<v Speaker 5>don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

960
00:41:42.951 --> 00:41:43.784
<v Speaker 5>that car might be the best car in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world and you just think about the best </v>

961
00:41:46.311 --> 00:41:49.730
<v Speaker 5>all around car hands down nine 11 turbo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You drive that thing.</v>

962
00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:51.800
<v Speaker 5>It drives like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a regular car.</v>

963
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:54.200
<v Speaker 5>It feels great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it smoothed over bumps and shit.</v>

964
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:56.210
<v Speaker 5>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the dampening system that they have.</v>

965
00:41:56.211 --> 00:41:57.044
<v Speaker 5>It's all electronically controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems to be able to predict what the </v>

966
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:02.870
<v Speaker 5>ground is like and adjust to like </v>
<v Speaker 5>different bumps in the road.</v>

967
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.610
<v Speaker 5>Like really well the best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

968
00:42:04.611 --> 00:42:08.600
<v Speaker 5>that was 2015 I'm talking about to then </v>
<v Speaker 5>18th they even better.</v>

969
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.553
<v Speaker 5>That was to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 10th and then he got probably a few </v>

970
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.470
<v Speaker 5>miles per gallon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

971
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:13.303
<v Speaker 5>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But those cars are zero to 60 in 2.5 </v>

972
00:42:15.411 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 5>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's best code on the road.</v>

973
00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:19.150
<v Speaker 5>Four wheel drive for pound money from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

974
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:21.410
<v Speaker 5>it's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just look man.</v>

975
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.273
<v Speaker 5>There's something about Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 5>engineering and German engineering that </v>

976
00:42:25.371 --> 00:42:28.550
<v Speaker 5>is hard to fuck with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't fuck with the Japanese.</v>

977
00:42:28.551 --> 00:42:29.930
<v Speaker 5>They never branched tag,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no racist.</v>

978
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.900
<v Speaker 5>They never break.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I buy Japanese cars all the time.</v>

979
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:34.250
<v Speaker 5>That's like my always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's us.</v>

980
00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I love Lexus because it's like,</v>

981
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:39.530
<v Speaker 5>you know when you get in that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

982
00:42:39.531 --> 00:42:42.470
<v Speaker 5>every time you press that button it </v>
<v Speaker 5>starts out on the stone every time.</v>

983
00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:43.323
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every time you bought a fancy Toyota </v>

984
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.110
<v Speaker 5>Tundra,</v>
<v Speaker 5>watch your mouth Toyota and drag.</v>

985
00:42:48.111 --> 00:42:48.944
<v Speaker 5>Nothing wrong with Toyota.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying it's compared to German </v>

986
00:42:51.231 --> 00:42:53.090
<v Speaker 5>though and I just chill him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That hundred bay.</v>

987
00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:53.933
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing Jeremy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the interior on German cars bed the </v>

988
00:42:56.571 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 5>best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

989
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:58.363
<v Speaker 5>Well their engineering is so sporty too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the Japanese don't really make a </v>

990
00:43:02.151 --> 00:43:05.870
<v Speaker 5>car like a nine 11 gt three they don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>really make that.</v>

991
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:06.973
<v Speaker 5>They make these track cars that work </v>
<v Speaker 5>really fascinating track like like the </v>

992
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.070
<v Speaker 5>Nissan Gtr,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's like super electronic.</v>

993
00:43:13.071 --> 00:43:15.620
<v Speaker 5>When you get in that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a spaceship dude.</v>

994
00:43:15.621 --> 00:43:18.500
<v Speaker 5>That thing is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like levels you out.</v>

995
00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:19.334
<v Speaker 5>Like when you go in and take turns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you actually feel it flattened the body </v>

996
00:43:21.711 --> 00:43:22.940
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With electronics,</v>

997
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:25.610
<v Speaker 5>it turns like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're you,</v>

998
00:43:25.611 --> 00:43:28.610
<v Speaker 5>you can make a hard turn and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 5>body lean.</v>

999
00:43:28.611 --> 00:43:29.660
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What else?</v>

1000
00:43:29.661 --> 00:43:32.510
<v Speaker 5>And then the Acura Nsx dead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the new ones,</v>

1001
00:43:32.511 --> 00:43:33.344
<v Speaker 5>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The new NSX is insane to hybrid engines </v>

1002
00:43:36.801 --> 00:43:37.634
<v Speaker 5>and the front wheels,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first rye weapons grade nine 11 what </v>

1003
00:43:40.791 --> 00:43:43.910
<v Speaker 5>does it say there with the Myob ground?</v>
<v Speaker 5>2029 wow.</v>

1004
00:43:43.911 --> 00:43:47.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>29 Porsche nine 11 it's my fave.</v>

1005
00:43:47.261 --> 00:43:48.094
<v Speaker 5>It's a beast car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are super reliable too for the </v>

1006
00:43:50.571 --> 00:43:54.560
<v Speaker 5>most so reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's just the engineering has to get</v>

1007
00:43:54.561 --> 00:43:55.730
<v Speaker 5>better and better every year.</v>

1008
00:43:55.730 --> 00:44:00.190
<v Speaker 5>So they're sharpening this razor's edge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're developing these cars that like,</v>

1009
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:02.840
<v Speaker 5>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's skid pad numbers that used to be</v>

1010
00:44:02.841 --> 00:44:05.960
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous like one g and a skid pad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like God,</v>

1011
00:44:05.961 --> 00:44:08.600
<v Speaker 5>it would have to be like a Ferrari f 40 </v>
<v Speaker 5>or something like that.</v>

1012
00:44:08.601 --> 00:44:09.434
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you get that shit out of a BMW m </v>

1013
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:11.984
<v Speaker 5>three like everything does a g on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>skid pad and those corvettes like grand </v>

1014
00:44:15.591 --> 00:44:17.490
<v Speaker 5>sport corvettes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do ridiculous.</v>

1015
00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:20.000
<v Speaker 5>He received the Viper ACR.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck,</v>

1016
00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:25.001
<v Speaker 5>you can just buy a fucking 660 </v>
<v Speaker 5>horsepower race car from viper.</v>

1017
00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.530
<v Speaker 5>I'd be lying if I didn't say I was </v>

<v Speaker 3>records at every single race track all </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the world.</v>

1032

<v Speaker 3>That one right there is a regular viper,</v>

1034
00:45:13.561 --> 00:45:18.561
<v Speaker 3>which is still pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just look for the viper srt ACR.</v>

1035
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:19.913
<v Speaker 3>The SRT ACR is the crazy one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the one that they just built for </v>

1036
00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:24.150
<v Speaker 3>racing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I heard they're having a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>because people are like enough terms.</v>

1042
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.713
<v Speaker 3>We trump's president and this will you </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember when the vipers first came out </v>

1043
00:45:36.151 --> 00:45:38.700
<v Speaker 3>as 500 horsepower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>500 pounds of Torque and there's so many</v>

1044
00:45:38.701 --> 00:45:40.830
<v Speaker 3>crashes because guys just didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to deal with it.</v>

1045
00:45:40.831 --> 00:45:43.160
<v Speaker 3>They'd go around the corners and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking also,</v>

1046
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.800
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have antilock brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The old vipers had nothing.</v>

1047
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.753
<v Speaker 3>I rented an old viper once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beat the fuck out of borrowing to buy </v>

<v Speaker 3>Viper Jack for a while it was a </v>

1049
00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:58.440
<v Speaker 3>shambles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were considered like vanilla ice of</v>

<v Speaker 3>wing in the back of it.</v>

1055
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.150
<v Speaker 3>But it's so ferocious that though I feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>like until you are so excited.</v>

1056
00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:16.410

<v Speaker 3>stink.</v>

1183
00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:11.390
<v Speaker 3>The sling sling dick with stinky shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

1184
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:16.510
<v Speaker 3>I would drive that conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's super conservative.</v>

1185
00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:18.373
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy that got on Rosie O'donnell</v>
<v Speaker 3>show and she famously sort of attacked </v>

1186
00:52:22.311 --> 00:52:26.210
<v Speaker 3>him for supporting the MRA and </v>
<v Speaker 3>connecting him to shootings.</v>

1187
00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.493
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which one of the greatest Americans </v>

1188
00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:31.370
<v Speaker 3>can't understand what she was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1189
00:52:31.371 --> 00:52:34.160
<v Speaker 3>And I understand her sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met Rosie O'donnell and I did her show</v>

1190
00:52:34.161 --> 00:52:34.994
<v Speaker 3>and I think she's a nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's just think that like things like </v>

1191
00:52:37.461 --> 00:52:39.470
<v Speaker 3>that are ill advised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1192
00:52:39.471 --> 00:52:40.304
<v Speaker 3>and that people got real mad at her man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those fucking NRA people due to </v>

1193
00:52:43.011 --> 00:52:44.990
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you talk anti second amendment,</v>

1194
00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:49.070
<v Speaker 3>they come with the force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fucking come after you.</v>

1195
00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:50.840
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1196
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:51.733
<v Speaker 3>Well if they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have lost the right a long </v>

1197
00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:54.704
<v Speaker 3>time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that would like </v>

1198
00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:56.320
<v Speaker 3>take those rights away.</v>

1199
00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:57.163
<v Speaker 3>My boy Tom Selleck went on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can only hit diamond piece talking </v>

1200
00:52:58.850 --> 00:52:59.683
<v Speaker 3>about guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Selleck didn't go on it and talk </v>

1201
00:53:00.981 --> 00:53:01.730
<v Speaker 3>about guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Agree.</v>

1202
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:03.190
<v Speaker 3>Went on there to talk about something </v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

1203
00:53:03.191 --> 00:53:06.140
<v Speaker 3>Just promoting something and she wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to bring up the NRA and you know,</v>

1204
00:53:06.141 --> 00:53:06.974
<v Speaker 3>he was upset about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think if you're talking about a </v>

1205
00:53:09.111 --> 00:53:12.100
<v Speaker 3>gun violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot,</v>

1206
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:13.003
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of factors and it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>gun violence and you can get really </v>

1207
00:53:15.201 --> 00:53:17.510
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of them is that it's all men.</v>

1208
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:18.523
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about we just ban all men because </v>

1209
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:23.210
<v Speaker 3>all men are responsible for mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>shootings.</v>

1210
00:53:23.211 --> 00:53:25.250
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking all men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never chicks.</v>

1211
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 3>So what</v>

1212
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:28.260
<v Speaker 5>do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We ban all men because without the men,</v>

1213
00:53:28.261 --> 00:53:30.020
<v Speaker 5>the guns don't even work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So okay,</v>

1214
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.210
<v Speaker 5>we're not banning all men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So should we ban all guns?</v>

1215
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:34.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should definitely been all guns.</v>

1216
00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:35.191
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1217
00:53:35.191 --> 00:53:36.024
<v Speaker 5>if we're going to ban all guns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how come only a certain percentage of </v>

1218
00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:38.694
<v Speaker 5>the guns get used in these crimes?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about all those other people that </v>

1219
00:53:40.531 --> 00:53:45.531
<v Speaker 5>are lawful law abiding Americans who are</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind and peaceful and keep John guns for</v>

1220
00:53:46.171 --> 00:53:47.004
<v Speaker 5>personal security or for hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do we take them away from them and who </v>

1221
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:51.450
<v Speaker 5>gets to decide?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where the problem lay.</v>

1222
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:56.040
<v Speaker 5>The problem doesn't lay in the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's stepping in because she's got this</v>

1223
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:57.630
<v Speaker 5>thing in front of her and she sees it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>a problem.</v>

1224
00:53:57.631 --> 00:53:58.464
<v Speaker 5>She wants to talk about the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is that the problem is </v>

1225
00:54:00.091 --> 00:54:02.430
<v Speaker 5>multifaceted and it's not just all men.</v>

1226
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:03.503
<v Speaker 5>The number of these men that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>medicated on pharmaceutical drugs is </v>

1227
00:54:06.841 --> 00:54:07.674
<v Speaker 5>fucking staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they say correlation does not </v>

1228
00:54:10.561 --> 00:54:11.394
<v Speaker 5>equal causation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can't assume that just because </v>

1229
00:54:13.771 --> 00:54:16.380
<v Speaker 5>someone's on pills that that makes </v>
<v Speaker 5>people shoot people.</v>

1230
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:18.210
<v Speaker 5>But damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's close.</v>

1231
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:20.280
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something in there.</v>

1232
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:21.143
<v Speaker 5>There's something going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] psychoactive drugs are </v>

1233
00:54:23.521 --> 00:54:26.700
<v Speaker 5>responsible for some changes in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior.</v>

1234
00:54:26.701 --> 00:54:28.200
<v Speaker 5>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's undeniable.</v>

1235
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:29.123
<v Speaker 5>How much is debatable and how much of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these disassociative sorta drugs allow </v>

1236
00:54:33.211 --> 00:54:36.000
<v Speaker 5>people to just like blank out and go and</v>
<v Speaker 5>do wacky shit.</v>

1237
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:38.280
<v Speaker 5>Different people with different brain </v>
<v Speaker 5>chemistry.</v>

1238
00:54:38.281 --> 00:54:39.310
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you,</v>

1239
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.360
<v Speaker 5>did you see the facebook killer?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He actually committed suicide today,</v>

1240
00:54:42.361 --> 00:54:46.650
<v Speaker 5>but here he was going around killing </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and doing it live on facebook and</v>

1241
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:48.960
<v Speaker 5>they were saying people were upset at </v>
<v Speaker 5>facebook going,</v>

1242
00:54:48.961 --> 00:54:50.940
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you allow him to do this?</v>

1243
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:51.661
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1244
00:54:51.661 --> 00:54:55.380
<v Speaker 5>we're going to change some of the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The cops said that he didn't do that.</v>

1245
00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.990
<v Speaker 5>They wasn't streaming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He uploaded upload it later.</v>

1246
00:54:58.090 --> 00:54:58.890
<v Speaker 5>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1247
00:54:58.890 --> 00:54:59.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll watch that more.</v>

1248
00:54:59.971 --> 00:55:00.804
<v Speaker 5>But then I saw a cop was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it actually helps us like in if you </v>

1249
00:55:03.811 --> 00:55:04.644
<v Speaker 5>didn't commit suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's times where there's been </v>

1250
00:55:06.301 --> 00:55:10.200
<v Speaker 5>other crimes that people do when they </v>
<v Speaker 5>hear it live or upload it to facebook or</v>

1251
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:13.600
<v Speaker 5>they rob a bank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then posts like could rich with cash and</v>

1252
00:55:13.601 --> 00:55:15.420
<v Speaker 5>they actually helps the cops track him </v>
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

1253
00:55:15.421 --> 00:55:16.254
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you should go away with </v>

1254
00:55:17.221 --> 00:55:19.650
<v Speaker 5>it because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well there's not kill regardless.</v>

1255
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:20.880
<v Speaker 5>Now they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1256
00:55:20.881 --> 00:55:22.770
<v Speaker 5>they can upload it on youtube or </v>
<v Speaker 5>wherever.</v>

1257
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:24.210
<v Speaker 5>They might take it down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're like,</v>

1258
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:25.613
<v Speaker 5>we shouldn't stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause that you're helping on a little </v>

1259
00:55:26.821 --> 00:55:27.390
<v Speaker 5>bit.</v>

1260
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:28.223
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a good excuse to go in there and </v>

1261
00:55:29.791 --> 00:55:31.080
<v Speaker 5>control the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1262
00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:31.914
<v Speaker 5>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like that could easily be a </v>

1263
00:55:33.091 --> 00:55:34.470
<v Speaker 5>false flag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there any,</v>

1264
00:55:34.471 --> 00:55:34.921
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1265
00:55:34.921 --> 00:55:35.754
<v Speaker 5>it's not a false flag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely a dead guy and he's </v>

1266
00:55:37.051 --> 00:55:39.060
<v Speaker 5>definitely a guy who killed himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So same thing.</v>

1267
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.940
<v Speaker 5>I think more often then they're being </v>
<v Speaker 5>false flags is a,</v>

1268
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:43.783
<v Speaker 5>is an event happens and people try to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take advantage of that event and they </v>

1269
00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:47.844
<v Speaker 5>try to make it easier on themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially law enforcement might try to </v>

1270
00:55:50.551 --> 00:55:52.260
<v Speaker 5>make it easy on themselves and enforce </v>
<v Speaker 5>laws,</v>

1271
00:55:52.261 --> 00:55:56.130
<v Speaker 5>especially politicians might take it as </v>
<v Speaker 5>an opportunity to push their agenda,</v>

1272
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.233
<v Speaker 5>their constituents want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of factors when it comes </v>

1273
00:55:59.461 --> 00:56:01.650
<v Speaker 5>into dealing with any kind of gun </v>
<v Speaker 5>violence,</v>

1274
00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:05.550
<v Speaker 5>but it's a multifaceted issue and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't take it up with Tom Selleck.</v>

1275
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.190
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Magnum fucking Pii is not the reason why</v>

1276
00:56:08.191 --> 00:56:09.990
<v Speaker 5>their school shooters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tak Mak,</v>

1277
00:56:09.991 --> 00:56:10.824
<v Speaker 5>just because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he has a lawful gun permit and </v>

1278
00:56:13.201 --> 00:56:14.034
<v Speaker 5>because he joined the NRA cause he </v>
<v Speaker 5>believes in the right to keep and bear </v>

1279
00:56:17.671 --> 00:56:18.504
<v Speaker 5>arms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The real problem is people that are </v>

1280
00:56:20.851 --> 00:56:23.500
<v Speaker 5>willing to kill a bunch of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not the guns.</v>

1281
00:56:23.501 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 5>It's not</v>

1282
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:24.933
<v Speaker 4>that they're men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not neither one of those two </v>

1283
00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:29.860
<v Speaker 4>incredibly common factors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guns and men.</v>

1284
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.440
<v Speaker 4>I always think it's weird too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever there's a shooter,</v>

1285
00:56:32.441 --> 00:56:35.140
<v Speaker 4>like with this whole facebook fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>killer in Ohio,</v>

1286
00:56:35.141 --> 00:56:35.974
<v Speaker 4>ruins like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1287
00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:37.550
<v Speaker 4>mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1288
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:39.010
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you can just chalk it up</v>

1289
00:56:39.011 --> 00:56:42.700
<v Speaker 4>to mental illness all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some donuts it's medicated too,</v>

1290
00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.870
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then sometimes he just a fuck the,</v>

1291
00:56:45.871 --> 00:56:46.704
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of bad apples to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a bad dude like when he was on </v>

1292
00:56:49.451 --> 00:56:52.150
<v Speaker 4>there and why are watching all someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>down a weird rabbit hole on Easter.</v>

1293
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.340
<v Speaker 4>But when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was on there just talking,</v>

1294
00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:56.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coherently being like,</v>

1295
00:56:56.021 --> 00:56:57.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've worked at this job forever.</v>

1296
00:56:57.251 --> 00:56:59.770
<v Speaker 4>People Shit on me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My girl just broke up with me.</v>

1297
00:56:59.771 --> 00:57:00.604
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking sick of this man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go around killing people </v>

1298
00:57:02.321 --> 00:57:03.550
<v Speaker 4>because I'm pissed off at the world.</v>

1299
00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:05.260
<v Speaker 4>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1300
00:57:05.261 --> 00:57:08.820
<v Speaker 4>Well the problem is someone who has that</v>
<v Speaker 4>attitude lacks empathy and the,</v>

1301
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:10.780
<v Speaker 4>it's not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the question is like,</v>

1302
00:57:10.781 --> 00:57:14.260
<v Speaker 4>how does someone get to that stage where</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're completely void of empathy?</v>

1303
00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:16.030
<v Speaker 4>That's what scares the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1304
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:17.133
<v Speaker 4>What doesn't scare the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people is that people were willing to </v>

1305
00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:20.840
<v Speaker 4>kill to defend their loved ones or any </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that shit.</v>

1306
00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:23.260
<v Speaker 4>What bothers people is people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have any empathy.</v>

1307
00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:24.123
<v Speaker 4>People that want to go fuck the world or</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you and fuck everything and then </v>

1308
00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:27.124
<v Speaker 4>just hurt people and laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would he be that way if he didn't </v>

1309
00:57:29.831 --> 00:57:32.050
<v Speaker 4>get whatever's coworkers were picking on</v>
<v Speaker 4>him?</v>

1310
00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:32.710
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1311
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:33.543
<v Speaker 4>is it a mental illness because he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting picked on or with is it this is </v>

1312
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:38.680
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this backlash to that bullying or his</v>

1313
00:57:38.681 --> 00:57:40.180
<v Speaker 4>girl breaking up with them because it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>small.</v>

1314
00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.080
<v Speaker 4>Daikin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was fat.</v>

1315
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:43.750
<v Speaker 4>There's lot of factors there that could </v>
<v Speaker 4>be a part of it.</v>

1316
00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:46.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying overall proximal and just be </v>
<v Speaker 4>a bad apple man and just,</v>

1317
00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:48.280
<v Speaker 4>it was like fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>

1318
00:57:48.281 --> 00:57:50.380
<v Speaker 4>this world sucks man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's possible.</v>

1319
00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:52.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean we just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I my my,</v>

1320
00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.073
<v Speaker 4>my whole thing here is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think we chalked up mental </v>

1321
00:57:55.091 --> 00:57:55.924
<v Speaker 4>illness too easily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I think what you're talking about </v>

1322
00:57:57.461 --> 00:57:58.294
<v Speaker 4>though is mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean what I'm saying is that anybody </v>

1323
00:58:00.341 --> 00:58:04.540
<v Speaker 4>that's willing to kill people like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is mentally ill and you could say like,</v>

1324
00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.590
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to define it.</v>

1325
00:58:05.591 --> 00:58:07.000
<v Speaker 4>Is it herpes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1326
00:58:07.001 --> 00:58:07.834
<v Speaker 4>is it the flu?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think the lack of empathy is in </v>

1327
00:58:10.721 --> 00:58:14.310
<v Speaker 4>itself a disconnect from the human race </v>
<v Speaker 4>and can make you mentally ill.</v>

1328
00:58:14.311 --> 00:58:16.720
<v Speaker 4>Like you could classify someone as </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentally ill.</v>

1329
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.780
<v Speaker 4>The problem is anybody could be mentally</v>
<v Speaker 4>ill.</v>

1330
00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:21.850
<v Speaker 4>If you get born into the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>

1331
00:58:21.851 --> 00:58:23.980
<v Speaker 4>you get abused and grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>

1332
00:58:23.981 --> 00:58:28.150
<v Speaker 4>Your brain is all hardwired to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're stressed out all the time and all</v>

1333
00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:29.163
<v Speaker 4>the people around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're all fucking crazy and you're </v>

1334
00:58:31.001 --> 00:58:33.130
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your cortisol levels are off the charts.</v>

1335
00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:37.330
<v Speaker 4>We all have the potential to lose our </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking mind.</v>

1336
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.890
<v Speaker 4>All of us do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or He,</v>

1337
00:58:38.891 --> 00:58:39.724
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you grew up desensitized where you see </v>

1338
00:58:41.261 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 4>the struggles of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like life doesn't own shit.</v>

1339
00:58:43.931 --> 00:58:45.460
<v Speaker 4>You see your friends and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1340
00:58:45.461 --> 00:58:46.140
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1341
00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:47.620
<v Speaker 4>this sucks man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who Cares?</v>

1342
00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:51.670
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's super important that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>have empathy for people like that.</v>

1343
00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:54.010
<v Speaker 4>Should we understand that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could have easily been us.</v>

1344
00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.470
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people get born into terrible,</v>

1345
00:58:56.471 --> 00:58:59.380
<v Speaker 4>terrible situations and he probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have you eaten over there bro?</v>

1346
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:02.010
<v Speaker 4>She's got bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She got bro,</v>

1347
00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:02.740
<v Speaker 4>which got bro.</v>

1348
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:03.371
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of them.</v>

1349
00:59:03.371 --> 00:59:04.870
<v Speaker 4>Peanut butter bars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are delish.</v>

1350
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:06.870
<v Speaker 4>Those are good when they're called.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1351
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:10.390

1352
00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.630

<v Speaker 4>no bs.</v>

1353
00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:14.620
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in there.</v>

1354
00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:16.350
<v Speaker 4>Those are legit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are good.</v>

1355
00:59:16.351 --> 00:59:18.220
<v Speaker 4>It's better than the rx bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1356
00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:21.100
<v Speaker 4>I like the peanut butter by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I like that dark chocolate.</v>

1357
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.760
<v Speaker 4>When you a two you couldn't handle it </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

<v Speaker 4>tastes.</v>

1362

<v Speaker 4>not only rich people like cars.</v>

1413
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.880
<v Speaker 4>That is one thing that is true because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>did ignore cars when I was broke.</v>

1414

<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1485
01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:24.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

1486
01:05:24.071 --> 01:05:25.720
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking brilliant.</v>

1487
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:27.090
<v Speaker 4>And then I watched you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1488
01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.033
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see at the store at 10 so I'll watch </v>

1489
01:05:28.811 --> 01:05:32.670
<v Speaker 4>your sets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was baffled how just I,</v>

1490
01:05:32.671 --> 01:05:33.041
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1491
01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:33.581
<v Speaker 4>I'm new to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1492
01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:36.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how you went from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did three sets.</v>

1493
01:05:36.131 --> 01:05:40.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm followed along with your three sets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How he changed them like on the go while</v>

1494
01:05:40.041 --> 01:05:41.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to figure out the right way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do it.</v>

1495
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:42.603
<v Speaker 4>It's good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's bad because sometimes you go </v>

1496
01:05:43.511 --> 01:05:44.344
<v Speaker 4>the wrong way because I fuck around so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much because I changed my materials so </v>

1497
01:05:47.291 --> 01:05:49.000
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I changed the approach,</v>

1498
01:05:49.001 --> 01:05:49.834
<v Speaker 4>I tried to change how I set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried to figure out what's the best </v>

1499
01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:54.490
<v Speaker 4>way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like once I settle in on one way,</v>

1500
01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:55.563
<v Speaker 4>our whole net one way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't even know if that's the </v>

1501
01:05:56.561 --> 01:05:56.950
<v Speaker 4>right way.</v>

1502
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:59.650
<v Speaker 4>So I tried different ways and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 4>those ways to take me nowhere.</v>

1503
01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.030
<v Speaker 4>That's how you know though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1504
01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:02.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's what the store is for.</v>

1505
01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:03.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the store,</v>

1506
01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:06.080
<v Speaker 4>like what I'm doing is trying shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1507
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.250
<v Speaker 4>Says when I see them doing a set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like once you do a special,</v>

1508
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:10.503
<v Speaker 4>then the months after the special it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or like some of your materials fucking </v>

1509
01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:14.830
<v Speaker 4>shaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1510
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:18.370
<v Speaker 4>and it will eventually hammer together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But on nights,</v>

1511
01:06:18.371 --> 01:06:19.204
<v Speaker 4>some nights it's perfect and on some </v>
<v Speaker 4>nights you don't really have the </v>

1512
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:22.900
<v Speaker 4>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

1513
01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like coming in for a landing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1514
01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:26.340
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw uh,</v>

1515
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:27.503
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris rock get up there and just like </v>

1516
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:30.820
<v Speaker 4>riff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Literally he was just like,</v>

1517
01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:32.890
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you could tell he just had nothing.</v>

1518
01:06:32.891 --> 01:06:35.500
<v Speaker 4>Who's just going and it's off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant still.</v>

1519
01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've always been,</v>

1520
01:06:37.141 --> 01:06:37.974
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few people have seen you live war </v>

1521
01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:42.780
<v Speaker 1>than me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few people for a few years there.</v>

1522
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I saw you live pretty much every time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1523
01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.450
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did a show and um,</v>

1524
01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:54.990
<v Speaker 1>you have your bits that are worked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some that you're working out.</v>

1525
01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:56.333
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every night you went up and you mix </v>

1526
01:06:58.601 --> 01:06:59.434
<v Speaker 1>the totally different like a DJ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were the same bits and you were </v>

1527
01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.620
<v Speaker 1>working on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1528
01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:06.690
<v Speaker 1>it was a different mix every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never did shit in a row.</v>

1529
01:07:06.691 --> 01:07:09.240
<v Speaker 1>That was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all you just flowing.</v>

1530
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:12.810
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is when you do two</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows and you're on the second show,</v>

1531
01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:13.683
<v Speaker 1>like what the fuck did I say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have I done this one yet or was it the </v>

1532
01:07:16.381 --> 01:07:21.381
<v Speaker 1>earlier show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second show just gotta be more rigid</v>

1533
01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:25.260
<v Speaker 1>and a show is a different mix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't ever do the same shit twice.</v>

1534
01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:26.363
<v Speaker 1>It's a different mix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've changed recently </v>

1535
01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:29.513
<v Speaker 1>because of all your specials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every show I've never saw the same </v>

1536
01:07:32.191 --> 01:07:34.020
<v Speaker 1>show twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never same bits,</v>

1537
01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:36.950
<v Speaker 1>but always mixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always a different segue.</v>

1538
01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:37.771
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1539
01:07:37.771 --> 01:07:39.320
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was fun for you.</v>

1540
01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:41.770
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that was just definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of it.</v>

1541
01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.060
<v Speaker 4>You want to keep it fresh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you also,</v>

1542
01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:47.330
<v Speaker 4>it's all about trying to figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right way to do it is.</v>

1543
01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.750
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to try it like eight wrong ways to</v>

1544
01:07:50.751 --> 01:07:52.490
<v Speaker 4>get the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what else was crazy.</v>

1545
01:07:52.491 --> 01:07:56.090
<v Speaker 4>As I'm reading that jet APP towel book </v>
<v Speaker 4>sick in the head and he,</v>

1546
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.841
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they came,</v>

1547
01:07:56.841 --> 01:07:59.690
<v Speaker 4>I was going on the same show and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>come in like,</v>

1548
01:07:59.691 --> 01:08:00.520
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1549
01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.000
<v Speaker 4>judd's going to jump on before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1550
01:08:02.001 --> 01:08:04.400
<v Speaker 4>who's Judd Apatow Malik?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

1551
01:08:04.401 --> 01:08:05.900
<v Speaker 4>And he walks back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you know,</v>

1552
01:08:05.901 --> 01:08:07.850
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to be that fucking Dick </v>
<v Speaker 4>sucker.</v>

1553
01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:08.923
<v Speaker 4>But we just started talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know how cool he is going to </v>

1554
01:08:10.251 --> 01:08:11.084
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anything about him besides </v>

1555
01:08:11.751 --> 01:08:12.584
<v Speaker 4>that book in his movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I'll sit in there and he's </v>

1556
01:08:14.541 --> 01:08:15.351
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got a man.</v>

1557
01:08:15.351 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1558
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:18.530
<v Speaker 4>and then we started talking to super </v>
<v Speaker 4>cool now I was just like,</v>

1559
01:08:18.531 --> 01:08:20.350
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your buck and which gone to the book,</v>

1560
01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:22.160
<v Speaker 4>he was the nicest guy ever.</v>

1561
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.120
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's very,</v>

1562
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.920
<v Speaker 4>very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's super down Earth,</v>

1563
01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:27.200
<v Speaker 4>easy to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't realize that.</v>

1564
01:08:27.201 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 4>Like he wrote for a Roseanne Barr,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom Arnold,</v>

1565
01:08:29.871 --> 01:08:32.660
<v Speaker 4>like Adam Sandler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's wrote for a ton of guys,</v>

1566
01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:35.120
<v Speaker 4>which I find is interesting cause he's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>standup comic,</v>

1567
01:08:35.121 --> 01:08:38.450
<v Speaker 4>but he would write for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just cause he's not a performer.</v>

1568
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:41.870
<v Speaker 4>So you'd rather just write for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like why not do it yourself?</v>

1569
01:08:41.871 --> 01:08:45.530
<v Speaker 4>Well I think he just was real busy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when you're producing movies and</v>

1570
01:08:45.531 --> 01:08:46.940
<v Speaker 4>stuff and doing all the shit that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>did,</v>

1571
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he had the time to go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the clubs and to do standup.</v>

1572
01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:52.100
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to go to the clubs.</v>

1573
01:08:52.101 --> 01:08:54.920
<v Speaker 4>He got to fuck around like like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>other night that I'm talking about.</v>

1574
01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:57.980
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about rather where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>see me doing all these different sets.</v>

1575
01:08:58.130 --> 01:08:58.970
<v Speaker 4>Everybody does that.</v>

1576
01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you see Louie at the Improv,</v>

1577
01:09:00.921 --> 01:09:02.360
<v Speaker 4>you'll see him later that night at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>store.</v>

1578
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:04.340
<v Speaker 4>You know these guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're hopping on and they're,</v>

1579
01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:06.760
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to mix stuff up and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't,</v>

1580
01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:10.610
<v Speaker 4>doesn't Louis say that you it to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good at stem should only be doing</v>

1581
01:09:10.611 --> 01:09:11.444
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's what he said the other night we </v>

1582
01:09:12.141 --> 01:09:13.250
<v Speaker 4>were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said he'd only,</v>

1583
01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:16.700
<v Speaker 4>he'd been doing nothing but stand up for</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last two years and he was saying,</v>

1584
01:09:16.701 --> 01:09:19.010
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could be good and do other stuff but</v>

1585
01:09:19.011 --> 01:09:21.290
<v Speaker 4>to really be your best you have to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>only stand up.</v>

1586
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:23.120
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>

1587
01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.730
<v Speaker 4>I think he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it makes sense.</v>

1588
01:09:25.731 --> 01:09:27.500
<v Speaker 4>Would you be happy doing just stand up </v>
<v Speaker 4>though?</v>

1589
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:28.423
<v Speaker 4>I would always do a podcast I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't think you would have to </v>

1590
01:09:33.021 --> 01:09:34.490
<v Speaker 4>just get rid of podcasting.</v>

1591
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.800
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it helps you with Id.</v>
<v Speaker 4>UFC would definitely,</v>

1592
01:09:36.801 --> 01:09:37.634
<v Speaker 4>I would definitely have to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the OFC and I think that's probably </v>

1593
01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:41.220
<v Speaker 4>going to happen eventually anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

1594
01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:44.510
<v Speaker 4>the thing that you get from podcasting </v>
<v Speaker 4>is you almost get like an education,</v>

1595
01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:45.960
<v Speaker 4>cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1596
01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:46.933
<v Speaker 4>it's a pretty peripheral education when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it turns cer certain things that people </v>

1597
01:09:50.871 --> 01:09:52.790
<v Speaker 4>say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I'm listening to you say it and it</v>

1598
01:09:52.791 --> 01:09:53.624
<v Speaker 4>blows me away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I only retain a certain percentage </v>

1599
01:09:55.941 --> 01:09:56.774
<v Speaker 4>of it unless I listened to the pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Lawrence Krauss is a theoretical </v>

1600
01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:03.110
<v Speaker 4>physicist that I had on was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>explain some theories to me and I was,</v>

1601
01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:06.260
<v Speaker 4>my stupid brain was just not taking it </v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

1602
01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:07.700
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1603
01:10:07.701 --> 01:10:10.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had Dennis Mckenna on yesterday who's,</v>

1604
01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic pioneer and he's a,</v>

1605
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:14.293
<v Speaker 4>what is his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's ethnobotanist and he's a professor </v>

1606
01:10:17.101 --> 01:10:19.190
<v Speaker 4>and he's a fucking insanely smart guy.</v>

1607
01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.053
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to listen to that two or three </v>

1608
01:10:20.901 --> 01:10:23.640
<v Speaker 4>times he's explained to me the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1609
01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:26.420
<v Speaker 4>the reason why certain drugs work so </v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1610
01:10:26.421 --> 01:10:28.610
<v Speaker 4>like in particular mosque mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was explained,</v>

1611
01:10:28.611 --> 01:10:29.444
<v Speaker 4>pulled up like our molecule chart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was explaining to us the difference </v>

1612
01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:32.594
<v Speaker 4>between the molecules that are connected</v>
<v Speaker 4>to silicide been versus the molecules </v>

1613
01:10:35.781 --> 01:10:38.870
<v Speaker 4>that make dmt to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really just one thing off.</v>

1614
01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.550
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's off the charts deep.</v>

1615
01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:41.533
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like those kind of </v>

1616
01:10:42.021 --> 01:10:45.230
<v Speaker 4>conversations they make me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make me smarter.</v>

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.030
<v Speaker 4>You know what made me more aware of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you who's a smart motherfucker</v>

1620
01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:57.170
<v Speaker 4>did change lanes here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I had a meeting with Aubrey Marcus.</v>

1712
01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:57.333
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think North Korea really needs to be </v>

1713
01:15:02.051 --> 01:15:04.910
<v Speaker 3>looked into because you think it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to war world son,</v>

1714
01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:07.480
<v Speaker 3>you think North Korea is fake?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's fake.</v>

1715
01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:09.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying it's saying that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fake.</v>

1716
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that Kim Jong Il could </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat,</v>

1717
01:15:12.150 --> 01:15:15.040
<v Speaker 3>I think might be part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're all buddies.</v>

1718
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:17.560
<v Speaker 3>I think at the very top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the top of Russia,</v>

1719
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:19.240
<v Speaker 3>the top of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UK,</v>

1720
01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:22.600
<v Speaker 3>they're just putting on a show and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>designated villain.</v>

1721
01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:25.500
<v Speaker 3>When we need to distract people from </v>
<v Speaker 3>this or that fucking he,</v>

1722
01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh Kim Jong is a kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people testing,</v>

1723
01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:33.370
<v Speaker 3>testing and missiles did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's testing missiles.</v>

1724
01:15:33.371 --> 01:15:34.204
<v Speaker 3>He said he's going to fire off one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in China it's very possible that </v>

1725
01:15:38.561 --> 01:15:39.394
<v Speaker 3>we've changed our foreign policy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're getting more aggressive with </v>

1726
01:15:41.861 --> 01:15:42.694
<v Speaker 3>them and this is their response and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they also are very incompetent because </v>

1727
01:15:46.031 --> 01:15:48.070
<v Speaker 3>they are terrified they're there.</v>

1728
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.110
<v Speaker 3>What they are essentially is a military </v>
<v Speaker 3>dictatorship.</v>

1729
01:15:50.111 --> 01:15:53.440
<v Speaker 3>There were terrified population and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their science is shitty.</v>

1730
01:15:53.441 --> 01:15:54.274
<v Speaker 3>They don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're getting all this from doing </v>

1731
01:15:55.361 --> 01:15:57.380
<v Speaker 3>hamstring media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like the head,</v>

1732
01:15:57.381 --> 01:16:00.070
<v Speaker 3>yet we can't miss the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're getting this from everywhere.</v>

1733
01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:00.973
<v Speaker 3>You can't always assume that everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the mainstream media is not true </v>

1734
01:16:03.611 --> 01:16:06.160
<v Speaker 3>because here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If something does happen,</v>

1735
01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:07.173
<v Speaker 3>that's a real thing that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mainstream media is always going to </v>

1736
01:16:09.041 --> 01:16:10.560
<v Speaker 3>cover it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does he say?</v>

1737
01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.660
<v Speaker 3>Stop and listen to me here cause this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

1738
01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:16.990
<v Speaker 3>Just because something's in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream media and I know you distrust</v>

1739
01:16:16.991 --> 01:16:17.824
<v Speaker 3>the mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean that it's not true </v>

1740
01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.040
<v Speaker 3>because you always have to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 3>if something happens,</v>

1741
01:16:21.041 --> 01:16:22.690
<v Speaker 3>say like Mount Saint Helens blows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1742
01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:25.420
<v Speaker 3>Love lava flowing down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people die.</v>

1743
01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:28.150
<v Speaker 3>That's a real natural disaster that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>all know happens.</v>

1744
01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Fox News is going to cover that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>CNN is going to cover that.</v>

1745
01:16:30.731 --> 01:16:32.100
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's going to cover that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not every,</v>

1746
01:16:32.101 --> 01:16:33.850
<v Speaker 3>everything that covers fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1747
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:38.800
<v Speaker 3>So if North Korea does try to launch a </v>
<v Speaker 3>missile and it does fail,</v>

1748
01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:39.813
<v Speaker 3>everyone's gonna cover that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just because CNN has something on </v>

1749
01:16:41.741 --> 01:16:43.120
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox News has something on it.</v>

1750
01:16:43.121 --> 01:16:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't mean that it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

1751
01:16:45.161 --> 01:16:50.161
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally with you on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look into North Korea.</v>

1752
01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Who's the King of conspiracy theories?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was shown out stone.</v>

1753
01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.240

<v Speaker 3>Real cause that's what I would say.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The fact that these people are actually </v>

1796
01:18:39.771 --> 01:18:40.604
<v Speaker 3>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that you can get people to </v>

1797
01:18:42.471 --> 01:18:46.250
<v Speaker 3>goose step down the middle of the street</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ride a tank and salute the king,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but listen,</v>

1802
01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:54.913
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're looking at right here is </v>

1803
01:18:56.121 --> 01:18:58.550
<v Speaker 3>actually happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not CGI.</v>

1804
01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:03.020
<v Speaker 3>So this is either a two levels of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's either one level of weird where you</v>

1805
01:19:03.021 --> 01:19:06.810

<v Speaker 3>the military dictatorship that they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>act out every day of their lives like </v>

<v Speaker 3>And these are all actors.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What are the odds that you're going to </v>

1825
01:19:53.721 --> 01:19:57.740
<v Speaker 3>get that many actors who don't even have</v>
<v Speaker 3>top billing to stay in line?</v>

1826
01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:58.963
<v Speaker 3>What are the odds that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get them to perform like that and drive </v>

1827
01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.760
<v Speaker 3>tanks and keep their mouth shut?</v>

1828
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.863
<v Speaker 3>And this one's on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's pitching in on it's way more </v>

1829
01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:09.054
<v Speaker 3>likely that these people are under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thumb of a military dictatorship is cut </v>

1830
01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:14.220
<v Speaker 3>ton of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1831
01:20:14.221 --> 01:20:17.760
<v Speaker 3>Because we've had a fuck load of </v>
<v Speaker 3>military dictatorships in history,</v>

1832
01:20:17.761 --> 01:20:18.594
<v Speaker 3>but what we haven't had is a country </v>
<v Speaker 3>filled with actors and who's playing </v>

1833
01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:22.374
<v Speaker 3>these actors?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's giving them that fucking who's </v>

1834
01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:24.533
<v Speaker 3>throw in North Korea crazy money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's the Goddamn teacher and how do </v>

1835
01:20:27.451 --> 01:20:28.284
<v Speaker 3>they train all of deicing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it one big auditoriums and one </v>

1836
01:20:31.381 --> 01:20:34.090
<v Speaker 3>episode of fame?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1837
01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:35.970
<v Speaker 3>look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goosestepping dude,</v>

1838
01:20:35.971 --> 01:20:37.560
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look how many people there.</v>

1839
01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Look how they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they turn their fucking tops over.</v>

1840
01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Whatever they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the changes to the flag goes.</v>

1841
01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:46.080
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a New Year's Eve parade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at these people,</v>

1842
01:20:46.081 --> 01:20:47.770
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all marching in tune.</v>

1843
01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:51.060
<v Speaker 3>Just the fact that they can get anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it either.</v>

1844
01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:51.953
<v Speaker 3>Either one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either his regular businessmen right </v>

1845
01:20:54.151 --> 01:20:54.984
<v Speaker 3>there on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because a few people that are probably </v>

1846
01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:57.120
<v Speaker 3>want you to sing.</v>

1847
01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:00.360
<v Speaker 3>It looks fucking fishy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cash is running rampant.</v>

1848
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:01.343
<v Speaker 3>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1849
01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:04.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying me ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mister [inaudible].</v>

1850
01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.180
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr [inaudible].</v>

1851
01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.193
<v Speaker 3>What is more likely?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it more likely these people are </v>

1852
01:21:10.051 --> 01:21:12.960
<v Speaker 3>fucking terrified and like many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

1853
01:21:12.961 --> 01:21:16.410
<v Speaker 3>many other civilizations in the past </v>
<v Speaker 3>session like this,</v>

1854
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:18.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ever existed,</v>

1855
01:21:18.181 --> 01:21:20.190
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure it hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>

1856
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:23.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it has an ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient Japan.</v>

1857
01:21:23.191 --> 01:21:26.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's been dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about shit.</v>

1858
01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.960
<v Speaker 3>We know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know the magazines,</v>

1859
01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:29.933
<v Speaker 3>the Mayans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the aztecs killed 80,000 people after </v>

1860
01:21:33.301 --> 01:21:35.010
<v Speaker 3>they cut and built one of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramids.</v>

1861
01:21:36.450 --> 01:21:38.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean they did over a period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably litigious.</v>

1862
01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:39.923
<v Speaker 3>He's probably legit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've been lied to so much about </v>

1863
01:21:43.341 --> 01:21:46.860
<v Speaker 3>like what's a lie to all these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>were actors and they just live there.</v>

1864
01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:50.040
<v Speaker 3>They're all out on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just think of how crazy that is.</v>

1865
01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.370
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't it be more likely that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>poor people are just brainwashed?</v>

1866
01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Because we know people get brainwashed </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be more like craziest when you,</v>

1867
01:21:59.941 --> 01:22:03.630
<v Speaker 3>when you're taking into consideration </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the lies that we've been told,</v>

1868
01:22:03.631 --> 01:22:05.670
<v Speaker 3>the fake moon missions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this shit.</v>

1869
01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:07.050
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1870
01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:07.913
<v Speaker 3>this is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put together a bunch of people and </v>

1871
01:22:09.421 --> 01:22:10.254
<v Speaker 3>made a fucking parade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they think the moon mission six </v>

1872
01:22:12.241 --> 01:22:14.880
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But everybody believes that shit.</v>

1873
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:18.480
<v Speaker 3>But there are real events that happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>every day that are in the totals,</v>

1874
01:22:18.481 --> 01:22:20.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is just too convenient.</v>

1875
01:22:20.421 --> 01:22:21.990
<v Speaker 3>It's too much of a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>

1876
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:22.853
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my guess is we're not going to war with </v>

1877
01:22:23.951 --> 01:22:24.591
<v Speaker 3>the Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my,</v>

1878
01:22:24.591 --> 01:22:25.424
<v Speaker 3>one of the greatest options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This will be one of the greatest </v>

1879
01:22:27.121 --> 01:22:27.954
<v Speaker 3>productions in the history of the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>race and the biggest movie of greater </v>

1880
01:22:31.831 --> 01:22:36.680
<v Speaker 3>production and the get all these Korean </v>
<v Speaker 3>people around.</v>

1881
01:22:36.850 --> 01:22:38.760
<v Speaker 3>That's a couple of thousand people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

1882
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:43.790
<v Speaker 3>No one's wanting to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to wait with snitch.</v>

1883
01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:47.460
<v Speaker 3>These are not the same people to fake </v>
<v Speaker 3>the moon missions.</v>

1884
01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.100
<v Speaker 3>Find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find the people,</v>

1885
01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:51.923
<v Speaker 3>but don't say it's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people are these people that are </v>

1886
01:22:54.421 --> 01:22:55.254
<v Speaker 3>stuck in North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that have escaped have told </v>

1887
01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:58.460
<v Speaker 3>horror stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Press.</v>

1888
01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:01.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like a giant cult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible.</v>

<v Speaker 3>about the whole North Korea thing.</v>

1892
01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:11.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that they're acting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be anything.</v>

1893

<v Speaker 3>that smells fishy.</v>

1895
01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.930
<v Speaker 3>Something is not right about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're telling us about North Korea.</v>

<v Speaker 3>susceptible to some new form of </v>

1904

<v Speaker 3>dictatorship?</v>

01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:14.300
<v Speaker 3>they take moon land picture every 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes and you can download it from the</v>

2166
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:16.280
<v Speaker 3>website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>CGI composites,</v>

2167
01:35:16.281 --> 01:35:18.830
<v Speaker 3>so constantly making CGI and some sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2168
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:23.660
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a cognitive bank somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do.</v>

2169
01:35:23.661 --> 01:35:24.494
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think if they have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology to make CGI that looks that </v>

2170
01:35:27.351 --> 01:35:28.184
<v Speaker 3>good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't they have the technology to </v>

2171
01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:32.570
<v Speaker 3>shoot a camera into space?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pictures from Massa.</v>

2172
01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:33.493
<v Speaker 3>How come they don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have that space kind of </v>

2173
01:35:35.670 --> 01:35:36.350
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2174
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:37.183
<v Speaker 3>they just never did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also don't give a fuck about </v>

2175
01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:39.433
<v Speaker 3>proven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's round those pictures I've seen </v>

2176
01:35:41.241 --> 01:35:43.070
<v Speaker 3>them put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have that kind of show me.</v>

2177
01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:44.750
<v Speaker 3>Show me a real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen.</v>

2178
01:35:44.751 --> 01:35:47.150
<v Speaker 3>NASA does not have one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>satellites.</v>

2179
01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think that's fair?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does it look famous?</v>

2180
01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:52.033
<v Speaker 3>Suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like something you'd see in a </v>

2181
01:35:53.121 --> 01:35:53.954
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's because when they do it in a </v>

2182
01:35:54.711 --> 01:35:56.120
<v Speaker 3>move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they try to make it look like this,</v>

2183
01:35:56.121 --> 01:35:57.110
<v Speaker 3>which is what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks real.</v>

2184
01:35:57.150 --> 01:35:59.210
<v Speaker 3>If that's real team and you don't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's real,</v>

2185
01:35:59.270 --> 01:36:00.103
<v Speaker 3>they faked six moon man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop saying that because it's </v>

2186
01:36:02.481 --> 01:36:03.630
<v Speaker 3>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about,</v>

2187
01:36:04.050 --> 01:36:04.883
<v Speaker 3>that's 1969 we're talking about 2017 I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think there's some gigantic conspiracy </v>

2188
01:36:09.891 --> 01:36:10.724
<v Speaker 3>involving the Japanese government where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they put up a fake picture of the Earth </v>

2189
01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:17.900
<v Speaker 3>from 22,000 miles up every 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>High resolution,</v>

2190
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:19.950
<v Speaker 3>downloadable photo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think it's fake?</v>

2191
01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:21.890
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't it be your real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2192
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:22.743
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it just as likely that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Japanese actually did launch that thing </v>

2193
01:36:25.251 --> 01:36:28.110
<v Speaker 3>in this space?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would it be fake propaganda,</v>

2194
01:36:28.150 --> 01:36:29.560
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they cared that they,</v>

2195
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:31.970
<v Speaker 3>is there a photo of this flat earth?</v>

2196
01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:32.990
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2197
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:35.150
<v Speaker 3>I like I just said again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's is there.</v>

2198
01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:39.590
<v Speaker 3>There's no photo of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the flat earth from space.</v>

2199
01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:42.710
<v Speaker 3>There's no photo of the round earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

2200
01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:46.010
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you say they're fake though?</v>

2201
01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:50.330
<v Speaker 3>They'll look CGI,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're not an expert in imagery.</v>

2202
01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:52.520
<v Speaker 3>Looks fake to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Convince you though.</v>

2203
01:36:52.521 --> 01:36:54.830
<v Speaker 3>When I watch Avatar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be an expert to know.</v>

2204
01:36:54.831 --> 01:36:58.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like when I watched episode </v>
<v Speaker 3>advertise at the movies.</v>

2205
01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:03.350
<v Speaker 3>When you watch some ridiculous Kung Fu </v>
<v Speaker 3>video beat a martial arts expert.</v>

2206
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:06.410
<v Speaker 3>If you were sitting next to someone that</v>
<v Speaker 3>told you that their Sensei can't compete</v>

2207
01:37:06.411 --> 01:37:07.244
<v Speaker 3>in the UFC because they're too deadly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you get pissed off because </v>

2208
01:37:09.681 --> 01:37:10.514
<v Speaker 3>you're an actual martial arts expert </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just like you with no science </v>

2209
01:37:13.941 --> 01:37:17.140
<v Speaker 3>background whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking about crazy photos.</v>

2210
01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:21.740
<v Speaker 3>I know crazy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why am you that I'm crazy?</v>

2211
01:37:21.770 --> 01:37:22.603
<v Speaker 3>But why not indulge at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not indulge the foam realm of </v>

2212
01:37:25.251 --> 01:37:30.251
<v Speaker 3>possibilities and not clean to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy every single time it's a NASA</v>

2213
01:37:30.321 --> 01:37:31.580
<v Speaker 3>can get pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been,</v>

2214
01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:34.790
<v Speaker 3>they've been doing CGI composite but </v>
<v Speaker 3>pleasing his whole question.</v>

2215
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:37.850
<v Speaker 3>I forget about stating what NASA does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please answer my questions.</v>

2216
01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Why do you always go towards the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy?</v>

2217
01:37:40.581 --> 01:37:44.270
<v Speaker 3>Why do you never considered the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility that maybe he's not the same</v>

2218
01:37:44.271 --> 01:37:46.800
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everybody's looking at global thing?</v>

2219
01:37:46.801 --> 01:37:49.960
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the European space agencies like all</v>

2220
01:37:49.961 --> 01:37:51.620
<v Speaker 3>in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a global thing.</v>

2221
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:55.320
<v Speaker 3>I think all governments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them,</v>

2222
01:37:55.321 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 3>the globalist</v>

2223
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:58.530
<v Speaker 1>are all working together to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to control.</v>

2224
01:37:58.531 --> 01:38:03.030
<v Speaker 1>There be advantages and the earth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

2225
01:38:03.570 --> 01:38:08.430
<v Speaker 1>What's the advantage that it's not round</v>
<v Speaker 1>then if they control you,</v>

2226
01:38:08.431 --> 01:38:09.950
<v Speaker 1>bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just want to fuck with us.</v>

2227
01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Keep you on up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2228
01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2229
01:38:12.690 --> 01:38:17.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>

2230
01:38:17.791 --> 01:38:21.840
<v Speaker 1>You could find the sounds easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put them on a ball because again,</v>

2231
01:38:21.841 --> 01:38:23.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put them on a ball.</v>

2232
01:38:23.341 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 1>My guesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on a ball.</v>

2233
01:38:24.901 --> 01:38:26.880
<v Speaker 1>You're nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't try to go anywhere.</v>

2234
01:38:26.881 --> 01:38:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Just stay down in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Hell No.</v>

2235
01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.110
<v Speaker 1>We sat down and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2236
01:38:34.111 --> 01:38:34.944
<v Speaker 1>well we got a release of fake math that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows that you can demonstrate that the </v>

2237
01:38:37.621 --> 01:38:41.220
<v Speaker 1>earth is round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to earth from space,</v>

2238
01:38:41.221 --> 01:38:41.881
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

2239
01:38:41.881 --> 01:38:43.920
<v Speaker 1>We just looked at one at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stopped saying it was fake.</v>

2240
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:45.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't know that it's fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're saying,</v>

2241
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:48.480
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem when you crazy,</v>

2242
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:50.220
<v Speaker 1>but don't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just stop.</v>

2243
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:51.143
<v Speaker 1>Just stop and think because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're communicating to millions of </v>

2244
01:38:53.461 --> 01:38:55.620
<v Speaker 1>people saying something that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>make any sense.</v>

2245
01:38:55.650 --> 01:38:58.530
<v Speaker 1>It does make so that you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about imagery.</v>

2246
01:38:58.531 --> 01:39:01.230
<v Speaker 1>You don't know anything about what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know anything about that.</v>

2247
01:39:01.290 --> 01:39:04.170
<v Speaker 1>It looks fake to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fake ass pit.</v>

2248
01:39:04.171 --> 01:39:06.630
<v Speaker 1>You don't have come on and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it with the naked eye.</v>

2249
01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:08.580
<v Speaker 1>It looks real to everybody else in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

2250
01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Someone that had made a confirmation </v>
<v Speaker 1>bias crazy,</v>

2251
01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:12.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2252
01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he made sure he was having</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun with it,</v>

2253
01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:19.170
<v Speaker 1>but you don't direct inclination to </v>
<v Speaker 1>always go towards a conspiracy.</v>

2254
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Does it keeps your a piss anybody off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a disservice to,</v>

2255
01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:24.840
<v Speaker 1>that's what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

2256
01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:26.630
<v Speaker 1>My doesn't have to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting angry.</v>

2257
01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:27.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting younger.</v>

2258
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Stoners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stoners.</v>

2259
01:39:30.210 --> 01:39:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that shit.</v>

2260
01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not raising my voice when I'm trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do is corner your ideas.</v>

2261
01:39:34.050 --> 01:39:34.883
<v Speaker 1>I try to corner your ideas because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying these things to your very </v>

2262
01:39:37.411 --> 01:39:39.840
<v Speaker 1>influential and you're saying these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to millions of people,</v>

2263
01:39:39.841 --> 01:39:41.970
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

2264
01:39:41.971 --> 01:39:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2265
01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.240
<v Speaker 1>That's why I've stated many times that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're crazy.</v>

2266
01:39:45.241 --> 01:39:46.200
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>

2267
01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:49.020
<v Speaker 1>when you use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when do you think you started losing it?</v>

2268
01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I think I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2269
01:39:51.631 --> 01:39:55.440
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I found out when I was 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everybody wasn't Catholic.</v>

2270
01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:57.180
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I started losing my,</v>

01:39:57.690 --> 01:39:58.850
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2272
01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:01.020
<v Speaker 1>everybody's not Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought everybody was Catholic.</v>

2273
01:40:01.021 --> 01:40:03.180
<v Speaker 1>There's other religions and how do we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know we're right?</v>

2274
01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:04.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a Jew?</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's more Jews and Catholics.</v>

2276
01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:08.820
<v Speaker 1>How do we know we have the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion?</v>

2277
01:40:08.821 --> 01:40:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2278
01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:11.150
<v Speaker 1>you started the West right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2279
01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:12.380

<v Speaker 1>Chris.</v>

2280
01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:16.620
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People to question authority are usually</v>

2281
01:40:16.621 --> 01:40:17.454
<v Speaker 1>looked at as crazy conspiracy theorist </v>
<v Speaker 1>CCIO coining the term conspiracy smart </v>

2282
01:40:22.531 --> 01:40:23.364
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a problem in the way you </v>

2283
01:40:24.811 --> 01:40:25.644
<v Speaker 1>approach these things cause you </v>
<v Speaker 1>approached them all knowing before you </v>

2284
01:40:28.351 --> 01:40:30.570
<v Speaker 1>even start that there are conspiracy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you what.</v>

2285
01:40:30.571 --> 01:40:32.490
<v Speaker 1>So that's confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

2286
01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:34.530
<v Speaker 1>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you lie so much you've got to prove</v>

2287
01:40:34.531 --> 01:40:36.420
<v Speaker 1>it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Utilize so goddamn much.</v>

2288
01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:37.373
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to be saying the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a defense but what I'm saying the </v>

2289
01:40:40.651 --> 01:40:43.350
<v Speaker 1>thing I ended the prosecuting attorney </v>
<v Speaker 1>with solid time.</v>

2290
01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:45.030
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a good,</v>

2291
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:45.883
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good analogy because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly how I look at filled with lies </v>

2292
01:40:48.650 --> 01:40:50.880
<v Speaker 1>then allows governments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments,</v>

2293
01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:52.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on uh,</v>

2294
01:40:52.770 --> 01:40:56.500
<v Speaker 1>being accused of lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand they've been covered line.</v>

2295
01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:58.360
<v Speaker 1>So they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in court.</v>

2296
01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:00.940
<v Speaker 1>But here are you saying the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the government.</v>

2297
01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever.</v>

2298
01:41:02.291 --> 01:41:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Just in general scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all government scientists.</v>

2299
01:41:05.481 --> 01:41:06.314
<v Speaker 1>You think scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think there's these independent </v>

2300
01:41:07.271 --> 01:41:08.104
<v Speaker 1>scientists come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all government scientists that </v>

2301
01:41:09.301 --> 01:41:10.230
<v Speaker 1>don't try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you?</v>

2302
01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Grants are all the control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think,</v>

2303
01:41:13.991 --> 01:41:14.824
<v Speaker 1>you don't think the globalist aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>control having control the science and </v>

2304
01:41:19.271 --> 01:41:22.170
<v Speaker 1>information since day one you think it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like a new thing there.</v>

2305
01:41:22.171 --> 01:41:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Name the globalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

2306
01:41:25.271 --> 01:41:25.841
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's flat,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It be like no fuck.</v>

2308
01:41:26.891 --> 01:41:30.700
<v Speaker 1>These guys were globalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of the globalist Alex called Eddie.</v>

2309
01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we just spent like a day together,</v>

2310
01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:35.260

<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

2314
01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Does that make me crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem?</v>

2315
01:41:44.630 --> 01:41:45.463
<v Speaker 1>Problem is this idea of the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government consists of a bunch of </v>

2316
01:41:48.731 --> 01:41:51.070
<v Speaker 1>inner control science with a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>history agencies.</v>

2317
01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:51.904
<v Speaker 1>Eddie fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know like the CIA and the FBI </v>

2318
01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:58.170
<v Speaker 1>each other?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's no one governments,</v>

2319
01:41:58.180 --> 01:41:59.680
<v Speaker 1>a lot of personal shit going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between.</v>

2320
01:41:59.681 --> 01:42:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's not just personal shit.</v>

2321
01:42:01.630 --> 01:42:04.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different factions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you call the government.</v>

2322
01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:05.733
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idea that it's all like the government </v>

2323
01:42:07.121 --> 01:42:09.750
<v Speaker 1>can't be trusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just say that cause I'm not gonna.</v>

2324
01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean you want me to pick out some </v>
<v Speaker 1>agencies.</v>

2325
01:42:11.450 --> 01:42:13.350

<v Speaker 1>I could pick out some sadness deck,</v>

2326
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:18.250

<v Speaker 1>it's history,</v>

2327
01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:20.530
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

2328
01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:24.940
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything has always been controlled by</v>

2329
01:42:24.941 --> 01:42:25.600
<v Speaker 1>the government.</v>

2330
01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:26.433
<v Speaker 1>Since day one,</v>

01:42:29.231 --> 01:42:30.064
<v Speaker 1>the day it was invented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think some independent dude just </v>

<v Speaker 1>you could believe that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to believe that I showed you.</v>

2355
01:43:24.490 --> 01:43:27.430
<v Speaker 1>You just apply this to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It basically,</v>

2356
01:43:27.431 --> 01:43:30.070
<v Speaker 1>anything comes from the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything coming from the government.</v>

2357
01:43:30.071 --> 01:43:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaurs don't come from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

2358
01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Just there's so much fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look in government,</v>

2359
01:43:35.351 --> 01:43:36.850
<v Speaker 1>it comes from science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's get into it.</v>

2360
01:43:36.851 --> 01:43:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I have looked into it.</v>

2361
01:43:38.561 --> 01:43:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Look dinosaurs as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is,</v>

2362
01:43:40.391 --> 01:43:41.224
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could go over these different </v>

2363
01:43:42.851 --> 01:43:44.530
<v Speaker 1>sections of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look here,</v>

2364
01:43:44.590 --> 01:43:47.030
<v Speaker 1>we can look at the next one that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes later.</v>

2365
01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you won't think that one's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2366
01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:49.360
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was kind of ready.</v>

2367
01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:51.590
<v Speaker 1>It's all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look fake to me.</v>

2368
01:43:51.591 --> 01:43:52.424
<v Speaker 1>It looks like what the fucking earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably looks like when you're 22,000 </v>

2369
01:43:54.651 --> 01:43:55.800
<v Speaker 1>miles away to you.</v>

2370
01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:00.800
<v Speaker 1>It does not to me agreeing to disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2371
01:44:00.890 --> 01:44:04.880
<v Speaker 1>but why think that it does?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't trust shit.</v>

2372
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:05.743
<v Speaker 1>Why think that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust the government does make </v>

2373
01:44:07.791 --> 01:44:11.040
<v Speaker 1>these fake pictures of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that would be that?</v>

2374
01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:12.830
<v Speaker 1>We could speculate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to speculate?</v>

2375
01:44:12.831 --> 01:44:13.664
<v Speaker 1>I mean I could show it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear you speculate that it's </v>

2376
01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:17.360
<v Speaker 1>easier to control people when they on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ball.</v>

2377
01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to tell people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

2378
01:44:19.190 --> 01:44:20.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we've got to live in a ball.</v>

2379
01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:21.793
<v Speaker 1>I told it to my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very easy to get the kids to </v>

2380
01:44:22.941 --> 01:44:23.774
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just lived on a ball throw ball </v>

2381
01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:28.200
<v Speaker 1>house bull shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to believe.</v>

2382
01:44:28.450 --> 01:44:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even make any sense.</v>

2383
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:31.783
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be easier to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen if they're on a ball rather than </v>

2384
01:44:34.641 --> 01:44:35.474
<v Speaker 1>they fun a plate?</v>

2385
01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Because if there's more land people </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna want to work,</v>

2386
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:40.940
<v Speaker 1>there's actually more land shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean it's more land?</v>

2387
01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Who knows if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you exactly what he talking about.</v>

2388
01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:47.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2389
01:44:47.961 --> 01:44:48.794
<v Speaker 1>Like more or less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the world is flat and the flat earth </v>

2390
01:44:51.411 --> 01:44:52.800
<v Speaker 1>model is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2391
01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:53.713
<v Speaker 1>what's the point of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the point of so all the math is </v>

2392
01:44:56.901 --> 01:45:01.010
<v Speaker 1>fake like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Earth is going 24 hours in a circle.</v>

2393
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.903
<v Speaker 1>Is that all fake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it spins and thousand miles an </v>

2394
01:45:04.041 --> 01:45:04.910
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2395
01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:07.480
<v Speaker 1>When you look into it works crash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stationary,</v>

2396
01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:08.550
<v Speaker 1>devin screws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2397
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:09.403
<v Speaker 1>if you look into the experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look into the experiments to </v>

2398
01:45:11.901 --> 01:45:14.960
<v Speaker 1>prove that the earth is spinning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them failed.</v>

2399
01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been in doctor.</v>

2400
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.991
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2401
01:45:17.991 --> 01:45:18.830
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

2402
01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:19.610
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2403
01:45:19.610 --> 01:45:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it edited.</v>

2404
01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.033
<v Speaker 1>What Jamie would going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the science in my head to </v>

2405
01:45:23.841 --> 01:45:25.250
<v Speaker 1>back it up yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not true.</v>

2406
01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:28.010
<v Speaker 1>You can't say things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what Eric Dubay says,</v>

2407
01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:28.873
<v Speaker 1>and he's not backing it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the evidence that find the </v>

2408
01:45:31.221 --> 01:45:32.054
<v Speaker 1>evidence kids in high school right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can show you the evidence with </v>

2409
01:45:35.661 --> 01:45:39.430
<v Speaker 1>science if you can't show it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not in class right now.</v>

2410
01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Just not up to date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing jre work right now.</v>

2411
01:45:42.130 --> 01:45:44.950
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about some shit,</v>

2412
01:45:45.490 --> 01:45:47.480
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying I don't trust it.</v>

2413
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:48.403
<v Speaker 1>You're saying something that people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been proving for hundreds and hundreds </v>

2414
01:45:51.831 --> 01:45:55.370
<v Speaker 1>of Nicholas a Mickelson Morley </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments.</v>

2415
01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:56.373
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2416
01:45:56.540 --> 01:45:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Einstein said it himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein said to this day,</v>

2417
01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Einstein said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>

2418
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:02.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're moving.</v>

2419
01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys just have them do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

2420
01:46:04.631 --> 01:46:06.860
<v Speaker 1>You're watching videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference.</v>

2421
01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:08.810
<v Speaker 1>You looking into it and watching youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>

2422
01:46:09.110 --> 01:46:09.943
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say this offer the same </v>

2423
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:13.143
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it's true that Albert Einstein </v>

2424
01:46:16.461 --> 01:46:17.294
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no evidence that the earth is </v>

2425
01:46:19.641 --> 01:46:20.700
<v Speaker 1>spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it be safe?</v>

2426
01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:22.040
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

2427
01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:23.900
<v Speaker 1>You said that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it on Youtube,</v>

2428
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:26.720
<v Speaker 1>but what if we find out that it is true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what?</v>

2429
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:30.730
<v Speaker 1>What if they find out leprechauns are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really but fucking genius.</v>

2430
01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:33.860
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying,</v>

2431
01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really look at what may be a 1947</v>

2432
01:46:39.471 --> 01:46:40.304
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't much evidence of the Earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>is spinning because they didn't </v>

2433
01:46:41.391 --> 01:46:42.530
<v Speaker 1>understand it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2434
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:45.980
<v Speaker 1>When we talking about something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened more than a half a century ago,</v>

2435
01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Einstein is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2436
01:46:47.690 --> 01:46:49.800
<v Speaker 1>he compare all the people that are alive</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

2437
01:46:49.801 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>whether</v>

2438
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.770
<v Speaker 3>it's Lawrence Krauss or Stephen </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hawking's,</v>

2439
01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.090
<v Speaker 3>most famous field</v>

2440
01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:57.160
<v Speaker 7>pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What does this experiment it was under?</v>

2441
01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:58.043
<v Speaker 7>Couldn't recreate it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was an 1880s I looked this up and I </v>

2442
01:47:00.051 --> 01:47:02.610
<v Speaker 7>was watching 5 cents.</v>
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] know what he just said?</v>

2443
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:05.460
<v Speaker 7>No already.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

2444
01:47:05.461 --> 01:47:08.100
<v Speaker 7>You keep using that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look at the Mickelson like experiments.</v>

2445
01:47:08.190 --> 01:47:10.170
<v Speaker 7>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I read up the information on it.</v>

2446
01:47:10.410 --> 01:47:12.900
<v Speaker 7>It's an experiment that was supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 7>be able to be recreated.</v>

2447
01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:13.793
<v Speaker 7>It was not able to be recreated so that </v>
<v Speaker 7>evidence is used by flat earth </v>

2448
01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:20.370
<v Speaker 7>supporting people like you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like go look it up.</v>

2449
01:47:20.371 --> 01:47:21.960
<v Speaker 7>Go look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look it up.</v>

2450
01:47:21.961 --> 01:47:23.100
<v Speaker 7>Repeatable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can't repair it.</v>

2451
01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.170
<v Speaker 7>You don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what you're saying.</v>

2452
01:47:25.230 --> 01:47:28.050
<v Speaker 7>I'm trying to tell you that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 7>evidence you trying to say.</v>

2453
01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:31.060
<v Speaker 3>The experiment showed the earth is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>spinning.</v>

2454
01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:34.060
<v Speaker 3>No one can reproduce that experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's not real.</v>

2455
01:47:35.530 --> 01:47:36.363
<v Speaker 3>So this thing that you keep repeating is</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit and this thing that you keep </v>

2456
01:47:39.281 --> 01:47:41.530
<v Speaker 3>her but don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where did you get this information?</v>

2457
01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Jet Shamey where'd you get it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where do I get what?</v>

2458
01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:46.090
<v Speaker 3>This information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does this come from?</v>

2459
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:47.910
<v Speaker 3>This is coming off the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2460
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:51.090
<v Speaker 3>Americans information I'm reading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them</v>

2461
01:47:55.130 --> 01:47:55.963
<v Speaker 7>slowly stopped their sources here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a book called the American </v>

2462
01:47:58.690 --> 01:47:59.523
<v Speaker 7>Journal of Science.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure that</v>

2463
01:47:59.670 --> 01:48:03.150
<v Speaker 3>which is bought and paid for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe it is.</v>

2464
01:48:03.151 --> 01:48:04.880
<v Speaker 3>It's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>

2465
01:48:04.881 --> 01:48:05.714
<v Speaker 3>Eddie wiped the Washington Post.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would anybody be paying money for </v>

2466
01:48:08.431 --> 01:48:09.264
<v Speaker 3>people to lie about the world at a set </v>
<v Speaker 3>of very good question that everybody </v>

2467
01:48:13.291 --> 01:48:14.124
<v Speaker 3>asks coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody on stat clinic group have a </v>

2468
01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:21.960
<v Speaker 3>seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

2469
01:48:23.190 --> 01:48:25.350
<v Speaker 3>they're not huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not getting knocked down.</v>

2470
01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:26.273
<v Speaker 3>That's why we just read this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been siting and you didn't even </v>

2471
01:48:28.411 --> 01:48:30.920
<v Speaker 3>understand it when we were reading it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You read off how Internet,</v>

2472
01:48:30.930 --> 01:48:31.763
<v Speaker 3>but that's how I read many books here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're both getting our information off </v>

2473
01:48:39.691 --> 01:48:40.524
<v Speaker 3>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you were saying is peer reviewed </v>

2474
01:48:42.031 --> 01:48:45.760
<v Speaker 3>journals from sign from American journal</v>
<v Speaker 3>offense.</v>

2475
01:48:45.810 --> 01:48:46.790
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is also,</v>

2476
01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:51.600
<v Speaker 3>that's like economists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think it's more likely,</v>

2477
01:48:51.690 --> 01:48:55.710
<v Speaker 3>more likely that everyone is in on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and lying than it is.</v>

2478
01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:56.633
<v Speaker 3>One guy doesn't know what the fuck he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about and it makes a youtube </v>

2479
01:48:58.651 --> 01:48:59.484
<v Speaker 3>video and you get convinced and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>attractive to you because it seems like </v>

2480
01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:05.010
<v Speaker 3>it would be an amazing conspiracy to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead of,</v>

2481
01:49:05.250 --> 01:49:06.083
<v Speaker 3>and you get trapped in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>rabbit hole and you'd go down to flat </v>

2482
01:49:08.821 --> 01:49:11.850
<v Speaker 3>earth rabbit hole and you find yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>defending things with experiments or you</v>

2483
01:49:11.851 --> 01:49:12.684
<v Speaker 3>don't even understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means you have some shit that he </v>

2484
01:49:14.911 --> 01:49:17.870
<v Speaker 3>pulled up off the internet and I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>you like all over.</v>

2485
01:49:17.890 --> 01:49:19.160
<v Speaker 3>I know you didn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You understand.</v>

2486
01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:20.850
<v Speaker 3>Explain it to you twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

2487
01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:21.773
<v Speaker 3>But I understood it and he had explained</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to you twice and you didn't </v>

2488
01:49:23.761 --> 01:49:24.790
<v Speaker 3>understand that you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2489
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:25.320
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2490
01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:25.591
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2491
01:49:25.591 --> 01:49:27.370
<v Speaker 3>This is the proof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I understand it.</v>

2492
01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:31.260
<v Speaker 3>There was an experiment to prove that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth wasn't moving.</v>

2493
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:33.960
<v Speaker 3>It was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they proved it,</v>

2494
01:49:34.170 --> 01:49:35.490
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

2495
01:49:35.491 --> 01:49:36.330
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2496
01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:36.601
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2497
01:49:36.601 --> 01:49:37.321
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2498
01:49:37.321 --> 01:49:37.710
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>

2499
01:49:37.710 --> 01:49:38.543
<v Speaker 3>they didn't prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that it's </v>

2500
01:49:39.781 --> 01:49:41.100
<v Speaker 3>spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2501
01:49:41.101 --> 01:49:41.934
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you can find some evidence of </v>

2502
01:49:43.201 --> 01:49:44.440
<v Speaker 3>the Earth is spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>

2503
01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:45.750
<v Speaker 3>people who have known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's spinning forever.</v>

2504
01:49:45.751 --> 01:49:47.450
<v Speaker 3>That's how you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how the seasons work.</v>

2505
01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.630
<v Speaker 3>That's how you see the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We spin around.</v>

2506
01:49:49.631 --> 01:49:52.960
<v Speaker 3>That's why it makes a claim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you can track time zones.</v>

2507
01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:53.853
<v Speaker 3>That's why he could put a piece of stick</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the ground asking all the actions </v>

2508
01:49:57.251 --> 01:49:58.870
<v Speaker 3>that it acts as a Sundial.</v>

2509
01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:00.393
<v Speaker 3>You're saying all the Shit Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's where would set has a </v>

2510
01:50:02.351 --> 01:50:05.290
<v Speaker 3>fundamental problem with the way you </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach these things.</v>

2511
01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:08.440
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is you do,</v>

2512
01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:11.410
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that I trust Shit Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know I don't trust you.</v>

2513
01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:13.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

2514
01:50:13.291 --> 01:50:17.830
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a flat around all back.</v>

2515
01:50:17.831 --> 01:50:20.350
<v Speaker 3>You keep saying that it's a bad fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>back because what I'm,</v>

2516
01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.090
<v Speaker 3>what we're saying is there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies.</v>

2517
01:50:22.091 --> 01:50:24.370
<v Speaker 3>The problem is when you think everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>is conspiracy,</v>

2518
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:25.383
<v Speaker 3>you act as a cyop guy and you fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>people over that want to look at real </v>

2519
01:50:29.141 --> 01:50:31.640
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies because the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies,</v>

2520
01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:34.240
<v Speaker 3>the Gulf of Tonkin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I thought too.</v>

2521
01:50:34.630 --> 01:50:38.170
<v Speaker 3>Like the Gulf of Tonkin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real operation,</v>

2522
01:50:38.171 --> 01:50:40.540
<v Speaker 3>northwoods real things that really </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

2523
01:50:40.630 --> 01:50:42.700
<v Speaker 3>When you look at those things and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>explore,</v>

2524
01:50:42.701 --> 01:50:43.271
<v Speaker 3>then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2525
01:50:43.271 --> 01:50:44.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they really killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy.</v>

2526
01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you look at this?</v>

2527
01:50:46.241 --> 01:50:47.140
<v Speaker 3>Look at this stuff.</v>

2528
01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:48.093
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of really crazy evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you start thinking that the world </v>

2529
01:50:52.391 --> 01:50:54.160
<v Speaker 3>is flat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dinosaurs aren't real,</v>

2530
01:50:54.250 --> 01:50:55.083
<v Speaker 3>all this nutty shit that you believe and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just jump into it with the problem </v>

2531
01:50:58.901 --> 01:50:59.734
<v Speaker 3>is it discredits all these other things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you believe that might be real </v>

2532
01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:05.980
<v Speaker 3>because the other things have some </v>
<v Speaker 3>validity to that.</v>

2533
01:51:05.981 --> 01:51:08.080
<v Speaker 3>You just haven't looked into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all I used to say.</v>

2534
01:51:08.081 --> 01:51:09.610
<v Speaker 3>The Sandy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the earth.</v>

2535
01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:11.313
<v Speaker 3>I'm signing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do what you think they're all </v>

2536
01:51:12.521 --> 01:51:14.230
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so insane.</v>

2537
01:51:14.231 --> 01:51:15.730
<v Speaker 3>You haven't looked into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have like,</v>

2538
01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:18.700
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could I not have?</v>

2539
01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:19.653
<v Speaker 3>You don't think I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching you go down the rabbit </v>

2540
01:51:21.311 --> 01:51:22.144
<v Speaker 3>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think I've tried to pay </v>

2541
01:51:22.241 --> 01:51:23.800
<v Speaker 3>attention to what the fuck these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are talking about.</v>

2542
01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:26.740
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so at any there's websites</v>

2543
01:51:26.741 --> 01:51:27.850
<v Speaker 3>dedicated to debunking.</v>

2544
01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:30.770
<v Speaker 3>It is dedicated to showing you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

2545
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:33.730
<v Speaker 3>showing you the math you can do when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>check the internet.</v>

2546
01:51:33.731 --> 01:51:35.530
<v Speaker 3>It's valid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I'm on the Internet,</v>

2547
01:51:35.531 --> 01:51:37.240
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not talking about the internet,</v>

2548
01:51:37.241 --> 01:51:38.860
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

2549
01:51:38.890 --> 01:51:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2550
01:51:39.851 --> 01:51:41.860
<v Speaker 3>it's a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of guys,</v>

2551
01:51:41.861 --> 01:51:44.210
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're just youtube videos.</v>

2552
01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:49.580
<v Speaker 3>No science behind them and is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>verified by peer review journals.</v>

2553
01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:50.913
<v Speaker 3>The science of the Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Saudi government science that's </v>

2554
01:51:53.261 --> 01:51:55.180
<v Speaker 3>bought and paid for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

2555
01:51:55.210 --> 01:51:59.620
<v Speaker 3>you started talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so on the sizing third is flat.</v>

2556
01:51:59.650 --> 01:52:00.940
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2557
01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:02.013
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's flat or round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I see a picture of earth from </v>

2558
01:52:05.171 --> 01:52:07.540
<v Speaker 3>space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're sitting on from space.</v>

2559
01:52:07.541 --> 01:52:09.910
<v Speaker 3>When I see a real picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we'll have the proof.</v>

2560
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying we don't need to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuro that it's round.</v>

2561
01:52:11.890 --> 01:52:12.723
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at pictures while we're </v>

2562
01:52:13.631 --> 01:52:14.830
<v Speaker 3>sitting here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2563
01:52:14.831 --> 01:52:15.664
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not even taking into </v>

2564
01:52:15.971 --> 01:52:20.080
<v Speaker 3>consideration the fact that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>monitor that you look at this,</v>

2565
01:52:20.081 --> 01:52:20.530
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2566
01:52:20.530 --> 01:52:22.240
<v Speaker 3>you don't even get like the high </v>
<v Speaker 3>resolution.</v>

2567
01:52:22.241 --> 01:52:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean they must be gigantic files that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they get.</v>

2568
01:52:24.491 --> 01:52:25.324
<v Speaker 3>You would never be able to see him and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their actual resolution on a regular </v>

2569
01:52:27.431 --> 01:52:28.264
<v Speaker 3>monitor in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about a photo of the </v>

2570
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:30.183
<v Speaker 3>earth photo of the Earth from 22,000 </v>
<v Speaker 3>miles away and they take one every </v>

2571
01:52:32.951 --> 01:52:37.951
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way you might look cgi to you,</v>

2572
01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:39.680
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to jump in a shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

2573
01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:41.440
<v Speaker 3>your side could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be real.</v>

2574
01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Too many things could be real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've been faking them so much.</v>

2575
01:52:44.651 --> 01:52:48.800
<v Speaker 3>They look like all those other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen so many fake ones that NASA,</v>

2576
01:52:48.801 --> 01:52:50.570
<v Speaker 3>a mitts that they're CGI composites.</v>

2577
01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:52.880
<v Speaker 3>There's so many out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you see this one,</v>

2578
01:52:52.881 --> 01:52:55.290
<v Speaker 3>it's like this is the same one I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many.</v>

2579
01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:57.590
<v Speaker 3>This is another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Posits is different.</v>

2580
01:52:58.330 --> 01:52:59.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>

2581
01:52:59.330 --> 01:53:01.880
<v Speaker 3>please,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you take one of these photos,</v>

2582
01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:02.840
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are those calls?</v>

2583
01:53:02.841 --> 01:53:05.330
<v Speaker 3>When you fucking do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you do that,</v>

2584
01:53:05.331 --> 01:53:06.850
<v Speaker 3>you know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a composite.</v>

2585
01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:09.430
<v Speaker 3>You're taking a bunch of photographs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they piece them all together.</v>

2586
01:53:09.431 --> 01:53:10.264
<v Speaker 3>It makes one enormous photo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you see these photos from space of </v>

2587
01:53:13.791 --> 01:53:17.300
<v Speaker 3>the earth from a closer saddle I knob </v>
<v Speaker 3>the nasa one that Jamie just pulled up,</v>

2588
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:20.210
<v Speaker 3>which does show a full full size image </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the earth.</v>

2589
01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:23.240
<v Speaker 3>What you're seeing is they take a photo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take it on the front and they piece</v>

2590
01:53:23.241 --> 01:53:24.920
<v Speaker 3>them all together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no scenes.</v>

2591
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:26.210
<v Speaker 3>It's a composite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Composite?</v>

2592
01:53:26.230 --> 01:53:26.570
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2593
01:53:26.570 --> 01:53:30.480
<v Speaker 3>There's an actual CGI artists put them </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

2594
01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:33.410
<v Speaker 7>It colors everything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eddie,</v>

2595
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:37.580
<v Speaker 7>is this CGI quick question for you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is this CGI because it's,</v>

2596
01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:38.773
<v Speaker 7>it was made in a computer and it fits </v>
<v Speaker 7>the definition of computer generated </v>

2597
01:53:41.391 --> 01:53:45.250
<v Speaker 7>image because that's the compass one </v>
<v Speaker 7>could easily mean you made this.</v>

2598
01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:47.030
<v Speaker 7>I'll show you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2599
01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:47.271
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

2600
01:53:47.271 --> 01:53:50.210
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but this could be easily a real picture,</v>

2601
01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:53.540
<v Speaker 7>but it is a real picture,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's not a hard picture.</v>

2602
01:53:53.541 --> 01:53:54.374
<v Speaker 7>Where I wasn't sure of earth from space.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's where I physically was on the </v>

2603
01:53:57.231 --> 01:54:00.020
<v Speaker 7>ground in New York City had take that </v>
<v Speaker 7>with the camera I was using.</v>

2604
01:54:00.650 --> 01:54:04.220
<v Speaker 7>That building would not fit in my lens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wasn't far enough away,</v>

2605
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:06.110
<v Speaker 7>but that's not what they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 7>they're doing.</v>

2606
01:54:06.111 --> 01:54:08.870
<v Speaker 7>They're saying they take strips.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what they're saying they do.</v>

2607
01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:10.033
<v Speaker 7>They're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to show you a video of the </v>

2608
01:54:11.271 --> 01:54:13.640
<v Speaker 7>artists who actually did the latest one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They go,</v>

2609
01:54:13.641 --> 01:54:15.970
<v Speaker 7>oh NASA,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's the guy who did the latest house.</v>

2610
01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:18.040
<v Speaker 7>Tell us what to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's awesome video.</v>

2611
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:19.183
<v Speaker 7>Just put NASA artist a CGI picture of </v>
<v Speaker 7>earth and you're going to hear him </v>

2612
01:54:24.411 --> 01:54:26.020
<v Speaker 7>talking and he says it did his </v>
<v Speaker 7>photoshop.</v>

2613
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.863
<v Speaker 7>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it is photoshop but it has to be fought </v>

2614
01:54:28.001 --> 01:54:29.680
<v Speaker 7>a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He says that word for it.</v>

2615
01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:33.620
<v Speaker 7>Can you do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was asking you to clarify that.</v>

2616
01:54:33.621 --> 01:54:35.720
<v Speaker 7>I'm trying to tell you that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 7>I literally had to do.</v>

2617
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:36.583
<v Speaker 7>I had to have been farther away to get </v>
<v Speaker 7>the photo and one photo of that giant </v>

2618
01:54:40.821 --> 01:54:41.654
<v Speaker 7>building,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that where I have in order to get </v>

2619
01:54:43.701 --> 01:54:44.534
<v Speaker 7>that distance away coloring with CGI,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there were buildings in a way you're </v>

2620
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:49.810
<v Speaker 7>saying it and photoshop.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I put his stuff,</v>

2621
01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:52.110
<v Speaker 7>he's going through the video going,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got it.</v>

2622
01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:52.953
<v Speaker 7>Cause I got,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was sometimes I put green shades here </v>

2623
01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:56.120
<v Speaker 7>and I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not an astronaut,</v>

2624
01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:57.110
<v Speaker 7>I never been to space.</v>

2625
01:54:57.110 --> 01:54:58.750
<v Speaker 7>So I have to kind of use my imagination </v>
<v Speaker 7>to,</v>

2626
01:54:59.030 --> 01:55:03.860
<v Speaker 7>to get the taking black whites almost </v>
<v Speaker 7>picture that NASA releases of earth.</v>

2627
01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:06.140
<v Speaker 7>Here's the latest one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Real nice and tight.</v>

2628
01:55:06.170 --> 01:55:08.180
<v Speaker 7>This that day that's a little </v>
<v Speaker 7>exaggerated.</v>

2629
01:55:08.181 --> 01:55:10.040
<v Speaker 7>The dark,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they weren't that dark in real life.</v>

2630
01:55:10.041 --> 01:55:11.480
<v Speaker 7>The brights aren't that bright and real </v>
<v Speaker 7>life.</v>

2631
01:55:11.481 --> 01:55:12.980
<v Speaker 7>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I added color to it.</v>

2632
01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:15.490
<v Speaker 7>I did some artistry to it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's bull shit.</v>

2633
01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:16.760
<v Speaker 7>So we got the fucking building looks </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2634
01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:19.150
<v Speaker 7>Oh okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now find that.</v>

2635
01:55:19.151 --> 01:55:23.540
<v Speaker 7>And then the CGI bucketing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you believe anything?</v>

2636
01:55:24.210 --> 01:55:26.090
<v Speaker 7>I believe shit that I can prove for </v>
<v Speaker 7>myself.</v>

2637
01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:28.450
<v Speaker 7>Like I believe the science in like a </v>
<v Speaker 7>skyscraper,</v>

2638
01:55:29.410 --> 01:55:32.060
<v Speaker 7>skyscraper it standing there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's true.</v>

2639
01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:32.953
<v Speaker 7>But how am I believe in that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have you looked into like the science </v>

2640
01:55:35.271 --> 01:55:36.104
<v Speaker 7>of space travel?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How much have you looked at how much </v>

2641
01:55:37.701 --> 01:55:40.460
<v Speaker 7>work was done to try to put satellites </v>
<v Speaker 7>into orbit?</v>

2642
01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:43.170
<v Speaker 7>So you'd think we went to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not what I asked you.</v>

2643
01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how much</v>

2644
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:45.530
<v Speaker 1>did you look in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to the moon.</v>

2645
01:55:45.550 --> 01:55:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Heti answer my fucking talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

2646
01:55:48.850 --> 01:55:51.480
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] circle you talking in </v>
<v Speaker 1>circles.</v>

2647
01:55:52.030 --> 01:55:54.510
<v Speaker 1>They're ridiculous conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is the government,</v>

2648
01:55:54.511 --> 01:55:55.440
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>

2649
01:55:55.590 --> 01:55:57.980
<v Speaker 1>the government's fake pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I'm just asking you a question,</v>

2650
01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:01.140
<v Speaker 1>punch up NASA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CGI artists.</v>

2651
01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Picture of earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that up there head.</v>

2652
01:56:03.150 --> 01:56:03.983
<v Speaker 1>He's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you like me to click on any of </v>

2653
01:56:06.541 --> 01:56:08.040
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one right there.</v>

2654
01:56:08.041 --> 01:56:11.640
<v Speaker 1>The second one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2655
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.770
<v Speaker 1>I just listened to him talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2656
01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:18.840
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No guys,</v>

2657
01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:19.793
<v Speaker 1>Jeff [inaudible] today I want to share </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you this article that's going to </v>

2658
01:56:21.770 --> 01:56:23.580
<v Speaker 1>seem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we allowed to play?</v>

2659
01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:24.543
<v Speaker 1>This guy isn't a scientist or are we </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to him or the the guy that </v>

2660
01:56:27.751 --> 01:56:28.584
<v Speaker 1>made the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said we're gonna listen to a </v>

2661
01:56:29.461 --> 01:56:30.840
<v Speaker 1>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2662
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:33.010
<v Speaker 1>it looked like the right video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2663
01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:33.853
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2664
01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:35.910
<v Speaker 1>but that is the guy that is the artist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he has,</v>

2665
01:56:35.911 --> 01:56:36.744
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a picture of the video talking </v>

2666
01:56:40.261 --> 01:56:44.190
<v Speaker 1>about how he created the latest picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>of earth for NASA.</v>

2667
01:56:44.191 --> 01:56:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're celebrating</v>

2668
01:56:46.410 --> 01:56:48.280
<v Speaker 5>Goddard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's from the goddard webpage.</v>

2669
01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:51.180
<v Speaker 5>So he's doing a recap of something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's written on the God or webpage.</v>

2670
01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:52.253
<v Speaker 5>So go to the God or web page,</v>
<v Speaker 5>find that guys page Robert Simmons </v>

2671
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:55.860
<v Speaker 5>Photoshop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There it was,</v>

2672
01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:02.000
<v Speaker 1>and we'll see what he's actually saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a picture?</v>

2673
01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:06.163
<v Speaker 5>What do you think is the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting that your role here at </v>

2674
01:57:07.191 --> 01:57:09.470
<v Speaker 5>Goddard?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you help support God's mission?</v>

2675
01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:12.310
<v Speaker 5>My role is to make imagery from earth </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientists.</v>

2676
01:57:12.330 --> 01:57:15.020
<v Speaker 5>Science is data.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I turned data into pictures.</v>

2677
01:57:15.230 --> 01:57:17.130
<v Speaker 5>I look for new interesting events that </v>
<v Speaker 5>nat NASA,</v>

2678
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:20.630
<v Speaker 5>NASA satellites have seen or that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>hidden in the latest data.</v>

2679
01:57:20.631 --> 01:57:24.470
<v Speaker 5>Define anything interesting that shows </v>
<v Speaker 5>off NASA is unique capabilities.</v>

2680
01:57:24.471 --> 01:57:25.304
<v Speaker 5>Finding things is the fun part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I rely on engineers and scientists to </v>

2681
01:57:27.951 --> 01:57:29.900
<v Speaker 5>produce the data.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're reliable.</v>

2682
01:57:29.901 --> 01:57:34.360
<v Speaker 5>Real time stream of 1.7 terabytes a day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit is incredible tale.</v>

2683
01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:38.420
<v Speaker 5>About the same as producing 3000 cds a </v>
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

2684
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:39.283
<v Speaker 5>We know where to look for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting stuff because each </v>

2685
01:57:41.630 --> 01:57:45.230
<v Speaker 5>instrument provides a very specialized </v>
<v Speaker 5>type of information.</v>

2686
01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:47.060
<v Speaker 5>So if I'm looking for something </v>
<v Speaker 5>specific,</v>

2687
01:57:47.090 --> 01:57:48.710
<v Speaker 5>I know where to look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

2688
01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:50.930
<v Speaker 5>recently there was a volcanic eruption </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the Red Sea.</v>

2689
01:57:50.931 --> 01:57:53.330
<v Speaker 5>The only reliable imagery of this was </v>
<v Speaker 5>from NASA satellites.</v>

2690
01:57:53.331 --> 01:57:55.910
<v Speaker 5>We basically confirmed the existence of </v>
<v Speaker 5>a new island.</v>

2691
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:57.680
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so where's the,</v>

2692
01:57:57.681 --> 01:58:00.170
<v Speaker 5>let's get to some photoshop shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The one where he's talking.</v>

2693
01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:01.093
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this guy's talking about science </v>

2694
01:58:01.821 --> 01:58:03.800
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like some of the science has to be real,</v>

2695
01:58:03.801 --> 01:58:04.550
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eddie?</v>

2696
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:06.620
<v Speaker 5>Like there has to be some subtle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like direct TV.</v>

2697
01:58:06.650 --> 01:58:07.970
<v Speaker 5>Direct TV is not fake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2698
01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2699
01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:12.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could do all that with land line</v>

2700
01:58:12.301 --> 01:58:13.134
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to go bounce anything </v>

2701
01:58:14.101 --> 01:58:15.370
<v Speaker 1>from space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do audio,</v>

2702
01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:16.953
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could just put it in space and it </v>

2703
01:58:17.681 --> 01:58:19.930
<v Speaker 5>just broadcast and shoot it up there and</v>
<v Speaker 5>shoot it back.</v>

2704
01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:21.670
<v Speaker 5>Why would you lie about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2705
01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:24.250
<v Speaker 5>there's a ton of fucking space.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Junk</v>

2706
01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:29.080
<v Speaker 1>satellite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no faith for satellites,</v>

2707
01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:31.140
<v Speaker 1>no pays for satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The taxpayer.</v>

2708
01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:32.080
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get bills.</v>

2709
01:58:32.081 --> 01:58:34.240
<v Speaker 1>We need nude telecommunication </v>
<v Speaker 1>satellite.</v>

2710
01:58:34.241 --> 01:58:36.880
<v Speaker 1>We got to throw it up there so you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>need $35 million.</v>

2711
01:58:36.881 --> 01:58:37.714
<v Speaker 1>Don't think Niko.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2712
01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to sign it.</v>

2713
01:58:38.710 --> 01:58:41.830
<v Speaker 1>They get the money to tax scam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think are real?</v>

2714
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:43.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2715
01:58:43.671 --> 01:58:45.180
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

2716
01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:46.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happening?</v>

2717
01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:47.313
<v Speaker 3>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are those things up there that you </v>

2718
01:58:47.921 --> 01:58:50.860
<v Speaker 3>can watch from the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen the space station fly</v>

2719
01:58:50.861 --> 01:58:52.000
<v Speaker 3>over head?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see it.</v>

2720
01:58:52.090 --> 01:58:54.280
<v Speaker 3>They can in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have pictures of it.</v>

2721
01:58:54.281 --> 01:58:55.114
<v Speaker 3>They timed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They told me it was going to be </v>

2722
01:58:55.590 --> 01:58:56.740
<v Speaker 3>overhead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a picture of it.</v>

2723
01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:59.050
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was in a high altitude plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the difference?</v>

2724
01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:01.780
<v Speaker 3>Why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would they lie?</v>

2725
01:59:02.170 --> 01:59:06.340
<v Speaker 3>Why would they pretend it's a space?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How high do airplanes go?</v>

2726
01:59:06.341 --> 01:59:09.700
<v Speaker 3>30,000 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now they can go hire 59 or 50 plus</v>

2727
01:59:09.970 --> 01:59:14.680
<v Speaker 3>commercial airplanes on average,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in the 30s 30 35,000 right.</v>

2728
01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:18.250
<v Speaker 3>When you're on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early sealing at 30,000 feet,</v>

2729
01:59:18.490 --> 01:59:19.323
<v Speaker 3>barely fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're in 30,000 feet and you'd </v>

2730
01:59:20.851 --> 01:59:21.684
<v Speaker 3>look down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't be able to see a god damn </v>

2731
01:59:23.351 --> 01:59:24.550
<v Speaker 3>it's true bus or a plane.</v>

2732
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:28.840
<v Speaker 3>Now those satellites are supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a hundred miles up.</v>

2733
01:59:28.930 --> 01:59:32.320
<v Speaker 3>Think about that because they're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>space and there a light.</v>

2734
01:59:32.410 --> 01:59:35.230
<v Speaker 3>There are very small pinprick of light </v>
<v Speaker 3>that moves across the sky.</v>

2735
01:59:35.231 --> 01:59:37.090
<v Speaker 3>You could see him with optics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to,</v>

2736
01:59:37.250 --> 01:59:38.083
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you really haven't looked and you </v>

2737
01:59:38.711 --> 01:59:39.544
<v Speaker 3>definitely haven't looked with optics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look with like a big spotting </v>

2738
01:59:41.531 --> 01:59:42.364
<v Speaker 3>scope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people get these telescopes and </v>

2739
01:59:43.241 --> 01:59:44.800
<v Speaker 3>they look up and they know exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going to be.</v>

2740
01:59:44.801 --> 01:59:46.570
<v Speaker 3>You can actually program it into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>telescope.</v>

2741
01:59:46.810 --> 01:59:47.643
<v Speaker 3>There's things that you can download </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you could find the coordinates of </v>

2742
01:59:49.691 --> 01:59:50.524
<v Speaker 3>itch into each individual planning the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that really super powerful </v>

2743
01:59:52.781 --> 01:59:53.614
<v Speaker 3>telescopes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said a amateur astronomers like to </v>

2744
01:59:54.881 --> 01:59:55.714
<v Speaker 3>use you in the key numbers and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>move specifically to a spot in the sky </v>

2745
02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:00.933
<v Speaker 3>where you can tune in to the moon or </v>
<v Speaker 3>tune into Saturn or into very specific </v>

2746
02:00:05.351 --> 02:00:06.610
<v Speaker 3>areas of the cosmos.</v>

2747
02:00:06.610 --> 02:00:09.580
<v Speaker 3>That change all the time because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that the earth is spinning.</v>

2748
02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:11.470
<v Speaker 3>We're catching all sorts of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

2749
02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:12.760
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of different times.</v>

2750
02:00:12.761 --> 02:00:15.220
<v Speaker 3>Especially no matter where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're on the equator,</v>

2751
02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:17.440
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 3>image,</v>

2752
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:19.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one moment in the sky,</v>

2753
02:00:19.301 --> 02:00:20.134
<v Speaker 3>then you are the next moment so it can </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you exactly where the space </v>

2754
02:00:22.781 --> 02:00:24.670
<v Speaker 3>station's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the moon's going to be,</v>

2755
02:00:24.671 --> 02:00:25.504
<v Speaker 3>where Mars is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they punch these coordinates into </v>

2756
02:00:27.251 --> 02:00:30.040
<v Speaker 3>these little computers and they all move</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this thing.</v>

2757
02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:32.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you believe the marvel Mars Rovers,</v>

2758
02:00:32.231 --> 02:00:33.064
<v Speaker 3>real man Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm going to do this </v>

2759
02:00:34.541 --> 02:00:37.870
<v Speaker 3>anymore because it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see why.</v>

2760
02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:39.720
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see where's the money for.</v>

2761
02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:40.391
<v Speaker 3>Then I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2762
02:00:40.391 --> 02:00:41.224
<v Speaker 3>hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see where the money is to have </v>

2763
02:00:42.941 --> 02:00:46.700
<v Speaker 3>all these hoaxes that you don't see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tax scam with the rovers land,</v>

2764
02:00:46.730 --> 02:00:47.980
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get the,</v>

2765
02:00:48.010 --> 02:00:52.150
<v Speaker 3>they just got nine NASA got $19 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2766
02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:55.240
<v Speaker 3>for trump gave him $19 billion.</v>

2767
02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:58.720
<v Speaker 3>What tells me possible so that they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually make a rover.</v>

2768
02:00:58.750 --> 02:00:59.583
<v Speaker 3>Tell me what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me what the space shuttle has done </v>

2769
02:01:02.321 --> 02:01:03.154
<v Speaker 3>for humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me all that money that was wasted </v>

2770
02:01:04.931 --> 02:01:06.280
<v Speaker 3>on spacial and then they just trashed </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2771
02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:07.293
<v Speaker 3>They went up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many times and then </v>

2772
02:01:08.111 --> 02:01:08.944
<v Speaker 3>they just trashed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't tell him how all those billions </v>

2773
02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:13.600
<v Speaker 3>of dollars has helped humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me,</v>

2774
02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:14.553
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think scientific innovation is very </v>

2775
02:01:17.201 --> 02:01:21.490
<v Speaker 3>important to us because in our minds we </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly want newer bed,</v>

2776
02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:23.630
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more innovative technologies.</v>

2777
02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:26.950
<v Speaker 3>Just a part of being a person in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>21st century what everybody wants.</v>

2778
02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:28.053
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants a new computer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody wants new things and a lot of </v>

2779
02:01:30.131 --> 02:01:32.950
<v Speaker 3>this new stuff comes from NASA </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>

2780
02:01:32.951 --> 02:01:37.060
<v Speaker 3>It comes from all the science and </v>
<v Speaker 3>innovation that goes names a part of me.</v>

2781
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 3>There's a list right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why</v>

2782
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:42.110
<v Speaker 5>do you say this when you don't look into</v>
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>

2783
02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:45.050
<v Speaker 5>I just love telling highway safety.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How does that,</v>

2784
02:01:45.051 --> 02:01:46.520
<v Speaker 5>how can we can read that down?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hires,</v>

2785
02:01:46.630 --> 02:01:48.290
<v Speaker 5>how can that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how can we can caddy,</v>

2786
02:01:48.291 --> 02:01:49.124
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the massive requirements that you have </v>

2787
02:01:52.011 --> 02:01:55.190
<v Speaker 5>on the gear when you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>going through fucking space,</v>

2788
02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:56.233
<v Speaker 5>the insane stress of reentry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they figured out all kinds of crazy </v>

2789
02:02:00.231 --> 02:02:02.000
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The speed in which you land,</v>

2790
02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:05.060
<v Speaker 5>they figured out a bunch of crazy shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>and rich baby food,</v>

2791
02:02:05.061 --> 02:02:06.800
<v Speaker 5>I mean portable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cordless vacuums,</v>

2792
02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:09.440
<v Speaker 5>freeze drying technology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of this comes from space.</v>

2793
02:02:09.441 --> 02:02:11.060
<v Speaker 5>There's a shit load of things that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>figured out.</v>

2794
02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:12.013
<v Speaker 5>Harnessing solar energy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of innovation that comes </v>

2795
02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:15.313
<v Speaker 5>from the development of either the space</v>
<v Speaker 5>station or the shuttles or a bunch of </v>

2796
02:02:19.671 --> 02:02:20.504
<v Speaker 5>different things that they've invented </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they continue to innovate these </v>

2797
02:02:22.671 --> 02:02:24.260
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these new satellites,</v>

2798
02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:26.660
<v Speaker 5>the shooting on the space are way better</v>
<v Speaker 5>than the humble.</v>

2799
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:30.050
<v Speaker 5>They keep doing more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>better and better,</v>

2800
02:02:30.170 --> 02:02:33.530
<v Speaker 5>and it's this constant rush to see who </v>
<v Speaker 5>can get to the,</v>

2801
02:02:33.590 --> 02:02:37.520
<v Speaker 5>the furthest point of technology in </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever field they're in,</v>

2802
02:02:37.670 --> 02:02:41.270
<v Speaker 5>whether it's the field of rocketry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's the field of satellites,</v>

2803
02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:42.373
<v Speaker 5>there's this massive amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>competition between the top scientists </v>

2804
02:02:45.381 --> 02:02:47.870
<v Speaker 5>in the world and to think that that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>all fake.</v>

2805
02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:49.013
<v Speaker 5>Does it make any sense?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because there are some things that are </v>

2806
02:02:50.691 --> 02:02:54.500
<v Speaker 5>fake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So why assume that all this is fake when</v>

2807
02:02:54.501 --> 02:02:55.334
<v Speaker 5>you really could see the challenger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you saw the challenger explode in the </v>

2808
02:02:57.741 --> 02:02:59.150
<v Speaker 5>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's fake,</v>

2809
02:02:59.270 --> 02:03:01.820
<v Speaker 5>no one was there to engineer the shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>that failed.</v>

2810
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:03.020
<v Speaker 5>Who said that was framed?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2811
02:03:03.021 --> 02:03:04.040
<v Speaker 5>any of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any of it,</v>

2812
02:03:04.041 --> 02:03:07.610
<v Speaker 5>any space travel because it's going up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So high altitude,</v>

2813
02:03:07.611 --> 02:03:09.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the space shuttle goes up and they'd use</v>

2814
02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:10.633
<v Speaker 5>work on fucking satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do know that the space station video </v>

2815
02:03:15.051 --> 02:03:20.051
<v Speaker 5>that sheldon and amy hit it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do this.</v>

2816
02:03:21.230 --> 02:03:22.063
<v Speaker 5>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a lot of these things that you just </v>

2817
02:03:24.081 --> 02:03:27.020
<v Speaker 5>automatically want to fake six moon </v>
<v Speaker 5>missions.</v>

2818
02:03:27.021 --> 02:03:28.820
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course that on trust shows,</v>

2819
02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:33.680
<v Speaker 5>even if that was true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are people in 1969 they're not the</v>

2820
02:03:33.681 --> 02:03:34.930
<v Speaker 5>same humans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2821
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:37.160
<v Speaker 5>so some people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not the same human beings.</v>

2822
02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:41.990
<v Speaker 5>That's just like saying that the people </v>
<v Speaker 5>who made the movies in 1969 are the same</v>

2823
02:03:41.991 --> 02:03:45.350
<v Speaker 5>people that made fast and furious eight </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that's what they make the movies.</v>

2824
02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:47.960
<v Speaker 5>They're not the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're totally different humans.</v>

2825
02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:53.080
<v Speaker 5>It's like saying the standup comedians </v>
<v Speaker 5>from 1969 but the same as the one nine 6</v>

2826
02:03:54.340 --> 02:03:55.173
<v Speaker 5>million missions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How am I supposed to believe those are </v>

2827
02:03:56.031 --> 02:03:58.190
<v Speaker 5>not the same people?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if that was true,</v>

2828
02:03:58.191 --> 02:04:00.710
<v Speaker 5>there's not the same people in rich.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Richard Nixon isn't alive anymore.</v>

2829
02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:02.540
<v Speaker 5>Just write them all off though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eddie just off.</v>

2830
02:04:02.650 --> 02:04:03.680
<v Speaker 5>Got To prove that to me.</v>

2831
02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:04.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't need to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2832
02:04:04.851 --> 02:04:07.810
<v Speaker 5>but don't need to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How's it going to add on?</v>

2833
02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:09.140
<v Speaker 5>Believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if it's true,</v>

2834
02:04:09.141 --> 02:04:09.801
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2835
02:04:09.801 --> 02:04:10.581
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2836
02:04:10.581 --> 02:04:11.510
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2837
02:04:11.511 --> 02:04:12.344
<v Speaker 5>but you got to prove it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise the problem isn't die handled </v>

2838
02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:16.723
<v Speaker 5>the product.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is there's no proven it and </v>

2839
02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:21.230
<v Speaker 5>you want to always assume that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>fake.</v>

2840
02:04:21.231 --> 02:04:22.064
<v Speaker 5>You don't have like this empty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>prove it to me like I'm not assuming </v>

2841
02:04:24.171 --> 02:04:25.004
<v Speaker 5>either way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're assuming it's fake every time </v>

2842
02:04:27.170 --> 02:04:29.330
<v Speaker 5>they faked six moon mission,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't matter.</v>

2843
02:04:29.331 --> 02:04:32.420
<v Speaker 5>These are not the same people living in </v>
<v Speaker 5>a different type of people they want,</v>

2844
02:04:32.421 --> 02:04:34.370
<v Speaker 5>they're not going to add all those </v>
<v Speaker 5>standard logic.</v>

2845
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:37.590
<v Speaker 5>The logic is just because someone fakes </v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

2846
02:04:37.591 --> 02:04:40.050
<v Speaker 5>one point in time before you were all </v>
<v Speaker 5>alive,</v>

2847
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:41.223
<v Speaker 5>doesn't mean that those same human </v>
<v Speaker 5>beings ever managed to download their </v>

2848
02:04:45.241 --> 02:04:47.190
<v Speaker 5>brains.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And everybody that ever did that job for</v>

2849
02:04:47.191 --> 02:04:49.560
<v Speaker 5>the rest of time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're not the same humans,</v>

2850
02:04:49.590 --> 02:04:53.070
<v Speaker 5>but so the scientists that are today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the generations later,</v>

2851
02:04:53.071 --> 02:04:56.100
<v Speaker 5>whether it's NASA or these Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientists or the Russians,</v>

2852
02:04:56.101 --> 02:04:56.934
<v Speaker 5>the Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoever the fuck is putting satellites </v>

2853
02:04:57.901 --> 02:04:58.734
<v Speaker 5>and rockets into space,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not the same people from 1969 </v>

2854
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:03.270
<v Speaker 5>you can't like look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like in one ad,</v>

2855
02:05:03.271 --> 02:05:04.170
<v Speaker 5>one blanket,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or</v>

2856
02:05:04.450 --> 02:05:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't blame NASA.</v>

2857
02:05:06.930 --> 02:05:09.380
<v Speaker 1>1969 Vena NASA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2858
02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:10.233
<v Speaker 1>Warner von Braun at Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't blame today's NASA for all the </v>

2859
02:05:14.351 --> 02:05:15.930
<v Speaker 1>lies from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what you're saying?</v>

2860
02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:16.783
<v Speaker 1>From the early seventies I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you believe that the space shuttles </v>

2861
02:05:20.201 --> 02:05:21.070
<v Speaker 1>were real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2862
02:05:21.071 --> 02:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I do believe the spacial Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2863
02:05:22.571 --> 02:05:27.571
<v Speaker 1>Just that I've saw plenty of video of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and then they take it on.</v>

2864
02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything else is bullshit.</v>

2865
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:31.703
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made the Saturn five rockets and </v>

2866
02:05:32.501 --> 02:05:33.281
<v Speaker 1>they launched him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2867
02:05:33.281 --> 02:05:34.810
<v Speaker 1>So do you know where they went into </v>
<v Speaker 1>orbit?</v>

2868
02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when the orbiter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how high,</v>

2869
02:05:36.690 --> 02:05:38.080
<v Speaker 1>how high people are going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2870
02:05:38.170 --> 02:05:39.003
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know.</v>

2871
02:05:39.130 --> 02:05:40.870
<v Speaker 1>I know they're going high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how high.</v>

2872
02:05:41.170 --> 02:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>So why would you assume that any of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is fake?</v>

2873
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:44.740
<v Speaker 1>They fake six moon missions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2874
02:05:44.741 --> 02:05:45.501
<v Speaker 1>You keep saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2875
02:05:45.501 --> 02:05:46.270
<v Speaker 1>but that's why.</v>

2876
02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:47.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not talking about the same </v>

2877
02:05:47.591 --> 02:05:49.050
<v Speaker 1>people at ea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

2878
02:05:49.060 --> 02:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same organization.</v>

2879
02:05:51.221 --> 02:05:52.054
<v Speaker 1>The problem is worse today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn them into va as soon as you say </v>

2880
02:05:54.731 --> 02:05:57.190
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now let me ask you something.</v>

2881
02:05:57.790 --> 02:06:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you a Brendan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you see that?</v>

2882
02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:01.273
<v Speaker 1>That how I can't trust NASA because even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though it was different people in 1969 </v>

2883
02:06:06.131 --> 02:06:06.964
<v Speaker 1>to 1973,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the p the massive today </v>

2884
02:06:10.721 --> 02:06:11.554
<v Speaker 1>aren't the ones that fake six moon </v>
<v Speaker 1>missions and stole billions of dollars </v>

2885
02:06:14.531 --> 02:06:17.830
<v Speaker 1>from American taxpayer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because the guys from today,</v>

2886
02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:20.650
<v Speaker 1>somehow they got weeded out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then NASA,</v>

2887
02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:22.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that they got weeded out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2888
02:06:22.181 --> 02:06:23.780
<v Speaker 1>in Nasa came this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2889
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:24.663
<v Speaker 1>honest agency of the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know that I'm going to </v>

2890
02:06:27.101 --> 02:06:29.800
<v Speaker 1>assume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to assume no,</v>

2891
02:06:29.801 --> 02:06:30.640
<v Speaker 1>I think you're the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2892
02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:34.030
<v Speaker 1>it's still part of the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong.</v>

2893
02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:34.953
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're good.</v>

2894
02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Let's say those six missions were all </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and it was fake.</v>

2895
02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:41.110
<v Speaker 1>You're going off the exception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the general rule.</v>

2896
02:06:41.170 --> 02:06:43.540
<v Speaker 1>So it's like me coming into your academy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some guy's a dick.</v>

2897
02:06:43.541 --> 02:06:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm like all those 10th planet guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dicks.</v>

2898
02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Like you're just lumping all them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same fucking,</v>

2899
02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:49.553
<v Speaker 1>that was a big shit though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like side project mass </v>

2900
02:06:51.601 --> 02:06:54.660
<v Speaker 1>employees to roadmap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is no,</v>

2901
02:06:54.670 --> 02:06:56.200
<v Speaker 1>I understand you saying the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>he said.</v>

2902
02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:58.960
<v Speaker 1>He's saying that just because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2903
02:06:59.090 --> 02:06:59.923
<v Speaker 1>that was the mood swings were so </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic and so global and the greatest </v>

2904
02:07:05.441 --> 02:07:10.441
<v Speaker 1>achievement of mankind and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even have the records anymore.</v>

2905
02:07:11.050 --> 02:07:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm talking about?</v>

2906
02:07:12.011 --> 02:07:13.330
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2907
02:07:13.930 --> 02:07:15.820
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about this early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know all that moon,</v>

2908
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.460
<v Speaker 1>you're not immature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Data's missing.</v>

2909
02:07:17.950 --> 02:07:20.590
<v Speaker 1>They had an awesome video says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

2910
02:07:20.890 --> 02:07:22.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have it.</v>

2911
02:07:22.241 --> 02:07:23.800
<v Speaker 1>It's missing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it's stolen,</v>

2912
02:07:23.801 --> 02:07:27.670
<v Speaker 1>but even if we did the head of NASA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if we did have the tapes,</v>

2913
02:07:28.150 --> 02:07:30.880
<v Speaker 1>we don't have the machines to play him </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

2914
02:07:30.881 --> 02:07:32.770
<v Speaker 1>so it really doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

2915
02:07:32.771 --> 02:07:33.610
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dumb retard</v>

2917
02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:39.790
<v Speaker 3>detective on the planet would would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspicious.</v>

2918
02:07:39.880 --> 02:07:42.600
<v Speaker 3>That just smelled like mission,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't just lump all,</v>

2919
02:07:42.610 --> 02:07:43.540
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all bullshit.</v>

2920
02:07:43.541 --> 02:07:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Then everyone will the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to see some Brendan,</v>

2921
02:07:45.521 --> 02:07:47.710
<v Speaker 3>it'll make you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the most suspicious thing.</v>

2922
02:07:48.010 --> 02:07:48.843
<v Speaker 3>One of the weirdest things about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moon landing is the post flight press </v>

2923
02:07:51.281 --> 02:07:52.570
<v Speaker 3>conference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen it?</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real weird.</v>

2925
02:07:55.720 --> 02:07:57.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean they can swift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Hipaa goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>

2929
02:08:02.370 --> 02:08:04.940
<v Speaker 3>They're open to it because now you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

2930
02:08:04.941 --> 02:08:06.710
<v Speaker 3>you're open to the fact that maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck I,</v>

2931
02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:07.553
<v Speaker 3>I maybe they did fake that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't just lump sum and I'm </v>

2932
02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:14.690
<v Speaker 3>saying they did the greatest achievement</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the time.</v>

2933
02:08:17.250 --> 02:08:19.780
<v Speaker 3>We got new people now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

2934
02:08:19.781 --> 02:08:20.770
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2935
02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:23.113
<v Speaker 3>How can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you see how I can't trust shit </v>

2936
02:08:24.671 --> 02:08:29.230
<v Speaker 3>from assets?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they would,</v>

2937
02:08:29.250 --> 02:08:30.070
<v Speaker 3>they they,</v>

02:08:31.721 --> 02:08:34.900
<v Speaker 3>they're all old and the new NASA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the good mass.</v>

2940
02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:36.573
<v Speaker 3>They can't all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was an agenda or believe in a </v>

2941

<v Speaker 3>guy on youtube.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Those people,</v>

2949
02:08:55.050 --> 02:08:55.883
<v Speaker 3>if you gave every racist person a video </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera and put made them a youtube </v>

2954
02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:13.500
<v Speaker 3>Don't have an hour for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're asking what is their side?</v>

2955
02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:16.210
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does Eric do?</v>

2956
02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:19.870
<v Speaker 3>I fourth grade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my teacher,</v>

2957
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:22.150
<v Speaker 3>I know what you don't care and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

2958
02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:23.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be mad at you for not </v>
<v Speaker 3>caring.</v>

2959
02:09:23.850 --> 02:09:25.540
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't be mad at me for carrying.</v>

2960
02:09:25.550 --> 02:09:26.383
<v Speaker 3>Then you don't look into what from mad </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause you don't look into what </v>

2961
02:09:32.411 --> 02:09:34.510
<v Speaker 3>scientists say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

2962
02:09:34.511 --> 02:09:39.511
<v Speaker 3>You're just automatically dismiss that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This fair to say the reason why you care</v>

2963
02:09:39.851 --> 02:09:42.250
<v Speaker 3>so much about Eddie believe in this shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know Eddie going,</v>

2964
02:09:42.251 --> 02:09:47.251
<v Speaker 3>I'm crazy cause he said he influences a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people and you to find enough for</v>

2965
02:09:47.351 --> 02:09:49.750
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look for the truth and look into it like</v>

2966
02:09:49.751 --> 02:09:50.584
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're investigating and just look </v>

2967
02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:54.850
<v Speaker 3>into both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why it's becoming huge.</v>

2968
02:09:54.851 --> 02:09:57.910
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason because people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really go to school.</v>

2969
02:09:59.950 --> 02:10:02.830
<v Speaker 3>They don't learn astrophysics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't study all these things.</v>

2970
02:10:02.831 --> 02:10:03.940
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2971
02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:07.840
<v Speaker 3>the entry barrier is fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to study physics,</v>

2972
02:10:07.841 --> 02:10:10.780
<v Speaker 3>you want to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can barely pay attention to it.</v>

2973
02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:13.360
<v Speaker 3>I listen to these books on tape and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go back over.</v>

2974
02:10:13.361 --> 02:10:14.194
<v Speaker 3>I'm three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four times just to understand a </v>

2975
02:10:15.371 --> 02:10:16.204
<v Speaker 3>paragraph.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try to figure out exactly what the fuck </v>

2976
02:10:17.951 --> 02:10:18.784
<v Speaker 3>they're quantifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about really intense </v>

2977
02:10:20.111 --> 02:10:23.380
<v Speaker 3>shit that thousands of people been </v>
<v Speaker 3>working on in conjunction.</v>

2978
02:10:23.381 --> 02:10:25.180
<v Speaker 3>They all feed off of each other's </v>
<v Speaker 3>innovation.</v>

2979
02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:26.860
<v Speaker 3>There's so many people working on these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2980
02:10:26.861 --> 02:10:27.694
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that they're all in on some </v>

2981
02:10:28.871 --> 02:10:32.350
<v Speaker 3>sort of a giant global lie is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2982
02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:34.830
<v Speaker 3>That's what everyone thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2983
02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:36.621
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2984
02:10:36.621 --> 02:10:37.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no women.</v>

2985
02:10:38.590 --> 02:10:40.990
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no one in history of flat.</v>

2986
02:10:40.991 --> 02:10:43.340
<v Speaker 3>I was looking into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It definitely can't.</v>

2987
02:10:43.341 --> 02:10:48.341
<v Speaker 3>So let me just say why I don't watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>game of thrones.</v>

2988
02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:55.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch breaking bad and better </v>
<v Speaker 3>call Saul.</v>

2989
02:10:55.610 --> 02:10:57.020
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you watch?</v>

2990
02:10:57.110 --> 02:11:01.400
<v Speaker 3>I watch real shit like first 48 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not talking about a show,</v>

2991
02:11:01.401 --> 02:11:04.100
<v Speaker 3>but if you watch game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knows it's fake.</v>

2992
02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:08.780
<v Speaker 3>It's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you don't,</v>

2993
02:11:08.820 --> 02:11:10.010
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just having fun.</v>

2994
02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:11.420
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the earth flat around?</v>

2995
02:11:11.540 --> 02:11:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's flat around until </v>
<v Speaker 3>we see a picture from space.</v>

2996
02:11:14.750 --> 02:11:17.850
<v Speaker 3>They're saying this bitch could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>squared be around.</v>

2997
02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:21.500
<v Speaker 3>It could be willing to a big camera with</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish.</v>

2998
02:11:21.501 --> 02:11:22.301
<v Speaker 3>I fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had done it.</v>

2999
02:11:22.301 --> 02:11:24.380
<v Speaker 3>You guys are fooled by the Fisheye Lens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>C'Mon man.</v>

3000
02:11:25.460 --> 02:11:26.293
<v Speaker 3>Plenty of pictures without the Fisheye </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lens that you could find this fish eye </v>

3001
02:11:28.591 --> 02:11:29.424
<v Speaker 3>lens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys buy some basic ass </v>

3002
02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:33.050
<v Speaker 3>kindergarten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand perspective?</v>

3003
02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do understand for PSI,</v>

3004
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:38.480
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't have a fish eye lens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you looking at this tiny fraction of the</v>

3005
02:11:38.481 --> 02:11:42.370
<v Speaker 3>surface,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why you shied lens of 1946,</v>

3006
02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:43.610
<v Speaker 3>how do you know that's real?</v>

3007
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Because it's a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran it on the net.</v>

3008
02:11:46.761 --> 02:11:51.761
<v Speaker 3>That's why I know he's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you,</v>

3009
02:11:54.650 --> 02:11:55.700
<v Speaker 3>would you be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's real.</v>

3010
02:11:56.700 --> 02:11:59.510
<v Speaker 3>That's real to Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you be open to talking to you care</v>

3011
02:11:59.511 --> 02:12:01.160
<v Speaker 3>if you believe that's real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

3012
02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:04.670
<v Speaker 3>Would you be taught in to talking to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual astrophysicist?</v>

3013
02:12:04.730 --> 02:12:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to.</v>

3014
02:12:05.721 --> 02:12:07.490
<v Speaker 3>Like what would you do if Neil degrasse </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tyson was here?</v>

3015
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:10.850
<v Speaker 3>Same arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would have some questions.</v>

3016
02:12:10.900 --> 02:12:13.100
<v Speaker 3>What would you listen to them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you had to be told you some shit</v>

3017
02:12:13.101 --> 02:12:17.780
<v Speaker 3>that actually made sense or would you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just think he's in a total I round earth</v>

3018
02:12:17.781 --> 02:12:19.370
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3019
02:12:19.371 --> 02:12:20.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

3020
02:12:20.361 --> 02:12:21.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3021
02:12:21.770 --> 02:12:22.603
<v Speaker 3>there's people that they push to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spokespeople and there's really </v>

3022
02:12:25.551 --> 02:12:28.580
<v Speaker 3>brilliant people that are good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking and their educators like him.</v>

3023
02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:30.620
<v Speaker 3>And then they get on television and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people love it.</v>

3024
02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:34.050
<v Speaker 3>And so he comes back and then he does a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit show called Cosmos or re-enacts.</v>

3025
02:12:34.051 --> 02:12:36.380
<v Speaker 3>But Carl Sagan show and everybody loves </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3026
02:12:36.381 --> 02:12:39.440
<v Speaker 3>And more people understand science now </v>
<v Speaker 3>than ever before because he breaks.</v>

3027
02:12:39.441 --> 02:12:40.310
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>

3028
02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:41.173
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard because you didn't go to </v>

3029
02:12:41.991 --> 02:12:43.820
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not mad,</v>

3030
02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.350
<v Speaker 3>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you man.</v>

3031
02:12:45.380 --> 02:12:46.190
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3032
02:12:46.190 --> 02:12:47.420
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to,</v>

3033
02:12:47.421 --> 02:12:48.254
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be able to talk about flat </v>

3034
02:12:49.191 --> 02:12:50.024
<v Speaker 3>earth and have fun cake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not fun for me because I think </v>

3035
02:12:52.041 --> 02:12:52.874
<v Speaker 3>there's some 16 year old kids out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are listening to this and they </v>

3036
02:12:54.261 --> 02:12:56.010
<v Speaker 3>think he makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem is,</v>

3037
02:12:56.011 --> 02:12:56.781
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with that?</v>

3038
02:12:56.781 --> 02:12:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Who cares about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because those poor kids,</v>

3039
02:12:58.970 --> 02:13:00.470
<v Speaker 3>what's happened to me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I am I,</v>

3040
02:13:00.540 --> 02:13:02.500
<v Speaker 3>my life was going to wasting time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3041
02:13:02.501 --> 02:13:02.910
<v Speaker 3>it's heavy.</v>

3042
02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:04.380
<v Speaker 3>You're waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're wasting time.</v>

3043
02:13:04.670 --> 02:13:06.050
<v Speaker 3>You fucking come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

3044
02:13:06.051 --> 02:13:09.430
<v Speaker 3>And he'd go down and shit that you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>consider a waste of time if you don't do</v>

3045
02:13:09.431 --> 02:13:10.264
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone was all in the pool pool and </v>

3046
02:13:11.421 --> 02:13:13.460
<v Speaker 3>he was obsessed with poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would say you're wasting your time.</v>

3047
02:13:13.461 --> 02:13:14.790
<v Speaker 3>What are you getting out of?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I hit those?</v>

3048
02:13:15.530 --> 02:13:16.970
<v Speaker 3>They're real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're real.</v>

3049
02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:18.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hit those balls to go into the whole,</v>

3050
02:13:18.831 --> 02:13:23.270
<v Speaker 3>it takes skill and concentration and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gives me something to occupy my mind.</v>

3051
02:13:23.271 --> 02:13:26.210
<v Speaker 3>It's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mind game and it's a body game.</v>

3052
02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:29.810
<v Speaker 3>When you're watching a fake video the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy made about,</v>

3053
02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 3>you think it's fake nuclear not being </v>
<v Speaker 3>real?</v>

3054
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:34.170
<v Speaker 5>I think it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3055
02:13:35.070 --> 02:13:36.090
<v Speaker 5>That's what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3056
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:37.223
<v Speaker 5>I mean I just feel like all the people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that study it at all the universities </v>

3057
02:13:44.130 --> 02:13:49.130
<v Speaker 5>have come to a conclusion and then one </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy makes a youtube video or 20 guys,</v>

3058
02:13:49.231 --> 02:13:52.570
<v Speaker 5>they're saying a thousand Santos Bonacci</v>
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

3059
02:13:52.740 --> 02:13:55.840
<v Speaker 5>Why would you listen to them versus the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ability to,</v>

3060
02:13:55.841 --> 02:13:56.674
<v Speaker 5>they have free cause generations after </v>
<v Speaker 5>generations of studying the science </v>

3061
02:13:59.821 --> 02:14:01.350
<v Speaker 5>behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The science,</v>

3062
02:14:01.530 --> 02:14:03.720
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of repeatable science.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

3063
02:14:03.721 --> 02:14:04.554
<v Speaker 5>but you just told us about this one test</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you paired it out as some sort of a </v>

3064
02:14:08.041 --> 02:14:11.760
<v Speaker 5>theory that we should look up and when </v>
<v Speaker 5>we did it turns out it didn't even work.</v>

3065
02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:13.770
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't repeated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3066
02:14:14.250 --> 02:14:15.180
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eddie,</v>

3067
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:16.103
<v Speaker 5>I love you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't like the way you approach </v>

3068
02:14:17.941 --> 02:14:18.774
<v Speaker 5>these things sometimes because I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>it confuses the fuck out of people like </v>

3069
02:14:21.330 --> 02:14:24.690
<v Speaker 5>I was when I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was super gullible.</v>

3070
02:14:24.691 --> 02:14:27.390
<v Speaker 5>I believed all kinds of stupid shit and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasted a ton of time.</v>

3071
02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:29.490
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially with successful guys,</v>

3072
02:14:29.491 --> 02:14:32.250
<v Speaker 5>all these certain stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>goddamned Ufo people,</v>

3073
02:14:32.251 --> 02:14:33.020
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all those.</v>

3074
02:14:33.020 --> 02:14:34.560
<v Speaker 5>I'll Ulu ufo stories that bought it.</v>

3075
02:14:35.110 --> 02:14:35.943
<v Speaker 7>I never got any,</v>
<v Speaker 7>have you ever heard of the law of </v>

3076
02:14:36.791 --> 02:14:37.830
<v Speaker 7>perspective?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

3077
02:14:38.010 --> 02:14:41.830
<v Speaker 7>You know that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not a law went about it.</v>

3078
02:14:41.890 --> 02:14:42.723
<v Speaker 7>It's that that's the deaf.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're giving the definition of what </v>

3079
02:14:44.171 --> 02:14:45.004
<v Speaker 7>perspective is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm trying to tell you though real </v>

3080
02:14:47.321 --> 02:14:49.780
<v Speaker 7>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There are laws of conservation of energy</v>

3081
02:14:49.781 --> 02:14:50.614
<v Speaker 7>and such in physics.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There are actual laws that they can be </v>

3082
02:14:52.721 --> 02:14:54.640
<v Speaker 7>translated without even speaking </v>
<v Speaker 7>language.</v>

3083
02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:58.540
<v Speaker 7>It's math.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The law perspective is not one of those.</v>

3084
02:14:59.710 --> 02:15:00.543
<v Speaker 7>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tell me.</v>

3085
02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:03.040
<v Speaker 7>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just the definition of perspective.</v>

3086
02:15:03.041 --> 02:15:05.440
<v Speaker 7>I'm asking you what the law,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is it?</v>

3087
02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:08.750
<v Speaker 7>Cause it's not real well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well maybe,</v>

3088
02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:11.230
<v Speaker 7>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you're saying there's no uh,</v>

3089
02:15:11.470 --> 02:15:12.303
<v Speaker 7>love.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm saying it's not a law as definition </v>

3090
02:15:16.570 --> 02:15:17.403
<v Speaker 7>gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a definition of the word </v>

3091
02:15:18.521 --> 02:15:20.950
<v Speaker 7>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not a law.</v>

3092
02:15:21.610 --> 02:15:23.620
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the law is a perspective.</v>

3093
02:15:23.650 --> 02:15:24.483
<v Speaker 7>Are the Herat one of the laws is the </v>
<v Speaker 7>perspective horizon not real to high </v>

3094
02:15:30.221 --> 02:15:30.530
<v Speaker 7>level.</v>

3095
02:15:30.530 --> 02:15:31.520
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love that.</v>

3096
02:15:31.521 --> 02:15:34.630
<v Speaker 7>That's not how it always happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Always happens.</v>

3097
02:15:34.631 --> 02:15:35.860
<v Speaker 7>Not a law,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it always happens.</v>

3098
02:15:35.861 --> 02:15:36.790
<v Speaker 7>It's a law.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If it happens,</v>

3099
02:15:36.940 --> 02:15:38.710
<v Speaker 7>that's not a law.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

3100
02:15:38.711 --> 02:15:40.930
<v Speaker 7>this is where you don't understand that </v>
<v Speaker 7>part of the laws of science.</v>

3101
02:15:40.931 --> 02:15:44.020
<v Speaker 7>That's not a law.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a definition.</v>

3102
02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:46.930
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then what is the definition?</v>

3103
02:15:46.931 --> 02:15:48.370
<v Speaker 7>Definition of a noun?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a person,</v>

3104
02:15:48.371 --> 02:15:50.260
<v Speaker 7>place thing or idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not a law.</v>

3105
02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:52.240
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's just the definition.</v>

3106
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:54.343
<v Speaker 7>You know what else is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I used to call this double lotus for </v>

3107
02:15:57.881 --> 02:16:00.540
<v Speaker 7>years and years and years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's not double lotus.</v>

3108
02:16:00.550 --> 02:16:01.810
<v Speaker 7>It's full load.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not a lot though.</v>

3109
02:16:01.811 --> 02:16:03.400
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But it's not,</v>

3110
02:16:03.401 --> 02:16:04.840
<v Speaker 7>it's not double load.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not a law.</v>

3111
02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:07.060
<v Speaker 7>It's not double loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what you're saying.</v>

3112
02:16:07.061 --> 02:16:10.540
<v Speaker 7>You're talking about a different word </v>
<v Speaker 7>for the same moodle.</v>

3113
02:16:10.990 --> 02:16:15.990
<v Speaker 7>What he's saying perspective Stephanie </v>
<v Speaker 7>Shot Better because hold on.</v>

3114
02:16:18.460 --> 02:16:20.350
<v Speaker 7>It's the same thing because of whatever </v>
<v Speaker 7>you call it.</v>

3115
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:24.310
<v Speaker 7>You got,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well when you look up this stuff online,</v>

3116
02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:26.890
<v Speaker 7>I try to type in the law of perspective </v>
<v Speaker 7>cause I wanted to see what your,</v>

3117
02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:27.753
<v Speaker 7>what you and Eric Dubay believe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That is the only thing I ever find with </v>

3118
02:16:32.111 --> 02:16:34.360
<v Speaker 7>the law perspective is the word flat </v>
<v Speaker 7>earth with it.</v>

3119
02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:35.853
<v Speaker 7>Or maybe there's actually there are </v>
<v Speaker 7>urban dictionary has a definition for </v>

3120
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:40.103
<v Speaker 7>what does,</v>
<v Speaker 7>doesn't matter if it's law but it's not </v>

3121
02:16:44.150 --> 02:16:49.150
<v Speaker 7>the same manner but that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but if the horizon always rises,</v>

3122
02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:53.500
<v Speaker 7>that's not a [inaudible] uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3123
02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:54.940
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what would you call it then?</v>

3124
02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:55.793
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't believe in gravity though </v>

3125
02:16:57.650 --> 02:16:59.980
<v Speaker 7>thing of perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't believe in gravity either.</v>

3126
02:16:59.981 --> 02:17:02.740
<v Speaker 7>That falls at a constant of 9.8 meters </v>
<v Speaker 7>per second.</v>

3127
02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:04.720
<v Speaker 7>That is a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a law of gravity.</v>

3128
02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:06.850
<v Speaker 7>Gravity is a theory I had.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3129
02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:07.270
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

3130
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:09.100
<v Speaker 7>You guys have this theory of what </v>
<v Speaker 7>gravity is.</v>

3131
02:17:09.310 --> 02:17:11.590
<v Speaker 7>Density,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's another scientific word.</v>

3132
02:17:11.770 --> 02:17:13.900
<v Speaker 7>You guys said that if it's more dense it</v>
<v Speaker 7>falls,</v>

3133
02:17:13.901 --> 02:17:16.000
<v Speaker 7>but why does it fall?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why was it fall lower?</v>

3134
02:17:16.001 --> 02:17:18.820
<v Speaker 7>If it's heavier,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then why is it heavier?</v>

3135
02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:22.710
<v Speaker 7>Do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cause it's 10 [inaudible] shortfalls.</v>

3136
02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:26.410
<v Speaker 7>A helium gas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Helium was a gas.</v>

3137
02:17:26.411 --> 02:17:31.240
<v Speaker 7>We're only heavy then it's because of </v>
<v Speaker 7>where it's lighter.</v>

3138
02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:32.980
<v Speaker 7>It's less dense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll explain.</v>

3139
02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:35.500
<v Speaker 7>It's lighter because we're in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>atmosphere of earth.</v>

3140
02:17:35.501 --> 02:17:37.510
<v Speaker 7>Isn't it less dense than if we were in </v>
<v Speaker 7>space?</v>

3141
02:17:37.540 --> 02:17:40.180
<v Speaker 7>There is no atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why everything floats.</v>

3142
02:17:40.210 --> 02:17:41.043
<v Speaker 7>Gases and us were dense too,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we would float in space just like </v>

3143
02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:46.540
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We got in the space.</v>

3144
02:17:46.541 --> 02:17:47.800
<v Speaker 7>You're correct.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If we got out there,</v>

3145
02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:51.280
<v Speaker 7>so can we not go to space?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how far we can go up</v>

3146
02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:52.793
<v Speaker 5>the space station.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You said the space shuttle went into </v>

3147
02:17:54.271 --> 02:17:55.104
<v Speaker 5>orbit.</v>

3148
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:58.400
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how far I want to say hi.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know where it went,</v>

3149
02:17:58.401 --> 02:18:02.270
<v Speaker 7>but I know it took off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Saw that and then I see it landing.</v>

3150
02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:04.300
<v Speaker 7>You see that more?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I went,</v>

3151
02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:06.020
<v Speaker 7>you know when we heard the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3152
02:18:06.710 --> 02:18:07.543
<v Speaker 7>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are you not confused on what laws and </v>

3153
02:18:08.781 --> 02:18:10.460
<v Speaker 7>stuff science are though?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you not see that?</v>

3154
02:18:10.490 --> 02:18:11.720
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We'll call it definition,</v>

3155
02:18:11.721 --> 02:18:13.220
<v Speaker 7>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what do we call it?</v>

3156
02:18:13.430 --> 02:18:14.540
<v Speaker 7>But that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what do they call it?</v>

3157
02:18:14.541 --> 02:18:15.720
<v Speaker 7>We'll call it whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In science,</v>

3158
02:18:15.721 --> 02:18:16.554
<v Speaker 7>we call things laws.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We don't call them definitions and </v>

3159
02:18:18.231 --> 02:18:20.150
<v Speaker 7>science.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There are laws because?</v>

3160
02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:22.310
<v Speaker 7>Because so what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that law,</v>

3161
02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:27.460
<v Speaker 7>which is most of them called in those </v>
<v Speaker 7>cases if hold on to,</v>

3162
02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:31.550
<v Speaker 7>in most cases it's math,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the law so that that math,</v>

3163
02:18:31.551 --> 02:18:36.380
<v Speaker 7>then that formulaic equation can go to </v>
<v Speaker 7>any country and work.</v>

3164
02:18:36.590 --> 02:18:38.630
<v Speaker 7>I don't need to speak English to the guy</v>
<v Speaker 7>in Germany.</v>

3165
02:18:38.631 --> 02:18:40.760
<v Speaker 7>That to explain to them what I'm trying </v>
<v Speaker 7>to get out of it,</v>

3166
02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:42.133
<v Speaker 7>he can test it with the same things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the same variables and get the same </v>

3167
02:18:44.391 --> 02:18:47.330
<v Speaker 7>thing out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why all these things are laws,</v>

3168
02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:51.390
<v Speaker 7>not definitely Cleveland.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Thank you for clearing that up permit.</v>

3169
02:18:51.500 --> 02:18:53.270
<v Speaker 7>Does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you accept that or no?</v>

3170
02:18:54.550 --> 02:18:54.820
<v Speaker 7>People</v>

3171
02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:55.653
<v Speaker 5>use as verbose terminology because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>makes him appear smarter than they </v>

3172
02:18:58.421 --> 02:19:00.850
<v Speaker 5>really are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No Eddie,</v>

3173
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:01.743
<v Speaker 5>and they tried to say it in a fancier </v>
<v Speaker 5>way because they really didn't go to </v>

3174
02:19:04.091 --> 02:19:04.924
<v Speaker 5>school for this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they say a bunch of shit that's not </v>

3175
02:19:06.521 --> 02:19:08.890
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the law of perspective and it's not</v>

3176
02:19:08.891 --> 02:19:09.724
<v Speaker 5>a law and it belies the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have an education in this </v>

3177
02:19:12.311 --> 02:19:14.020
<v Speaker 5>stuff and they're just talking out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their ass.</v>

3178
02:19:14.270 --> 02:19:18.580
<v Speaker 5>That's disrespectful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>disrespectful to the fucking generations</v>

3179

<v Speaker 5>That one guy can figure out all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>different things that dinosaurs aren't </v>

<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

3183
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:30.770
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking earth.</v>

3189
02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:45.260
<v Speaker 1>He figured it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had him on my podcast.</v>

3190
02:19:45.490 --> 02:19:47.240
<v Speaker 1>That's too much money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes often flat earth.</v>

3191
02:19:47.241 --> 02:19:48.074
<v Speaker 1>I'd be interested to know that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing a lot of books off in a lot of </v>

3192
02:19:50.121 --> 02:19:51.010
<v Speaker 1>youtube videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know,</v>

3193
02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:54.950
<v Speaker 1>isn't everybody making money as a NASA </v>
<v Speaker 1>making billions and well,</v>

3194
02:19:54.951 --> 02:19:55.784
<v Speaker 1>he's got a youtube account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA lied six times about the moon </v>

3195
02:20:01.251 --> 02:20:03.760
<v Speaker 1>missions and cat don't believe he kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling back from them.</v>

3196
02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:05.390
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the root of it all,</v>

3197
02:20:05.391 --> 02:20:07.730
<v Speaker 1>so don't be mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you should understand that.</v>

3198
02:20:07.731 --> 02:20:08.890
<v Speaker 1>That's one of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3199
02:20:09.580 --> 02:20:10.413
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most preposterous idea available </v>

3200
02:20:12.741 --> 02:20:16.670
<v Speaker 1>that every photo of the earth is fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no photos,</v>

3201
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:20.690
<v Speaker 1>there's no photos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no photos of the composite,</v>

3202
02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:21.560
<v Speaker 1>a special video.</v>

3203
02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:22.393
<v Speaker 1>If they don't find a problem that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no photos of the earth being </v>

3204
02:20:24.261 --> 02:20:25.340
<v Speaker 1>flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one.</v>

3205
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:26.970
<v Speaker 1>There's no photos of the earth being </v>
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

3206
02:20:27.350 --> 02:20:30.200
<v Speaker 1>There's planning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no photos.</v>

3207
02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:32.300
<v Speaker 1>NASA will tell you that about CGI </v>
<v Speaker 1>artist.</v>

3208
02:20:32.301 --> 02:20:33.160
<v Speaker 1>How can we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we think?</v>

3209
02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:34.850
<v Speaker 1>We can't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't get anywhere else.</v>

3210
02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:35.693
<v Speaker 1>It can even get a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that has a meeting </v>

3211
02:20:37.380 --> 02:20:40.060
<v Speaker 1>every week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to the artist was never proved.</v>

3212
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:41.810
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to that for me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>

3213
02:20:41.970 --> 02:20:45.860
<v Speaker 1>they didn't see anything in there about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the CGI that that article,</v>

3214
02:20:46.100 --> 02:20:48.550
<v Speaker 1>he puts together data and make photos </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3215
02:20:48.620 --> 02:20:49.453
<v Speaker 1>He puts together data because it has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be interpreted because you're talking </v>

3216
02:20:51.171 --> 02:20:52.004
<v Speaker 1>about 1.7 terabytes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Treg the video of him talking about the </v>

3217
02:20:55.011 --> 02:20:58.030
<v Speaker 1>video you told me to try it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the wrong one.</v>

3218
02:20:59.170 --> 02:21:00.003
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible bunch where he's talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>terabytes like a thousand gigabytes </v>

3219
02:21:02.820 --> 02:21:03.710
<v Speaker 1>isn't word for word.</v>

3220
02:21:03.710 --> 02:21:04.610
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3221
02:21:04.670 --> 02:21:06.000
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's photoshopped it.</v>

3222
02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:07.820
<v Speaker 1>It's photoshop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be.</v>

3223
02:21:07.850 --> 02:21:08.683
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3224
02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:13.820
<v Speaker 1>that's a no shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say it in that article.</v>

3225
02:21:14.090 --> 02:21:15.770
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did said come out of his mouth.</v>

3226
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:16.740
<v Speaker 1>He's got to find that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3227
02:21:16.770 --> 02:21:17.890
<v Speaker 1>but when you're talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3228
02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:20.750
<v Speaker 1>photoshop doesn't mean that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>distorting the image.</v>

3229
02:21:20.751 --> 02:21:23.860
<v Speaker 1>It also can mean to the connecting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of different images to make it,</v>

3230
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:25.423
<v Speaker 1>but when you watch him talking about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>we put together the official picture of </v>

3231
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.823
<v Speaker 1>earth from space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about cartoon animation </v>

3232
02:21:33.261 --> 02:21:36.050
<v Speaker 1>type Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about his own imagination.</v>

3233
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.903
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe because he's talking about this </v>

3234
02:21:38.241 --> 02:21:40.820
<v Speaker 1>insane amount of data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1.7 terabytes,</v>

3235
02:21:40.970 --> 02:21:41.803
<v Speaker 1>maybe we don't understand how the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets interpreted into an image in </v>

3236
02:21:44.361 --> 02:21:46.910
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if it's possible to do</v>

3237
02:21:46.911 --> 02:21:47.744
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know like to have an in perspective </v>

3238
02:21:49.700 --> 02:21:50.533
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at it like a 12 inch</v>
<v Speaker 1>screen or 24 inch screen where the fuck </v>

3239
02:21:52.611 --> 02:21:53.444
<v Speaker 1>your monitor would be and you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take this 1.7 terabyte image and </v>

3240
02:21:56.691 --> 02:21:58.130
<v Speaker 1>shrink it down so it fits in there.</v>

3241
02:21:58.550 --> 02:22:00.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that messed with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3242
02:22:01.070 --> 02:22:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That finished product is it admitted?</v>

3243
02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:05.540
<v Speaker 1>CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CGI composite.</v>

3244
02:22:05.541 --> 02:22:06.374
<v Speaker 1>It's admitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even the Japanese got real </v>

3245
02:22:09.711 --> 02:22:10.850
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>

3247
02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA does have one.</v>

3248
02:22:15.201 --> 02:22:16.034
<v Speaker 1>That's what the problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep saying they don't from 1972 </v>

3249
02:22:18.510 --> 02:22:19.343
<v Speaker 1>saying the only real one that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>from [inaudible] 72 I just pulled up is </v>

3250
02:22:21.891 --> 02:22:22.724
<v Speaker 1>up right now that there's pictures from </v>
<v Speaker 1>today that discover when you said that </v>

3251
02:22:24.830 --> 02:22:27.110
<v Speaker 1>that on some pictures I'd delete it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of that.</v>

3252
02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3254
02:22:34.111 --> 02:22:35.790
<v Speaker 1>space shuttle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't believe in anything else?</v>

3255
02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:36.653
<v Speaker 1>That's where it ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So leaving shadow goes up and flies </v>

3256
02:22:40.261 --> 02:22:42.570
<v Speaker 1>around direct TV on when it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs.</v>

3257
02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:44.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it goes.</v>

3260
02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:54.473
<v Speaker 1>fake ones off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have evidence that you would </v>

3261
02:22:55.171 --> 02:22:56.004
<v Speaker 1>accept as real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks just like the ones that were </v>

3262
02:22:58.411 --> 02:23:00.750
<v Speaker 1>admitted that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that let's try to thoughts.</v>

3263
02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:04.470
<v Speaker 1>They look exactly like the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were admitted.</v>

3264
02:23:04.471 --> 02:23:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Fakes where you accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We one's real.</v>

02:23:19.420 --> 02:23:21.480
<v Speaker 1>me that one I got that looks like all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the CGI ones,</v>

3268
02:23:21.481 --> 02:23:23.850
<v Speaker 1>like say I don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's try to stick this lens.</v>

3269
02:23:26.570 --> 02:23:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Tams is a motherfucker of a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worry about Yeti.</v>

3270
02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:32.370
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to,</v>

3271
02:23:32.371 --> 02:23:34.580
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking group better than average.</v>

3272
02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:35.513
<v Speaker 1>You're doing great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I worry about you going down these </v>

3273
02:23:37.111 --> 02:23:39.930
<v Speaker 1>rabbit holes and strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the big deal?</v>

3274
02:23:39.931 --> 02:23:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Who cares if the earth is round or flat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entertaining to me.</v>

3275
02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the big deal?</v>

3276
02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If kids started looking into flat earth,</v>

3277
02:23:47.850 --> 02:23:50.460
<v Speaker 1>good start questioning shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look into it and you,</v>

3278
02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:52.530
<v Speaker 1>and you have proof that it is around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of going,</v>

3279
02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:53.970
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some scientists figured it out,</v>

3280
02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:55.770
<v Speaker 1>somebody figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody figured out.</v>

3281
02:23:55.771 --> 02:23:58.350
<v Speaker 1>But you figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try to figure it out.</v>

3282
02:23:58.500 --> 02:24:01.020
<v Speaker 1>You know the one thing that all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that we don't need scientists to</v>

3283
02:24:01.021 --> 02:24:02.190
<v Speaker 1>figure out as we know a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3284
02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:04.350
<v Speaker 1>A compass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a compass points to north.</v>

3285
02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:06.270
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need a battery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this,</v>

3286
02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:07.290
<v Speaker 1>you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3287
02:24:07.291 --> 02:24:07.770
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

3288
02:24:07.770 --> 02:24:09.090
<v Speaker 1>let me explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all we know.</v>

3289
02:24:09.170 --> 02:24:12.080
<v Speaker 1>This is all we know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pointing to the north.</v>

3290
02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:12.810
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3291
02:24:12.810 --> 02:24:16.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a magnetic force in the north.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all we know that for sure.</v>

3292
02:24:16.980 --> 02:24:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't need a scientist to confirm </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3293
02:24:19.230 --> 02:24:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I know that there's a force in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>north,</v>

3294
02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:23.910
<v Speaker 1>some kind of magnetic force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else do,</v>

3295
02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:28.350
<v Speaker 1>what else don't I need a government </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist confirmation from uh,</v>

3296
02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:30.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the north star.</v>

3297
02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:31.620
<v Speaker 1>It's right over the north end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You finish.</v>

3298
02:24:31.621 --> 02:24:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Let me finish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me just finish.</v>

3299
02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Let me just finish the North Pole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The North Star,</v>

3300
02:24:35.311 --> 02:24:36.144
<v Speaker 1>Polaris is directly coincidentally over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the North Pole where all the campuses </v>

3301
02:24:40.921 --> 02:24:41.610
<v Speaker 1>are pointing.</v>

3302
02:24:41.610 --> 02:24:44.070
<v Speaker 1>All the company companies are pointing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the North Pole.</v>

3303
02:24:44.220 --> 02:24:48.420
<v Speaker 1>There's this magnetic force in the North</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pole and coincidence polaris.</v>

3304
02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:49.493
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying the polaris is directly </v>

3305
02:24:50.401 --> 02:24:51.234
<v Speaker 1>over the North Pole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been multiple north stars is </v>

3306
02:24:54.541 --> 02:24:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Polaris directly above the North Pole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that there's been more than one</v>

3307
02:24:57.631 --> 02:25:00.570
<v Speaker 1>northstar over the history of where'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get that information from?</v>

3308
02:25:00.690 --> 02:25:02.340
<v Speaker 1>From the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3309
02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:04.380
<v Speaker 1>So you don't believe that any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3310
02:25:05.010 --> 02:25:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's Polaris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the North Star Polaris because Polaris,</v>

3311
02:25:07.981 --> 02:25:09.540
<v Speaker 1>the Northstar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me read this please.</v>

3312
02:25:09.541 --> 02:25:10.374
<v Speaker 1>Cause it'll explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now earth's rotation access </v>

3313
02:25:12.031 --> 02:25:14.700
<v Speaker 1>happens to be pointing almost exactly a </v>
<v Speaker 1>polaris,</v>

3314
02:25:14.701 --> 02:25:18.420
<v Speaker 1>but in the year 3000 BC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the North Star was a star called through</v>

3315
02:25:18.421 --> 02:25:21.060
<v Speaker 1>ban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as Alpha draconian,</v>

3316
02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:24.190
<v Speaker 1>and in about 13 years from now,</v>

3317
02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:25.053
<v Speaker 5>the procession of the rotation axis will</v>
<v Speaker 5>mean that the bright star Vega will be </v>

3318
02:25:28.931 --> 02:25:29.764
<v Speaker 5>the north star.</v>

3319
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:33.110
<v Speaker 1>That's according to NASA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's according to every scientist that</v>

3320
02:25:33.111 --> 02:25:34.880
<v Speaker 1>studies at Eddie from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that?</v>

3321
02:25:35.150 --> 02:25:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Because that's why it's still a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know arena?</v>

3322
02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:39.830
<v Speaker 1>How do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just said,</v>

3323
02:25:39.850 --> 02:25:42.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know list.</v>

3324
02:25:42.311 --> 02:25:44.060
<v Speaker 1>There's no dispute about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

3325
02:25:44.090 --> 02:25:46.610
<v Speaker 1>I bet he jamie could pull up 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>different fucking things.</v>

3326
02:25:46.611 --> 02:25:48.230
<v Speaker 1>It'll show you the same thing on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

3327
02:25:48.530 --> 02:25:51.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just on the Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay if you get hit the internet,</v>

3328
02:25:51.711 --> 02:25:54.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's not okay if I get information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

3329
02:25:54.981 --> 02:25:58.040
<v Speaker 1>It's if you get your information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no information on both sides,</v>

3330
02:25:58.410 --> 02:26:01.360
<v Speaker 1>but you don't think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now when I look at it,</v>

3331
02:26:01.410 --> 02:26:04.130
<v Speaker 1>northstar changes over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of what does that Michigan,</v>

3332
02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:07.060
<v Speaker 1>does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any,</v>

3333
02:26:07.130 --> 02:26:08.840
<v Speaker 1>that's not science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does that not make sense?</v>

3334
02:26:08.890 --> 02:26:09.723
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said it doesn't make sense that the </v>

3335
02:26:10.521 --> 02:26:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Internet only works for you and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar what works when you,</v>

3336
02:26:13.060 --> 02:26:13.893
<v Speaker 1>when you keep looking at it over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over again from all these </v>

3337
02:26:15.981 --> 02:26:20.210
<v Speaker 1>multiple sources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you just assume you didn't say,</v>

3338
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you said over and over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you did.</v>

3339
02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Why you playing games?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like you're playing tic TAC toe.</v>

3340
02:26:25.251 --> 02:26:27.980
<v Speaker 1>You're not looking at the truth of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound like a little Jiu Jitsu.</v>

3341
02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:32.230
<v Speaker 1>If you want to believe Nasa App,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all assets,</v>

3342
02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:33.830
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>

3343
02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:34.693
<v Speaker 1>Why is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you telling me then why does </v>

3344
02:26:36.261 --> 02:26:38.870
<v Speaker 1>that compass point towards the north?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3345
02:26:38.930 --> 02:26:39.763
<v Speaker 1>We know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know there's a magnetic force north </v>

3346
02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:47.690
<v Speaker 1>in the mag in the North Pole and we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>the polaris is right over the north pole</v>

3347
02:26:47.930 --> 02:26:51.560
<v Speaker 1>and the constellations rotate around </v>
<v Speaker 1>Polaris.</v>

3348
02:26:51.561 --> 02:26:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Polaris is a fixed star and they all </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote the constellations,</v>

3349
02:26:54.681 --> 02:26:58.760
<v Speaker 1>rotate around that and it's right over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the north pole spent.</v>

3350
02:26:59.190 --> 02:27:00.023
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on striking how much time you've </v>

3351
02:27:01.581 --> 02:27:06.290
<v Speaker 1>actually spent explaining what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did I say wrong?</v>

3352
02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:07.753
<v Speaker 1>You and Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they repeat that over and over again </v>

3353
02:27:08.931 --> 02:27:10.440
<v Speaker 1>like the sky doesn't change at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3354
02:27:10.441 --> 02:27:11.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what I said.</v>

3355
02:27:11.511 --> 02:27:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3356
02:27:13.010 --> 02:27:13.843
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said the stars don't star Polaris </v>

3357
02:27:16.370 --> 02:27:17.203
<v Speaker 1>Star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay ahead of the norm over the North </v>

3358
02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:19.273
<v Speaker 1>Pole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no,</v>

3359
02:27:19.610 --> 02:27:22.010
<v Speaker 1>and do the constellations rotate around </v>
<v Speaker 1>Polaris?</v>

3360
02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes sir.</v>

3361
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:24.200
<v Speaker 1>License don't rotate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3362
02:27:24.390 --> 02:27:25.280
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started around.</v>

3363
02:27:25.281 --> 02:27:27.980
<v Speaker 1>When you look at time lapse photography </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Polaris,</v>

3364
02:27:28.190 --> 02:27:30.940
<v Speaker 1>you could you go watch time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the constellations gone.</v>

3365
02:27:31.010 --> 02:27:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Polaris is the fixer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they didn't go.</v>

3366
02:27:32.991 --> 02:27:33.824
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could find your way around and just </v>

3367
02:27:34.371 --> 02:27:35.720
<v Speaker 1>find the north star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't move.</v>

3368
02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:37.333
<v Speaker 1>Explain that</v>

3369
02:27:38.530 --> 02:27:40.930
<v Speaker 5>and if the Earth is spinning like we </v>
<v Speaker 5>know it is,</v>

3370
02:27:41.590 --> 02:27:42.423
<v Speaker 5>what's directly above the earth would </v>
<v Speaker 5>stay the same because the earth is </v>

3371
02:27:45.251 --> 02:27:46.084
<v Speaker 5>spinning faster than spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>furthest spinning a thousand miles an </v>

3372
02:27:48.521 --> 02:27:49.354
<v Speaker 5>hour in a circle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though the cosmos suspending the </v>

3373
02:27:50.951 --> 02:27:54.220
<v Speaker 5>cosmos changes as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of things that change</v>

3374
02:27:54.850 --> 02:27:56.340
<v Speaker 1>and the sky looks different all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3375
02:27:56.350 --> 02:27:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Change over the North Pole,</v>

3376
02:27:58.180 --> 02:27:59.013
<v Speaker 5>but if you were spinning and you talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about a small window of time when </v>

3377
02:28:02.111 --> 02:28:04.270
<v Speaker 5>they're taking these time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>life time lapse photographs,</v>

3378
02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:06.220
<v Speaker 5>her take him over a few hours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3379
02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:07.093
<v Speaker 5>Becky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you understand that that if you </v>

3380
02:28:08.281 --> 02:28:09.114
<v Speaker 5>are looking up over a few hours and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have one light that's directly overhead </v>

3381
02:28:12.101 --> 02:28:12.934
<v Speaker 5>and the other ones are circulate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one light that's directly overhead </v>

3382
02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:17.500
<v Speaker 5>over a few hours is not going to move </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough to register in the photograph,</v>

3383
02:28:17.710 --> 02:28:20.710
<v Speaker 5>but the ones on the sides are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're looking at a timelapse,</v>

3384
02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:22.130
<v Speaker 5>you're at a time lapse over</v>

3385
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:22.963
<v Speaker 1>a few hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are looking at a time lapse over </v>

3386
02:28:24.651 --> 02:28:25.484
<v Speaker 1>months or years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would see that thing spinning to </v>

3387
02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Polaris would still be on the same spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3388
02:28:30.321 --> 02:28:31.880
<v Speaker 1>You'd have the procession of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equinoxes.</v>

3389
02:28:31.881 --> 02:28:33.980
<v Speaker 1>It changes the rotation of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth Act.</v>

3390
02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:38.450
<v Speaker 1>It wobbles on its axis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been tracking that forever.</v>

3391
02:28:38.470 --> 02:28:40.100
<v Speaker 1>You got to watch time lapse photography </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your,</v>

3392
02:28:40.130 --> 02:28:40.963
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know you're not listening to one </v>

3393
02:28:42.411 --> 02:28:47.180
<v Speaker 1>time lapse photography is over a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours and and over a few hours.</v>

3394
02:28:47.181 --> 02:28:52.100
<v Speaker 1>You can see the earth causing a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour and constellation circling</v>

3395
02:28:52.101 --> 02:28:53.450
<v Speaker 1>around Polaris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one motion,</v>

3396
02:28:53.451 --> 02:28:53.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3397
02:28:53.970 --> 02:28:54.803
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you capture one motion and that time </v>

3398
02:28:56.751 --> 02:28:57.584
<v Speaker 1>lapse photography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but science is telling us that there's </v>

3399
02:28:59.481 --> 02:29:01.520
<v Speaker 1>four motions going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

3400
02:29:01.521 --> 02:29:02.354
<v Speaker 1>they're just much slower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about something that </v>

3401
02:29:04.611 --> 02:29:05.990
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very quick.</v>

3402
02:29:05.991 --> 02:29:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Over a very short amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>year after year,</v>

3403
02:29:08.481 --> 02:29:09.480
<v Speaker 1>decade to decade.</v>

3404
02:29:09.550 --> 02:29:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Polar look on the same spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3405
02:29:11.110 --> 02:29:12.830
<v Speaker 1>None of these stars are staying in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same spot.</v>

3406
02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:16.210
<v Speaker 1>You've got to find one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a polaris specific one.</v>

3407
02:29:16.270 --> 02:29:21.270
<v Speaker 1>They find prolaris which cause that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only one that isn't and everything's</v>

3408
02:29:22.131 --> 02:29:23.300
<v Speaker 1>going around Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

3409
02:29:23.301 --> 02:29:24.134
<v Speaker 1>what are you looking at right there when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that that time lapse photo at </v>

3410
02:29:26.231 --> 02:29:30.260
<v Speaker 1>the SBAC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit spinning the earth and the sky is,</v>

3411
02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:32.960
<v Speaker 1>is the sky spinning or as the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>

3412
02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:35.870
<v Speaker 1>I think the sky spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

3413
02:29:36.650 --> 02:29:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Why would people be lying about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3414
02:29:38.750 --> 02:29:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the light's about Polaris.</v>

3415
02:29:42.770 --> 02:29:43.431
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

3416
02:29:43.431 --> 02:29:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Because it's in the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ready?</v>

3417
02:29:44.600 --> 02:29:45.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3418
02:29:45.351 --> 02:29:47.810
<v Speaker 1>There's always that no 32nd picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3419
02:29:47.811 --> 02:29:48.644
<v Speaker 1>You talking about something that happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>very often as other constellations are </v>

3420
02:29:50.511 --> 02:29:51.860
<v Speaker 1>moving really quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eddie,</v>

3421
02:29:52.100 --> 02:29:54.500
<v Speaker 1>if it's the ones directly overhead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3422
02:29:54.830 --> 02:29:57.470
<v Speaker 1>If you have a ball and you spin it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your finger like Michael Jordan,</v>

3423
02:29:57.980 --> 02:29:58.813
<v Speaker 1>the outside equator of the ball is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to spin like fucking crazy in this big </v>

3424
02:30:02.601 --> 02:30:05.750
<v Speaker 1>long wide loop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the tip of the ball is going to spin</v>

3425
02:30:05.751 --> 02:30:07.160
<v Speaker 1>in a very short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tight circle.</v>

3426
02:30:07.270 --> 02:30:08.103
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3427
02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:09.680
<v Speaker 1>When you see the Harlem Globe trotters,</v>

3428
02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:13.220
<v Speaker 7>you can test it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eddie,</v>

3429
02:30:13.221 --> 02:30:14.054
<v Speaker 7>if you just point a camera in the same </v>
<v Speaker 7>spot out of your window for like three </v>

3430
02:30:16.401 --> 02:30:17.690
<v Speaker 7>months straight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>take a photo,</v>

3431
02:30:17.780 --> 02:30:18.613
<v Speaker 7>maybe even four or five tests.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm talking to you [inaudible] we just </v>

3432
02:30:20.740 --> 02:30:23.170
<v Speaker 7>want to give you an example to test it </v>
<v Speaker 7>for yourself to show you that the,</v>

3433
02:30:23.350 --> 02:30:24.183
<v Speaker 7>the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the stars in the sky that you'll see </v>

3434
02:30:25.221 --> 02:30:26.054
<v Speaker 7>above your head like you've claimed to </v>
<v Speaker 7>go out and look out every night will be </v>

3435
02:30:28.491 --> 02:30:29.810
<v Speaker 7>different throughout the year.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3436
02:30:29.860 --> 02:30:30.250
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3437
02:30:30.250 --> 02:30:31.970
<v Speaker 1>they will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't be different.</v>

3438
02:30:32.060 --> 02:30:33.620
<v Speaker 1>They're moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are rotating,</v>

3439
02:30:33.650 --> 02:30:38.100
<v Speaker 1>the are rotating around Polaris and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be in the same spot moving.</v>

3440
02:30:38.930 --> 02:30:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are moving,</v>

3441
02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:41.983
<v Speaker 1>but you're always going to see polaris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you think that this is a </v>

3442
02:30:43.761 --> 02:30:44.594
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they lie about the earth </v>

3443
02:30:46.441 --> 02:30:48.580
<v Speaker 1>spinning when it's really the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe spinning,</v>
