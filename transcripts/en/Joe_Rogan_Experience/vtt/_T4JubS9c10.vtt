1
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Did you see this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're back.</v>

2
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Trump's latest conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:12.354
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's saying that there's a New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York Times piece that contains a</v>

5
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>paragraph saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump suggested that the access</v>

6
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>hollywood tape wasn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's like saying that never existed.</v>

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

9
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I think those are the two microphones on</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

10
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>So I was up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the TV was on.</v>

11
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

12
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he said like in passing to</v>

13
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how do we even know?</v>

14
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>That's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

15
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how tired he must be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so tired.</v>

00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Just listen.</v>

17
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just doing normal stuff.</v>

18
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Doing podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dual comedy shows,</v>

19
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a girlfriend,</v>

20
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tiring.</v>

21
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Imagine being 70 and being the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>president and being in a position where</v>

22
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did I do this?</v>

23
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Why did I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got,</v>

24
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

25
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe let's just give him the benefit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doubt.</v>

26
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you went into this job with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best of intentions,</v>

27
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>but it was just overwhelmed by conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every step of the way.</v>

28
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>He's tested in a way that his character</v>
<v Speaker 1>was never tested before and all these</v>

29
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>people are mad at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just hell,</v>

30
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>hell on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 so tired and he's getting the worst</v>

31
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>comments ever have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did like this tired.</v>

32
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an article that was written,</v>

33
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>not married men not meaning in any way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to disparage the great president of</v>

34
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>ours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a article that was</v>

35
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:34.360
<v Speaker 1>written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>a while back that were this guy found</v>
<v Speaker 1>out that trump had some sort of a</v>

37
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>prescription for an fentimans like way</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the day,</v>

38
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that word's a dirty word,</v>

39
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>but let's just break down what that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

40
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a series and a class of drugs</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a stimulant and there's a lot of</v>

41
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>people that use stimulants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including me.</v>

42
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I love coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drink these caveman Nitros for a lot</v>

43
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This might as well be a drug,</v>

44
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>just 270 milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This little can,</v>

45
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>270 milligrams of caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a hypocrite.</v>

46
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I try not to be at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just being honest.</v>

47
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing wrong with stimulants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy coffee,</v>

48
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>but that's the only one that I fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than that new vigil.</v>

49
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 1>I've tried that stuff a few times and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>will try it.</v>

50
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Like say if I have to drive home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if driving home from San Francisco,</v>

51
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like 10 o'clock at night and know</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get home until three in</v>

52
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 1>the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four in the morning,</v>

53
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I will take one of those cause it'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep you from falling asleep.</v>

54
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's made for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

55
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently what I've read was that it,</v>

56
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.840
<v Speaker 1>that's what they prescribe it for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would,</v>

57
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>it's made for the guy and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally called pro vigil.</v>

58
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's two different ones,</v>

59
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretty much the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>But one of them's a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think new vigils.</v>

61
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>A new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

62
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think what they did is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was probably some sort of a,</v>

63
00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of maybe maybe it's an improvement</v>

64
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it was some sort of a copyright</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing or a trademark thing.</v>

65
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to ask Jamie that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google a bunch of shit.</v>

66
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>What did we start with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start with the trump,</v>

67
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.850

<v Speaker 1>amphetamine thing.</v>

68
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.220

<v Speaker 1>that's what adderall is folks.</v>

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.250
<v Speaker 2>like in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:05:22.251 --> 00:05:24.680
<v Speaker 2>like if you tried to do coke on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

119
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.900
<v Speaker 2>before you do comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your timing's off.</v>

120
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start like you're just going through</v>

121
00:05:29.031 --> 00:05:32.000
<v Speaker 2>your shit super fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I felt like.</v>

122
00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:33.470
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never doing that again.</v>

123
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.920
<v Speaker 2>And then I had it one more time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like years later,</v>

124
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was doing something,</v>

125
00:05:38.481 --> 00:05:40.430
<v Speaker 2>I had to stay awake and I just felt</v>
<v Speaker 2>jittery.</v>

126
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like it compared to like</v>

127
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.350
<v Speaker 2>nuvigil where you didn't have like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>jitters or the,</v>

128
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.880
<v Speaker 2>the adderall type feeling</v>

129
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>nuvigil doesn't give you any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

130
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just on.</v>

131
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't,</v>

133
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

134
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.650
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel like it stimulates you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it just doesn't,</v>

135
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>that keeps you out of level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't take any heart.</v>

136
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Jesus sounds like a new vigil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Add this,</v>

137
00:06:01.351 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit is.</v>

138
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>So this is the thing about new vigil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with Tim Ferris</v>

139
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Tim Ferriss didn't put that in</v>

140
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>one of his biohacking books specifically</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he felt like if he did,</v>

141
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 1>people would eat it like candy and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>went holy Shit.</v>

142
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Like when on a guy like Tim Ferriss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely influential guy that spends a</v>

143
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:28.031
<v Speaker 1>lot of time doing like biohacking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement shit like he does for that</v>

144
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>guy to say he didn't want to write about</v>
<v Speaker 1>new vigil or pro vigil at a book because</v>

145
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want people eating it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>candy.</v>

146
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Like Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to him.</v>

147
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that he said that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought was very important,</v>

148
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>he said there's no biological free</v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch.</v>

149
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 1>So there's gotta be some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>repercussions for taking that.</v>

150
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 1>And maybe we won't know for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

151
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something's happening,</v>

152
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing something.</v>

153
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 1>If it gets you fired up now it's not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural thing.</v>

154
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like you're taking vitamins</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those vitamins like b 12 or</v>

155
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>something like that stimulates you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you energy.</v>

156
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:03.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

157
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:07.030
<v Speaker 1>so is it bad that it's not that is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad or cat?</v>

158
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>How much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many chemicals are bad and how many</v>

159
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>chemicals are okay and how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

160
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.290
<v Speaker 2>look at sugar man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>W we we are now learning a sugar is like</v>

161
00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:19.020
<v Speaker 2>the worst thing in the whole entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>world because of the sugar industry.</v>

162
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.340
<v Speaker 2>And back in the day was like sell this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell this fats bad,</v>

163
00:07:23.341 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and him and now we know that sugar is</v>

164
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest things for heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease and all that crap and the,</v>

165
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.010
<v Speaker 2>they're weasels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you pull up?</v>

166
00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:34.300
<v Speaker 2>The comparison chart on new vaginal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>provigil.</v>

167
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.860
<v Speaker 2>They're almost the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is modafinil and the other one is</v>

168
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.220
<v Speaker 2>our modafinil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they have some sort of a here.</v>

169
00:07:41.221 --> 00:07:43.200
<v Speaker 2>The mechanism of action is slightly</v>
<v Speaker 2>different on them.</v>

170
00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:44.820
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>

171
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Is One an improvement of the other eye</v>

172
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 2>can't really looks at new bridges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has slightly different functions to</v>

173
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.001
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

174
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 2>It's something about electronic couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

175
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

177
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.480
<v Speaker 1>they'll listen to what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This stuff is,</v>

178
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>it may activate orexin peptides via</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulation of Orexin receptors.</v>

179
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh x one and x two and may also</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>

180
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Ready for this one glue to glue to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metta.</v>

181
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.020

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Is that I say it and it sounds right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glutamatergic concentrations decrease ga</v>

184
00:08:30.221 --> 00:08:34.500
<v Speaker 1>be allergic activation and increase</v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic coupling.</v>

185
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I who knows what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well she,</v>

187
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.150

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

188
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.630
<v Speaker 1>And then she to like lay it out and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would listen to it afterwards.</v>

189

191
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.720
<v Speaker 1>a a stupid monkey person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like stupid monkey of question for</v>

192
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:56.190

194
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 3>What is electronic coupling that we've</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to get to the bottom of that cause</v>

195
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 3>that's electronic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem.</v>

196
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 3>How do we have something electronic in</v>
<v Speaker 3>us?</v>

197
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.250
<v Speaker 3>How was like a thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to worry about what you're</v>

198
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 3>trying to stay awake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it the fuck?</v>

199
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 3>We're robots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

200
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:14.190
<v Speaker 3>Magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how we found out by looking at</v>

201
00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 3>the ingredients of new vigil and were</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

202
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:16.531
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what does this mean?</v>

204
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.940
<v Speaker 3>Then all of a sudden the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>overlords turned the switch and we can</v>

205
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 3>see them in front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

206
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.460
<v Speaker 3>you guys are robots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because his entire time was that God</v>

207
00:09:24.461 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 3>damn ad agency the whole time that let</v>
<v Speaker 3>it out.</v>

208
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 3>We're doing the bid</v>

209
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.610
<v Speaker 1>bidding for the robot world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what the creepiest fucking</v>

210
00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:34.370
<v Speaker 1>quote I ever read it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

211
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.620
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marshall Mcluhan,</v>

212
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.730
<v Speaker 1>he said human beings are the sex organs</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the machine world.</v>

213
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man.</v>

214
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:47.380
<v Speaker 1>And he wrote this Mcluhan was a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker and like our one of a</v>

215
00:09:47.381 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 1>really underrated visionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you read some of the stuff,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

217
00:09:51.371 --> 00:09:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy had some insight and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty sure he wrote all this stuff in</v>

218
00:09:55.391 --> 00:09:59.450
<v Speaker 1>like the 60s you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of what,</v>

219
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.050
<v Speaker 1>find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find when that quote was</v>

220
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.470
<v Speaker 1>said by Mcluhan or written however it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

221
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.130
<v Speaker 1>human beings or the sex organs of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine world.</v>

222
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.130
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it was in the 60s you wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

223
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.420
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's so how the fuck did he see that?</v>

225
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are some sort of a,</v>

226
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.200
<v Speaker 1>a weird being that makes better and</v>
<v Speaker 1>better technology every year and we'd</v>

227
00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:29.380
<v Speaker 1>get pumped about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is why I wanted to show you that</v>

228
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.510
<v Speaker 3>razor phone.</v>

<v Speaker 3>1964 64 just stop and think of that.</v>

231
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:41.340
<v Speaker 3>1964 that motherfucker figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was all kind of mine.</v>

232

<v Speaker 3>or your eyes are puffy down but you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the passcode.</v>

257
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.650
<v Speaker 3>But anytime you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just unlocks,</v>

258
00:11:37.651 --> 00:11:39.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>size of it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>as the the plus,</v>

262
00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:50.100

275
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.330
<v Speaker 3>Cancel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh there it is.</v>

276
00:12:22.331 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Here's some notifications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now can you see anything?</v>

277
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:27.680
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'm already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to fake face Id.</v>

278
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Speaker 3>Look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that will look,</v>

280
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

281
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.630
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect example.</v>

282
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.510
<v Speaker 3>So it fucks up sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes,</v>

283
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.430
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you what man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this a,</v>

284
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:50.140
<v Speaker 3>the form factor is very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my security camp.</v>

285
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.550
<v Speaker 3>So it's a huge ass camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not second three or four</v>

286
00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 3>cameras I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's the shoe as huge as phone</v>

287
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.450
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a huge ass phone.</v>

288
00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.890
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it has a killer camera.</v>

289
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.580
<v Speaker 3>What a weird world man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just 10 years ago the first iphone came</v>

290
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:07.600
<v Speaker 3>out and if you saw that thing today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that thing was made out of wood.</v>

291
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.710
<v Speaker 3>I still have mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have some amazing all mine and</v>

292
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:14.380
<v Speaker 3>two of them are starting to explode</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

293
00:13:14.381 --> 00:13:17.320
<v Speaker 3>and it's not fair because I bought him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I wanted to keep them like a</v>

294
00:13:17.321 --> 00:13:19.720
<v Speaker 3>collector,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my like iphone three is like bubbled</v>

295
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:21.340
<v Speaker 3>up and it's about to blow up any day</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

296
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.380
<v Speaker 3>So do you get used to all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference?</v>

297
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.000
<v Speaker 3>You have different swipes now because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a homepage.</v>

298
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to shut it down to get out of</v>

299
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:30.424
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

300
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

301
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.530
<v Speaker 3>If the swiping system actually is very</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

302
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.430
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I used to do it that</v>
<v Speaker 3>different way.</v>

303
00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:38.710
<v Speaker 3>Like if you want to go in between like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

304
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.280
<v Speaker 3>like programs now you just go to the on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom left or right.</v>

305
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:47.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you do that and then now the top</v>

306
00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:50.380
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets you to the control center.</v>

307
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.050
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it took me about two days for me to</v>

308
00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:53.920
<v Speaker 3>finally go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

309
00:13:53.921 --> 00:13:56.890
<v Speaker 3>this is so much how it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

310
00:13:56.891 --> 00:13:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah.</v>

311
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Who's figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

312
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:01.780
<v Speaker 1>like if they figure out a better way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's a better way,</v>

313
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:02.201
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

314
00:14:02.201 --> 00:14:04.410
<v Speaker 1>cordy typing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know the whole deal behind that?</v>

315
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Apparently this is not the fastest way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to type like the keyboard Qwerty is set</v>

316
00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:13.450
<v Speaker 1>up the way it is because in the olden</v>
<v Speaker 1>days they made it that way because old</v>

317
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:17.200
<v Speaker 1>keys would get stuck on each other and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would mash them and they get stuck</v>

318
00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had a separate,</v>

319
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:22.870
<v Speaker 1>the more commonly used keys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they changed the way they did it,</v>

320
00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:25.830
<v Speaker 1>but the right way to do the typewriter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goddammit,</v>

321
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I forget the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

322
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.700
<v Speaker 1>some people try wacky fucking nerds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wacky nerds,</v>

323
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.140
<v Speaker 1>these wacky nerds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they touch it.</v>

324
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.130
<v Speaker 1>They take their keyboards and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>reprogrammed them or they buy a specific</v>

325
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:40.210
<v Speaker 1>keyboard that's in this way and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they learn how to type with this super</v>

326
00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:42.850
<v Speaker 1>unusual keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's supposed to be fast.</v>

327
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.890
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a plug in.</v>

328
00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:46.770
<v Speaker 3>I think that you can do it on your ipad</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your iphones and stuff like that.</v>

329
00:14:46.771 --> 00:14:47.880
<v Speaker 3>They'll realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

330
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.720
<v Speaker 3>what is it called James?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The devora Kita for act.</v>

331
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

332
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

333
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.120
<v Speaker 1>a little different layout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

334
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:55.370
<v Speaker 1>So there's cordy and Devorah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

335
00:14:55.490 --> 00:15:00.490
<v Speaker 1>like it's a e U I d h.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not corny at all.</v>

336
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.730
<v Speaker 1>P Y F,</v>
<v Speaker 1>G,</v>

337
00:15:02.731 --> 00:15:05.750
<v Speaker 1>C R L on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

338
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Like you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would take a long ass time to</v>

339
00:15:08.091 --> 00:15:08.720
<v Speaker 1>relearn.</v>

340
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.970
<v Speaker 3>You can't relearn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to start from the beginning.</v>

341
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.351
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

342
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:15.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>

343
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm too stupid.</v>

344
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm too stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like my thoughts about learning a</v>

345
00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:20.420
<v Speaker 3>new language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

346
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.130
<v Speaker 3>well I'm good voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

347
00:15:22.131 --> 00:15:26.210
<v Speaker 3>Your students so much already there that</v>

<v Speaker 3>what the fuck that guy just said.</v>

360
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you could get already do it in</v>

366
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:11.660
<v Speaker 3>that camera on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best camera of any,</v>

367
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.010
<v Speaker 3>any phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new pixel two.</v>

368
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.950
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy is it's a single camera where</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these other phones are doing it with</v>

369
00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:17.360
<v Speaker 3>a dual camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is interesting,</v>

370
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:18.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

371
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.360
<v Speaker 1>what's really interesting is the level</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all these phones are at now,</v>

372
00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.180
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is at a super high level.</v>

373
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Like technologically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jump has been giant.</v>

374
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like where is this fucking thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>going?</v>

375
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Like where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are we going to look at for the</v>

376
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:36.380
<v Speaker 1>iphone 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is it going to be aware of blindness?</v>

379
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.330
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be wearable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one day there's not going to be</v>

380
00:16:43.331 --> 00:16:44.111
<v Speaker 3>a device,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a phone.</v>

381
00:16:44.111 --> 00:16:46.210
<v Speaker 3>You're just going to be wearing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow.</v>

382
00:16:46.211 --> 00:16:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Like you look at your sleeve to make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone call.</v>

383
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.000
<v Speaker 3>You can check your email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're using your shoe to some mad</v>

384
00:16:52.001 --> 00:16:53.800
<v Speaker 3>scientist is going to figure out a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make it</v>

385
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.130
<v Speaker 1>eyeballs that work better than our</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyeballs and they'll go,</v>

386
00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.080
<v Speaker 1>we're going to swap out our eyeballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be the first to go and</v>

387
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.040
<v Speaker 1>swap out your eyeballs for these super</v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic eyeballs.</v>

388
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:08.240
<v Speaker 1>But everything is like a shade of color</v>
<v Speaker 1>off like red is purple.</v>

389
00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.510
<v Speaker 1>They got to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of them old led screens</v>

390
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.430
<v Speaker 1>and he's got burned in like we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get,</v>

391
00:17:13.431 --> 00:17:15.740
<v Speaker 1>we're going to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But right now you just give up your</v>

392
00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:17.480
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give up your eyes for the computer</v>

393
00:17:17.481 --> 00:17:19.760
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it start us off to start us</v>

394
00:17:19.761 --> 00:17:22.250
<v Speaker 1>off with better eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First it'd be our blind friends,</v>

395
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro,</v>

396
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.931
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind friends.</v>

397
00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:25.580
<v Speaker 1>We'll get new eyes and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

398
00:17:25.581 --> 00:17:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I see so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually happy that I went blind.</v>

399
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did you just say?</v>

400
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.190
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try it.</v>

401
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.300
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be some someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some crazy fucker with good eyesight is</v>

402
00:17:37.301 --> 00:17:38.600
<v Speaker 1>going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to see better.</v>

403
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like the girl with a perfect body</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets boob implants like,</v>

404
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.660
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how'd you do that?</v>

405
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl already has double d's and goes</v>

406
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:48.890
<v Speaker 1>to like AAA.</v>

408
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

409
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.903
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

410
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Why did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

411
00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.980
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to think of like all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blind people would be the first ones</v>

412
00:17:57.981 --> 00:18:00.590
<v Speaker 1>to get all the new eyeballs and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing better.</v>

413
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.780
<v Speaker 1>So they're all going to be like those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with the glasses,</v>

414
00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:04.250
<v Speaker 1>the blind people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they take off their,</v>

415
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.940
<v Speaker 1>and they're all robots like they live</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the movie they live.</v>

416
00:18:07.941 --> 00:18:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Remember that Rowdy Roddy Piper recipes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>

417
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Remember when Rowdy Roddy Piper was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie star for a little bit doing some</v>

418
00:18:14.361 --> 00:18:17.710
<v Speaker 1>action movies and he was like one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first guys like the rock to break</v>

419
00:18:17.711 --> 00:18:19.580
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

420
00:18:19.581 --> 00:18:21.290
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that day live movie.</v>

421
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.600
<v Speaker 1>That was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I miss that guy,</v>

422
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.261
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

423
00:18:24.261 --> 00:18:26.540
<v Speaker 1>it's a real possibility that this could</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

424
00:18:26.541 --> 00:18:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Like this is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

425
00:18:28.101 --> 00:18:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's going to happen in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a decade,</v>

426
00:18:30.111 --> 00:18:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but if human beings live to be another</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years,</v>

427
00:18:33.051 --> 00:18:36.140
<v Speaker 1>we're going to find they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have better replacements to tweet about</v>

428
00:18:36.141 --> 00:18:36.350
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

429
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.260
<v Speaker 1>A robot was scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody just the way he worded it,</v>

430
00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.880
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is nothing in a few years,</v>

431
00:18:40.881 --> 00:18:43.670
<v Speaker 1>that Bot will move so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a strobe light to see it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>beings on the planet earth that guys,</v>

436
00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.350
<v Speaker 1>you know that they think he might have</v>
<v Speaker 1>invented bitcoin.</v>

437
00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.660
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of speculation online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

438
00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

439
00:19:01.401 --> 00:19:03.170
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even read the article.</v>

440
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I looked at the headline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like probably,</v>

445
00:19:14.961 --> 00:19:19.250
<v Speaker 1>there was a video of him from like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>1990s where he got like a million dollar</v>

446

448
00:19:23.631 --> 00:19:25.640
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably like one of the smartest</v>

<v Speaker 1>human beings ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he sports car though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>battery in Australia.</v>

463
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.130
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck tech and Leon Musk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elon.</v>

464
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Elon musk is making good on his promise</v>
<v Speaker 1>to solve energy,</v>

465
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.280
<v Speaker 1>an energy crisis in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you make that bear</v>

466
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.353
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

467
00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Besides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

468
00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.400
<v Speaker 1>screw that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

469
00:20:21.401 --> 00:20:23.710
<v Speaker 1>here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fully installed.</v>

470
00:20:23.711 --> 00:20:26.530
<v Speaker 1>The world's largest lithium ion battery</v>
<v Speaker 1>in South Australia.</v>

471
00:20:26.531 --> 00:20:28.420
<v Speaker 1>The state government said in a statement</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thursday,</v>

472
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Tesla teamed up with a French renewable</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy from and a local government to</v>

473
00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:36.460
<v Speaker 1>install the battery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which must promise to deliver within a</v>

474
00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.440
<v Speaker 1>hundred days of signing the contract or</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be free.</v>

475
00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 1>He's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did as a crisis.</v>

476
00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.020
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a mad man.</v>

477
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.110
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking mad scientist from a,</v>

478
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.400
<v Speaker 1>he's like a guy from a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

479
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had a movie and there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>some mad billionaire Robert Downey</v>

480
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:59.140
<v Speaker 1>junior type character that just kept</v>
<v Speaker 1>invented the newest crazy shit and was</v>

481
00:20:59.141 --> 00:21:01.720
<v Speaker 1>at the cutting edge of science and was</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling everybody to look out for the</v>

482
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:06.721
<v Speaker 1>fucking robots are going to kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be Elon Musk and let him know</v>

483
00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:08.530
<v Speaker 1>the comedy show one night.</v>

484
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I was panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He watched you though,</v>

485
00:21:10.841 --> 00:21:12.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he,</v>

486
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.610
<v Speaker 1>I think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a nice army with them.</v>

487
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bring a lot of money with guns can</v>

488
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.470
<v Speaker 1>move very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're worried about</v>

489
00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:22.750
<v Speaker 1>robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

490
00:21:22.751 --> 00:21:24.580
<v Speaker 1>He's right though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the scary thing.</v>

491
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:28.060
<v Speaker 1>When you watch that one robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one mini robot is this little</v>

492
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:32.680
<v Speaker 1>yellow one in this video and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>running on the ground and like a very</v>

493
00:21:32.681 --> 00:21:34.150
<v Speaker 1>fast rate and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

494
00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:34.984
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

495
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Like you're trying to wrap your head</v>
<v Speaker 1>around this thing.</v>

496
00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Like what is this thing has guns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

497
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:42.370
<v Speaker 1>It's got a little camera and it's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>guns and it's running at you like this</v>

498
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:46.750
<v Speaker 1>and it's like the size of a 44 magnum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a series of 44 magnums pointed</v>

499
00:21:46.751 --> 00:21:49.630
<v Speaker 1>at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about that big and it's running.</v>

500
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll go a hundred times faster than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could ever run.</v>

501
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

502
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:58.560
<v Speaker 1>This is like probably how people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yemen feel like,</v>

503
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.690
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been telling you you can't,</v>

504
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.710
<v Speaker 1>you can't let them use robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know like the people that get bombed</v>

505
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.630
<v Speaker 1>with drones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've just sorta like,</v>

506
00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.440
<v Speaker 1>that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to Blake,</v>

507
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.870
<v Speaker 1>tell us about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one has to tell us that they're going</v>

508
00:22:13.871 --> 00:22:15.490
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just do it right.</v>

509
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.480
<v Speaker 1>And something like 80% of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they kill her innocent.</v>

510
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.450
<v Speaker 1>There's some crazy number of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drones of Kilt,</v>

511
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I know we've gone over this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it like 80% do you remember?</v>

512
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.680
<v Speaker 1>That sounds about right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's some,</v>

513
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.570
<v Speaker 1>let's see if we can find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just cause it's so,</v>

514
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I know you're a guru.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you were in surgery to get it</v>

515
00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.150
<v Speaker 1>probably might be like 78% whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

516
00:22:37.151 --> 00:22:41.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's even if it's more than 50%</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking crazy.</v>

517
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.710
<v Speaker 1>We just have robots that shoot things at</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and we hope we get the right</v>

518
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:46.960
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would never think that transformers</v>

519
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.070
<v Speaker 1>like what actually happened one day</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have like good</v>

520
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:55.130
<v Speaker 1>transformers and bad transformers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good ones are going to hack the badger</v>

521
00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.880
<v Speaker 1>ones or vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Bay was right all along.</v>

522
00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.340
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to bring Megan Fox back into the</v>

523
00:23:00.341 --> 00:23:02.550
<v Speaker 1>franchise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I just,</v>

524
00:23:02.551 --> 00:23:06.430
<v Speaker 1>that's hard to imagine man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably inevitable,</v>

525
00:23:06.431 --> 00:23:08.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably inevitable that someone is</v>

526
00:23:08.461 --> 00:23:11.890
<v Speaker 1>going to make some super smart robot</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does his bidding and this and we're</v>

527
00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:15.880
<v Speaker 1>going to have like a war of worlds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have robo cops fight the</v>

528
00:23:15.881 --> 00:23:16.840
<v Speaker 1>bad robots.</v>

529
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Drones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine if the argument would be</v>

530
00:23:20.261 --> 00:23:23.620
<v Speaker 1>let's let the robots fight because</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore it'll save human lives will</v>

531
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:28.621
<v Speaker 1>dictate how the world is one sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the Olympics but with robots</v>

532
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.170
<v Speaker 1>fighting to the death to see who gets to</v>
<v Speaker 1>run the world.</v>

533
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm like Elon must,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be doing instead of making</v>

534
00:23:34.601 --> 00:23:36.850
<v Speaker 1>batteries is trying to invent force</v>
<v Speaker 1>fields.</v>

535
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.880
<v Speaker 1>You know like for real we need on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal force fields,</v>

536
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.190
<v Speaker 1>we'll see he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing,</v>

537
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:47.220
<v Speaker 1>he is at the cutting edge of science and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like implementation of all</v>

538
00:23:48.981 --> 00:23:53.981
<v Speaker 1>these new inventions like lithium ion</v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries that are hooked up to a giant</v>

539
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:56.070
<v Speaker 1>fucking</v>

540
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.730
<v Speaker 5>whatever that structure was committed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then drone raise this one on Espn all</v>

541
00:23:59.731 --> 00:24:04.731
<v Speaker 5>the time they pee do to put on like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost a Vr headset and race through it.</v>

542
00:24:04.891 --> 00:24:06.560
<v Speaker 5>They did have him in arenas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

543
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:10.260
<v Speaker 5>A lot of times it's at night with lit up</v>
<v Speaker 5>like neon obstacles they're going to go</v>

544
00:24:10.261 --> 00:24:11.910
<v Speaker 5>through and you'd be like 70 miles an</v>
<v Speaker 5>hour.</v>

545
00:24:11.911 --> 00:24:13.860
<v Speaker 5>I think they go really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So cool.</v>

546
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.000
<v Speaker 5>That's incredible.</v>

547
00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.910
<v Speaker 1>That's so much cooler than a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause this is an actual thing out there</v>

548
00:24:18.911 --> 00:24:22.120
<v Speaker 1>that you're moving around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like to play a video game.</v>

549
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the new video game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new video game is you put some like</v>

550
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:31.830
<v Speaker 1>10 k camera Vr headset thing on and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>put these cameras on these robots and</v>

551
00:24:35.591 --> 00:24:39.520
<v Speaker 1>then you go do shit where the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is really doing it.</v>

552
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a video.</v>

553
00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:45.790
<v Speaker 1>You're just watching some real physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing take place.</v>

554
00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:49.630
<v Speaker 1>And then you have these physical wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like instead of,</v>

555
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.960
<v Speaker 1>you know like if you built together an</v>
<v Speaker 1>army of semi indestructable robots,</v>

556
00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you had to duke it out with another</v>

557
00:24:57.281 --> 00:25:02.281
<v Speaker 1>army of semi indestructable robots and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be like a television show or</v>

558
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:06.520
<v Speaker 1>drone laser tag where it's like star</v>
<v Speaker 1>wars and you're fighting and if you have</v>

559
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.130
<v Speaker 1>you shoot your laser at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like turns off the drone.</v>

560
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.440
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't destroy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it makes it fake.</v>

561
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd have to have high stakes.</v>

562
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.180
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think things would be so cheap back by</v>

563
00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:18.940
<v Speaker 1>the time it gets to this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything gets cheaper and</v>

564
00:25:18.941 --> 00:25:19.840
<v Speaker 1>cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you used to be,</v>

565
00:25:19.841 --> 00:25:24.280
<v Speaker 1>like you had to be a super baller to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that Michael Douglas brick on the</v>

566
00:25:24.281 --> 00:25:25.180
<v Speaker 1>beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

567
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Remember when the movie greed or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

568
00:25:27.191 --> 00:25:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street greed is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's walking with that giant brick.</v>

569
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Like you had to be a super ball or to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to afford that.</v>

570
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.160
<v Speaker 1>But now that's like nothing and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a cell phone that's way better than</v>

571
00:25:36.161 --> 00:25:38.680
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every person walking down the</v>

572
00:25:38.681 --> 00:25:40.600
<v Speaker 1>street you can serve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a fallen on you?</v>

573
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.261
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

574
00:25:41.261 --> 00:25:43.420
<v Speaker 1>And he pulls out his phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way better than Michael Douglas's.</v>

575
00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Super baller all time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How many weeks?</v>

618
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I watched it on an airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No sound.</v>

619
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.200
<v Speaker 1>That's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do when you're so high.</v>

620
00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:30.120
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking you got to fall out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky.</v>

621
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.900
<v Speaker 1>They'd watch that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

622
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.870
<v Speaker 1>That guy's awesome as wolverine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though he's not supposed to like is</v>

623
00:27:36.871 --> 00:27:39.900
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to look like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wolverines not supposed to be a big guy.</v>

624
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.150
<v Speaker 1>That would be like a bear hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll run.</v>

625
00:27:42.151 --> 00:27:47.151
<v Speaker 1>It's like a little little blockhead guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wolverine would be built like um,</v>

626
00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:52.980
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to go like who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samar Paul Horez.</v>

627
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who some are.</v>

628
00:27:55.161 --> 00:27:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Paul Harris is a guy who fought in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>

629
00:27:57.691 --> 00:28:00.780
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got kicked out of the UFC for I think</v>

630
00:28:00.781 --> 00:28:02.810
<v Speaker 1>unjustly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got it.</v>

631
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.580
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he holds on to submissions too long and</v>

632
00:28:05.581 --> 00:28:08.550
<v Speaker 1>people get really mad at him cause he</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking mangles people's legs.</v>

633
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:12.510
<v Speaker 1>But I think the last one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like east the people are they out there</v>

634
00:28:12.511 --> 00:28:16.290
<v Speaker 1>on him so hard that I think the last one</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just,</v>

635
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.930
<v Speaker 1>it was a tiny minor infraction.</v>

636
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just get super excited and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's definitely held on to</v>

637
00:28:22.861 --> 00:28:25.320
<v Speaker 1>things too long in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's learned from that.</v>

638
00:28:25.321 --> 00:28:27.990
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC as a zero tolerance policy for</v>

639
00:28:27.991 --> 00:28:29.670
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't fight for the UFC anymore.</v>

640
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:32.820
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point is the guy looked like</v>

641
00:28:32.821 --> 00:28:36.390
<v Speaker 1>wolverine from the comic book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just fucking jacked.</v>

642
00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:39.600
<v Speaker 1>He was like this five foot eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five foot nine.</v>

643
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:43.320
<v Speaker 1>He might not even been that tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred 85 pound goal.</v>

644
00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Willa just ripping people's legs apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the scariest guys hour.</v>

645

<v Speaker 6>But like I showed you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I,</v>

692
00:30:52.511 --> 00:30:55.350
<v Speaker 6>I'm on the low side of normal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but so I don't even know what that</v>

693
00:30:55.351 --> 00:30:57.780
<v Speaker 6>means.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I guess I should test it every</v>

694
00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.730
<v Speaker 6>couple of months to see if it bounces up</v>
<v Speaker 6>and down.</v>

695
00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:03.300
<v Speaker 6>But I definitely have lower normal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

696
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.570
<v Speaker 6>you could fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know I,</v>

697
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.000
<v Speaker 6>but here's the thing you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you,</v>

698
00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.750
<v Speaker 6>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you really like we have in a</v>

699
00:31:09.751 --> 00:31:11.220
<v Speaker 6>conversation about health.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

700
00:31:11.221 --> 00:31:13.140
<v Speaker 6>I mean I'm just checking my t levels,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bro.</v>

701
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.273
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bro.</v>

702
00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.700
<v Speaker 6>It's all connected.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What I'm saying is that I guarantee you</v>

703
00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:21.480
<v Speaker 6>if you just changed your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it would have a significant effect on</v>

704
00:31:21.481 --> 00:31:23.850
<v Speaker 6>that just changed your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to go to,</v>

705
00:31:23.851 --> 00:31:26.430
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to do this new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you want to do it with me all through</v>

706
00:31:26.431 --> 00:31:28.860
<v Speaker 6>December,</v>
<v Speaker 6>December,</v>

707
00:31:28.861 --> 00:31:30.320
<v Speaker 6>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is what I'm gonna do.</v>

708
00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:33.150
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to work out five days a week</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least.</v>

709
00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.650
<v Speaker 6>Minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I owe five days a week.</v>

710
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.910
<v Speaker 6>No bread,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no wheat,</v>

711
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.380
<v Speaker 6>no pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no sugar.</v>

712
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.930
<v Speaker 6>All month.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Two drinks a week.</v>

713
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.120
<v Speaker 6>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's it.</v>

714
00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.053
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

715
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.020
<v Speaker 1>So if you go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a drink wine,</v>

716
00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.960
<v Speaker 1>you get one more of those in a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are you going to eat?</v>

717
00:31:48.961 --> 00:31:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Mostly just stake healthy food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

718
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I watched another week document or on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plane,</v>

719
00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.800
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my fucking pants.</v>

720
00:31:55.801 --> 00:31:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was talking about the stuff that's in</v>

721
00:31:58.651 --> 00:32:03.651
<v Speaker 1>roundup and how it's only supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect bacteria and they're the</v>

722
00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:05.340
<v Speaker 1>scientists in this documentary like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

723
00:32:05.341 --> 00:32:09.030
<v Speaker 1>but you have bacteria in your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not taking that into</v>

724
00:32:09.031 --> 00:32:11.070
<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not taking into consideration</v>

725
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.680
<v Speaker 1>gut flora.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were talking about how many</v>

726
00:32:13.681 --> 00:32:17.850
<v Speaker 1>people are having issues because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating bread that has pesticides on.</v>

727
00:32:17.851 --> 00:32:18.684
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

728
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.570
<v Speaker 1>is this like some pseudoscience shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this some nonsense?</v>

729
00:32:21.571 --> 00:32:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I got to get to it and eventually I</v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

730
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:29.450
<v Speaker 1>but I can't imagine that stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kills bacteria would be good for you.</v>

731
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I just can't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much of that you would</v>

732
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:35.550
<v Speaker 1>actually wind up having in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how the fuck could that be good for</v>

733
00:32:35.551 --> 00:32:36.384
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

734
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Like all that roundup that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should scare the fuck out of you.</v>

735
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.760
<v Speaker 1>What is going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

736
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

737
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.760
<v Speaker 1>we sure we share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

738
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:47.750
<v Speaker 1>For you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of those things,</v>

739
00:32:47.751 --> 00:32:51.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowable per probably,</v>

740
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:56.060
<v Speaker 1>but who set that standard and is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard been updated based on what you</v>

741
00:32:56.061 --> 00:32:58.400
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's too much money involved in</v>

742
00:32:58.401 --> 00:33:00.800
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to realize like anything that's</v>

743
00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:03.680
<v Speaker 1>going to slow down the money when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to in his old bro,</v>

744
00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:05.600
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't talk and conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

745
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.090
<v Speaker 1>like for real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is important when it comes to</v>

746
00:33:08.091 --> 00:33:10.550
<v Speaker 1>environmental regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the fight,</v>

747
00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.010
<v Speaker 1>here's a Ryko super good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to this,</v>

748
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.880
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the fight when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to environmental regulations,</v>

749
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:22.870
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck would be arguing against</v>
<v Speaker 1>preserving the environment to stop,</v>

750
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.270
<v Speaker 1>stop and think about how crazy these</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations have to be where someone</v>

751
00:33:30.271 --> 00:33:30.771
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

752
00:33:30.771 --> 00:33:33.830
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't dig that oil well right next</v>

753
00:33:33.831 --> 00:33:37.130
<v Speaker 1>to this river because it'll kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in the river.</v>

754
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:40.970
<v Speaker 1>You fucking cunts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people still wind up doing it</v>

755
00:33:40.971 --> 00:33:42.520
<v Speaker 1>somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how it,</v>

756
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 1>how is that conversation even taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>place that we're,</v>

757
00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:49.160
<v Speaker 1>we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting involved in doing things</v>

758
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:53.450
<v Speaker 1>that we know for sure is going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>some consequence and we're willing to</v>

759
00:33:53.451 --> 00:33:57.020
<v Speaker 1>accept a certain amount of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some consequence on the natural world</v>

760
00:33:57.021 --> 00:34:00.050
<v Speaker 1>around it might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might just the keystone pipeline,</v>

761
00:34:00.051 --> 00:34:02.900
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the other day release 200,000</v>

762
00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:05.120
<v Speaker 1>gallons of oil a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a little bit.</v>

763
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>

764
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.690
<v Speaker 1>House bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Want to fix?</v>

765
00:34:08.691 --> 00:34:10.430
<v Speaker 1>This is what we're trying to fix this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

766
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we should be like before we agree</v>

767
00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:18.290
<v Speaker 1>to anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

768
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's gotta be some trade off,</v>

769
00:34:20.901 --> 00:34:22.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do a big city and you</v>

770
00:34:22.761 --> 00:34:25.370
<v Speaker 1>want to have all this power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's gotta be some sort of</v>

771
00:34:25.371 --> 00:34:28.070
<v Speaker 1>environmental consequences at this stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the life.</v>

772
00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.650
<v Speaker 1>Is that at this stage of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people like the way we're running</v>

773
00:34:30.651 --> 00:34:34.910
<v Speaker 1>things and has elan musk can make us</v>
<v Speaker 1>those big ass batteries everywhere.</v>

774
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.160
<v Speaker 1>It's solar power collectors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

775
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lh.</v>

776
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Every building should be required to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have solar collectors on them in la.</v>

777
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.840
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that crazy expensive,</v>

778
00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:47.960
<v Speaker 1>like it's not that you could do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself on Amazon prime,</v>

779
00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:49.520
<v Speaker 1>prime dropping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

780
00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It's dropping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

781
00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:53.660
<v Speaker 1>they make some things where you can like</v>
<v Speaker 1>charge your phone.</v>

782
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Like they make these a solar panels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could sit them out on your</v>

783
00:34:56.871 --> 00:35:01.130
<v Speaker 1>patio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It collects a electricity enough to you</v>

784
00:35:01.131 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 1>take it with you the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could charge your phone with it,</v>

785
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.620
<v Speaker 1>you charge your laptop with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like backpacks that have solar on</v>

786
00:35:06.621 --> 00:35:07.770
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got to be like,</v>

787
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.050
<v Speaker 1>why the sunniest places should have be</v>
<v Speaker 1>required to do shit like that.</v>

788
00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the windiest places should have</v>

789
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.070
<v Speaker 1>windmills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I've read is,</v>

790
00:35:16.071 --> 00:35:21.071
<v Speaker 1>the only issue on any of this stuff is</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are the minerals coming from to</v>

791
00:35:21.171 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 1>make these magnets?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

792
00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:27.560
<v Speaker 1>there's things called conflict minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's minerals that are,</v>

793
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken out of the ground in the Congo by</v>

794
00:35:30.741 --> 00:35:32.090
<v Speaker 1>slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

795
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:37.120
<v Speaker 1>there's little children working in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>camps that they've documented polling,</v>

796
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called [inaudible] Tan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the name of it.</v>

797
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Out of the mountains and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to make cell phones.</v>

798
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.860
<v Speaker 1>It's very depressing and I don't know if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still do it there like that</v>

799
00:35:46.861 --> 00:35:48.450
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if since uh,</v>

800
00:35:48.451 --> 00:35:50.700
<v Speaker 1>it's been exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's had any sort of an impact on how</v>

801
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:51.990
<v Speaker 1>they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

802
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Shane Smith was the first person that</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to us about it and I remember</v>

803
00:35:55.111 --> 00:35:56.530
<v Speaker 1>talking to him about it going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

804
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.720
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

805
00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Like stop and think about like what a</v>

809
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.810
<v Speaker 1>if you just think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pinnacle of like what we use as far</v>

810
00:36:12.811 --> 00:36:14.520
<v Speaker 1>as like technology is like one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

811
00:36:14.521 --> 00:36:16.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you take that,</v>

812
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.070
<v Speaker 1>which is like the most pervasive</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

813
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.530
<v Speaker 1>the most advanced aspect of our society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

814
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:27.560
<v Speaker 1>The Internet in a phone that takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures and you can ironically connect</v>

815
00:36:28.831 --> 00:36:33.831
<v Speaker 1>that all the way back to a child slave</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's digging rocks out of the ground</v>

<v Speaker 1>with a stick.</v>

818
00:36:41.011 --> 00:36:42.390
<v Speaker 1>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've mined minerals.</v>

819
00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just take it out of the Congo</v>

820
00:36:44.401 --> 00:36:46.860
<v Speaker 1>that malaria is digging in my backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get rocks.</v>

821
00:36:46.861 --> 00:36:48.470
<v Speaker 1>I collected rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>polished him.</v>

822
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.730
<v Speaker 1>It was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love doing that.</v>

823
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met a dude once who pan for gold.</v>

824
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.580
<v Speaker 1>We were coming across the country and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

825
00:36:56.581 --> 00:37:01.581
<v Speaker 1>I met a dude who was a legitimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>prospector and he was not making a ton</v>

826
00:37:01.891 --> 00:37:04.260
<v Speaker 1>of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had like this idea that he could</v>

827
00:37:04.261 --> 00:37:08.700
<v Speaker 1>at any day like go in one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>rivers and pull out some serious gold.</v>

828
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.500
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does happen,</v>

829
00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:13.290
<v Speaker 1>especially like in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's those TV shows where it's in</v>

830
00:37:13.291 --> 00:37:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Alaska where there's these guys go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

831
00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:20.130
<v Speaker 1>they get a certain amount of gold out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground every day and sometimes they</v>

832
00:37:20.131 --> 00:37:24.420
<v Speaker 1>hit good pots and they can really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really collect and stack them up.</v>

833
00:37:24.421 --> 00:37:26.430
<v Speaker 1>But this dude was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that brought him some shit that I</v>

834
00:37:26.431 --> 00:37:27.420
<v Speaker 1>thought it was gold and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

835
00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I found some gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

836
00:37:28.321 --> 00:37:28.531
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

837
00:37:28.531 --> 00:37:29.970
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pyrite.</v>

838
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:33.070
<v Speaker 1>That's fool's gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started thinking about,</v>

839
00:37:33.071 --> 00:37:33.904
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

840
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.270
<v Speaker 1>why is gold worth anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come,</v>

841
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.050
<v Speaker 1>this pretty stuff was not as much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pretty stuff.</v>

842
00:37:40.051 --> 00:37:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck is fool's gold might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be worth more than gold.</v>

843
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:47.010
<v Speaker 1>One some day we will like you fools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was right there in front of your eyes</v>

<v Speaker 1>the entire time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what is fool's gold made out of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fool's gold looks pretty dope.</v>

846
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I think I should have some shit made out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fool's gold since I'm a fool.</v>

847
00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:00.470
<v Speaker 1>That's good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should make it happen Bro.</v>

848
00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:04.140
<v Speaker 1>How dope would it be to have a fool's</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold watch movement?</v>

<v Speaker 5>They like find a place and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell anybody about it cause they know</v>

868
00:39:01.331 --> 00:39:04.780
<v Speaker 5>there's probably like $2 million worth</v>
<v Speaker 5>of shit down there and they got to be</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

871
00:39:10.061 --> 00:39:13.270
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole industry of that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people that finance these guys.</v>

872
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.840

00:39:20.171 --> 00:39:24.130
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the people that need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>finance that bitch and usually they make</v>

875
00:39:24.131 --> 00:39:25.750
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a split.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the guy's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of dollars and come</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with Zilch and they just think around</v>

878
00:39:31.841 --> 00:39:33.460
<v Speaker 1>the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the corner.</v>

00:39:33.461 --> 00:39:36.810
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be my pot of gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Roman ship that crashed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Those greedy cons,</v>

881
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.700
<v Speaker 1>these to bring so much gold with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it killed their boat,</v>

882
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:48.300
<v Speaker 1>poison them from the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that he just got hundreds and</v>

883
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:50.170
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of pounds of gold.</v>

884
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:54.070
<v Speaker 5>There's another movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he an acts that came out last year</v>

885
00:39:54.071 --> 00:39:58.690
<v Speaker 5>that's sort of about it to where he goes</v>
<v Speaker 5>to somewhere like Thailand and they're</v>

886
00:39:58.691 --> 00:40:00.310
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they know the spot where they're</v>

887
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.460
<v Speaker 5>prospectors are going to like dig all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the gold out of the out of the mountains</v>

888
00:40:03.461 --> 00:40:05.560
<v Speaker 5>and demanding thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not a in the ocean.</v>

889
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 5>Pretty Dope wasn't as good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what was good</v>

890
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:10.770
<v Speaker 1>that I liked a lot of people did not</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the dark tower.</v>

891
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>

892
00:40:13.381 --> 00:40:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Idris Elba Guy,</v>

893
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.670
<v Speaker 1>he could sell me anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm buying it.</v>

894
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.530
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

895
00:40:19.531 --> 00:40:23.210
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy that's like you believe is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a legit Badass.</v>

896
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:27.300
<v Speaker 1>But also can act like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I believed him in this movie.</v>

897
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:30.180
<v Speaker 1>He was a wacky movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like very wacky.</v>

898
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:32.460
<v Speaker 1>It's always whacking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have a Stephen King book,</v>

899
00:40:32.461 --> 00:40:34.910
<v Speaker 1>he tried to make a movie out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a British accent?</v>

900
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite,</v>

901
00:40:38.191 --> 00:40:42.690
<v Speaker 1>but he has like some sort of a noble</v>
<v Speaker 1>accent like the way talks,</v>

902
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:46.650
<v Speaker 1>you know like I do not aim with my hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>to aim with your hand,</v>

903
00:40:46.651 --> 00:40:49.350
<v Speaker 1>just to forget the face of your father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of shit.</v>

904
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.090
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like intense,</v>

905
00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:53.850
<v Speaker 1>weird world that they live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this movie.</v>

906
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:54.900
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

907
00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.820
<v Speaker 1>But I enjoy the shit out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

908
00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Cause you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you watch a movie that's a Stephen</v>

909
00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:01.320
<v Speaker 1>King book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to realize they have to</v>

910
00:41:01.321 --> 00:41:05.310
<v Speaker 1>abbreviate the fuck out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a complex story that gets</v>

911
00:41:05.311 --> 00:41:10.311
<v Speaker 1>woven into all these different places</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to condense that to an</v>

912
00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:13.440
<v Speaker 1>hour and a half to make it palatable for</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

913
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.420
<v Speaker 1>It just use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very hard to do.</v>

914
00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Like I those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like game of thrones have</v>

915
00:41:19.351 --> 00:41:22.470
<v Speaker 1>made movies obsolete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like movies or like clunky.</v>

916
00:41:22.471 --> 00:41:25.860
<v Speaker 1>They're like cds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why Karen had cds do you don't have</v>

917
00:41:25.861 --> 00:41:27.360
<v Speaker 1>a phone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who are you?</v>

918
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.900
<v Speaker 5>I I think the same way about game of</v>
<v Speaker 5>thrones.</v>

919
00:41:29.901 --> 00:41:32.630
<v Speaker 5>I can't get into it.</v>

987
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.370
<v Speaker 6>There's something satisfying about</v>
<v Speaker 6>those.</v>

988
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like Adam Carolla show was good.</v>

989
00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:19.880
<v Speaker 6>Satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

990
00:44:19.881 --> 00:44:21.890
<v Speaker 6>you would bus people but then they'd fix</v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

991
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.990
<v Speaker 6>He'd bust people that are like shitty</v>
<v Speaker 6>carpenters.</v>

992
00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:27.350
<v Speaker 6>They were really bad contractors are</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing terrible jobs on people's houses.</v>

993
00:44:27.351 --> 00:44:29.300
<v Speaker 6>That's a cool show too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always,</v>

994
00:44:29.301 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 6>when I was a kid I always watched it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this old house with Vila and all that</v>

995
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.630
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

996
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I prefer the positive shows though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

997
00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to watch all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>contractors that are like ripping people</v>

998
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:41.610

<v Speaker 1>But I think that this,</v>

1001
00:44:45.451 --> 00:44:48.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the what the style of show that I like</v>

1002
00:44:48.391 --> 00:44:50.610
<v Speaker 1>is when they take a house and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>redo it.</v>

1003
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:51.481
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the,</v>

1004
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:52.900
<v Speaker 1>those are my favorite ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1005
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:56.730
<v Speaker 1>This show is really cool because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>husband and wife and she's just like a</v>

1006
00:44:56.731 --> 00:44:58.490
<v Speaker 1>bad ass designer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she,</v>

1007
00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.580
<v Speaker 1>she'll take it like just her paint style</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1008
00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:03.690
<v Speaker 1>and like how she makes this stuff is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1009
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.480
<v Speaker 1>very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the these houses and makes you</v>

1010
00:45:06.481 --> 00:45:09.330
<v Speaker 1>depressed living at in La when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I can't buy a house,</v>

1011
00:45:09.331 --> 00:45:12.160
<v Speaker 1>$50,000 anywhere in Los Angeles at all.</v>

1012
00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:12.780
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1013
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.540
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing to see that exists.</v>

1014
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:20.880
<v Speaker 1>If you want to live in the pile spaces</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive cause there's not as much of</v>

1015
00:45:20.881 --> 00:45:22.500
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the craziest thing is New York</v>

1016
00:45:22.501 --> 00:45:24.180
<v Speaker 1>City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know New York City,</v>

<v Speaker 1>million and it's an apartment.</v>

1018

<v Speaker 1>it's an apartment.</v>

1021
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Even apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a great view.</v>

1022
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a great view but it's a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment and it cost $20 million.</v>

1023
00:45:38.731 --> 00:45:39.451
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1024
00:45:39.451 --> 00:45:40.710
<v Speaker 1>How many people are in the building with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>

1025
00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1026
00:45:43.111 --> 00:45:44.100
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1027
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:47.040
<v Speaker 1>You're on the top floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's thousands of people and you're</v>

1028
00:45:47.041 --> 00:45:50.880
<v Speaker 1>all in a giant metal and concrete box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be 20 million police.</v>

1029
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Like why in the fuck are you talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about who wants to live like that?</v>

1030
00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:58.750
<v Speaker 1>If you ever like a pet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it like 1.2 million a month or a pet</v>

1031
00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.300
<v Speaker 1>you nail?</v>

1032
00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.900
<v Speaker 1>You have to pay extra because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't done much.</v>

1033
00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I think you might have exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1034
00:46:03.431 --> 00:46:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're buying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you own it,</v>

1035
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:07.950
<v Speaker 1>but if you're renting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet there's a lot of places that won't</v>

1036
00:46:07.951 --> 00:46:11.220
<v Speaker 1>want to rent if you have a dog because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dog wants a fucking things up,</v>

1037
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs will we bite things and shit on</v>

1038
00:46:15.541 --> 00:46:19.380
<v Speaker 1>places and Piss on things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not supposed to dealing with that</v>

1039
00:46:19.381 --> 00:46:21.720
<v Speaker 1>now it can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1040
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:26.070
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to imagine that that's the</v>

1041
00:46:26.071 --> 00:46:29.130
<v Speaker 1>right way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's exciting as fuck.</v>

1042
00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Living in a giant apartment in New York</v>

1043
00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:34.620
<v Speaker 1>City and deep and everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just overwhelmed by giant</v>

1044
00:46:34.621 --> 00:46:37.500
<v Speaker 1>numbers of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be exciting as fuck.</v>

1045
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.020
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're in the middle of the</v>

1046
00:46:40.021 --> 00:46:45.021
<v Speaker 1>high line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't think that leaves you a</v>

1047
00:46:46.351 --> 00:46:48.990
<v Speaker 1>lot of time for quiet and reflection.</v>

1048
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can force yourself into a room and</v>

1049
00:46:51.841 --> 00:46:54.930
<v Speaker 1>shut the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think this is just a theory,</v>

1050
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:58.200
<v Speaker 1>but I really think we need a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of actual space between each</v>

1051
00:46:58.201 --> 00:46:59.310
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To relax.</v>

1052
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just my feeling.</v>

1053
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.990
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if I go over someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

1054
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:05.070
<v Speaker 1>they live in the country and I go sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>out on their porch.</v>

1055
00:47:05.071 --> 00:47:07.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't I live like us?</v>

1056
00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:09.810
<v Speaker 1>How can we all live like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is how you're supposed to live.</v>

1057
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Like this feels great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you go,</v>

1058
00:47:11.971 --> 00:47:14.370
<v Speaker 1>you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see fucking rolling hills.</v>

1059
00:47:14.371 --> 00:47:17.010
<v Speaker 1>You see birds and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this feels great.</v>

1060
00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Like you see the trees see water</v>
<v Speaker 1>dripping off of him and the sunlight's</v>

1061
00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:23.220
<v Speaker 1>peeking through the leaves and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1062
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.260
<v Speaker 1>this feels so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1063

<v Speaker 1>This piece is done.</v>

1151
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.930
<v Speaker 1>That happens to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't happen out here</v>

1152
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.280
<v Speaker 3>except for in a cryo chamber or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's only one girl never,</v>

1153
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:16.190
<v Speaker 3>and she fell asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a very unfortunate story.</v>

1154
00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.000
<v Speaker 3>She was apparently working there and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>did</v>

1155
00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.210
<v Speaker 1>to herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She looked,</v>

1156
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:22.340
<v Speaker 1>she set the machine up for herself alone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1157
00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.480
<v Speaker 1>she was too short and the nitrogen got</v>
<v Speaker 1>into her lungs.</v>

1158
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:28.150
<v Speaker 1>She's like breathing it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't breathing in air and she</v>

1159
00:51:28.151 --> 00:51:30.010
<v Speaker 1>blacked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horrible,</v>

1160
00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:31.660
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible story.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1163
00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a way to die.</v>

1164
00:51:36.761 --> 00:51:41.290
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frozen to death at a cryo chamber.</v>

1165
00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:44.680
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen this map going around?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

1166
00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:47.120
<v Speaker 3>there's this little county right here is</v>
<v Speaker 3>Los Angeles.</v>

1167
00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more people in this county then</v>

1168
00:51:49.761 --> 00:51:52.790
<v Speaker 3>these other 41 states together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not combined,</v>

1169
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 3>but each of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of them are,</v>

1170
00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.740

<v Speaker 3>That's craziness.</v>

1172
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:03.440
<v Speaker 3>I think that's only with the 10 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1173
00:52:03.441 --> 00:52:05.140
<v Speaker 3>official population counts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We're a mad Hubba people sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:52:06.891 --> 00:52:09.830

<v Speaker 3>The 526 square miles,</v>

1176
00:52:09.831 --> 00:52:11.630
<v Speaker 3>which isn't even that big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

1177
00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:13.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean it looks big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we keep talking.</v>

1178
00:52:13.731 --> 00:52:15.230
<v Speaker 3>Where are we going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where are we going?</v>

1179
00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Where do we go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if we're going to bust a move.</v>

1180
00:52:18.421 --> 00:52:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I say Seattle still need good</v>

1181
00:52:20.191 --> 00:52:21.100
<v Speaker 1>internet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1182
00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:23.850
<v Speaker 1>So now it might be the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

1183
00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Cause you get like a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weather.</v>

1184
00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.513
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey bitch,</v>

1185
00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.960

<v Speaker 1>You better appreciate June.</v>

1186
00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better appreciate July because</v>

1187
00:52:30.361 --> 00:52:32.670
<v Speaker 1>November is going to roll around just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it did last year and everyone's</v>

1188
00:52:32.671 --> 00:52:34.050
<v Speaker 1>going to be depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1189
00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

1190
00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:39.300
<v Speaker 1>So if you go out in Seattle in like</v>
<v Speaker 1>August people,</v>

1191
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.550
<v Speaker 3>what about Oregon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's in between the,</v>

1192
00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.990
<v Speaker 3>the mother hubs of Google and Amazon are</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad spot right between them.</v>

1193
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.080
<v Speaker 3>I think the move is Eugene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We move in next to Dan Carlin and</v>

1194
00:52:50.081 --> 00:52:51.930
<v Speaker 3>Cameron Hanes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Climb that mountain,</v>

1195
00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:53.790
<v Speaker 3>climb that mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all Santa Barbara,</v>

1196
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.240

<v Speaker 3>good guy.</v>

1197
00:52:57.330 --> 00:53:01.680
<v Speaker 3>That's a good God damn spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like la light and has good wine and</v>

1198
00:53:01.681 --> 00:53:03.420
<v Speaker 3>places to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:53:03.421 --> 00:53:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1200
00:53:05.101 --> 00:53:07.350
<v Speaker 3>I like Santa Barbara to chill beach to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1201
00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Go to that beach people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super friendly.</v>

1202
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Cute Zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh damn man,</v>

1203
00:53:11.671 --> 00:53:14.610
<v Speaker 3>that's a good spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Santa Barbara might be the perfect spot.</v>

1204
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:17.160
<v Speaker 3>It's a good spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

1205
00:53:17.161 --> 00:53:20.250
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have told everybody you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to run out there</v>

1206
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:24.330
<v Speaker 3>and Barbara Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they promise Seattle is the,</v>

1207
00:53:24.331 --> 00:53:27.450
<v Speaker 3>you know like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're from Ohio where it's gray sky</v>

1208
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:30.060
<v Speaker 3>every day and Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be kind of like</v>

1209
00:53:30.061 --> 00:53:33.330
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's way too many gray skies.</v>

1210
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:34.223
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing though,</v>

1211
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:37.670
<v Speaker 1>are you willing to trade some grace guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>for cooler people?</v>

1212
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:40.630
<v Speaker 1>The thing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying everybody in Seattle</v>

1213
00:53:40.631 --> 00:53:43.070
<v Speaker 1>is cooler than everybody in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love people in La.</v>

1214
00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:46.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're getting a kind of,</v>

1215
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:48.830
<v Speaker 1>this is just my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this might not be right,</v>

1216
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:54.020
<v Speaker 1>but I have a feeling that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you develop more character in an</v>

1217
00:53:54.021 --> 00:53:57.230
<v Speaker 1>environment where your comfort is</v>
<v Speaker 1>tested.</v>

1218
00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I think if you live in a cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment where it's cold in the</v>

1219
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.691
<v Speaker 1>winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you live in,</v>

1220
00:54:02.691 --> 00:54:05.280
<v Speaker 1>where would it really rains and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>soaked and you,</v>

1221
00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:10.100
<v Speaker 1>you hear the thunder outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The [inaudible] is a humbling to that</v>

1222
00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:15.290
<v Speaker 1>experience that people that live in la</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't fucking get.</v>

1223
00:54:15.291 --> 00:54:18.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the reasons why people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of these other states get</v>

1224
00:54:18.561 --> 00:54:21.650
<v Speaker 1>annoyed at some of the attitudes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in La have.</v>

1225
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:25.820
<v Speaker 1>It's because you were not experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything other than traffic.</v>

1226
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Like these people get snowed on every</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

1227
00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Every year they're digging themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1228
00:54:31.941 --> 00:54:32.661
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1229
00:54:32.661 --> 00:54:33.740
<v Speaker 1>well what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

1230
00:54:33.741 --> 00:54:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm stuck in traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1231
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Like she don't have any constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one day it got too hot and you had</v>

1232
00:54:40.881 --> 00:54:42.650
<v Speaker 1>to turn the fan on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1233
00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.020
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be okay.</v>

1234
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Just drink water and go buy ice at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>store like you're going to live.</v>

1235
00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Even if it sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna sweat a lot.</v>

1236
00:54:51.411 --> 00:54:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Drink a lot of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to live.</v>

1237
00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:54.770
<v Speaker 1>It's 110 stay inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay in the shade.</v>

1238
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:56.630
<v Speaker 1>You're going to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to suck,</v>

1239
00:54:56.631 --> 00:55:00.200
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not live if you're living in</v>

1240
00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Chicago and you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your old lady and your power goes</v>

1241
00:55:04.311 --> 00:55:06.020
<v Speaker 1>out and you're stuck in your house.</v>

1242
00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.420
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Traffic,</v>

1243
00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:09.330
<v Speaker 3>but that traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see the traffic last night of</v>

1244
00:55:09.331 --> 00:55:11.160
<v Speaker 3>everyone coming home?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just as bad.</v>

1245
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:13.230
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

1246
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1247
00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:16.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a video and it says Thanksgiving</v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic,</v>

1248
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five freeway at a complete</v>

1249
00:55:19.641 --> 00:55:24.641
<v Speaker 1>standstill and it is fucking miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean miles and miles and miles of</v>

1250
00:55:26.601 --> 00:55:29.600
<v Speaker 1>people that look at the going five miles</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour in either direction</v>

1251
00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:34.140
<v Speaker 3>and when Satan is red because of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rear lights and the other one's white</v>

1252
00:55:34.141 --> 00:55:35.850
<v Speaker 3>because of the headline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was just telling me when I'm weird.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm up for Seattle or Santa Barbara.</v>

1258
00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we should go to Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1259
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.830
<v Speaker 3>I would go right next to where the walls</v>
<v Speaker 3>being built.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I know it doesn't,</v>

1264
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.651
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

1265
00:56:01.651 --> 00:56:04.230
<v Speaker 3>Can I think about Denver's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Super Fun.</v>

1266
00:56:04.231 --> 00:56:04.980
<v Speaker 3>Flexible.</v>

1267
00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Denver will go to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get nine degrees for a few days and</v>

1268
00:56:07.981 --> 00:56:12.090
<v Speaker 1>then there'll be 60 it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because you're like way up</v>

1269
00:56:12.091 --> 00:56:12.781
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1270
00:56:12.781 --> 00:56:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're literally at a mile high.</v>

1271
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I think Denver is 5,000 feet above sea</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

1272
00:56:17.521 --> 00:56:19.920
<v Speaker 1>5,500 it's exactly a mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1273
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:20.803
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1274
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a very high city when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about a lot of other</v>

1275
00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:29.341
<v Speaker 1>words too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting place man.</v>

1276
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different spot cause like Denver,</v>

1277
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:40.960
<v Speaker 1>either they're in this weird like</v>
<v Speaker 1>combination world,</v>

1278
00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:42.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the way I put Denver.</v>

1279
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Like you have a city that's like a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

1280
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:47.860
<v Speaker 1>You have the comedy works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best comedy clubs in the</v>

1281
00:56:47.861 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to,</v>

1282
00:56:49.211 --> 00:56:52.030
<v Speaker 1>comedy works there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have an Improv there too.</v>

1283
00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Don't they have a Denver Improv?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1284
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of I improv everywhere.</v>

1285
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Those fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out there.</v>

1286
00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.940
<v Speaker 1>They're constantly bringing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing the funny to the people.</v>

1287
00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1288
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:04.360
<v Speaker 1>they're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end probes are everywhere.</v>

1289
00:57:04.361 --> 00:57:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Denver has like everything that it</v>

1290
00:57:07.781 --> 00:57:11.980
<v Speaker 1>has restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has like a real urban life.</v>

1291
00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:14.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a real cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real buildings and shit.</v>

1292
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.430
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right next to the God damn rocket</v>

1293
00:57:17.431 --> 00:57:19.690
<v Speaker 1>mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you look out the window,</v>

1294
00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:23.980
<v Speaker 1>like we were just there the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and Tony did a Gig at the Belko and</v>

1295
00:57:23.981 --> 00:57:24.850
<v Speaker 1>we were driving home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1296
00:57:24.851 --> 00:57:25.684
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

1297
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:27.910
<v Speaker 1>That's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the rocky mountains.</v>

1298
00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:31.210
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these fucking people are staring at</v>

1299
00:57:31.211 --> 00:57:33.310
<v Speaker 1>the continental divide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1300
00:57:33.311 --> 00:57:36.670
<v Speaker 1>they're just looking at the rocky</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains.</v>

1301
00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:39.640
<v Speaker 1>You could just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could drive up to the top of the</v>

1302
00:57:39.641 --> 00:57:43.840
<v Speaker 1>hills like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up near Nederland and shit like that and</v>

1303
00:57:43.841 --> 00:57:45.850
<v Speaker 1>see these like quaint towns.</v>

1304
00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:48.370
<v Speaker 1>It's still exists on dirt roads into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>woods.</v>

1305
00:57:48.371 --> 00:57:49.790
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1306
00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1307
00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably did Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the only place that had</v>

1308
00:57:55.721 --> 00:57:57.760
<v Speaker 1>snow I would move to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the spot.</v>

1309
00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:01.150
<v Speaker 1>I think Denver's a spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just seattle.</v>

1310
00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.700
<v Speaker 1>My go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My go with a good quake.</v>

1311
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good and quick volcano mount.</v>

1312
00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1313
00:58:07.541 --> 00:58:12.541
<v Speaker 1>The volcano could blow and if Mount</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saint Helens volcano could blow tsunami.</v>

1314
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:18.100
<v Speaker 1>There was some tsunami shit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seattle that was in the newspaper for</v>

1315
00:58:18.110 --> 00:58:21.790
<v Speaker 1>years ago that was actually causing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop in real estate in Seattle.</v>

1316
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Cause people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1317
00:58:23.831 --> 00:58:27.790
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they were talking about how someday</v>

1318
00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:31.630
<v Speaker 1>the next hundred years a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake and tsunami is going to level</v>

1319
00:58:31.631 --> 00:58:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

1320
00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:37.480
<v Speaker 1>you can't just say that I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell my house,</v>

1321
00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.500
<v Speaker 1>the disaster waiting to happen at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>northwest.</v>

1322
00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find the article.</v>

1323
00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Like the article was something about con</v>
<v Speaker 1>dammit.</v>

1324
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.840
<v Speaker 1>If I can remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake in soon.</v>

1326
00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:54.710
<v Speaker 1>What does it look?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Natural disaster danger zone.</v>

1327
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Experts,</v>

1328
00:58:59.621 --> 00:59:01.390
<v Speaker 1>they've uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the really big one,</v>

1329
00:59:01.391 --> 00:59:04.900
<v Speaker 1>here's what will actually happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be it anyway,</v>

1330
00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:09.130
<v Speaker 1>point being scared the fuck out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody because it was one of those</v>

1331
00:59:09.131 --> 00:59:13.120
<v Speaker 1>stories that was kind of like one person</v>
<v Speaker 1>reported on it and then it went around,</v>

1332
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:15.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know those like you get them on dig</v>

1333
00:59:15.761 --> 00:59:17.860
<v Speaker 1>or something like that and you and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to twitter,</v>

1334
00:59:17.861 --> 00:59:19.810
<v Speaker 1>someone will have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be linked to another website.</v>

1335
00:59:19.811 --> 00:59:20.920
<v Speaker 1>You can go and check and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1336
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1337
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:22.650
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this really happening?</v>

1338
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Seattle go on under what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1339
00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:27.560
<v Speaker 1>out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1340
00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.940
<v Speaker 1>in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might lose Seattle.</v>

1341
00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.340
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's think,</v>

1342
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:33.440
<v Speaker 1>get off the list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much are you scared of bears,</v>

1343
00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:36.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1344
00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you're not scared of bears,</v>

1345
00:59:38.811 --> 00:59:41.960
<v Speaker 1>the move is Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana is the move.</v>

1346
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:43.640
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause Montana's like Denver.</v>

1347
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Well with less people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you got an airport.</v>

1348
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:49.130
<v Speaker 1>If you're willing to give up a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got an airport you can get out.</v>

1349
00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to give up an extra day though</v>

1350
00:59:51.441 --> 00:59:53.330
<v Speaker 1>for travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you've got to get out and fly</v>

1351
00:59:53.331 --> 00:59:55.550
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and then from there you fly</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1352
00:59:55.551 --> 00:59:58.220
<v Speaker 1>And so like the odds are you doing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>show that night?</v>

1353
00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.830
<v Speaker 1>You can really probably couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd probably have to leave Thursday</v>

1354
01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:03.650
<v Speaker 1>for a Friday night show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you get back the same day?</v>

1355
01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Same weather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1356
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:09.140
<v Speaker 1>but bears like the big kind of now I</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of knew people,</v>

1357

1360
01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:22.280

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a great place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1409
01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>He's a California guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the lips on that thing.</v>

1410
01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1411
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.040
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that woman's supposed to be?</v>

1412
01:02:23.041 --> 01:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>She had a demon or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a skull.</v>

1413
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing when you zoom in on it and</v>

1414
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>see how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how good the details are,</v>

1415
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>these incredible style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1416
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's so many really good</v>

1417
01:02:34.621 --> 01:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>tattoo artists now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1418
01:02:35.821 --> 01:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>this is a weird time for the art form</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

1419
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess probably a lot of those tattoo</v>

1420
01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:42.980
<v Speaker 1>shows in specific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1421
01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>they made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like more people understand it</v>

1422
01:02:46.831 --> 01:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>more as an art form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1423
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:53.600
<v Speaker 1>like give more like legit worldclass</v>
<v Speaker 1>artists worldclass word way to put it.</v>

1424
01:02:53.761 --> 01:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>But legit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talented,</v>

1425
01:02:55.681 --> 01:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>super talented artists that decided to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become tattoo artists,</v>

1426
01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.513
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1427
01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.810
<v Speaker 5>See this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it,</v>

1428
01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:04.750
<v Speaker 5>temporary tattoo printer on your arm</v>
<v Speaker 5>machine?</v>

1429
01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:06.241
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

1430
01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:07.930
<v Speaker 5>not to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that lasts as long as</v>

1431
01:03:07.931 --> 01:03:09.970
<v Speaker 5>like a temporary tattoo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which isn't very long at all.</v>

1432
01:03:09.971 --> 01:03:11.680
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1433
01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.770
<v Speaker 5>at full color and probably just works</v>
<v Speaker 5>off a jpeg or something.</v>

1434
01:03:14.771 --> 01:03:17.080
<v Speaker 5>So you could try out then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long does it last for?</v>

1435
01:03:17.081 --> 01:03:18.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was guessing as long as the temporary</v>

1436
01:03:18.911 --> 01:03:20.560
<v Speaker 5>tattoo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like it's a little bit</v>

1437
01:03:20.561 --> 01:03:22.310
<v Speaker 5>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a stamp that says,</v>

1438
01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:23.180
<v Speaker 5>they might say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1439
01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.273
<v Speaker 5>better</v>

<v Speaker 1>Design your own tattoo on the APP.</v>

1441

<v Speaker 6>They're trying to get these kids to</v>

1443
01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.060
<v Speaker 6>accept the numbers when they come and</v>
<v Speaker 6>collect the all for camps.</v>

<v Speaker 6>the time.</v>

1452
01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:59.460
<v Speaker 6>That's what Alex Jones needs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He just needs me to go,</v>

<v Speaker 6>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stop.</v>

1456
01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.860
<v Speaker 6>That might not be it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people need a rudder.</v>

1457
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.470
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1458
01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:08.100
<v Speaker 6>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I'm your rudder,</v>

1459
01:04:08.101 --> 01:04:11.820
<v Speaker 6>you've got a serious fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got a serious fucking problem.</v>

1460
01:04:11.821 --> 01:04:14.830
<v Speaker 6>I was hoping that flat earth or what's</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to like the rock.</v>

1461
01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.530
<v Speaker 6>I was waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was so excited for this.</v>

1462
01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:22.050
<v Speaker 6>He's done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He shot himself like 160 miles into</v>

1463
01:04:22.051 --> 01:04:24.240
<v Speaker 6>space or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not really.</v>

1464
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:26.311
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he did.</v>

1465
01:04:26.311 --> 01:04:29.880
<v Speaker 6>I think he did shoot himself like 1.6</v>
<v Speaker 6>miles into the air.</v>

1466
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.000
<v Speaker 6>Something ridiculous in the past and he</v>
<v Speaker 6>recovered.</v>

1467
01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:36.990
<v Speaker 6>Took him like several days to recover</v>
<v Speaker 6>from the g forces.</v>

1468
01:04:36.991 --> 01:04:39.570
<v Speaker 6>I do believe that this is something that</v>
<v Speaker 6>was in the article.</v>

1469
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.640
<v Speaker 6>It might be something he said.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He might just be crazy.</v>

1470
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:43.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's trying to be like evil knievel.</v>

1471
01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.710
<v Speaker 5>He was trying to do a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 5>things and he jumped onto the flat earth</v>

1472
01:04:46.711 --> 01:04:48.520
<v Speaker 5>thing about a year ago to gain money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1473
01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:49.523
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1474
01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.830
<v Speaker 5>he's trying to like jump a limo over a</v>
<v Speaker 5>boards,</v>

1475
01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.810
<v Speaker 5>some dumb shit like that.</v>

1476
01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.120
<v Speaker 6>Well no one believes it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Come in.</v>

1477
01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:55.891
<v Speaker 6>How do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1478
01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:57.840
<v Speaker 6>do yes they do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a bitch.</v>

1479
01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:00.410
<v Speaker 5>I read the article about it when it</v>
<v Speaker 5>first was coming out last week.</v>

1480
01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

1481
01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:03.230
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read one of the craziest fucking</v>

1482
01:05:03.231 --> 01:05:06.320
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone said one of the flat earth</v>

1483
01:05:06.321 --> 01:05:08.780
<v Speaker 1>proponents said about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1484
01:05:08.781 --> 01:05:10.820
<v Speaker 1>this is going around apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forgive me,</v>

1485
01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>forgive me if you've heard this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that a ship doesn't really</v>

1486
01:05:16.341 --> 01:05:20.800
<v Speaker 1>disappear over the horizon do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can always zoom in on it if you just</v>

1487
01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>have enough of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a powerful lens on your camera.</v>

1488
01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>So they think that that in some way is</v>
<v Speaker 1>proof that the earth is flat.</v>

1489
01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>That's just proof of how far you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

1490
01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:34.870
<v Speaker 1>It's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He likes,</v>

1491
01:05:34.871 --> 01:05:38.650
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the curve of the earth.</v>

1492
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.710
<v Speaker 1>It takes forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking huge.</v>

1493
01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get what people are doing.</v>

1494
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Like who come if you zoom out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see,</v>

1495
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>well you can't forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why he can't see Mt.</v>

1496
01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Kilimanjaro from your fucking living</v>
<v Speaker 1>room in Santa Monica.</v>

1497
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Dip Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1498
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a curve to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just takes a long ass time and you</v>

1499
01:05:57.371 --> 01:06:01.480
<v Speaker 1>can't see the boat long before it goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the curb because unless you're</v>

1500
01:06:01.481 --> 01:06:05.830
<v Speaker 1>talking about a giant ass boat and even</v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant ass boat at 30 miles away,</v>

1501
01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:09.760
<v Speaker 1>which is what you still be able to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it that's too far for your eyes.</v>

1502
01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:13.840
<v Speaker 1>So if you zoom in with some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy spotting scope or something like</v>

1503
01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:14.411
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1504
01:06:14.411 --> 01:06:17.740
<v Speaker 1>you'll be able to see it for a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>while and then in another couple of</v>

1505
01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.860
<v Speaker 1>hours it would be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to go over the topic,</v>

1506
01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:25.160
<v Speaker 1>but they want it to be real so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want it to be real so bad that they</v>

1507
01:06:26.201 --> 01:06:29.710
<v Speaker 1>come up with these things that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>true as examples.</v>

1508
01:06:29.711 --> 01:06:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Why the earth is flat and the big one</v>
<v Speaker 1>was know there's how come every photo of</v>

1509
01:06:33.371 --> 01:06:35.050
<v Speaker 1>the earth from space is a composite.</v>

1510
01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:38.860
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even bother to look into it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's not true.</v>

1511
01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:43.630
<v Speaker 1>If there's a fucking satellite that</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a high resolution photo of the</v>

1512
01:06:43.631 --> 01:06:45.700
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like every 10 minutes,</v>

1513
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:48.160
<v Speaker 1>so the him Awori eight to Japanese</v>
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

1514
01:06:48.161 --> 01:06:50.740
<v Speaker 1>You could go online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could look at the pictures.</v>

1515
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:55.720
<v Speaker 1>It shows where every fucking storm cloud</v>
<v Speaker 1>is all over the country in real time.</v>

1516
01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.570
<v Speaker 1>So if there's a storm that's hitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

1517
01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:01.450
<v Speaker 1>you go to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at that image from that day</v>

1518
01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:03.280
<v Speaker 1>where the storm's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see the fucking storm,</v>

1519
01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.180
<v Speaker 1>like it's all real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't believe that's real.</v>

1520
01:07:07.181 --> 01:07:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe that someone is so good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at hiding shit that they've kept all the</v>

1521
01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:14.770
<v Speaker 1>images of the flat earth from ever being</v>
<v Speaker 1>published,</v>

1522
01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.800
<v Speaker 1>that no one has been able to treat in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of people,</v>

1523
01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:21.640
<v Speaker 1>it's been able to travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass the ice wall and to the Nether</v>

1524
01:07:21.641 --> 01:07:24.520
<v Speaker 1>region of hobbits and gnomes and pixies</v>
<v Speaker 1>elves.</v>

1525
01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:27.730
<v Speaker 1>It's just mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1526
01:07:27.731 --> 01:07:30.520
<v Speaker 1>we have a huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lack of education,</v>

1527
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:34.510
<v Speaker 1>lack of education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's also being committed to</v>

1528
01:07:34.511 --> 01:07:36.730
<v Speaker 1>these ideas to the point where they're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of you.</v>

1529
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:40.330
<v Speaker 1>It's Aye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's idea identity,</v>

1530
01:07:40.331 --> 01:07:42.190
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what it is.</v>

1531
01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:45.640
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you believe in an idea so much that</v>

1532
01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:48.010
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've been guilty of this and I think</v>

1533
01:07:48.011 --> 01:07:51.850
<v Speaker 1>everybody has at one point in your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been guilty of not really looking</v>

1534
01:07:51.851 --> 01:07:54.610
<v Speaker 1>at it for what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead looking at it for what you</v>

1535
01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:58.320
<v Speaker 1>want it to be and for what you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>already committed yourself to believing</v>

1536
01:07:58.321 --> 01:08:00.280
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of the problem.</v>

1537
01:08:00.281 --> 01:08:03.700
<v Speaker 1>A big part of the problem with people is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you commit yourself to believing in</v>

1538
01:08:03.701 --> 01:08:05.950
<v Speaker 1>something and then when you commit</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to believe me,</v>

1539
01:08:05.951 --> 01:08:08.650
<v Speaker 1>it's something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's contrary to that belief</v>

1540
01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.800
<v Speaker 1>gets fought viciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shut it down,</v>

1541
01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.990
<v Speaker 1>you into robbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By all means necessary.</v>

1542
01:08:13.991 --> 01:08:15.740
<v Speaker 1>You mock it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you deride it.</v>

1543
01:08:15.741 --> 01:08:19.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't examine it objectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He don't look at it objectively.</v>

1544
01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:20.690
<v Speaker 1>You just look for a way to shoot it</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

1545
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.820
<v Speaker 1>look for a way to shit on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look for way,</v>

1546
01:08:22.821 --> 01:08:25.850
<v Speaker 1>if in any fallback on the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>lies all the time.</v>

1547
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I never believed that fall back on all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these different positions,</v>

1548
01:08:28.161 --> 01:08:29.270
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>

1549
01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.020
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1550
01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.080
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it from just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1551
01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:36.090
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the most likely thing?</v>

1552
01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.820
<v Speaker 1>The most likely thing is it's round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured it out.</v>

1553
01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:40.740
<v Speaker 1>They know it's round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see it from space.</v>

1554
01:08:40.741 --> 01:08:43.380
<v Speaker 1>They've taken pictures of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have absolutely flying in the</v>

1555
01:08:43.381 --> 01:08:46.470
<v Speaker 1>space station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's videos of the fucking the thing</v>

1556
01:08:46.471 --> 01:08:50.370
<v Speaker 1>landing on the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People pulling people out of the water.</v>

1557
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:52.440
<v Speaker 1>They they've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've gone into space.</v>

1558
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've taken pictures.</v>

1559
01:08:53.701 --> 01:08:55.350
<v Speaker 1>This is all real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's satellites.</v>

1560
01:08:55.351 --> 01:08:57.720
<v Speaker 1>They're real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get satellite radio,</v>

1561
01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:59.340
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1562
01:08:59.341 --> 01:09:01.800
<v Speaker 1>It's really from a satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get direct tv,</v>

1563
01:09:01.801 --> 01:09:03.630
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in space.</v>

1564
01:09:03.631 --> 01:09:08.220
<v Speaker 1>It's orbiting the fucking earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's flight patterns that are</v>

1565
01:09:08.221 --> 01:09:12.630
<v Speaker 1>carefully calculated that are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the earth.</v>

1566
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would have to be lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand how crazy it is?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Angry little pricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call me a shill.</v>

<v Speaker 1>votes and I have one done by Christmas</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're very soft cotton.</v>

1581
01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:03.970
<v Speaker 1>It feels wonderful on this camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1582
01:10:03.971 --> 01:10:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it's almost like a troll man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

1583
01:10:06.791 --> 01:10:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I used to think that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It started out as a troll.</v>

1584
01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.450
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it became an exercise in</v>

1585
01:10:13.451 --> 01:10:16.790
<v Speaker 1>psychology from what I've understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of understood,</v>

1586
01:10:16.791 --> 01:10:20.530
<v Speaker 1>and I might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from what little I've done poking</v>

1587
01:10:20.531 --> 01:10:24.250
<v Speaker 1>around about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it's might've started on</v>

1588
01:10:24.251 --> 01:10:29.050
<v Speaker 1>four Chan and it might've started as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke that there's always been a certain</v>

1589
01:10:29.051 --> 01:10:32.410
<v Speaker 1>percentage of people that believed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world was flat.</v>

1590
01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:35.770
<v Speaker 1>There's always a certain percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like there's a certain percentage</v>

1591
01:10:35.771 --> 01:10:36.604
<v Speaker 1>of moonies.</v>

1592
01:10:36.850 --> 01:10:39.690
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain percentage of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know are Satan,</v>

1593
01:10:39.691 --> 01:10:40.870
<v Speaker 1>watch Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just,</v>

1594
01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:44.980
<v Speaker 1>there's wacky beliefs and people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to these wacky beliefs and they</v>

1595
01:10:44.981 --> 01:10:46.580
<v Speaker 1>fucking clean tim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

1596
01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:49.090
<v Speaker 1>and to say in whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1597
01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:52.000
<v Speaker 1>whatever the belief is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain percentage of people</v>

1598
01:10:52.001 --> 01:10:53.290
<v Speaker 1>that have always thought the earth was</v>
<v Speaker 1>flat,</v>

1599
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:58.590
<v Speaker 1>but then what I read was it someone on</v>
<v Speaker 1>four chance started trolling and that by</v>

1600
01:10:58.961 --> 01:11:03.010
<v Speaker 1>trolling and trying to post this fake</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence about the world being flat,</v>

1601
01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:07.510
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people bought it and they ran</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it and not only do they run with</v>

1602
01:11:07.511 --> 01:11:09.160
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started to ramp it up and add</v>

1603
01:11:09.161 --> 01:11:13.080
<v Speaker 1>things to it and flat earth theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>became a thing and these people all</v>

1604
01:11:13.081 --> 01:11:15.540
<v Speaker 1>decided that this was like a legitimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit.</v>

1605
01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:18.330
<v Speaker 1>That there is some Illuminati,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some group of Jews.</v>

1606
01:11:18.331 --> 01:11:22.200
<v Speaker 1>It's always Jews that are hiding all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>information that somehow or another</v>

1607
01:11:22.201 --> 01:11:23.730
<v Speaker 1>they've talked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the map makers,</v>

1608
01:11:23.731 --> 01:11:25.380
<v Speaker 1>all the people that work in commercial</v>
<v Speaker 1>shipping,</v>

1609
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.180
<v Speaker 1>all the people that are flying</v>
<v Speaker 1>airplanes,</v>

1610
01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:29.070
<v Speaker 1>all the people that are making</v>
<v Speaker 1>satellites.</v>

1611
01:11:29.071 --> 01:11:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Anyone in aerospace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these fucking people,</v>

1612
01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:36.360
<v Speaker 1>all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people are all together and</v>

1613
01:11:36.361 --> 01:11:37.560
<v Speaker 1>they're all lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1614
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:38.580
<v Speaker 1>And I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am too.</v>

1615
01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe just listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're chasing you're fucking tail</v>

1616
01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.170
<v Speaker 1>and you confuse the shit out of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are dumber than you because</v>

1617
01:11:46.171 --> 01:11:50.850
<v Speaker 1>of your inability to look at what it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus what you want it to be.</v>

1618
01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:57.780
<v Speaker 1>You heard me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not writing about everything.</v>

1619
01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking,</v>

1620
01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:03.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm right about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking reason why someone</v>

1621
01:12:03.091 --> 01:12:05.760
<v Speaker 1>would lie about the shape of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no benefit in it.</v>

1622
01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:09.960
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason why anybody would</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceal that information.</v>

1623
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:14.370
<v Speaker 1>There's no benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone found out the earth was flat,</v>

1624
01:12:14.371 --> 01:12:17.490
<v Speaker 1>they would be fucking singing it from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rooftops.</v>

1625
01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:22.440
<v Speaker 1>And he real scientist and he real person</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been in the space station and he</v>

1626
01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:25.140
<v Speaker 1>real person flying a space shuttle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're real.</v>

1627
01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I know you're a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know him.</v>

1628
01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:28.620
<v Speaker 1>I've met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had that,</v>

1629
01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:30.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Conrad Guy.</v>

1630
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Is that his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Hadfield.</v>

1631
01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Chris Hatfield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot his fucking name.</v>

1632
01:12:33.121 --> 01:12:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Commander Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I blamed the weed.</v>

1633
01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Chris Hadfield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was wonderful.</v>

1634
01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:39.840
<v Speaker 1>He was in space for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's talking about the effects of it</v>

1635
01:12:39.841 --> 01:12:43.140
<v Speaker 1>when he came down and how it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bad it fucked up his body.</v>

1636
01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:45.840
<v Speaker 1>That was a fascinating podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember had,</v>

1637
01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I think I got like 40 minutes with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he had to go.</v>

1638
01:12:48.151 --> 01:12:51.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of those quick little</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and he was amazing.</v>

1639
01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:55.050
<v Speaker 1>You're talking to a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been circling the fucking planet in</v>

1640
01:12:55.051 --> 01:12:56.940
<v Speaker 1>a metal box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1641
01:12:56.941 --> 01:12:58.500
<v Speaker 1>let's do it real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

1642
01:12:58.590 --> 01:12:59.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is real.</v>

1643
01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:02.400
<v Speaker 1>This is the reason why your phone works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Understand this.</v>

1644
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:04.860
<v Speaker 1>The people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what's ironic.</v>

1645
01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:09.360
<v Speaker 1>The people that are doubting the highest</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds and the most competent</v>

1646
01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:14.340
<v Speaker 1>technological innovators in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the most competent people are the</v>

1647
01:13:14.341 --> 01:13:17.280
<v Speaker 1>people that are involved in like</v>
<v Speaker 1>aerospace,</v>

1648
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:21.260
<v Speaker 1>airplane construction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jet pack,</v>

1649
01:13:21.261 --> 01:13:24.660
<v Speaker 1>construction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phones,</v>

1650
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:28.800
<v Speaker 1>computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people that are at the top</v>

1651
01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:33.801
<v Speaker 1>of the fucking heap and these apes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are using these devices to say that the</v>

1652
01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:39.060
<v Speaker 1>world is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing just what a massive</v>

1653
01:13:39.061 --> 01:13:42.060
<v Speaker 1>disservice you're doing to the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds that have created the thing that</v>

1654
01:13:42.061 --> 01:13:46.200
<v Speaker 1>you're using to complain with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous idea that someone's hiding</v>

1655
01:13:46.201 --> 01:13:50.550
<v Speaker 1>the information from all the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't want you to know that</v>

1656
01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:52.800
<v Speaker 1>the world is like your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1657
01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:56.970
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to believe big foot's real.</v>

1658
01:13:57.030 --> 01:14:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to believe if you show me some</v>

1659
01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:03.270
<v Speaker 1>fucking half ass big foot footage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch it three,</v>

1660
01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.790
<v Speaker 1>four times in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go one day.</v>

1661
01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:06.331
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

1662
01:14:06.331 --> 01:14:07.164
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1663
01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:09.030
<v Speaker 1>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of parts of the world we</v>

1664
01:14:09.031 --> 01:14:11.260
<v Speaker 1>never go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also more deep in the Congo.</v>

1665
01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1666
01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I want to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also objective.</v>

1667
01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:19.690
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you want to believe the earth is</v>

1668
01:14:19.691 --> 01:14:21.220
<v Speaker 1>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm super sorry,</v>

1669
01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:24.670
<v Speaker 1>but it appears to be round as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like every other planet we've ever</v>

1670
01:14:24.671 --> 01:14:26.290
<v Speaker 1>looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>

1671
01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how crazy would be if earth was</v>
<v Speaker 1>flat.</v>

1672
01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem with this idea.</v>

1673
01:14:30.851 --> 01:14:33.500
<v Speaker 1>You fucking dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the people behind this idea</v>

1674
01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:36.400
<v Speaker 1>believed that it was created by God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on a pizza tray.</v>

1675
01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Like this is part of a religious belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that God made this flat earth and the</v>

1676
01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:46.090
<v Speaker 1>cosmos and it's all about us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is part of it.</v>

1677
01:14:46.091 --> 01:14:47.800
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a connected to your group,</v>

1678
01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Julie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so arrogant with your idea.</v>

1679
01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:52.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking dumb.</v>

1680
01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm smart enough to know the world</v>

1681
01:14:55.411 --> 01:14:57.400
<v Speaker 1>is round crazy assholes.</v>

1682
01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Have you talked about net new Trenton</v>
<v Speaker 2>neutered trouty</v>

1683
01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:05.090
<v Speaker 1>net new neutered and trout trout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1684
01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw mark Cuban saying positive things</v>

1685
01:15:08.301 --> 01:15:10.940
<v Speaker 1>about nick net neutrality and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>really surprised,</v>

1686
01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.040
<v Speaker 1>but then I realized he's a rich old</v>
<v Speaker 1>white guy.</v>

1687
01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.260
<v Speaker 1>And if I was a rich old white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

1688
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:16.730
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't need regulation.</v>

1689
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:19.700
<v Speaker 1>We took care of Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we clean up our own neighborhood.</v>

1690
01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.920
<v Speaker 2>He also has a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no matter how much it costs,</v>

1691
01:15:22.921 --> 01:15:24.120
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1692
01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:26.520
<v Speaker 1>there's that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

1693
01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:28.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was making some arguments and I'm too</v>

1694
01:15:28.981 --> 01:15:30.630
<v Speaker 1>fucking stupid to know what their</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties right.</v>

1695
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.781
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1696
01:15:31.781 --> 01:15:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the arguments against it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think those make the most sense.</v>

1697
01:15:36.150 --> 01:15:39.270
<v Speaker 1>But apparently there's some big business</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and a lot of,</v>

1698
01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I get your hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yolo drove.</v>

1699
01:15:40.841 --> 01:15:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Of course there are those fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>aerosols.</v>

1700
01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:44.640
<v Speaker 1>They never have enough money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>

1701
01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:50.060
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also like you got to let them,</v>

1702
01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.920
<v Speaker 1>you've got to let them do their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1703
01:15:52.921 --> 01:15:55.080
<v Speaker 1>you've got to let them do their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I,</v>

1704
01:15:56.190 --> 01:16:01.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who's right and I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>love to hear a really educated objective</v>

1705
01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:07.260
<v Speaker 1>analysis on whether or not that enhances</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition or hurts it,</v>

1706
01:16:07.410 --> 01:16:09.750
<v Speaker 1>whether or not that's good for business</v>
<v Speaker 1>or bad for it.</v>

1707
01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Most of the stuff that I read says it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad for it,</v>

1708
01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.350
<v Speaker 1>but I need to look at it really closely.</v>

1709
01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:17.730
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely letting them censor the</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet and that's like,</v>

1710
01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.560
<v Speaker 2>like what is the exact restrictions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>

1711
01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1712
01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:24.280
<v Speaker 2>it's up to the ISP to be too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1713
01:16:24.281 --> 01:16:25.930
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want this website?</v>

1714
01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.900
<v Speaker 2>We might give it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said they can start editing stuff.</v>

1715
01:16:28.901 --> 01:16:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Say as an example via Viacom who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>owned by Time Warner or whatever.</v>

1716
01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Cause they like something comes out</v>
<v Speaker 2>against the CEO of time warmer.</v>

1717
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:39.960
<v Speaker 2>They can actually go in and edit the</v>

1720
01:16:44.291 --> 01:16:46.060

<v Speaker 2>like we're China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they don't want you to go to my</v>

1725
01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.780
<v Speaker 1>soft dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading about a Vietnamese blogger</v>

1726
01:16:55.781 --> 01:16:59.290
<v Speaker 1>today who was sentenced for seven years</v>
<v Speaker 1>in jail,</v>

1727
01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:02.320
<v Speaker 1>a 22 year old Vietnamese blogger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1728
01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:05.070
<v Speaker 1>it was in the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1729
01:17:05.230 --> 01:17:08.920
<v Speaker 1>he was writing about an oil spill and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said that he was,</v>

1730
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:11.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking negative and you doing</v>

1731
01:17:11.481 --> 01:17:15.830
<v Speaker 1>propaganda against the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They locked them in jail for seven years</v>

1732
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:21.550
<v Speaker 1>for doing journalism on an oil spill and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for pointing the blame at the government</v>

1733
01:17:22.821 --> 01:17:25.070
<v Speaker 1>or whoever the fuck was responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oil spill.</v>

1734
01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:29.270
<v Speaker 1>She's 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did lockman dl for 10 years because</v>

1735
01:17:29.271 --> 01:17:30.830
<v Speaker 1>somebody wrote an article now a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different one.</v>

1736
01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:32.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a girl.</v>

1737
01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.030
<v Speaker 1>That's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's from earlier in the year I went,</v>

1738
01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:36.250
<v Speaker 1>I went deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1739
01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:38.120
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're locking bloggers up over there.</v>

1740
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam apparently they have great good</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues with like gay rights and you</v>

1741
01:17:45.681 --> 01:17:47.870
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of progressive ideas that we</v>

1742
01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:53.260
<v Speaker 1>subscribe to in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do not tolerate criticism like</v>

1743
01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:58.370
<v Speaker 1>it's apparently in that way very</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian and that if you do</v>

1744
01:17:58.371 --> 01:18:01.040
<v Speaker 1>criticize them in the form of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda,</v>

1745
01:18:01.041 --> 01:18:03.770
<v Speaker 1>like blogs against them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll lock you in a fucking cage for</v>

1746
01:18:03.771 --> 01:18:04.640
<v Speaker 1>like a decade.</v>

1747
01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:07.880
<v Speaker 1>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to really appreciate,</v>

1748
01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:09.130
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the reasons why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1749
01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:11.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if trump understands this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he does,</v>

1750
01:18:11.211 --> 01:18:13.460
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his idea is like,</v>

1751
01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:15.530
<v Speaker 1>you're going against me fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going against you.</v>

1752
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN.</v>

1753
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:20.390
<v Speaker 1>You know I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by just like completely deriding</v>

1754
01:18:20.391 --> 01:18:21.300
<v Speaker 1>them like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

1755
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:26.350
<v Speaker 1>you run this risk of getting to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>position where there's not like this</v>

1756
01:18:28.041 --> 01:18:33.041
<v Speaker 1>objective powerful force that's watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the president and reporting on all</v>

1757
01:18:33.771 --> 01:18:35.180
<v Speaker 1>of his actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1758
01:18:36.490 --> 01:18:40.640
<v Speaker 1>This a chart that I read today though</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a little disturbing and it was</v>

1759
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:45.850
<v Speaker 1>like a truth chart and it was like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times CNN has said things that were</v>

1760
01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:48.950
<v Speaker 1>not true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many times does it have to correct</v>

1761
01:18:48.951 --> 01:18:51.320
<v Speaker 1>itself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many times did they say things that</v>

1762
01:18:51.321 --> 01:18:53.880
<v Speaker 1>are true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1763
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:57.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that,</v>

1764
01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.580
<v Speaker 1>that might have been some horse shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I read,</v>

1765
01:18:58.581 --> 01:18:59.840
<v Speaker 1>but if it was right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1766
01:18:59.841 --> 01:19:01.880
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are They Brung that often?</v>

1767
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:05.360
<v Speaker 6>Any News,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially when it has breaking news</v>

1768
01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.490
<v Speaker 6>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's at least they're correcting</v>

1769
01:19:07.491 --> 01:19:09.560
<v Speaker 6>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where like our president won't correct</v>

1770
01:19:09.561 --> 01:19:10.940
<v Speaker 6>himself in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>True.</v>

1771
01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:11.853
<v Speaker 6>That's good point.</v>

1772
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's what they mean by being</v>

1773
01:19:14.391 --> 01:19:16.070
<v Speaker 1>incorrect and that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1774
01:19:16.071 --> 01:19:18.140
<v Speaker 1>the latest report says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

1775
01:19:18.141 --> 01:19:21.230
<v Speaker 1>see that's just what the latest reports</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the latest report might not be.</v>

1776
01:19:21.231 --> 01:19:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you say the,</v>

1777
01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.120
<v Speaker 1>that's the latest report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not wrong.</v>

1778
01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:29.170
<v Speaker 6>You just don't have the right</v>
<v Speaker 6>information.</v>

1779
01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.730
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think everyone knows that when</v>

1780
01:19:30.731 --> 01:19:32.170
<v Speaker 6>you're watching the news,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1781
01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if something happens like some</v>

1782
01:19:34.241 --> 01:19:35.980
<v Speaker 1>crazy shooter type situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1783
01:19:36.010 --> 01:19:40.180
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just very dangerous when you see</v>

1784
01:19:40.181 --> 01:19:44.200
<v Speaker 1>the president and the free press going</v>
<v Speaker 1>after each other like that.</v>

1785
01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:46.940
<v Speaker 1>So he tweeted today what</v>

1786
01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:50.140
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we should have a contest as to which of</v>

1787
01:19:50.141 --> 01:19:54.190
<v Speaker 6>the networks plus CNN and not including</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fox is the most dishonest,</v>

1788
01:19:54.191 --> 01:19:56.710
<v Speaker 6>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and or distorted and its political</v>

1789
01:19:56.711 --> 01:20:00.340
<v Speaker 6>coverage of your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your favorite president in parentheses.</v>

1790
01:20:00.341 --> 01:20:03.100
<v Speaker 6>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're all bad winter to receive the</v>

1791
01:20:03.101 --> 01:20:06.580
<v Speaker 6>fake news trophy in all caps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's her fucking president.</v>

1792
01:20:06.581 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's so weird.</v>

1793
01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:12.480
<v Speaker 1>This is so weird because here's what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

1794
01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:16.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not weird to think this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to broadcast that,</v>

1795
01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:20.050
<v Speaker 1>to write that down and to put that on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like that.</v>

1796
01:20:20.051 --> 01:20:22.110
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy thought.</v>

1797
01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I think I would like him so much better</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he'd never tweeted like,</v>

1798
01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:29.010
<v Speaker 1>like if we just had news and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1799
01:20:29.011 --> 01:20:31.680
<v Speaker 1>but you're getting to see like we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about this,</v>

1800
01:20:31.681 --> 01:20:34.470
<v Speaker 1>the stress of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is how he's always been</v>

1801
01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:36.660
<v Speaker 1>fires back at people when they fired</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1802
01:20:36.661 --> 01:20:37.860
<v Speaker 1>That's his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1803
01:20:37.861 --> 01:20:40.670
<v Speaker 1>should have known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people's for some reason expected</v>

1804
01:20:40.671 --> 01:20:42.120
<v Speaker 1>them to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once he got in there,</v>

1805
01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:43.081
<v Speaker 1>they expected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1806
01:20:43.081 --> 01:20:44.970
<v Speaker 1>he's just doing it for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just trust me.</v>

1807
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:47.100
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be super cool.</v>

1808
01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:50.610
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried to Bait Bait him yet?</v>

1809
01:20:50.890 --> 01:20:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get to bait him.</v>

1810
01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:53.031
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1811
01:20:53.031 --> 01:20:54.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no desire.</v>

1812
01:20:55.590 --> 01:21:00.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to ever do that to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just looked.</v>

1813
01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:02.880
<v Speaker 1>This is the world that I'm seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1814
01:21:02.881 --> 01:21:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm reporting on what I'm seeing.</v>

1815
01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm a reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a journalist.</v>

1816
01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:11.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing a bunch of like whether</v>

1817
01:21:11.131 --> 01:21:13.660
<v Speaker 1>they're justified or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1818
01:21:13.670 --> 01:21:18.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of this pettiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this all that should be avoided by</v>

1819
01:21:18.271 --> 01:21:22.110
<v Speaker 1>advanced human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's the problem is the lack of</v>

1820
01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:26.190
<v Speaker 1>humor to it all and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the angry pettiness of it all is what's</v>

1821
01:21:26.191 --> 01:21:28.800
<v Speaker 1>most disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not the idea that something wrong with</v>

1822
01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:31.920
<v Speaker 1>this system because if that chart was</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and a wrong a lot and if they're</v>

1823
01:21:31.921 --> 01:21:34.140
<v Speaker 1>wrong about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's there's one thing,</v>

1824
01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:37.020
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that that should be handled as</v>

1825
01:21:37.021 --> 01:21:42.021
<v Speaker 1>always pointing out exactly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically how they were wrong,</v>

1826
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:45.090
<v Speaker 1>how it could have gotten back to them.</v>

1827
01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:48.030
<v Speaker 1>That was the wrong information and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done to correct it.</v>

1828
01:21:48.031 --> 01:21:51.510
<v Speaker 1>If they have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge it and then that's it.</v>

1829
01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what should be done when you're</v>

1830
01:21:53.461 --> 01:21:56.610
<v Speaker 1>in that position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're just a regular dude and you</v>

1831

<v Speaker 1>want to just go on twitter and talk some</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit and you know,</v>

1832
01:22:00.031 --> 01:22:03.150
<v Speaker 1>say the sooner is fucking fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like some firefighters</v>

1833
01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:04.470
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she'd be fired.</v>

1834
01:22:04.471 --> 01:22:07.470
<v Speaker 1>If you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't care that you can say that.</v>

1835
01:22:07.471 --> 01:22:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't bother me when you're the</v>

1836
01:22:09.181 --> 01:22:10.890
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

<v Speaker 1>weird as that seems to say to someone</v>

1839
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:22.200
<v Speaker 1>that like this is a part of the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to set a good example.</v>

1840
01:22:22.201 --> 01:22:23.760
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're setting the tone of the country.</v>

1841
01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:24.930
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

1842
01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Like I wouldn't write that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you write that?</v>

1843
01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:29.640
<v Speaker 1>You write that to somebody's never fake</v>
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>

1844

<v Speaker 1>Trophy exclamation points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So come on.</v>

1845
01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1846
01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:35.940
<v Speaker 1>And whoever let you do that needs to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>you some mushrooms and have you seen as</v>

1847
01:22:35.941 --> 01:22:39.060
<v Speaker 1>boomerangs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a boomerang and his snapchat.</v>

1848
01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have snapchat.</v>

1849
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine though,</v>

1850
01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:45.480
<v Speaker 1>if Tega you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be hilarious if he did.</v>

1851
01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1852
01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:49.750
<v Speaker 1>people get tired of all this anti trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and you know,</v>

1853
01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:51.240
<v Speaker 1>people get tired of just hearing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

1854
01:22:51.241 --> 01:22:53.130
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hurts them.</v>

1855
01:22:53.490 --> 01:22:54.810
<v Speaker 1>But those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of things,</v>

1856
01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:57.960
<v Speaker 1>that's like fuel for the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like he's doing,</v>

1857
01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:01.010
<v Speaker 1>he's doing the work of the people hate</v>
<v Speaker 1>him for him.</v>

1858
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:05.530
<v Speaker 1>He just keeps providing more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous shit.</v>

1859
01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Do you think</v>

1860
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:07.690
<v Speaker 6>trump is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he get mad at him for,</v>

1861
01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.790
<v Speaker 6>do you think trump's a flat earth</v>
<v Speaker 6>earthers no.</v>

1862
01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:13.600
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean some of that probably a look,</v>

1863
01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:15.190
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would like to know what he thinks</v>

1864
01:23:15.191 --> 01:23:17.320
<v Speaker 6>about Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he keeps releasing these documents</v>

1865
01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.050
<v Speaker 6>and I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1866
01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:21.670
<v Speaker 6>and some of these documents are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1867
01:23:21.671 --> 01:23:25.300
<v Speaker 6>they've um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of like,</v>

1868
01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:29.620
<v Speaker 6>one of the ones was about Jack Ruby,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jack Ruby saying the day that Kennedy</v>

1869
01:23:29.621 --> 01:23:33.010
<v Speaker 6>was going to get shot a get ready,</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to see some fireworks today.</v>

1870
01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:37.930
<v Speaker 6>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what did he really say?</v>

1871
01:23:38.290 --> 01:23:40.420
<v Speaker 6>Like how do I know he really said that I</v>
<v Speaker 6>want to know.</v>

1872
01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:41.860
<v Speaker 6>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really owe it.</v>

1873
01:23:41.861 --> 01:23:46.390
<v Speaker 6>But if the FBI got it from a credible</v>
<v Speaker 6>source and that they really believed</v>

1874
01:23:46.391 --> 01:23:49.810
<v Speaker 6>that the problem is like the people that</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jack Ruby was hanging around with some</v>

1875
01:23:49.811 --> 01:23:53.410
<v Speaker 6>crazy stripper is doing like some 1960s</v>
<v Speaker 6>version of speed.</v>

1876
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:54.783
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He told me,</v>

1877
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:56.650
<v Speaker 6>he told me fireworks was going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>happen.</v>

1878
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:59.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then she runs off into the fucking</v>

1879
01:23:59.171 --> 01:24:03.010
<v Speaker 6>forest it where the fuck knows.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe check Ruby just had like a nice</v>

1880
01:24:03.011 --> 01:24:08.011
<v Speaker 6>party surprise party later could have</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to set off president got shot.</v>

1881
01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:13.060
<v Speaker 6>What would be the best evidence that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>would need right now to like know that</v>

1882
01:24:13.061 --> 01:24:14.740
<v Speaker 6>that was true?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good question,</v>

1883
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:17.230
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I've seen people argue that the</v>

1884
01:24:17.231 --> 01:24:21.820
<v Speaker 6>photo of Lee Harvey Oswald is convenient</v>
<v Speaker 6>photo of him in the backyard with a</v>

1885
01:24:21.821 --> 01:24:24.880
<v Speaker 6>rifle in one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a newspaper and the other hand that is</v>

1886
01:24:24.881 --> 01:24:26.590
<v Speaker 6>photo shopped,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not photoshop,</v>

1887
01:24:26.591 --> 01:24:28.930
<v Speaker 6>but photo edited is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it is,</v>

1888
01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:30.940
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it's been proven that it</v>

1889
01:24:30.941 --> 01:24:32.440
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I know that that's a common</v>

1890
01:24:32.441 --> 01:24:35.380
<v Speaker 6>statement and then if people have</v>
<v Speaker 6>broken,</v>

1891
01:24:35.410 --> 01:24:38.980
<v Speaker 6>they've done some analysis on the</v>
<v Speaker 6>photograph and I do not know enough</v>

1892
01:24:38.981 --> 01:24:40.870
<v Speaker 6>about photography to know whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're right.</v>

1893
01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:43.930
<v Speaker 6>The shadows are all off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that they found out that they,</v>

1894
01:24:43.931 --> 01:24:48.931
<v Speaker 6>the magazine did it too for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like at the magazine did it not like the</v>

1895
01:24:49.091 --> 01:24:52.450
<v Speaker 6>government or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I remember it being a</v>

1896
01:24:52.451 --> 01:24:54.910
<v Speaker 6>controversial photo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then I remember someone saying</v>

1897
01:24:54.911 --> 01:24:59.911
<v Speaker 6>recently that they believe it was not</v>
<v Speaker 6>faked and that there was new evidence to</v>

1898
01:24:59.951 --> 01:25:02.620
<v Speaker 6>indicate that it was not fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just the problem with being like a</v>

1899
01:25:03.190 --> 01:25:05.050
<v Speaker 6>surface reader.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1900
01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.000
<v Speaker 6>The one in the far left.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1901
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:10.660
<v Speaker 6>That's a Dallas police reenactment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1902
01:25:10.661 --> 01:25:12.190
<v Speaker 6>How do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're the exact same time?</v>

1903
01:25:12.191 --> 01:25:14.470
<v Speaker 6>You don't have a camera when he was come</v>
<v Speaker 6>on stupid.</v>

1904
01:25:15.130 --> 01:25:18.400
<v Speaker 6>You can't take a photograph as a</v>
<v Speaker 6>reenactment unless you know exactly when</v>

1905
01:25:18.401 --> 01:25:21.840
<v Speaker 6>he took the photograph and you have the</v>
<v Speaker 6>same clouds in the sky and shit cause</v>

1906
01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.710
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess they're trying to like find out</v>

1907
01:25:23.711 --> 01:25:28.360
<v Speaker 6>whether or not that was a real photo or</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it was Lee Harvey Oswald's head</v>

1908
01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:33.660
<v Speaker 6>put on somebody else's body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the body matched his body go to</v>

1909
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:38.080
<v Speaker 6>focusing on his face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't go to this one.</v>

1910
01:25:38.081 --> 01:25:39.580
<v Speaker 6>There's one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's one that's like a better</v>

1911
01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.400
<v Speaker 6>resolution version.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1912
01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:43.240
<v Speaker 6>You go to the one right above it</v>
<v Speaker 6>actually</v>

1913
01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:46.710
<v Speaker 6>without him right there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1914
01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:48.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the photo.</v>

1915
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:53.580
<v Speaker 6>It looks a little off like the head</v>
<v Speaker 6>definitely looks a little weird head.</v>

1916
01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:57.610
<v Speaker 6>I guess the shadows is what they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about.</v>

1917
01:25:57.630 --> 01:26:01.570
<v Speaker 6>The shadow that's coming from the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 6>of his Chin's not the same as what the</v>

1918
01:26:01.571 --> 01:26:02.530
<v Speaker 6>shadow is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>blah,</v>

1919
01:26:02.531 --> 01:26:03.050
<v Speaker 6>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>blah.</v>

1920
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:03.960
<v Speaker 6>On this feet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh no</v>

1921
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.170
<v Speaker 1>ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not smart enough to know whether or</v>

1922
01:26:06.171 --> 01:26:07.880
<v Speaker 1>not that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks okay to me,</v>

1923
01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:11.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's so grainy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at that photo.</v>

1924
01:26:11.091 --> 01:26:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pictures are today.</v>

1925
01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.630
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to check out a girl's tinder</v>

1926
01:26:14.631 --> 01:26:15.380
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

1927
01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:19.120
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you really look like this?</v>

1928
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:22.010
<v Speaker 1>I've seen there's the full wine now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Look,</v>

1929
01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:25.340
<v Speaker 1>look at his feet like zoom out of Louis</v>
<v Speaker 1>is his feet shadows.</v>

1930
01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.600
<v Speaker 1>See what we see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

1931
01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:30.620
<v Speaker 1>See how the shadow is going that way on</v>
<v Speaker 1>his feet and then if you look at his</v>

1932
01:26:30.621 --> 01:26:32.420
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shad is like kinda going to make</v>

1933
01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:34.520
<v Speaker 1>that picture of the smallest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can get the whole picture in there.</v>

1934
01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:36.000
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1935
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.620
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's correct.</v>

1936
01:26:40.770 --> 01:26:43.440
<v Speaker 1>The thing that would make me feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>something was weird</v>

1937
01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:49.280
<v Speaker 1>is just that it's so old that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't really tell whether or not</v>

1938
01:26:49.281 --> 01:26:51.980
<v Speaker 1>someone doctored it and they might have</v>
<v Speaker 1>had reason to doctorate.</v>

1939
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:54.290
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes me think that it might</v>

1940
01:26:54.291 --> 01:26:56.630
<v Speaker 1>be fucked with not the actual picture</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

1941
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:59.960
<v Speaker 1>When I'm looking at the picture itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to find reasons why it was</v>

1942
01:26:59.961 --> 01:27:00.830
<v Speaker 1>fucked with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1943
01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:02.840
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm losing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Half beyond.</v>

1949
01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:18.640
<v Speaker 1>That was jock Louie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was depressed and he made fun of him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm just joking.</v>

1952
01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that guy has great stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that those days,</v>

1953
01:27:26.271 --> 01:27:27.650
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd get away with a lot of shit.</v>

1954
01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:30.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an interesting article that,</v>

1955
01:27:30.261 --> 01:27:31.094
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>

1956
01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:33.260
<v Speaker 1>what's his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David from,</v>

1957
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:36.920
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a a conservative writer,</v>

1958
01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:42.200
<v Speaker 1>New York Times bestselling author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote something about it.</v>

1959
01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember what it was.</v>

1960
01:27:44.210 --> 01:27:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was Richard Nixon's letter to,</v>

1961
01:27:48.710 --> 01:27:49.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>JFK,</v>

1962
01:27:49.611 --> 01:27:53.210
<v Speaker 1>his widow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like heartfelt articulate,</v>

1963
01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:59.320
<v Speaker 1>interesting letter between an opponent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of John F.</v>

1964
01:27:59.870 --> 01:28:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Richard Nixon.</v>

1965
01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:03.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's who he was.</v>

1966
01:28:03.821 --> 01:28:06.370
<v Speaker 1>The opponent of John F.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy wasn't just Richard Nixon,</v>

1967
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:08.800
<v Speaker 1>like they were running against each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1968
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:12.400
<v Speaker 1>And so he writes this like really</v>
<v Speaker 1>heartfelt letter and it's like,</v>

1969
01:28:12.401 --> 01:28:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read it and you'll out.</v>

1970
01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which it,</v>

1971
01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Nixon wasn't as stupid as people want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think he was.</v>

1972
01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:21.370
<v Speaker 1>He was very smart of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just was fucked up.</v>

1973
01:28:23.650 --> 01:28:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I think this job just does it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

1974
01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody gets gets out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one alive.</v>

1975
01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at Donald Trump's hair.</v>

1976
01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:32.530
<v Speaker 1>It's already getting kind of white like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1977
01:28:32.531 --> 01:28:35.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's all painted and who knows what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real car that stuff is.</v>

1978
01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.910
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably all white.</v>

1979
01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:38.200
<v Speaker 1>He's probably just given up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

1980
01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Not going in today like Switzer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's die day.</v>

1981
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:44.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it says cheetos and the couch day.</v>

1982
01:28:44.171 --> 01:28:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you golf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to watch Fox News and they</v>

1983
01:28:46.251 --> 01:28:49.330
<v Speaker 1>gonna tell me on awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just sits there stroking it,</v>

1984
01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:52.450
<v Speaker 1>watching Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox News loves him.</v>

1985
01:28:52.810 --> 01:28:57.790
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to see white one one</v>
<v Speaker 1>network just going full gung Ho we're</v>

1986
01:28:57.791 --> 01:29:00.470
<v Speaker 1>going to go trump all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I supposedly,</v>

1987
01:29:00.490 --> 01:29:02.280
<v Speaker 1>that's why he's getting involved</v>

1988
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:06.060
<v Speaker 6>with that merger of Time Warner or</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever to get rid of CNN or something.</v>

1989
01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:07.140
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so god,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1991
01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:10.240
<v Speaker 6>that's the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1992
01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:13.800
<v Speaker 6>Like Time Magazine's being bought out a</v>
<v Speaker 6>t and t is trying to buy time Warner,</v>

1993
01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:15.960
<v Speaker 6>the whole company or something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>

1994
01:29:15.970 --> 01:29:18.780
<v Speaker 6>these gigantic companies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See the thing is,</v>

1995
01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:22.700
<v Speaker 6>I don't know shit about this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1996

<v Speaker 6>need to know if in some way,</v>

1998
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:33.450
<v Speaker 6>here's the real scary thing that</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone who owns a giant company would</v>

1999
01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:38.370
<v Speaker 6>be able to control their own internet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you would have like a network,</v>

2000
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.490
<v Speaker 6>like you would be on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd be on the verizon Internet thing</v>

2001
01:29:41.491 --> 01:29:43.140
<v Speaker 6>and he'd be on comcast like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2002
01:29:43.141 --> 01:29:44.260
<v Speaker 6>you're on comcast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Shit.</v>

2004
01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what we don't want them.</v>

2005
01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:51.031
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>

2006
01:29:51.031 --> 01:29:53.460
<v Speaker 6>there's an article I tweeted the other</v>
<v Speaker 6>day where on the,</v>

2007
01:29:53.461 --> 01:29:55.340
<v Speaker 6>I think la times or something like that</v>
<v Speaker 6>word,</v>

2008
01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:58.770
<v Speaker 6>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a woman who works for the FCC a row.</v>

2009
01:29:58.800 --> 01:29:59.401
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2010
01:29:59.401 --> 01:30:01.500
<v Speaker 6>please don't let us do this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2011
01:30:01.501 --> 01:30:02.334
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2012
01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:03.880
<v Speaker 6>I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's,</v>

2013
01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:05.850
<v Speaker 6>there's a website you can go to where</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's automated,</v>

2014
01:30:05.851 --> 01:30:09.930
<v Speaker 6>where you can put in your information</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we'll write an email or a letter to</v>

2015
01:30:10.170 --> 01:30:12.180
<v Speaker 6>the FCC.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I recommend doing that.</v>

2016
01:30:12.181 --> 01:30:13.170
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

2017
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:15.680
<v Speaker 6>I think we have like 10 days til they</v>
<v Speaker 6>vote on this.</v>

2018
01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:16.910
<v Speaker 6>That's what's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is this,</v>

2019
01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.470
<v Speaker 6>this should be something cause this is a</v>
<v Speaker 6>very important issue.</v>

2020
01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:22.710
<v Speaker 6>This should be something that's debated</v>
<v Speaker 6>on prime time television.</v>

2021
01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:23.830
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It needs to,</v>

2022
01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:26.160
<v Speaker 6>it really should be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean all of these kind of really</v>

2023
01:30:26.190 --> 01:30:27.590
<v Speaker 6>crucial,</v>
<v Speaker 6>crucial,</v>

2024
01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:30.390
<v Speaker 6>this is where you stop listening to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>her shoulder memory,</v>

2025
01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:34.230
<v Speaker 6>all of these crucial issues,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they should all be discussed in the,</v>

2026
01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:37.740
<v Speaker 6>like the public forum.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They should be discussed in like the,</v>

2027
01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:41.850
<v Speaker 6>the center of the town.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what the show should be like.</v>

2028
01:30:41.850 --> 01:30:43.920
<v Speaker 6>What CNN and any of these shows should</v>
<v Speaker 6>be.</v>

2029
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:49.200
<v Speaker 6>Part of what they should be is like a</v>
<v Speaker 6>town center where people talk about</v>

2030
01:30:49.201 --> 01:30:52.680
<v Speaker 6>these like super important ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is an important idea that needs to</v>

2031
01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:56.730
<v Speaker 6>be like they need to interrupt</v>
<v Speaker 6>television shows for this because we</v>

2032
01:30:56.731 --> 01:31:01.731
<v Speaker 6>might be signing off on a terrible idea</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we might be letting companies get</v>

2033
01:31:01.981 --> 01:31:03.780
<v Speaker 6>away with having more and more control</v>
<v Speaker 6>over us.</v>

2034
01:31:03.781 --> 01:31:05.010
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I need to go look at it.</v>

2035
01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.770
<v Speaker 6>I need to really look at it carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we all need to look at it carefully.</v>

2036
01:31:07.771 --> 01:31:10.670
<v Speaker 6>If this is really happening in 10 days,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the average person's not going to have</v>

2037
01:31:10.710 --> 01:31:13.560
<v Speaker 6>the time nor the ambition to go and</v>
<v Speaker 6>investigate this.</v>

2038
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:14.910
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>scary.</v>

2039
01:31:14.911 --> 01:31:16.220
<v Speaker 6>Think Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As I was looking,</v>

2040
01:31:16.230 --> 01:31:17.970
<v Speaker 6>there's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's another thing that happened too</v>

2041
01:31:17.971 --> 01:31:20.460
<v Speaker 6>that they're voting on I think this</v>
<v Speaker 6>week.</v>

2042
01:31:20.461 --> 01:31:21.750
<v Speaker 6>Monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the PR.</v>

2043
01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:24.840
<v Speaker 6>Another problem I have it is too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's five people on that panel of the</v>

2044
01:31:24.841 --> 01:31:29.310
<v Speaker 6>FCC board that decides these decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's usually one person that's the</v>

2045
01:31:29.311 --> 01:31:31.140
<v Speaker 6>flipping vote that makes it a three two</v>
<v Speaker 6>vote.</v>

2046
01:31:31.141 --> 01:31:34.200
<v Speaker 6>It's never like five of which one showed</v>
<v Speaker 6>up and the solid gold Bentley,</v>

2047
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:39.780
<v Speaker 6>which one got out his next covered in</v>
<v Speaker 6>lipstick.</v>

2048
01:31:40.670 --> 01:31:42.690
<v Speaker 6>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's the analysis,</v>

2049
01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:46.650
<v Speaker 6>but the FCC wants to relax when a</v>
<v Speaker 6>broadcast media as big as rules that has</v>

2050
01:31:46.651 --> 01:31:51.030
<v Speaker 6>to do with like a small,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a small city having one company</v>

2051
01:31:51.031 --> 01:31:54.600
<v Speaker 6>owned the TV station and a newspaper in</v>
<v Speaker 6>that area,</v>

2052
01:31:54.601 --> 01:31:56.790
<v Speaker 6>which is like a media rights issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh.</v>

2053
01:31:56.791 --> 01:31:58.950
<v Speaker 6>So they want that to come back there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're trying to,</v>

2054
01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:00.180
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stop the rule</v>

2055
01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:03.610
<v Speaker 5>that prevented that or like re Redo the</v>
<v Speaker 5>vote on it or whatever.</v>

2056
01:32:03.611 --> 01:32:04.444
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

2057

<v Speaker 1>that are getting brutalized in these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting hit in the head with</v>

2285
01:42:02.241 --> 01:42:03.830
<v Speaker 1>beer bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant Gash.</v>

2286
01:42:03.831 --> 01:42:06.020
<v Speaker 1>His blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that?</v>

2287
01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like that.</v>

2288
01:42:07.731 --> 01:42:08.564
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2289
01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:12.800
<v Speaker 2>the youtube crap or that you used to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>really popular where they would just</v>

2290
01:42:12.801 --> 01:42:15.580
<v Speaker 2>edit things together real fast and an</v>
<v Speaker 2>end with like ha,</v>

2291
01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:18.560
<v Speaker 2>like screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was that shit called?</v>

2292
01:42:18.730 --> 01:42:20.920
<v Speaker 1>That was user created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of people like you</v>

2293
01:42:20.921 --> 01:42:24.040
<v Speaker 1>could see those people doing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just decided to try to talk real</v>

2294
01:42:24.041 --> 01:42:27.850
<v Speaker 1>fast and cut out all the breaths in</v>
<v Speaker 1>between it and slam it together.</v>

2295
01:42:27.851 --> 01:42:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no intention span whatsoever.</v>

2296
01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Now this stuff like in what we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching now I find,</v>

2297
01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.960
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all using the same characters.</v>

2298
01:42:35.961 --> 01:42:37.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like to me it's from a</v>

2299
01:42:37.941 --> 01:42:40.850
<v Speaker 2>message board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when we were back in the day</v>

2300
01:42:40.851 --> 01:42:43.970
<v Speaker 2>on your message board and we would like</v>
<v Speaker 2>make all these videos and stuff like</v>

2301
01:42:43.971 --> 01:42:45.500
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's from a group of</v>

2302
01:42:45.501 --> 01:42:47.660
<v Speaker 2>people that all are doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2303
01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:52.430
<v Speaker 2>collectively like to me it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you'll find like a deep four chan</v>

2304
01:42:52.431 --> 01:42:56.180
<v Speaker 2>thread in it or something where like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh I did the baby falling video or</v>

2305
01:42:56.181 --> 01:42:56.580
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2306
01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:58.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of different ones man.</v>

2307
01:42:58.501 --> 01:43:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this was like with real people</v>

2308
01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:04.290
<v Speaker 1>but the ones that you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

2309
01:43:04.291 --> 01:43:06.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cartoon ones,</v>

2310
01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.570
<v Speaker 1>they're being made in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not speaking English in any of</v>

2311
01:43:09.571 --> 01:43:11.810
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all like noises and stuff and</v>

2312
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:16.410
<v Speaker 1>they're generating like if their ad</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly and some of them were approved</v>

2313
01:43:16.411 --> 01:43:18.330
<v Speaker 1>for ads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're generating a tremendous amount</v>

2314
01:43:18.331 --> 01:43:20.160
<v Speaker 1>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to think about how many hits</v>

2315
01:43:20.161 --> 01:43:23.250
<v Speaker 1>these fucking things are getting and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many like see if you could pull up one</v>

2316
01:43:23.251 --> 01:43:25.470
<v Speaker 1>and see how many millions of hits it</v>
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

2317
01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2318
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I just pulled up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had 5 million,</v>

2319
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:29.250
<v Speaker 1>5 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2320
01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.830
<v Speaker 1>so 5 million hits is the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

2321
01:43:31.831 --> 01:43:33.960
<v Speaker 1>If you've got ads on a video for little</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

2322
01:43:33.961 --> 01:43:35.550
<v Speaker 1>that gets 5 million hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a business.</v>

2323
01:43:35.551 --> 01:43:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got those things in there,</v>

2324
01:43:37.051 --> 01:43:38.490
<v Speaker 1>generating them by computers.</v>

2325
01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:41.460
<v Speaker 1>So you're making hundreds and hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them and you put them all over the</v>

2326
01:43:41.461 --> 01:43:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Internet and they all have 5 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>hits each.</v>

2327
01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:47.100
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about a substantial</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money that you're getting</v>

2328
01:43:47.101 --> 01:43:50.070
<v Speaker 1>every month and they're just making</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

2329
01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:53.720
<v Speaker 1>And then the real fucked up thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like apparently there's some,</v>

2330
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:56.220
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read the beginning of this and</v>

2331
01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:58.250
<v Speaker 1>then never read any further into it but</v>
<v Speaker 1>read it.</v>

2332
01:43:58.610 --> 01:44:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to thread apparently where these</v>

2333
01:44:00.981 --> 01:44:04.640
<v Speaker 1>people were trying to decipher some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that are being said in the</v>

2334
01:44:04.641 --> 01:44:09.641
<v Speaker 1>comments and they think that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>using the comments as like ways we're</v>

2335
01:44:09.951 --> 01:44:12.440
<v Speaker 1>child trafficking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can communicate with Jonah.</v>

2336
01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:15.980
<v Speaker 1>This is like speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sounds like wow,</v>

2337
01:44:15.981 --> 01:44:18.830
<v Speaker 1>that seems far fetched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so it doesn't child trafficking</v>

2338
01:44:18.831 --> 01:44:20.450
<v Speaker 1>sound far fetched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2339
01:44:20.451 --> 01:44:21.680
<v Speaker 1>you know it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2340
01:44:21.681 --> 01:44:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Child trafficking sounds crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>farfetched.</v>

2341
01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that someone's so evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're selling children,</v>

2342
01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:27.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

2343
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:29.360
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.110
<v Speaker 1>So if that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then why wouldn't it be that they would</v>

2345
01:44:33.111 --> 01:44:33.944
<v Speaker 1>communicate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2346
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:37.790
<v Speaker 1>is it more far fetched that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate in code in some sort of way</v>

2347
01:44:37.791 --> 01:44:38.624
<v Speaker 1>in the comments?</v>

2348
01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:40.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they probably wouldn't do it on</v>

2349
01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:42.270
<v Speaker 2>kid videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would probably do it online.</v>

2350
01:44:42.271 --> 01:44:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Like just like any video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like tractor.</v>

2351
01:44:44.590 --> 01:44:46.760
<v Speaker 1>It could be videos or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2352
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:47.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be.</v>

2353
01:44:47.601 --> 01:44:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're not that smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the trauma Lester's right.</v>

2354
01:44:49.731 --> 01:44:50.750
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that,</v>

2355
01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:53.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these why else?</v>

2356
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:55.490
<v Speaker 1>These kids are not going to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments.</v>

2357
01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:57.530
<v Speaker 1>So who's making comments on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos?</v>

2358
01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.560
<v Speaker 2>It to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2359
01:44:59.590 --> 01:45:02.620
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a group of people somewhere and</v>

2360
01:45:02.621 --> 01:45:06.160
<v Speaker 2>it's making these now the fact that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube is letting them sell it as kids,</v>

2361
01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:09.010
<v Speaker 2>they need to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube needs to change how they have</v>

2362
01:45:09.011 --> 01:45:12.070
<v Speaker 2>kid videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cat Videos should have a team of people.</v>

2363
01:45:12.190 --> 01:45:15.130
<v Speaker 2>You get approved then you become in for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure two kids.</v>

2364
01:45:15.250 --> 01:45:17.830
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just upload anything and put</v>

2365
01:45:17.890 --> 01:45:21.530
<v Speaker 2>the kid to tag on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should have the kid tag.</v>

2366
01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How kids find out about it.</v>

2367
01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You give your kid the user response when</v>

2368
01:45:25.571 --> 01:45:29.080
<v Speaker 2>you get your kid like the ipad and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it on Youtube.</v>

2369
01:45:29.081 --> 01:45:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Kids that should be selected videos</v>
<v Speaker 2>only.</v>

2370
01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:34.660
<v Speaker 2>It's been approved by eyeballs and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2371
01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:37.120
<v Speaker 2>I should not be able to make a kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>

2372
01:45:37.150 --> 01:45:38.170
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

2373
01:45:38.410 --> 01:45:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not be able to make kid video</v>
<v Speaker 1>where a kid gets hit in the head with a</v>

2374
01:45:41.201 --> 01:45:41.630
<v Speaker 1>fucking</v>

2375

<v Speaker 2>If that shit was like just on like once</v>

2376
01:45:45.741 --> 01:45:47.390
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of us did it and were like,</v>

2377
01:45:47.391 --> 01:45:50.480
<v Speaker 2>I just made all these stupid videos of</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids falling down on the ground and it</v>

2378
01:45:50.481 --> 01:45:51.800
<v Speaker 2>wasn't for kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd be like,</v>

2379
01:45:51.801 --> 01:45:54.860
<v Speaker 2>that's just a stupid cartoon that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would see on like adult swim or</v>

<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>

2383
01:46:00.690 --> 01:46:04.230
<v Speaker 2>especially the ones that I watched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those stupid ones</v>

<v Speaker 1>where like a non sequitur video comes</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know you're talking about it's blank</v>

2399
01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:42.570
<v Speaker 1>interstitial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that is,</v>

2400
01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.151
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

2401
01:46:45.151 --> 01:46:48.610
<v Speaker 1>matthew mcconaughey was in that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was in this movie.</v>

2402
01:46:48.750 --> 01:46:49.583
<v Speaker 1>He was the</v>

2403
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:51.950
<v Speaker 6>dark tower movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>

2404
01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:52.681

<v Speaker 6>he's the bad guy.</v>

2406
01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:57.090
<v Speaker 6>Matthew mcconaughey's bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And all I could think of that was all I</v>

2407
01:46:57.091 --> 01:46:58.970
<v Speaker 6>could think of was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2408
01:46:59.810 --> 01:47:03.420
<v Speaker 6>Louis C K is bit about Mad Mike and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2409
01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.400
<v Speaker 6>Louis C.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Case bit about Matthew mcconaughey.</v>

2410
01:47:05.401 --> 01:47:07.620
<v Speaker 6>Do you remember it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's like,</v>

2411
01:47:07.710 --> 01:47:11.540
<v Speaker 6>the law says you can't touch,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I see a lot of law</v>

<v Speaker 8>burgers out here</v>

<v Speaker 6>he was,</v>

2414

<v Speaker 6>he loved the movie so much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They was walking around his house saying</v>

2415
01:47:20.231 --> 01:47:23.880
<v Speaker 6>that thing over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when I was watching this movie,</v>

2416
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:28.180
<v Speaker 6>Matthew mcconaughey is the bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All I could think of is Louis C K is bit</v>

2417
01:47:28.210 --> 01:47:30.010
<v Speaker 6>going on things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of law burgers out here.</v>

2419
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:39.330

<v Speaker 8>That fucking happens,</v>

2420
01:47:39.331 --> 01:47:40.320
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That happens.</v>

<v Speaker 8>that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

2423
01:47:43.351 --> 01:47:46.740
<v Speaker 8>that subjects ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's got me every time I see Matthew</v>

2424
01:47:46.741 --> 01:47:48.740
<v Speaker 8>mcconaughey,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it was a thing is a lot of long</v>

2425
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:49.663
<v Speaker 8>burgers.</v>

2426
01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:57.970
<v Speaker 6>Hbo Pulled All the Louis C K Shit</v>
<v Speaker 6>offline tid.</v>

2427
01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:58.990
<v Speaker 6>They really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2428
01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.920
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a hard one.</v>

2429
01:48:02.210 --> 01:48:05.420
<v Speaker 6>That seems silly and it's still funny</v>
<v Speaker 6>comedy.</v>

2430
01:48:05.421 --> 01:48:08.090
<v Speaker 6>He wasn't jerking off in front of</v>
<v Speaker 6>anybody when he did the comedy.</v>

2431
01:48:08.650 --> 01:48:11.960
<v Speaker 6>Like just like you can't invalidate</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything everybody's ever done.</v>

2432
01:48:11.961 --> 01:48:14.600
<v Speaker 6>If they did something bad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not good that he did it,</v>

2433
01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:18.710
<v Speaker 6>but it's kind of fucked up that day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did that even though he,</v>

2434
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:22.010
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the situation of him asking permission</v>

2435
01:48:22.011 --> 01:48:24.680
<v Speaker 6>and him admitting it and coming out and</v>
<v Speaker 6>apologizing,</v>

2436
01:48:24.890 --> 01:48:25.940
<v Speaker 6>but yet didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's that,</v>

2437
01:48:25.941 --> 01:48:29.840
<v Speaker 6>that masterson scientologists guide that</v>
<v Speaker 6>all his shows are on there and then</v>

2438
01:48:29.841 --> 01:48:31.220
<v Speaker 6>there's like real,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the more people.</v>

2439
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:33.200
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that those are real,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those stories are real?</v>

2440
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:35.240
<v Speaker 6>I think a lot of them are real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2441
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:37.520
<v Speaker 6>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean like why haven't they done</v>

2442
01:48:37.521 --> 01:48:39.050
<v Speaker 6>something?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If that story is real,</v>

2443
01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:41.480
<v Speaker 6>it seems like that one would be</v>
<v Speaker 6>something that would get a lot of</v>

2444
01:48:41.481 --> 01:48:42.314
<v Speaker 6>attention</v>

2445
01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:46.980
<v Speaker 8>hold.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It happened</v>

2446
01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:47.910
<v Speaker 5>yesterday and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2447
01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:50.790
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess sports world and the Ohio state</v>

2448
01:48:50.791 --> 01:48:53.400
<v Speaker 5>world to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the defensive coordinator who used to</v>

2449
01:48:53.401 --> 01:48:57.600
<v Speaker 5>be an nfl coach was rumored earlier</v>
<v Speaker 5>yesterday afternoon or I think maybe</v>

2450
01:48:57.601 --> 01:48:59.730
<v Speaker 5>even Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he was going to be hired as the new</v>

2451
01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:01.470
<v Speaker 5>head coach for Tennessee's football</v>
<v Speaker 5>team.</v>

2452
01:49:02.190 --> 01:49:04.110
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were going to make the announcement</v>

2453
01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:08.400
<v Speaker 5>yesterday evening I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at some point after the agreement</v>

2454
01:49:08.401 --> 01:49:09.810
<v Speaker 5>had been signed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2455
01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:13.710
<v Speaker 5>it hit the media in Tennessee and there</v>
<v Speaker 5>was protests in front of the stadium.</v>

2456
01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:16.410
<v Speaker 5>All of their fans and alumni were pissed</v>
<v Speaker 5>at this is going to happen.</v>

2457
01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:20.730
<v Speaker 5>Someone out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was on the Penn state team,</v>

2458
01:49:20.731 --> 01:49:22.890
<v Speaker 5>he was one of the assistants to Jerry</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sandusky.</v>

2459
01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:25.360
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the uh,</v>

2460
01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:28.650
<v Speaker 5>tying to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although he's already been vetted by</v>

2461
01:49:28.651 --> 01:49:30.480
<v Speaker 5>Ohio state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he's already the coach there and</v>

2462
01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:34.020
<v Speaker 5>Urban Meyer's team has vetted them and</v>
<v Speaker 5>backed him and all that.</v>

2463
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:39.720
<v Speaker 5>So before the night was over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they already canceled a contract and now</v>

2464
01:49:39.721 --> 01:49:42.540
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think even going to sue them for money</v>

2465
01:49:42.541 --> 01:49:44.520
<v Speaker 5>that he was supposedly going to be owed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause he probably,</v>

2466
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:46.830
<v Speaker 5>he could have already got rid of his</v>
<v Speaker 5>house like in that day because he was</v>

2467
01:49:46.831 --> 01:49:47.531
<v Speaker 5>going to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2468
01:49:47.531 --> 01:49:49.690
<v Speaker 5>so all sorts of things happened and</v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

2469
01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:52.520
<v Speaker 5>it was like literally 24 hours or less</v>
<v Speaker 5>that close to,</v>

2470
01:49:52.521 --> 01:49:54.280
<v Speaker 5>he worked at Jerry Sandusky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2471
01:49:54.281 --> 01:49:56.530
<v Speaker 5>cause he was an assistant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was younger.</v>

2472
01:49:56.531 --> 01:49:58.180
<v Speaker 5>There's other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a couple of other coaches on</v>

2473
01:49:58.181 --> 01:50:00.190
<v Speaker 5>there that claim to not know anything</v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

2474
01:50:00.191 --> 01:50:03.840
<v Speaker 5>I believe man and sort of some other</v>
<v Speaker 5>people like Kirk Carpentry.</v>

2475
01:50:03.850 --> 01:50:05.710
<v Speaker 5>I started tweeting out last night that</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was a,</v>

2476
01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:07.060
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2477
01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 5>do you really think that you should do</v>
<v Speaker 5>this with no evidence?</v>

2478
01:50:09.401 --> 01:50:11.230
<v Speaker 5>There is no evidence in this case</v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently,</v>

2479
01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:15.070
<v Speaker 5>and he's lost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't have that job opportunity now</v>

2480
01:50:15.071 --> 01:50:15.560
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>

2481
01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I think you need a real investigation</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you commit to something like</v>

2482
01:50:20.001 --> 01:50:20.930
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

2483
01:50:21.110 --> 01:50:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the case.</v>

2484
01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:26.990
<v Speaker 1>He might have not known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that he didn't know.</v>

2485
01:50:27.890 --> 01:50:29.720
<v Speaker 1>But if you didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like don't you think there'd be like a</v>

2486
01:50:29.721 --> 01:50:34.721
<v Speaker 1>story you'd hear something melt down</v>
<v Speaker 1>over potential hiring of Greg Ciano is a</v>

2487
01:50:35.481 --> 01:50:37.880
<v Speaker 1>bad look for Tennessee program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm?</v>

2488
01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:40.360
<v Speaker 1>What's a bad look?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2489
01:50:41.310 --> 01:50:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck is going on.</v>

2490
01:50:43.910 --> 01:50:47.330
<v Speaker 1>If you knew that this guy knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you would have this feeling like,</v>

2491
01:50:47.331 --> 01:50:48.320
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that guy.</v>

2492
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:51.560
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you knew that he didn't know,</v>

2493
01:50:51.561 --> 01:50:52.760
<v Speaker 1>you'd be furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>

2494
01:50:52.761 --> 01:50:53.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2495
01:50:53.090 --> 01:50:57.080
<v Speaker 1>you're labeling an innocent man and</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying he's a bad person.</v>

2496
01:50:57.081 --> 01:50:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Like there's needs to be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation.</v>

2497
01:50:58.910 --> 01:51:01.490
<v Speaker 1>If there has been an investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to accept the results.</v>

2498
01:51:01.491 --> 01:51:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're on a witch hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to figure out what's really</v>

2499
01:51:04.641 --> 01:51:06.050
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2500
01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:07.370
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the particulars,</v>

2501
01:51:07.730 --> 01:51:10.370
<v Speaker 1>but if you know the particulars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2502
01:51:10.371 --> 01:51:11.410
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2503
01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:13.010
<v Speaker 1>you got to make a case for it.</v>

2504
01:51:13.930 --> 01:51:15.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at Al Franklin.</v>

2505
01:51:15.390 --> 01:51:18.190
<v Speaker 2>I like it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That let a little vague picture of him</v>

2506
01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:21.000
<v Speaker 2>like acting like he's grabbing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl's boobs and then you see the,</v>

2507
01:51:21.010 --> 01:51:23.890
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff that comes out about her</v>
<v Speaker 2>after where it's like,</v>

2508
01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:24.480
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

2509
01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:27.460
<v Speaker 2>she was like groping all these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole time.</v>

2510
01:51:27.461 --> 01:51:28.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leanne tweeting.</v>

2511
01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:29.010
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2512
01:51:29.010 --> 01:51:30.820
<v Speaker 2>If there was a been fake</v>

2513
01:51:31.650 --> 01:51:32.840
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see any of that.</v>

2514
01:51:32.841 --> 01:51:35.180
<v Speaker 1>There's video of apologized for what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>did though.</v>

2515
01:51:35.690 --> 01:51:36.261
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2516
01:51:36.261 --> 01:51:37.550
<v Speaker 1>what he was doing was trying to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

2517
01:51:37.610 --> 01:51:39.790
<v Speaker 1>trying to be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a picture and he wasn't even a,</v>

2518
01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:44.330
<v Speaker 1>he was a comedian bank then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't even a state representative.</v>

2519
01:51:44.331 --> 01:51:46.160
<v Speaker 1>But either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you don't do that.</v>

2520
01:51:46.161 --> 01:51:48.230
<v Speaker 1>That could be your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be your sister.</v>

2521
01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:50.360
<v Speaker 1>She's out cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's your girlfriend.</v>

2522
01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:52.520
<v Speaker 1>You joke around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing that was your girlfriend.</v>

2523
01:51:52.521 --> 01:51:54.110
<v Speaker 1>If you girlfriends out and you take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture like,</v>

2524
01:51:54.610 --> 01:51:55.970
<v Speaker 1>and you'd be silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2525
01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:58.400
<v Speaker 1>She loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your girlfriend.</v>

2526
01:51:58.430 --> 01:52:01.100
<v Speaker 1>She knows the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I've heard she takes a picture</v>

2527
01:52:01.250 --> 01:52:02.990
<v Speaker 1>like sit next to your Dick while you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were unconscious.</v>

2528
01:52:02.991 --> 01:52:05.000
<v Speaker 1>She goes like this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be upset.</v>

2529
01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:06.013
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2530
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she wasn't his girlfriend.</v>

2531
01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:12.160
<v Speaker 1>She was working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was working,</v>

2532
01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:15.680
<v Speaker 1>they're always doing this charity tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said that he tried to kiss her.</v>

2533
01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:17.510
<v Speaker 1>There was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was more than one thing.</v>

2534
01:52:18.170 --> 01:52:21.770
<v Speaker 1>So he apologized for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was the other women that</v>

2535
01:52:21.771 --> 01:52:22.880
<v Speaker 1>were saying that he grabbed her butt.</v>

2536
01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Well it's that dance do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that was just like,</v>

2537
01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:29.100
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're taking photos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2538
01:52:29.101 --> 01:52:30.850
<v Speaker 2>the one girl said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he put his hand on my bike.</v>

2539
01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're taking a photo,</v>

2540
01:52:32.491 --> 01:52:34.920
<v Speaker 2>you just put your arm around somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a touches your,</v>

2541
01:52:34.921 --> 01:52:36.850
<v Speaker 2>but I be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I be old</v>

2542
01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:39.610
<v Speaker 1>dudes like to grab butts too though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an old dude thing.</v>

2543
01:52:39.611 --> 01:52:40.550
<v Speaker 1>George Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Bush,</v>

2544
01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:43.520
<v Speaker 1>George W.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush likes to take pictures of people</v>

2545
01:52:43.521 --> 01:52:44.920
<v Speaker 1>and a ride as they go to take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

2546
01:52:44.921 --> 01:52:45.800
<v Speaker 1>He squeezes their ass,</v>

2547
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:48.200
<v Speaker 6>but that might be like some old Texas</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2548
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:50.470
<v Speaker 6>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey joke.</v>

2549
01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:53.180
<v Speaker 6>Plus he's almost dead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Leave him alone.</v>

2550
01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:56.360
<v Speaker 6>Like people have to realize he's the</v>
<v Speaker 6>longest living president ever</v>

2551
01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:57.280
<v Speaker 1>at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2552
01:52:57.670 --> 01:52:59.350
<v Speaker 1>he's the oldest one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2553
01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Carter Carter still</v>

2554
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:05.950
<v Speaker 6>now he's not his old Herbert Walker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bush is older than Carter.</v>

2555
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:10.510
<v Speaker 6>I think you right now he's the oldest</v>
<v Speaker 6>surviving president is what they say.</v>

2556
01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:14.410
<v Speaker 6>But Carter is the longest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>longest to go that he was president.</v>

2557
01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:16.181
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2558
01:53:16.181 --> 01:53:18.400
<v Speaker 6>He's almost dead like he's got to grab</v>
<v Speaker 6>acids.</v>

2559
01:53:18.401 --> 01:53:22.310
<v Speaker 6>He's going for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what's also ridiculous looking.</v>

2560
01:53:22.330 --> 01:53:24.610
<v Speaker 6>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you became like like a president or</v>

2561
01:53:24.611 --> 01:53:27.400
<v Speaker 6>something like that and then you went</v>
<v Speaker 6>through all the photos you've ever taken</v>

2562
01:53:27.401 --> 01:53:30.580
<v Speaker 6>with fans after a show or at shows and</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff like that.</v>

2563
01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:32.120
<v Speaker 6>You can take any of those photos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My,</v>

2564
01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:32.741
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2565
01:53:32.741 --> 01:53:37.060
<v Speaker 6>he's making a blowjob face to a woman</v>
<v Speaker 6>under the age of 17 or so.</v>

2566
01:53:37.930 --> 01:53:41.320
<v Speaker 6>If you freeze every people take so many</v>
<v Speaker 6>pictures.</v>

2567
01:53:41.650 --> 01:53:43.700
<v Speaker 1>We're taking pictures when you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at your mouth is open.</v>

2568
01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

2569
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that those old dudes just</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbed acids.</v>

2570
01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what's coming out.</v>

2571
01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:55.740
<v Speaker 6>They just thought it was a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get away with it.</v>

2572
01:53:55.741 --> 01:53:57.420
<v Speaker 6>They grabbed acids when they took</v>
<v Speaker 6>pictures.</v>

2573
01:53:58.310 --> 01:54:01.260
<v Speaker 6>They probably grab yours do just to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>to look in your face like,</v>

2574
01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:02.131
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>totally.</v>

2575
01:54:02.131 --> 01:54:03.360
<v Speaker 6>There's probably a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sports.</v>

2576
01:54:03.361 --> 01:54:05.250
<v Speaker 6>I don't think anyone really slaps butts</v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>

2577
01:54:05.251 --> 01:54:07.830
<v Speaker 6>It used to be a thing all the time or</v>
<v Speaker 6>they certainly,</v>

2578
01:54:07.831 --> 01:54:09.900
<v Speaker 6>they slapped butts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a video that Morgan Murphy</v>

2579
01:54:09.901 --> 01:54:13.440

<v Speaker 3>I can't wait for the meet doctor to come</v>

2640
01:56:48.691 --> 01:56:49.440
<v Speaker 3>on soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2641
01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2642
01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:51.750
<v Speaker 3>the meat down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Better way to describe it.</v>

2643
01:56:51.751 --> 01:56:52.890
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the carnivore,</v>

2644
01:56:52.891 --> 01:56:54.000
<v Speaker 3>he's a full carnivore.</v>

2645
01:56:54.190 --> 01:56:58.150
<v Speaker 1>That's all he does is eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks he's been like this crazy</v>

2646
01:56:58.151 --> 01:57:00.280
<v Speaker 1>proponent of meat eating only</v>

2647
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:03.200
<v Speaker 3>the has to be badgered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stanker you're something,</v>

2648
01:57:03.201 --> 01:57:05.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cholesterol or a site owner.</v>

2649
01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:06.230
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it would be</v>

2650
01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:09.530
<v Speaker 1>perfectly healthy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2651
01:57:09.570 --> 01:57:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2652
01:57:10.941 --> 01:57:14.570
<v Speaker 1>I think one thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think you would need some</v>

2653
01:57:14.571 --> 01:57:16.790
<v Speaker 1>nutrients from vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2654
01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:18.980
<v Speaker 1>And then there's some things you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>only get from vegetables.</v>

2655
01:57:19.610 --> 01:57:21.500
<v Speaker 1>But then are you getting any of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>from me?</v>

2656
01:57:21.501 --> 01:57:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Because they eat vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the idea.</v>

2657
01:57:23.781 --> 01:57:26.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like lions don't really eat a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of salads.</v>

2658
01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:30.350
<v Speaker 1>They just fuck up zebras</v>
<v Speaker 1>and zebras.</v>

2659
01:57:30.530 --> 01:57:33.770
<v Speaker 1>They do plenty of salad eat and for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion and the lines are good.</v>

2660
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:35.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't really have to,</v>

2661
01:57:35.301 --> 01:57:36.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat it on their own.</v>

2662
01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:40.840
<v Speaker 3>If that blueberry affects the bear meat</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much that it changes the shape and</v>

2663
01:57:40.841 --> 01:57:43.300
<v Speaker 3>color and taste of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it not all that shape.</v>

2664
01:57:43.301 --> 01:57:45.640
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mean that but like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely,</v>

2665
01:57:45.790 --> 01:57:46.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2666
01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Changes the color and the taste of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>

2667
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:52.150
<v Speaker 1>It would only make sense that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting something from the grass when</v>

2668
01:57:52.151 --> 01:57:55.390
<v Speaker 1>you eat a steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why grass fed steak is better</v>

2669
01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:57.520
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like proven for you.</v>

2670
01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Then corn fed steak because corn is</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically sugar.</v>

2671
01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean well it's not good when you shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see,</v>

2672
01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:05.710
<v Speaker 1>hey that's not even digest</v>

2673
01:58:05.710 --> 01:58:10.440
<v Speaker 3>it like the reason why he's he corn in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your shit cause that your body's like,</v>

2674
01:58:10.441 --> 01:58:13.740
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing with this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy's eating plastic.</v>

2675
01:58:13.741 --> 01:58:16.440
<v Speaker 3>Just spit this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's such a weird thing.</v>

2676
01:58:16.441 --> 01:58:18.060
<v Speaker 3>You're assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like get it out,</v>

2677
01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:20.070
<v Speaker 3>get it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I'm going to try to process it.</v>

2678
01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:23.160
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did I tell you a long time ago,</v>

2679
01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:26.010
<v Speaker 3>I think I already told you this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but back in the day when like hands</v>

2680
01:58:26.011 --> 01:58:29.040
<v Speaker 3>across America and all that shit we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to write in school,</v>

2681
01:58:29.130 --> 01:58:31.350
<v Speaker 3>like how do we help starvation and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2682
01:58:31.351 --> 01:58:33.820
<v Speaker 3>If we have any ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wrote about how we should just</v>

2683
01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:36.930
<v Speaker 3>feed everyone in corn and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>could wash it off the next day and eat</v>

2684
01:58:36.931 --> 01:58:39.480
<v Speaker 3>it like a few more times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got in trouble for that.</v>

2685
01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 3>Like mom had like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain's always been</v>

2686
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:46.050
<v Speaker 1>gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Mom's like had to get caught in and</v>

2687
01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:48.610
<v Speaker 1>it's stuff like that because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking like,</v>

2688
01:58:48.611 --> 01:58:51.850
<v Speaker 1>well you can eat it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's like make sense to me.</v>

2689
01:58:51.851 --> 01:58:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Like it's untouched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that some native Americans</v>

2690
01:58:55.061 --> 01:58:57.680
<v Speaker 1>used to call it a second harvest and</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to eat thrown shit.</v>

2691
01:58:57.720 --> 01:58:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think the cooked it or something.</v>

2694
01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:04.600
<v Speaker 1>They call it second harvest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the person told me,</v>

2697
01:59:08.081 --> 01:59:11.200
<v Speaker 1>this might've been crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might've made this up.</v>

2698
01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll remember who it was.</v>

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Americans to conserve as much food as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible during deadly winters.</v>

02:01:16.691 --> 02:01:19.270
<v Speaker 1>and they have a script and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep throwing the script over and over</v>

2742
02:01:19.271 --> 02:01:21.610
<v Speaker 1>and we're looking for like hidden</v>
<v Speaker 1>messages in the script.</v>

2743
02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I think the script is probably just</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

2744
02:01:23.501 --> 02:01:26.680
<v Speaker 1>They think it's fucked up to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cartoon character hit himself in the</v>

2745
02:01:26.681 --> 02:01:28.690
<v Speaker 1>head with a bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you're probably right.</v>

2746
02:01:28.691 --> 02:01:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe these fucking child</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators,</v>

2747
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:33.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe they communicate on all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different websites.</v>

2748
02:01:33.970 --> 02:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they just decide like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2749
02:01:35.261 --> 02:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>let's meet on this tire forum and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>just say things in code and attire means</v>

2750
02:01:39.801 --> 02:01:40.280
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2751
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.080
<v Speaker 6>I mean it wasn't that always the shit</v>
<v Speaker 6>with pizza gate.</v>

2752
02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:44.030
<v Speaker 6>Like they thought that they were talking</v>
<v Speaker 6>in code.</v>

2753
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:47.450
<v Speaker 6>Like all the conspiracy theorists</v>
<v Speaker 6>thought that a slice of pizza meant like</v>

2754
02:01:47.451 --> 02:01:51.710
<v Speaker 6>a kid and the youtube one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean them being there being so many of</v>

2755
02:01:51.711 --> 02:01:53.270
<v Speaker 6>them sort of says that there's money in</v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2756
02:01:53.810 --> 02:01:56.750
<v Speaker 6>They've tapped into an algorithm and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're just beating it to death.</v>

2757
02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:58.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they just have the same script and</v>

2758
02:01:58.701 --> 02:02:00.770
<v Speaker 6>they just do it with a computer change.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One little thing,</v>

2759
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:02.810
<v Speaker 6>little thing here and there and that's</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I think it is.</v>

2760
02:02:02.811 --> 02:02:04.640
<v Speaker 6>I think it's not as nefarious as</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody likes to think,</v>

2761
02:02:04.641 --> 02:02:09.380
<v Speaker 6>but it's really fucking weird to keep</v>
<v Speaker 6>seeing the same video playing out over</v>

2762
02:02:09.381 --> 02:02:12.050
<v Speaker 6>and over again with a bottle flies</v>
<v Speaker 6>through the hair and the baby gets hit</v>

2763
02:02:12.051 --> 02:02:13.840
<v Speaker 6>in the fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'd floods.</v>

2764
02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:15.770
<v Speaker 6>I think the activity was a little weird.</v>

2765
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:18.110
<v Speaker 6>Or when it's people actually people</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing it.</v>

2766
02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:21.170
<v Speaker 6>You can't just have a computer make it</v>
<v Speaker 6>to where people are.</v>

2767
02:02:21.171 --> 02:02:23.720
<v Speaker 6>God damn nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're nuts and they're out there.</v>

2768
02:02:24.110 --> 02:02:24.960
<v Speaker 6>I like furries.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2769
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:29.090
<v Speaker 6>I th I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have a bunch of outfits that I make</v>

2770
02:02:29.091 --> 02:02:31.370
<v Speaker 6>videos with and stuff and that's pretty</v>
<v Speaker 6>much what that is.</v>

2771
02:02:31.371 --> 02:02:34.500
<v Speaker 6>That's just basically cross play.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Any kind of a roleplay.</v>

2772
02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:35.553
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're having fun,</v>

2773
02:02:35.690 --> 02:02:38.060
<v Speaker 6>having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't feel like normies.</v>

2774
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:39.170
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 6>That was the thing when we first found</v>

2816
02:04:24.351 --> 02:04:26.600
<v Speaker 6>out about tentacle porn,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember like collectively the</v>

2817
02:04:26.601 --> 02:04:27.530
<v Speaker 6>Internet was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is going on in Japan?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tentacle Porn was a loophole for or</v>

2821
02:04:37.541 --> 02:04:41.250
<v Speaker 6>report insertion because she can't show</v>
<v Speaker 6>a insertion.</v>

2822

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2823
02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:47.050

<v Speaker 1>You have the,</v>

2824
02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:50.000
<v Speaker 1>it finds the weakest link and it makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>its way through.</v>

2825
02:04:50.060 --> 02:04:53.500
<v Speaker 1>You can't suppress it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like what you see with</v>

2826
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Catholic priests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you see in this.</v>

2827
02:04:56.930 --> 02:04:58.490
<v Speaker 1>You can't show penetration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2830
02:05:03.401 --> 02:05:08.401
<v Speaker 1>a dick on the end of every octopus arm</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're banging eight different</v>

2831
02:05:08.901 --> 02:05:10.070
<v Speaker 1>school girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

2832
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

2833
02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the magazine.</v>

2834
02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:13.513
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

2835
02:05:14.890 --> 02:05:17.320
<v Speaker 6>They're all school girls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Japan is so weird,</v>

2836
02:05:17.321 --> 02:05:19.240
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Big veiny Dick.</v>

2837
02:05:19.250 --> 02:05:21.400
<v Speaker 6>So it'll like ripping their lower jaw</v>
<v Speaker 6>out,</v>

2838
02:05:21.610 --> 02:05:24.280
<v Speaker 6>but it's just coming out of an octopus</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's okay.</v>

2839
02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:28.540
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen their game show called</v>
<v Speaker 6>like slippery stairs</v>

2840
02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:33.730
<v Speaker 6>the other day?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder what the,</v>

2841
02:05:33.731 --> 02:05:36.620
<v Speaker 6>like the cheating would be a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how would you cheated?</v>

2842
02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:39.970
<v Speaker 6>Slippery stairs seemingly someone in</v>
<v Speaker 6>America would figure out a way to buck</v>

2843
02:05:39.971 --> 02:05:40.780
<v Speaker 6>the system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2844
02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:43.750
<v Speaker 6>I would say it would have something to</v>
<v Speaker 6>do with pulling the other guys down.</v>

2845
02:05:43.980 --> 02:05:46.000
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think you can touch them though.</v>

2846
02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:49.090
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can you?</v>

2847
02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:49.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you can.</v>

2848
02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:52.420
<v Speaker 6>If you did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think people would just get ahead and</v>

2849
02:05:52.421 --> 02:05:54.010
<v Speaker 6>you would never let anybody get close to</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

2850
02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:56.640
<v Speaker 6>but I think the problem is for people</v>
<v Speaker 6>listening,</v>

2851
02:05:56.670 --> 02:06:01.110
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>

2852
02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.800
<v Speaker 6>he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

2853
02:06:02.801 --> 02:06:04.210
<v Speaker 6>He was there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He took everybody out like a bowling</v>

2854
02:06:04.211 --> 02:06:06.040
<v Speaker 6>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is amazing.</v>

2855
02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:08.320
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 6>to join.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 6>different interests,</v>

3049
02:14:03.961 --> 02:14:06.080
<v Speaker 6>different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're just different men and women,</v>

3050
02:14:06.090 --> 02:14:08.280
<v Speaker 6>different parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody lumped together in this dorm.</v>

3051
02:14:08.281 --> 02:14:11.490
<v Speaker 6>They all just can't really afford an</v>
<v Speaker 6>apartment.</v>

3052
02:14:11.491 --> 02:14:13.530
<v Speaker 6>And they're all living together in this</v>
<v Speaker 6>university setting.</v>

3053
02:14:14.150 --> 02:14:17.220
<v Speaker 6>But they could be anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your net and you roommate could be</v>

3054
02:14:17.221 --> 02:14:20.170
<v Speaker 6>anybody got to share a bathroom with</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone in the hall.</v>

3055
02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:23.160
<v Speaker 6>That one shit in the news recently where</v>
<v Speaker 6>that woman was,</v>

02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:45.210
<v Speaker 6>Finally I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yo girl got rid of her roommate after</v>

3086
02:15:45.211 --> 02:15:48.390
<v Speaker 6>one and a half month of spitting in her</v>
<v Speaker 6>coconut oil,</v>

3087
02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:51.390
<v Speaker 6>putting moldy clam dip and her lotions</v>
<v Speaker 6>rubbing,</v>

3088
02:15:51.391 --> 02:15:54.240
<v Speaker 6>use tampons in her backpack,</v>
<v Speaker 6>putting her toothbrush and places where</v>

3089
02:15:54.241 --> 02:15:58.410
<v Speaker 6>the sun doesn't shine and so much more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can finally say goodbye.</v>

3090
02:15:58.411 --> 02:16:02.130
<v Speaker 6>Jamaican Barbie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She said she was making that up as part</v>

3091
02:16:02.131 --> 02:16:04.300
<v Speaker 6>of her defense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but whether or not she wasn't not,</v>

3092
02:16:04.301 --> 02:16:06.630
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Story came out a couple of weeks ago.</v>

3093
02:16:06.790 --> 02:16:07.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See the thing is like,</v>

3094
02:16:07.831 --> 02:16:10.830
<v Speaker 6>you might think it'd be funny to say</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that and make it up and</v>

3095
02:16:10.831 --> 02:16:12.300
<v Speaker 6>it might be made up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>

3096
02:16:12.900 --> 02:16:16.080
<v Speaker 6>You might think it's funny to make,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but boy did you fuck up by saying that</v>

3097
02:16:17.530 --> 02:16:19.770
<v Speaker 6>like you gotta make something like that</v>
<v Speaker 6>up and then put it on the Internet where</v>

3098
02:16:19.771 --> 02:16:22.440
<v Speaker 6>anybody can find out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That seems crazy.</v>

3099
02:16:24.810 --> 02:16:29.350
<v Speaker 6>I guess you can test her toothbrush and</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff like that for every day.</v>

3100
02:16:29.450 --> 02:16:30.283
<v Speaker 6>Like you have the time.</v>

3101
02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to know when the last time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tested your toothbrush for,</v>

3102
02:16:32.321 --> 02:16:36.670
<v Speaker 1>but juice every well has it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3103
02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:39.020
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those things people just</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't test for.</v>

3104
02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Test your toothbrush to see if it's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's ass hole.</v>

3105
02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:44.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just a lot of things I'm thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

3106
02:16:44.531 --> 02:16:45.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3107
02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:47.200
<v Speaker 1>and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bad they hit each other,</v>

3108
02:16:47.201 --> 02:16:48.750
<v Speaker 1>but that called them on a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A tooth brush.</v>

3109
02:16:48.780 --> 02:16:53.780
<v Speaker 1>My brows bitch eat my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a sick type of person.</v>

3110
02:16:53.941 --> 02:16:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll sit there and watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You brushed their teeth,</v>

3111
02:16:57.080 --> 02:17:01.360
<v Speaker 1>their asshole juices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good in there for a weekend in the gums</v>

3112
02:17:01.810 --> 02:17:03.840
<v Speaker 1>and the gums allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3113
02:17:04.510 --> 02:17:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if she did it.</v>

3114
02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:07.510
<v Speaker 1>She did do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a sick bitch.</v>

3115
02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Magine as in the thought that has to go</v>

3116
02:17:11.921 --> 02:17:13.120
<v Speaker 1>through your head to do something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3117
02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she didn't realize how gross other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would find it.</v>

3118
02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:19.240
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy thing that she told</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

3119
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Like people would probably been doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to each other forever.</v>

3120
02:17:21.430 --> 02:17:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I think the first thing she did or was</v>
<v Speaker 1>it a slow build up?</v>

3121
02:17:29.710 --> 02:17:34.460
<v Speaker 1>This is a spin brush right to the lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>ribs frauds,</v>

3122
02:17:35.770 --> 02:17:39.800
<v Speaker 1>frauds at the lower ribs and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got the toothbrush like this with</v>

3123
02:17:39.801 --> 02:17:43.180
<v Speaker 1>their fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What she's like barely got the bottom of</v>

3124
02:17:43.181 --> 02:17:46.390
<v Speaker 1>the toothbrush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's knuckle deep in her own ass hall</v>

3125
02:17:46.570 --> 02:17:50.520
<v Speaker 1>and she barely has the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>toothbrush and she's got a kind of user</v>

3126
02:17:50.530 --> 02:17:54.880
<v Speaker 1>shit muscles to force it out when she</v>
<v Speaker 1>could pinch down on and pull it out and</v>

3127
02:17:54.881 --> 02:17:56.290
<v Speaker 1>sometimes she has to do it over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

3128
02:17:56.291 --> 02:17:59.470
<v Speaker 1>And again man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what you imagine you get a</v>

3129
02:17:59.471 --> 02:18:04.471
<v Speaker 1>drink prune juice to try to get that</v>
<v Speaker 1>toothbrush out of your household and you</v>

3130
02:18:04.991 --> 02:18:06.940
<v Speaker 1>got to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want it to hit the wall coming</v>

3131
02:18:06.941 --> 02:18:11.380
<v Speaker 1>out and then bounce back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to really open it wide so</v>

3132
02:18:11.381 --> 02:18:14.110
<v Speaker 1>like you probably got to have to wear</v>
<v Speaker 1>like long gloves,</v>

3133
02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:18.010
<v Speaker 1>you know like Lube your ass all up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just were like some of the gloves</v>

3134
02:18:18.011 --> 02:18:20.320
<v Speaker 1>you wear when you like clean and bundles</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sticks and shit.</v>

3135
02:18:20.610 --> 02:18:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know those ones made out of swings</v>

3136
02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:28.020
<v Speaker 1>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good grip on things that are slippery.</v>

3137
02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:34.030
<v Speaker 1>He's pulling your butter part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get that toothbrush out and</v>

3138
02:18:34.031 --> 02:18:37.240
<v Speaker 1>right when it gets out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear the keys in the door.</v>

3139
02:18:37.330 --> 02:18:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I got the pictures back and put it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the glass clink and you shut the door</v>

3140
02:18:42.671 --> 02:18:44.230
<v Speaker 1>and just wash your toothbrush off real</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>

3141
02:18:44.260 --> 02:18:46.570
<v Speaker 1>But you've got to dry it too because</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise should pick her toothbrush.</v>

3142
02:18:46.571 --> 02:18:48.370
<v Speaker 1>I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck is my toothbrush already</v>

3143
02:18:48.371 --> 02:18:53.371
<v Speaker 1>wet Donna?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like if you put toothpaste on a wet</v>

3144
02:18:53.381 --> 02:18:54.820
<v Speaker 1>toothbrush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that's a fucking wet</v>

3145
02:18:54.821 --> 02:18:56.830
<v Speaker 1>toothbrush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looking down and I think it looks</v>

3146
02:18:56.831 --> 02:18:58.660
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it when you feel that your</v>

3147
02:18:58.661 --> 02:18:59.411
<v Speaker 1>finger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3148
02:18:59.411 --> 02:19:00.640
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cold and wet.</v>

3149
02:19:01.090 --> 02:19:04.240
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is just using my toothbrush?</v>

3150
02:19:04.390 --> 02:19:06.340
<v Speaker 1>You think about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been at work for nine hours.</v>

3151
02:19:06.610 --> 02:19:08.560
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck is my toothbrush?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Dry.</v>

3152
02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:11.580
<v Speaker 1>It would be dry or something like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in her asshole.</v>

3153
02:19:11.890 --> 02:19:15.580
<v Speaker 1>All you smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It smells like Madison,</v>

3154
02:19:18.550 --> 02:19:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Madison and Jim Poultney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's smells like roundup</v>

3155
02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:28.040
<v Speaker 1>and went out into the fucking garage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got Some lawn spray.</v>

3156
02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:31.880
<v Speaker 6>Do you see that new thing that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you put in your mouth and it brushes</v>

3157
02:19:31.881 --> 02:19:34.670
<v Speaker 6>your teeth for you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Lazy?</v>

3158
02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:38.390
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In 30 seconds it's brushed your teeth.</v>

3159
02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:40.490
<v Speaker 6>Is it better?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3160
02:19:40.491 --> 02:19:43.040
<v Speaker 6>It's an interesting idea that we'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3161
02:19:43.041 --> 02:19:46.580
<v Speaker 6>you could just put it in your mouth in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the car or something like that in 30</v>

3162
02:19:46.581 --> 02:19:49.700
<v Speaker 6>seconds later.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how proven it is and it</v>

3163
02:19:49.701 --> 02:19:53.150
<v Speaker 6>seems like it would get down now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just weird.</v>

3164
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:58.510
<v Speaker 6>I wonder how much of an impact fluoride</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the water has on preventing tooth</v>

3165
02:19:58.551 --> 02:19:59.480
<v Speaker 6>decay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if any.</v>

3166
02:20:00.380 --> 02:20:03.350
<v Speaker 6>I've been reading about Florida and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>water and it's so hard to figure out</v>

3167
02:20:03.351 --> 02:20:08.351
<v Speaker 6>who's nuts this ten second automatic</v>
<v Speaker 6>toothbrush could save you hours every</v>

3168
02:20:08.481 --> 02:20:09.530
<v Speaker 6>year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's hot.</v>

3169
02:20:09.531 --> 02:20:10.910
<v Speaker 6>I hope she brushed her teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

3170
02:20:10.911 --> 02:20:12.440
<v Speaker 6>I put that in your pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Imagine of her.</v>

3171
02:20:12.460 --> 02:20:14.260
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Imagine for breath,</v>

3172
02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:17.440
<v Speaker 6>smell that she's out pretty would suck</v>
<v Speaker 6>lik that.</v>

3173
02:20:17.550 --> 02:20:19.570
<v Speaker 6>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is like a ball gag.</v>

3174
02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:22.820
<v Speaker 6>This is like if you were going to like</v>
<v Speaker 6>practice strengthening your neck,</v>

3175
02:20:22.850 --> 02:20:26.030
<v Speaker 6>you'd bite down on that thing and attach</v>
<v Speaker 6>that rope to like a bungee cord.</v>

3176
02:20:26.031 --> 02:20:30.410
<v Speaker 6>Like the iron neck device you that thing</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you chew down and it strengthens</v>

3177
02:20:30.411 --> 02:20:32.360
<v Speaker 6>your next book.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Makes Sense?</v>

3178
02:20:32.420 --> 02:20:35.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy go back to that guy like,</v>

3179
02:20:35.780 --> 02:20:37.970
<v Speaker 6>come on Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't care how much they're paying you</v>

3180
02:20:37.971 --> 02:20:40.250
<v Speaker 6>for this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's the same one and his girlfriend</v>

3181
02:20:40.251 --> 02:20:43.730
<v Speaker 6>comes by and kisses him on the cheek and</v>
<v Speaker 6>leaves like he doesn't need to have time</v>

3182
02:20:43.731 --> 02:20:47.450
<v Speaker 6>to get a good kiss on the lips because</v>
<v Speaker 6>you too busy sucking on this robot Dick.</v>

3183
02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:52.880
<v Speaker 6>This thing is just cleaning out your</v>
<v Speaker 6>face.</v>

3184
02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:55.760
<v Speaker 6>How about you brush your teeth like a</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking normal person?</v>

3185
02:20:56.060 --> 02:20:58.370
<v Speaker 6>Maybe have the newspaper open beside</v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

3186
02:20:58.610 --> 02:21:00.620
<v Speaker 6>I just wonder if it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that dedication.</v>

3187
02:21:00.770 --> 02:21:02.720
<v Speaker 6>Here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it better to go to the car wash or</v>

3188
02:21:02.721 --> 02:21:04.790
<v Speaker 6>wash your car by hand?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mm hmm.</v>

3189
02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:06.920
<v Speaker 6>Of course it's better to wash a car by</v>
<v Speaker 6>hand.</v>

3190
02:21:06.921 --> 02:21:08.330
<v Speaker 6>That's why hand washing costs more</v>
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>

3191
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:10.330
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it depends what car washing,</v>

3192
02:21:10.390 --> 02:21:11.690
<v Speaker 6>what's better,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's better,</v>

3193
02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:15.050
<v Speaker 6>what's better to give you your teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the attention they deserve and go over</v>

3194
02:21:15.051 --> 02:21:18.890
<v Speaker 6>each one with a fine brush or suck the</v>
<v Speaker 6>robot Dick.</v>

3195
02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:23.300
<v Speaker 6>And he cleans your teeth out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nazi.</v>

3380
02:28:57.140 --> 02:29:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like a troll to me when</v>

3381
02:29:00.170 --> 02:29:02.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that what a lot of this stuff</v>

3382
02:29:02.541 --> 02:29:06.770
<v Speaker 1>is being silly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're supposed to pretend that</v>

3383
02:29:06.771 --> 02:29:08.630
<v Speaker 1>that's not like the spirit of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet sometimes.</v>

3384
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:10.610
<v Speaker 1>That's what got me so mad about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole pepe,</v>

3385
02:29:10.611 --> 02:29:11.930
<v Speaker 1>the frog stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3386
02:29:11.931 --> 02:29:14.330
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this spirit of the Internet is in</v>

3387
02:29:14.331 --> 02:29:16.250
<v Speaker 1>fucking with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has been forever.</v>

3388
02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:18.290
<v Speaker 1>People are bored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're at work.</v>

3389
02:29:18.380 --> 02:29:21.620
<v Speaker 1>They come up with hilarious memes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them are really fucked up.</v>

3390
02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean that guy's a real Nazi or</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it mean he's just an asshole who's</v>

3391
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:27.950
<v Speaker 1>bored at work and he's mad at everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be that,</v>

3392
02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:30.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of them are like</v>

3393
02:29:30.981 --> 02:29:34.370
<v Speaker 1>real Nazis and how might have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just people fucking around.</v>

3394
02:29:35.180 --> 02:29:36.320
<v Speaker 1>That's like the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3395
02:29:36.350 --> 02:29:39.140
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so much of the Internet is people</v>

3396
02:29:39.141 --> 02:29:41.090
<v Speaker 1>fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to tell what's going on in</v>

3397
02:29:41.091 --> 02:29:44.540
<v Speaker 1>any given moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3398
02:29:44.541 --> 02:29:46.420
<v Speaker 1>like this flat earth thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3399
02:29:46.430 --> 02:29:48.180
<v Speaker 1>that's the great thing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't change.</v>

3400
02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.010
<v Speaker 1>It can't change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it'll change?</v>

3401
02:29:52.011 --> 02:29:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that really it'll get to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>point where they'll have so much control</v>

3402
02:29:55.911 --> 02:29:58.520
<v Speaker 1>over the Internet that there'll be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop content like that.</v>

3403
02:29:58.521 --> 02:30:03.521
<v Speaker 1>Like there'll be a closed down like</v>
<v Speaker 1>message boards or a social media where</v>

3404
02:30:03.621 --> 02:30:05.240
<v Speaker 1>people are allowed to talk about stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

3405
02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:07.540
<v Speaker 2>They do it in every other country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All must,</v>

3406
02:30:07.580 --> 02:30:08.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

3407
02:30:08.540 --> 02:30:11.150
<v Speaker 2>the main reason they want it is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>too many,</v>

3408
02:30:11.630 --> 02:30:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean net netflix takes up like 75% of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bandwidth right now.</v>

3409
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.761
<v Speaker 2>Does it really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3410
02:30:16.761 --> 02:30:20.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like something crazy where all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these videos and we're all,</v>

3411
02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:21.290
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to get worse.</v>

3412
02:30:21.291 --> 02:30:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Four K Eight K,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 gay.</v>

3413
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:25.670
<v Speaker 2>So they want to have control of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3414
02:30:25.760 --> 02:30:28.290
<v Speaker 2>if you're gonna use video or if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

3415
02:30:28.310 --> 02:30:31.190
<v Speaker 2>they want to like pretty much it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think they're saying</v>

3416
02:30:31.191 --> 02:30:31.420
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3417
02:30:31.420 --> 02:30:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of get it from their perspective.</v>

3418
02:30:33.791 --> 02:30:37.600
<v Speaker 1>If say they have a limited amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth and then the one application,</v>

3419
02:30:37.601 --> 02:30:40.480
<v Speaker 1>like Netflix is using up most of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth of paying the same amount of</v>

3420
02:30:40.481 --> 02:30:41.314
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3421
02:30:41.650 --> 02:30:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the case though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question I'm not sure about</v>

3422
02:30:44.321 --> 02:30:46.150
<v Speaker 1>is is there a limited amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth?</v>

3423
02:30:46.151 --> 02:30:49.780
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's always been an</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite amount of bandwidth,</v>

3424
02:30:49.800 --> 02:30:52.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would there ever be true socialist</v>

3425
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Commie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just wondering you bad for business.</v>

3426
02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:59.470
<v Speaker 1>I get the pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pipes might get clogged,</v>

3427
02:30:59.471 --> 02:31:01.750
<v Speaker 1>which could be a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all happening at once.</v>

3428
02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:04.630
<v Speaker 1>You would really freak me the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I found out there's a real pipe,</v>

3429
02:31:05.080 --> 02:31:06.770
<v Speaker 1>it goes across the bottom of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

3430
02:31:06.850 --> 02:31:07.683
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3431
02:31:07.930 --> 02:31:10.660
<v Speaker 1>So if you send an email from somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Australia,</v>

3432
02:31:10.661 --> 02:31:15.661
<v Speaker 1>there's a God damn pipe as someone laid</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the flat ocean of the flat earth</v>

3433
02:31:16.090 --> 02:31:17.830
<v Speaker 1>all the way to the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>

3434
02:31:17.980 --> 02:31:20.280
<v Speaker 1>those people have to be in on the flat</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth conspiracy as well.</v>

3435
02:31:20.310 --> 02:31:23.220
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does it just go by satellite?</v>

3436
02:31:23.221 --> 02:31:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have to go through this pipe</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways?</v>

3437
02:31:25.380 --> 02:31:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not be a pipe to Australia,</v>

3438
02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:29.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely a pipe to Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

3439
02:31:29.930 --> 02:31:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Trans Atlantic Communications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cable and transatlantic communications</v>

3440
02:31:33.061 --> 02:31:35.250
<v Speaker 1>cable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transatlantic communications cables,</v>

3441
02:31:35.251 --> 02:31:36.420
<v Speaker 1>a submarine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3442
02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Submarine Communications cable</v>
<v Speaker 1>connecting one side of the Atlantic</v>

3443
02:31:39.540 --> 02:31:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Ocean to the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After mid century,</v>

3444
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:45.720
<v Speaker 1>coaxial cable came into use with</v>
<v Speaker 1>amplifiers late in the century,</v>

3445
02:31:45.721 --> 02:31:47.750
<v Speaker 1>used for optical fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3446
02:31:47.880 --> 02:31:52.020
<v Speaker 1>and most now use optical amplifiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's only one cable.</v>

3447
02:31:52.021 --> 02:31:52.854
<v Speaker 1>It's only one</v>

3448
02:31:52.940 --> 02:31:54.040
<v Speaker 5>probably really big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And their mouths,</v>

3449
02:31:54.210 --> 02:31:56.270
<v Speaker 5>they can't be just one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this just made me think of something</v>

3450
02:31:56.271 --> 02:31:58.580
<v Speaker 5>else I wanted to show you that I just</v>
<v Speaker 5>found the other day that's kind of</v>

3451
02:31:58.581 --> 02:32:00.140
<v Speaker 5>scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That has to do with fiber optics</v>

3452
02:32:00.290 --> 02:32:01.123
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>

3453
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's time for another episode of</v>

3454
02:32:04.801 --> 02:32:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Vernon scares the world.</v>

3455
02:32:07.270 --> 02:32:12.070
<v Speaker 5>Me a link that showed that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people can hide a microphone.</v>

3456
02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:15.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how big and how well it can</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen inside of an ethernet cable.</v>

3457
02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:16.690
<v Speaker 5>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they were like,</v>

3458
02:32:16.691 --> 02:32:18.670
<v Speaker 5>check all your cables cause you never</v>
<v Speaker 5>know what could happen.</v>

3459
02:32:18.730 --> 02:32:23.080
<v Speaker 5>And then so I started looking through</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tweets of that and it showed there</v>

3460
02:32:23.081 --> 02:32:26.740
<v Speaker 5>was a link to a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a company that made a fiber cable.</v>

3461
02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:30.490
<v Speaker 5>And the description of what the fiber</v>
<v Speaker 5>cable could do is that it could listen</v>

3462
02:32:31.030 --> 02:32:32.980
<v Speaker 5>the entire length of the cable.</v>

3463
02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:35.160
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

3464
02:32:35.160 --> 02:32:38.610
<v Speaker 5>it was sort of saying it was just to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>able to listen for like a water</v>

3465
02:32:38.611 --> 02:32:40.500
<v Speaker 5>underground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like water pipes that are leaking and</v>

3466
02:32:40.860 --> 02:32:43.950
<v Speaker 5>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it doesn't say the limit of what it</v>

3467
02:32:43.951 --> 02:32:48.100
<v Speaker 5>can here and where it's being used,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is uh,</v>

3468
02:32:48.290 --> 02:32:48.950
<v Speaker 5>alarming.</v>

3469
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if it turned out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

3470
02:32:52.220 --> 02:32:56.480
<v Speaker 1>every wire in everyone's house is</v>
<v Speaker 1>secretly a microphone and the government</v>

3471
02:32:56.660 --> 02:33:00.260
<v Speaker 1>has been years ahead with this data and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tuning into everything you've said at</v>

3472
02:33:00.261 --> 02:33:01.230
<v Speaker 1>every moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>

3473
02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:04.680
<v Speaker 1>all your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the microphone inside of the</v>

3474
02:33:05.710 --> 02:33:06.920
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3475
02:33:07.550 --> 02:33:11.330
<v Speaker 1>That little tiny thing is a microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3476
02:33:11.900 --> 02:33:14.000
<v Speaker 1>And then where's your God now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3477
02:33:14.990 --> 02:33:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leat kids.</v>

3478
02:33:16.490 --> 02:33:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I bet he spells it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>L three,</v>

3479
02:33:18.081 --> 02:33:20.270
<v Speaker 1>three T.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'll be able to find</v>

3480
02:33:20.271 --> 02:33:20.571
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three.</v>

3481
02:33:20.571 --> 02:33:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Seven is three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

3482
02:33:21.860 --> 02:33:22.693
<v Speaker 1>seven</v>

3483
02:33:22.890 --> 02:33:24.540
<v Speaker 5>l seven three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three,</v>

3484
02:33:24.541 --> 02:33:26.610
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

3485
02:33:28.110 --> 02:33:29.400
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I'm going to go to find</v>

3486
02:33:29.401 --> 02:33:31.200
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like taking a shit while I was</v>

3487
02:33:31.201 --> 02:33:33.690
<v Speaker 5>looking through this deep tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's like 5,000 things in here now.</v>

3488
02:33:33.691 --> 02:33:35.640
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a scary thing.</v>

3489
02:33:35.641 --> 02:33:38.040
<v Speaker 5>And the fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't really know you could even hear</v>

3490
02:33:38.041 --> 02:33:41.130
<v Speaker 5>audio through fiber that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that it's used,</v>

3491
02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:42.630
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like uh,</v>

3492
02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:44.940
<v Speaker 5>the light cable you can use in the back</v>
<v Speaker 5>of your any box.</v>

3493
02:33:44.941 --> 02:33:48.270
<v Speaker 5>That little red light that's always on</v>
<v Speaker 5>is looking for a fiber audio cable,</v>

3494
02:33:48.271 --> 02:33:49.440
<v Speaker 5>which is the best,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

3495
02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:51.060
<v Speaker 1>that's how it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike's Wick told me once,</v>

3496
02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Mike Swick was working for the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States government in Russia and they had</v>

3497
02:33:56.371 --> 02:33:59.160
<v Speaker 1>like a Russian ambassador,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Russian embassy building,</v>

3498
02:33:59.670 --> 02:34:01.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American US embassy building in Russia.</v>

3499
02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:06.810
<v Speaker 1>And they had developed these devices</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they found in the walls of the</v>

3500
02:34:06.811 --> 02:34:11.811
<v Speaker 1>building that were powered by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement of the building.</v>

3501
02:34:12.750 --> 02:34:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Like cause the move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a skyscraper would have a</v>

3502
02:34:15.271 --> 02:34:18.130
<v Speaker 1>certain mass sway through the wind and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had figured</v>

3503
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:22.960
<v Speaker 6>out to how to make a device that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>require any sort of additional power</v>

3504
02:34:22.961 --> 02:34:24.880
<v Speaker 6>source other than the movement of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>building.</v>

3505
02:34:24.900 --> 02:34:26.440
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it could transmit sound.</v>

3506
02:34:26.441 --> 02:34:28.610
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this stuff is so far ahead of anything</v>

3507
02:34:28.690 --> 02:34:32.500
<v Speaker 6>we knew even existed and they were using</v>
<v Speaker 6>this in the building spine people.</v>

3508
02:34:32.890 --> 02:34:37.890
<v Speaker 6>Mike Swick told me about that in like</v>
<v Speaker 6>2002 and it happened to him way before</v>

3509
02:34:39.341 --> 02:34:42.250
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so we might be,</v>

3510
02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:44.620
<v Speaker 6>you know who the fuck knows what they</v>
<v Speaker 6>can,</v>

3511
02:34:44.650 --> 02:34:48.640
<v Speaker 6>I mean John Edward Snowden does might be</v>
<v Speaker 6>the reason why they kept that guy</v>

3512
02:34:48.641 --> 02:34:53.380
<v Speaker 6>running like because they want to</v>
<v Speaker 6>discourage anybody coming out.</v>

3513
02:34:53.381 --> 02:34:56.380
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at any moment we're going to find out</v>

3514
02:34:56.530 --> 02:34:59.050
<v Speaker 6>that all of our phones are on 24 hours a</v>
<v Speaker 6>day.</v>

3515
02:34:59.051 --> 02:35:01.780
<v Speaker 6>Whether they're at of batteries are not</v>
<v Speaker 6>that there's a certain amount of battery</v>

3516
02:35:01.781 --> 02:35:03.640
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think your phone retains and the</v>

3517
02:35:03.641 --> 02:35:04.570
<v Speaker 6>government could listen.</v>

3518
02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:07.960
<v Speaker 6>They know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The GPS tracker is tracking your phone,</v>

3519
02:35:07.961 --> 02:35:10.390
<v Speaker 6>whether it's on or off everywhere you</v>
<v Speaker 6>go.</v>

3520
02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:13.540
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of those phones actually do work</v>

3521
02:35:13.780 --> 02:35:16.420
<v Speaker 6>with gps when the phone is on airplane</v>
<v Speaker 6>mode.</v>

3522
02:35:16.750 --> 02:35:18.430
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well it's just,</v>

3523
02:35:18.460 --> 02:35:19.390
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

3524
02:35:19.391 --> 02:35:23.650
<v Speaker 6>There's a gps chip in your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why find your phone works.</v>

3525
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:26.040
<v Speaker 6>Like you can go on apple,</v>
<v Speaker 6>find your phone.</v>

3526
02:35:26.060 --> 02:35:27.160
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my phone's in the Bronx.</v>

3527
02:35:27.170 --> 02:35:29.050
<v Speaker 6>Hey leave it there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't get shot.</v>

3528
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:30.820
<v Speaker 6>But listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

3529
02:35:31.180 --> 02:35:35.590
<v Speaker 6>that's how they can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They can find your Jamie once they take</v>

3530
02:35:35.591 --> 02:35:36.424
<v Speaker 6>your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3531
02:35:37.020 --> 02:35:39.590
<v Speaker 6>if they give you those robot eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's in the air pod.</v>

3532
02:35:39.591 --> 02:35:42.400
<v Speaker 6>That's in the Apple Watch too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's in all your apple computers.</v>

3533
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:44.500
<v Speaker 6>Lots everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3534
02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:46.990
<v Speaker 6>How's that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because she lives shit.</v>

3535
02:35:47.020 --> 02:35:48.400
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like it.</v>

<v Speaker 6>So I'll tell you what.</v>

3537

<v Speaker 6>I'm digging these airpods I've been</v>
<v Speaker 6>using it a lot like fucking awesome.</v>

3538
02:35:54.580 --> 02:35:56.260
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was so skeptical.</v>

3539
02:35:56.470 --> 02:35:58.720
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I keep with me all the time too.</v>

3540
02:35:58.721 --> 02:36:01.270
<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My favorite thing about them is that the</v>

3541
02:36:01.271 --> 02:36:04.390
<v Speaker 6>case that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cause that's one thing I always had with</v>

3542
02:36:04.391 --> 02:36:05.770
<v Speaker 6>Bluetooth headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always like,</v>

3543
02:36:05.771 --> 02:36:07.240
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I forgot to charge my head and look at</v>

3544
02:36:07.241 --> 02:36:08.710
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] welcome to the future</v>

3545
02:36:08.711 --> 02:36:13.270
<v Speaker 6>pitches</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I stick them in Miami and worry</v>

3546
02:36:13.271 --> 02:36:14.740
<v Speaker 6>about them falling out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't really fall out.</v>

3547
02:36:14.770 --> 02:36:16.510
<v Speaker 6>They're hard to fall out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had to like hit it.</v>

3548
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:20.930
<v Speaker 6>I made them fall out of the gym when I</v>
<v Speaker 6>was doing Chin ups because my shoulder's</v>

3549
02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:24.130
<v Speaker 6>touched my ears and I made him fall out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when one goes out,</v>

3550
02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:25.470
<v Speaker 6>the other one stops.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3551
02:36:25.620 --> 02:36:27.850
<v Speaker 6>Which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you have the Apple Watch,</v>

3552
02:36:28.410 --> 02:36:29.230
<v Speaker 6>which much?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

3553
02:36:29.230 --> 02:36:32.050
<v Speaker 6>But then you don't need your iphone for</v>
<v Speaker 6>music too much.</v>

3554
02:36:32.051 --> 02:36:34.330
<v Speaker 6>You're using your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Got To draw lines.</v>

3555
02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:37.960
<v Speaker 6>It's a better for jogging so you don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>have your phone in your pocket when</v>

3556
02:36:37.961 --> 02:36:38.800
<v Speaker 6>you're listening to music.</v>

3557
02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:41.710
<v Speaker 6>I have a fanny pack that is a neoprene</v>
<v Speaker 6>waistband.</v>

3558
02:36:41.830 --> 02:36:44.530
<v Speaker 6>My phone sits in there perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Car Keys.</v>

3559
02:36:44.740 --> 02:36:45.640
<v Speaker 6>It's extra weight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bro.</v>

3560
02:36:45.730 --> 02:36:47.200
<v Speaker 6>Not No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't mind.</v>

3561
02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:50.830
<v Speaker 6>I'm stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm running with my dog.</v>

3562
02:36:50.831 --> 02:36:52.640
<v Speaker 6>I'm not shaving any seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do a lot of calling,</v>

3563
02:36:53.370 --> 02:36:57.270
<v Speaker 6>trying to get him out of the bushes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My dog fucking loves it now.</v>

3564
02:36:57.271 --> 02:36:59.190
<v Speaker 6>He still hates going in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>

3565
02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:01.000
<v Speaker 6>he's more reluctant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's less reluctant.</v>

3566
02:37:01.001 --> 02:37:03.130
<v Speaker 6>He gets right up to the car cause he</v>
<v Speaker 6>knows we're going to go run and he loves</v>

3567
02:37:03.131 --> 02:37:04.990
<v Speaker 6>running.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then when we come back,</v>

3568
02:37:05.020 --> 02:37:07.000
<v Speaker 6>a lot of times I give him a bath too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3569
02:37:07.001 --> 02:37:09.130
<v Speaker 6>he loves that leash.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No leash,</v>

3570
02:37:09.131 --> 02:37:11.200
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a really good,</v>

3571
02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:13.000
<v Speaker 6>he really listens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He'll wake me,</v>

3572
02:37:13.030 --> 02:37:16.270
<v Speaker 6>obviously he's</v>
<v Speaker 6>some fucking goofball</v>

3573
02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:20.720
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I posted a video and I was like a fool.</v>

3574
02:37:20.721 --> 02:37:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I read through some of the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them said,</v>

3575
02:37:22.460 --> 02:37:24.740
<v Speaker 1>don't let him get ahead of you bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the alpha.</v>

3576
02:37:25.450 --> 02:37:26.271
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3577
02:37:26.271 --> 02:37:29.990
<v Speaker 1>I hope you're either joking around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe trolled me.</v>

3578
02:37:29.991 --> 02:37:32.270
<v Speaker 1>You might've told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might be just a dummy.</v>

3579
02:37:32.660 --> 02:37:34.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking you probably more of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dummy.</v>

3580
02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:36.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think your dog ahead of you when you</v>

3581
02:37:36.261 --> 02:37:38.240
<v Speaker 1>walk on a leash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid or otherwise,</v>

3582
02:37:38.270 --> 02:37:39.890
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your dog's walking you.</v>

3583
02:37:39.891 --> 02:37:43.280
<v Speaker 1>You dumb cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're always going to be in</v>

3584
02:37:43.281 --> 02:37:45.020
<v Speaker 1>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the dogs in front.</v>

3585
02:37:45.050 --> 02:37:46.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the other leash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're wrong,</v>

3586
02:37:46.941 --> 02:37:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to walk next to you.</v>

3587
02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's what Cesar Milan tells</v>

3588
02:37:52.100 --> 02:37:52.911
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3589
02:37:52.911 --> 02:37:53.744
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

3590
02:37:56.930 --> 02:37:59.210
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not running with his dog.</v>

3591
02:37:59.240 --> 02:38:01.190
<v Speaker 1>I run with my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My top totally listens to me.</v>

3592
02:38:01.490 --> 02:38:03.200
<v Speaker 1>And when he gets to far goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop dude.</v>

3593
02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:05.420
<v Speaker 1>And he stops like he's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3594
02:38:05.421 --> 02:38:06.141
<v Speaker 1>come on back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>

3595
02:38:06.141 --> 02:38:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take a breather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he'll come back and hang out with</v>

3596
02:38:08.421 --> 02:38:10.610
<v Speaker 1>me like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't let them off the leash.</v>

3597
02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:13.820
<v Speaker 1>I liked the fact that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he likes to be free.</v>

3598
02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:16.150
<v Speaker 1>He likes to run around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to run around,</v>

3599
02:38:16.190 --> 02:38:17.470
<v Speaker 1>let them have a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a sweet dog.</v>

3600
02:38:17.471 --> 02:38:19.590
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to be mean to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3601
02:38:19.730 --> 02:38:21.310
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my new dog is,</v>

3602
02:38:21.350 --> 02:38:24.650
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know how to use a leash and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been trained to not use a leash,</v>

3603
02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:28.640
<v Speaker 1>but I don't trust it so much because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like one car honking his horn or</v>

3604
02:38:28.641 --> 02:38:31.400
<v Speaker 1>something and he freaks out and runs</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the traffic or something.</v>

3605
02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When his cars,</v>

3606
02:38:32.990 --> 02:38:35.100
<v Speaker 1>I always have him on a leash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime there's cars that had him on a</v>

3607
02:38:35.101 --> 02:38:37.130
<v Speaker 1>leash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I get out of the car and we go</v>

3608
02:38:37.131 --> 02:38:38.390
<v Speaker 1>off into the trails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3609
02:38:38.391 --> 02:38:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people see him,</v>

3610
02:38:39.441 --> 02:38:41.770
<v Speaker 1>he's like the nicest dog ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody meets him.</v>

3611
02:38:41.771 --> 02:38:42.231
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3612
02:38:42.231 --> 02:38:43.280
<v Speaker 1>he's so sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3613
02:38:43.281 --> 02:38:46.280
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like you have to worry about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it being dangerous.</v>

3614
02:38:47.270 --> 02:38:48.410
<v Speaker 1>He just likes to run around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3615
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're watching like a little</v>

3616
02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:52.130
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid.</v>

3617
02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you bring him here so we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at him?</v>

3618
02:38:54.650 --> 02:38:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's at home.</v>

3619
02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sabine is yard man.</v>

3620
02:38:57.630 --> 02:39:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Go in the pool and swam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He swims whenever he wants too.</v>

3621
02:39:00.170 --> 02:39:02.660
<v Speaker 1>That'd be funny if you were the new</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic that always brings his dog</v>

3622
02:39:02.661 --> 02:39:04.910
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you Brian Golden retriever.</v>

3623
02:39:05.250 --> 02:39:07.250
<v Speaker 1>He's 75 pound dog everywhere.</v>

3624
02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Tales knocking people's drinks or ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>hall.</v>

3625
02:39:11.150 --> 02:39:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Can you fucking dog out of here man</v>
<v Speaker 1>tales.</v>

3626
02:39:14.090 --> 02:39:16.490
<v Speaker 1>So many people are so stupid with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs.</v>

3627
02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Like their dog is like a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they can't leave it alone anywhere.</v>

3628
02:39:20.030 --> 02:39:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Eliza can't leave it anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3629
02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Eliza's I've seen her without the dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally.</v>

3630
02:39:25.350 --> 02:39:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he holds it.</v>

3631
02:39:27.650 --> 02:39:30.170
<v Speaker 1>The husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he clings onto that thing.</v>

3632
02:39:30.171 --> 02:39:32.180
<v Speaker 1>She's a sweet dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's definitely a super,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's another,</v>

3637
02:39:38.241 --> 02:39:40.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good argument for not living in the</v>

3638
02:39:40.971 --> 02:39:42.860
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Live somewhere where your dog can be</v>

3639
02:39:42.861 --> 02:39:44.000
<v Speaker 1>free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3640
02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:46.550
<v Speaker 1>live somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can go out the back yard and throw a</v>

3641
02:39:46.551 --> 02:39:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Frisbee for your dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3642
02:39:48.141 --> 02:39:50.240
<v Speaker 1>go go on hikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goddammit.</v>

3643
02:39:50.270 --> 02:39:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Dumpy stuck in that red and white horror</v>
<v Speaker 1>show of tail lights and headlight</v>

3644
02:39:57.021 --> 02:39:59.150
<v Speaker 1>traffic.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

3646
02:40:02.481 --> 02:40:05.420
<v Speaker 1>What's that going to be like in 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the skywalk?</v>

3647
02:40:05.421 --> 02:40:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't we be planning for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that's just going to be in the</v>

3648
02:40:09.111 --> 02:40:11.150
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to be like 20 feet up.</v>

3649
02:40:11.390 --> 02:40:12.890
<v Speaker 1>You might've been right with Santa</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barbara.</v>

3650
02:40:13.050 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 1>You know why I think you might've</v>

3651
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:17.580
<v Speaker 6>been right because Santa Barbara's only</v>
<v Speaker 6>an hour away so he'd go up there.</v>

3652
02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:20.400
<v Speaker 6>It's an hour away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Important Shit.</v>

3653
02:40:20.401 --> 02:40:22.470
<v Speaker 6>We could always come back to drive us</v>
<v Speaker 6>in.</v>

3654
02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:24.240
<v Speaker 6>Is that how that works then?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3659
02:40:31.411 --> 02:40:32.790
<v Speaker 6>He's probably not going to do the Santa</v>
<v Speaker 6>Barbara.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Same County.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3661
02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:36.090

<v Speaker 6>San Francisco.</v>

3662
02:40:36.091 --> 02:40:39.870
<v Speaker 6>Have you heard of Tesla loop in Los</v>

<v Speaker 6>Smart.</v>

3682
02:41:29.910 --> 02:41:32.130
<v Speaker 6>It's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's free advertising for the cars.</v>

3683
02:41:32.131 --> 02:41:33.360
<v Speaker 6>People get in and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit,</v>

02:41:33.361 --> 02:41:35.550
<v Speaker 6>this thing is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you see that guy giant</v>

3685
02:41:35.551 --> 02:41:36.600
<v Speaker 6>dashboard and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 6>What is that?</v>

3687
02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:40.640
<v Speaker 6>Is it like a airplane seat?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your bias?</v>

3688
02:41:40.650 --> 02:41:42.030
<v Speaker 6>You could be sitting with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3689
02:41:42.340 --> 02:41:45.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's $39 just by the seat next to</v>

3690
02:41:45.830 --> 02:41:50.430
<v Speaker 6>have someone as far a bus that goes</v>
<v Speaker 6>every day now from San Francisco to la,</v>

3691
02:41:50.431 --> 02:41:53.580
<v Speaker 6>that's like a overnight sleeping bus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Were you sleeping a pod and they have</v>

3692
02:41:53.581 --> 02:41:54.480
<v Speaker 6>like really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3693
02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:56.910
<v Speaker 6>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's obviously not the fastest way to</v>

3694
02:41:56.911 --> 02:41:59.070
<v Speaker 6>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you need to go overnight and you</v>

3695
02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:02.700
<v Speaker 6>kind have that time to rest was a driver</v>
<v Speaker 6>stays away.</v>

3696
02:42:02.790 --> 02:42:03.720
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the scary,</v>

3697
02:42:03.721 --> 02:42:06.810
<v Speaker 6>I mean I hope the same with the pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a driver sleeping,</v>

3698
02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:10.280
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it's a pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all shot on auto pilot.</v>

3699
02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:13.290
<v Speaker 6>Pilot can adjust,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but maybe those tests of buses,</v>

3700
02:42:13.380 --> 02:42:15.510
<v Speaker 6>maybe a tussle bus like when them big</v>
<v Speaker 6>ass,</v>

3701
02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:17.940
<v Speaker 6>those,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those big giant trucks that he's making</v>

3702
02:42:17.941 --> 02:42:21.810
<v Speaker 6>now put pods in the back of the truck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's only three or 500 miles though,</v>

3703
02:42:21.811 --> 02:42:22.830
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So far?</v>

3704
02:42:22.831 --> 02:42:25.520
<v Speaker 6>I think 500 miles Max one I think so you</v>
<v Speaker 6>go,</v>

3705
02:42:25.530 --> 02:42:27.780
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you stop and San Luis Obispo.</v>

3706
02:42:27.870 --> 02:42:31.230
<v Speaker 6>I start carrying battery charge.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How long they have to charge for.</v>

3707
02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:36.660
<v Speaker 6>What is the distance in miles from La to</v>
<v Speaker 6>San Francisco?</v>

3708
02:42:36.690 --> 02:42:39.680
<v Speaker 6>If you had to guess?</v>
<v Speaker 6>800 and I don't know.</v>

3709
02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:41.040
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3710
02:42:41.041 --> 02:42:41.521
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3711
02:42:41.521 --> 02:42:42.840
<v Speaker 6>not nearly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not nearly.</v>

3712
02:42:42.900 --> 02:42:47.900
<v Speaker 6>I would say probably in the 400 it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>like 420470470 you think?</v>

3713
02:42:49.170 --> 02:42:49.831
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3714
02:42:49.831 --> 02:42:50.810
<v Speaker 6>I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3715
02:42:50.910 --> 02:42:52.720
<v Speaker 6>You say 800?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I say for 25.</v>

3717
02:42:55.290 --> 02:42:56.370
<v Speaker 6>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's good bet.</v>

3718
02:42:57.030 --> 02:42:58.860
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's right though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's way less.</v>

3719
02:42:59.330 --> 02:43:02.700
<v Speaker 6>Is it from Los Angeles to San Francisco?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's see.</v>

3720
02:43:02.910 --> 02:43:07.430
<v Speaker 6>381</v>
<v Speaker 6>82 miles from lawson.</v>

3721
02:43:07.470 --> 02:43:09.240
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Interesting.</v>

3722
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:14.320
<v Speaker 6>What's that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That means you have a raven bro.</v>

3723
02:43:14.630 --> 02:43:16.160
<v Speaker 6>They got straight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3724
02:43:16.440 --> 02:43:17.320
<v Speaker 6>Straight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then go above</v>

3725
02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:20.530
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's never heard that.</v>

3726
02:43:20.531 --> 02:43:21.880
<v Speaker 6>Never heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's cool.</v>

3727
02:43:22.420 --> 02:43:24.850
<v Speaker 6>Say that kind of talk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm used to it and I thought you fucking</v>

3728
02:43:25.210 --> 02:43:27.540
<v Speaker 6>city slickers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3729
02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:29.290
<v Speaker 6>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3730
02:43:29.291 --> 02:43:32.140
<v Speaker 6>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a regular tesla can't do that.</v>

3731
02:43:32.350 --> 02:43:36.190
<v Speaker 6>But they said the new one would be able</v>
<v Speaker 6>to drive all the way there and back.</v>

3732
02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:39.190
<v Speaker 6>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cause that was one of their sayings.</v>

3733
02:43:39.191 --> 02:43:41.910
<v Speaker 6>They said you could drive from San</v>
<v Speaker 6>Francisco to La and back will.</v>

3734
02:43:41.911 --> 02:43:45.520
<v Speaker 6>You definitely couldn't do that because</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's more than 600.</v>

3735
02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:47.890
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's more maybe the edge of the</v>

3736
02:43:47.891 --> 02:43:50.740
<v Speaker 6>county.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe Carolee,</v>

3737
02:43:51.100 --> 02:43:52.360
<v Speaker 6>let's lock.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stop lying.</v>

3738
02:43:52.870 --> 02:43:54.400
<v Speaker 6>Stop lying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You gonna leave me stranded in the</v>

3739
02:43:54.401 --> 02:43:57.400
<v Speaker 6>desert.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to be somewhere halfway back</v>

3740
02:43:57.401 --> 02:43:59.980
<v Speaker 6>where there's no water and that stupid</v>
<v Speaker 6>piece of Shits gonna run out of</v>

3741
02:43:59.981 --> 02:44:00.670
<v Speaker 6>batteries.</v>

3742
02:44:00.670 --> 02:44:02.590
<v Speaker 6>Stop lying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just say it's awesome.</v>

3743
02:44:02.591 --> 02:44:04.810
<v Speaker 6>It goes 600 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't say you can go to San Francisco</v>

3744
02:44:04.811 --> 02:44:05.680
<v Speaker 6>and back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't,</v>

3745
02:44:05.950 --> 02:44:08.080
<v Speaker 6>you shouldn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They should make it a,</v>

3746
02:44:08.081 --> 02:44:10.330
<v Speaker 6>the electric cars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They should make it wireless charging</v>

3747
02:44:10.331 --> 02:44:12.010
<v Speaker 6>and then have the [inaudible] road</v>
<v Speaker 6>speed.</v>

3748
02:44:12.011 --> 02:44:14.140
<v Speaker 6>Like big mats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they've talked about too.</v>

3749
02:44:14.141 --> 02:44:14.891
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3750
02:44:14.891 --> 02:44:16.270
<v Speaker 6>I think they have talked about doing</v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

3751
02:44:16.690 --> 02:44:20.230
<v Speaker 6>They've talked about having people in</v>
<v Speaker 6>some sort of tracks where you know you</v>

3752
02:44:20.231 --> 02:44:23.110
<v Speaker 6>can't change lanes unless like you're in</v>
<v Speaker 6>a specific spot.</v>

3753
02:44:23.111 --> 02:44:26.530
<v Speaker 6>And that that track charges the the lane</v>
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>

3754
02:44:26.660 --> 02:44:28.990
<v Speaker 6>It'd basically be in your own little</v>
<v Speaker 6>trolley car.</v>

3755
02:44:29.140 --> 02:44:32.050
<v Speaker 6>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Knows man.</v>

3756
02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:34.330
<v Speaker 6>I think the idea of driving your own car</v>
<v Speaker 6>though,</v>

3757
02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:37.150
<v Speaker 6>that's on the way out for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think we only have like a few,</v>

3758
02:44:37.630 --> 02:44:40.210
<v Speaker 6>maybe a decade or so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>More of that shit.</v>

3759
02:44:40.450 --> 02:44:40.930
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mike,</v>

3760
02:44:40.930 --> 02:44:42.880
<v Speaker 6>Mike Carr would just with the lane</v>
<v Speaker 6>guidance,</v>

3761
02:44:42.881 --> 02:44:44.650
<v Speaker 6>you know that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did it on the way here.</v>

3762
02:44:44.830 --> 02:44:49.240
<v Speaker 6>I barely drove off from Burbank to here</v>
<v Speaker 6>just because of my link.</v>

3763
02:44:49.270 --> 02:44:52.690
<v Speaker 6>My car just drives itself pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just have to put my finger on it so it</v>

3764
02:44:52.691 --> 02:44:55.690
<v Speaker 6>knows that my fingers on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you think,</v>

3765
02:44:55.691 --> 02:44:56.710
<v Speaker 6>man?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think like,</v>

3766
02:44:57.760 --> 02:44:59.590
<v Speaker 6>do you think people start moving out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>la?</v>

3767
02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:01.660
<v Speaker 6>You think people will realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look at this and go,</v>

3768
02:45:01.661 --> 02:45:03.760
<v Speaker 6>this is unsustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got to get out now.</v>

3769
02:45:03.820 --> 02:45:06.100
<v Speaker 6>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'll take something like a fucking</v>

3770
02:45:06.101 --> 02:45:08.980
<v Speaker 6>earthquake or something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Earthquake or thanksgiving.</v>

3771
02:45:08.981 --> 02:45:12.190
<v Speaker 6>Hollywood continues to die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know Hollywood's not going to</v>

3772
02:45:12.191 --> 02:45:14.770
<v Speaker 6>continue to die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now it with Youtube and people are doing</v>

3773
02:45:14.771 --> 02:45:17.290
<v Speaker 6>it in their houses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't need to be in Los Angeles</v>

3774
02:45:17.291 --> 02:45:18.010
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could.</v>

3775
02:45:18.010 --> 02:45:20.830
<v Speaker 6>That is true that people are making</v>
<v Speaker 6>shitloads of money just from their</v>

3776
02:45:20.831 --> 02:45:23.140
<v Speaker 6>fucking basement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is true.</v>

3777
02:45:23.230 --> 02:45:25.420
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then the tech community is booming</v>

3778
02:45:25.421 --> 02:45:28.180
<v Speaker 6>and other cities to like Seattle has a</v>
<v Speaker 6>huge tech community.</v>

3779
02:45:28.240 --> 02:45:31.360
<v Speaker 6>You still have to come here though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if you're only here for four or five</v>

3780
02:45:31.361 --> 02:45:33.490
<v Speaker 6>days out of the month,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are you considering that,</v>

3781
02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:37.060
<v Speaker 6>why would you have to come here?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Work for a cooperate?</v>

3782
02:45:37.061 --> 02:45:39.750
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if someone just wants to</v>
<v Speaker 6>stay in La,</v>

3783
02:45:40.090 --> 02:45:42.120
<v Speaker 6>you know what the fuck he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Listen to them.</v>

3784
02:45:43.150 --> 02:45:45.000
<v Speaker 6>There's a reason why when youtube</v>
<v Speaker 6>started,</v>

3785
02:45:45.010 --> 02:45:47.240
<v Speaker 6>all the big people moved here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They didn't have to move here then they</v>

3786
02:45:47.241 --> 02:45:49.570
<v Speaker 6>were all making money at home.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'd be like the glamorous thing to</v>

3787
02:45:49.571 --> 02:45:51.880
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Youtube does have offices here.</v>

3788
02:45:52.540 --> 02:45:54.400
<v Speaker 6>The glamorous thing to do I think is</v>
<v Speaker 6>part of it.</v>

3789
02:45:54.401 --> 02:45:55.420
<v Speaker 6>Like come on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're gonna move to La.</v>

3790
02:45:55.470 --> 02:45:57.910
<v Speaker 6>If they made the officer's here though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cause everyone was here.</v>

3791
02:45:57.911 --> 02:45:59.830
<v Speaker 6>That's right bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So well we're here.</v>

3792
02:46:00.250 --> 02:46:02.230
<v Speaker 6>Why we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They go to the offices and he'd be here.</v>

3793
02:46:02.350 --> 02:46:04.210
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the one thing that keeps me,</v>

3794
02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:07.990
<v Speaker 6>there's the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's the podcast and having a great</v>

3795
02:46:08.020 --> 02:46:10.250
<v Speaker 6>supply of guests and being around</v>

3796
02:46:10.250 --> 02:46:11.230
<v Speaker 1>all my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3797
02:46:11.250 --> 02:46:15.080
<v Speaker 1>this is the reasons to stay here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we could just have our mass exodus.</v>

3798
02:46:16.190 --> 02:46:19.310
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get everybody to make enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>money when they could just pull up and</v>

3799
02:46:19.311 --> 02:46:22.910
<v Speaker 1>bail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody's got to be able</v>

3800
02:46:22.911 --> 02:46:27.290
<v Speaker 1>to just pull up and bail and just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>start a new community.</v>

3801
02:46:27.890 --> 02:46:32.690
<v Speaker 1>We could just all move next to doug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stan hope too much NYC and you don't,</v>

3802
02:46:32.691 --> 02:46:34.910

<v Speaker 1>You gotta make your own thing.</v>

3803
02:46:34.940 --> 02:46:39.200
<v Speaker 1>I think we go to like Santa Ynez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go to some weird cow country type</v>

3804
02:46:39.201 --> 02:46:41.360
<v Speaker 1>place or people who have their own</v>

02:46:42.730 --> 02:46:45.110
<v Speaker 1>No where like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The purge happens like that and then</v>

3822
02:47:21.080 --> 02:47:24.590
<v Speaker 1>route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One a from a giant landslide and they</v>

02:47:28.851 --> 02:47:31.790

3826
02:47:31.820 --> 02:47:35.360
<v Speaker 1>over the landslide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know when and they want</v>

3827
02:47:35.361 --> 02:47:36.290
<v Speaker 1>to let it settle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the two stages of the landslide.</v>

3853
02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:45.080
<v Speaker 1>They show it before and then they show</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second stage and then the third</v>

3854
02:48:45.081 --> 02:48:47.270
<v Speaker 1>stage where it finally is.</v>

3857
02:48:51.830 --> 02:48:54.410
<v Speaker 1>they have satellite images of what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like.</v>

3858
02:48:54.411 --> 02:48:55.550
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how much fell off,</v>

3859
02:48:55.551 --> 02:48:55.790

<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

3861
02:48:56.930 --> 02:49:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Just so what do you have to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't even go anywhere near</v>

3862
02:49:00.801 --> 02:49:02.720
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

3863
02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:05.390
<v Speaker 1>don't drive there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of keep following some of</v>

3864
02:49:05.391 --> 02:49:06.890
<v Speaker 1>these houses right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two guys.</v>

3865
02:49:06.900 --> 02:49:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Fuck I'm screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so fucked.</v>

3866
02:49:10.111 --> 02:49:12.990
<v Speaker 1>It's going to keep falling like more</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts are going to fall and they think</v>

3867
02:49:12.991 --> 02:49:17.991
<v Speaker 1>part of it is the root system isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong enough to keep the uh,</v>

3868
02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:19.293
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3869
02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:21.990
<v Speaker 1>you know like the more trees and roots</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

3870
02:49:21.991 --> 02:49:24.870
<v Speaker 1>the less likely it is to have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>landslides I guess because the trees and</v>

3871
02:49:24.871 --> 02:49:29.620
<v Speaker 1>the root system keep all the dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then if you have poor rainfall then</v>

3872
02:49:29.630 --> 02:49:31.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trees don't grow as much and I have</v>

3873
02:49:31.690 --> 02:49:34.440
<v Speaker 1>as much weeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have as much shit on the side</v>

3874
02:49:34.441 --> 02:49:35.640
<v Speaker 1>of the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's like,</v>

3875
02:49:35.690 --> 02:49:39.270
<v Speaker 1>you ever seen me drive by Malibu and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got like cement all up on the side</v>

3876
02:49:39.271 --> 02:49:42.000
<v Speaker 1>of certain hills and like mash and shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep things from falling.</v>

3877
02:49:42.170 --> 02:49:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I these people like holding onto their</v>
<v Speaker 1>chunk of dirt with every tooth and claw.</v>

3878
02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:50.290
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

3879
02:49:50.290 --> 02:49:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposedly like a lot of places</v>

3880
02:49:52.241 --> 02:49:55.900
<v Speaker 1>because of all the fires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this winter it's going to be land</v>

3881
02:49:55.930 --> 02:49:57.970
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mudslides everywhere for for us.</v>

3882
02:49:58.240 --> 02:49:59.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3883
02:49:59.140 --> 02:50:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burbank.</v>

3884
02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:02.890
<v Speaker 1>They say that the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that the fires are good for</v>

3885
02:50:02.891 --> 02:50:04.600
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you need to burn some of that</v>

3886
02:50:04.601 --> 02:50:06.190
<v Speaker 1>shit down and it's supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

3887
02:50:06.490 --> 02:50:09.700
<v Speaker 1>puts minerals in the soil and then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>builds things back up and then these</v>

3888
02:50:09.701 --> 02:50:13.870
<v Speaker 1>fires through like lightening strikes</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like super common and then the</v>

3889
02:50:13.871 --> 02:50:16.600
<v Speaker 1>things were burned down and the rain</v>
<v Speaker 1>would come and then they would</v>

3890
02:50:16.601 --> 02:50:19.880
<v Speaker 1>repopulate with new new seeds and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

3891
02:50:19.900 --> 02:50:22.280
<v Speaker 1>this guy figured out how to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3892
02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:24.240
<v Speaker 1>You could stand on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3893
02:50:24.270 --> 02:50:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3894
02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put pieces of paper in between the</v>

3895
02:50:27.191 --> 02:50:30.730
<v Speaker 1>sand and then he pulled the sides off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and the paper,</v>

3896
02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:35.760
<v Speaker 1>the paper being compressed in between</v>
<v Speaker 1>these pieces of sand allows it to hold</v>

3897
02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:37.780
<v Speaker 1>tremendous weight without losing its</v>
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>

3898
02:50:38.230 --> 02:50:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3899
02:50:39.101 --> 02:50:40.720
<v Speaker 1>It's super weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See how it is.</v>

3900
02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:42.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like each thing is like a slice,</v>

3901
02:50:43.110 --> 02:50:43.943
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

3902
02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Like see if they show how he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3903
02:50:48.500 --> 02:50:50.480
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just sort of how it works.</v>

3904
02:50:50.481 --> 02:50:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Similar how side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means you said the side of a</v>

3905
02:50:53.241 --> 02:50:54.170
<v Speaker 1>freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

02:50:55.850 --> 02:50:56.540
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

3907
02:50:56.540 --> 02:50:58.400
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they do with the side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the freeways thing.</v>

3908
02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:00.680
<v Speaker 1>That's how they reinforce those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3909
02:51:00.681 --> 02:51:03.620
<v Speaker 1>If you see him slowly build it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of crazy to watch them do it.</v>

3910
02:51:03.621 --> 02:51:05.870
<v Speaker 1>But dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched something really crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>if you high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a thing where they're building</v>

3915
02:51:14.060 --> 02:51:19.020
<v Speaker 1>a bridge and they're moving a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic girder and his girl,</v>

3916
02:51:19.021 --> 02:51:22.970
<v Speaker 1>there's like a hundred yards wide and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're picking it up.</v>

3917
02:51:23.060 --> 02:51:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing,</v>

3918
02:51:24.891 --> 02:51:27.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes to the end of the bridge where</v>

3919
02:51:27.711 --> 02:51:29.510
<v Speaker 1>the edge is cause they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're building the bridge,</v>

3920
02:51:29.511 --> 02:51:34.370
<v Speaker 1>it stops and then this other thing comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and then it moves forward and then</v>

3921
02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:36.830
<v Speaker 1>connects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It connects with the other side.</v>

3922

3924
02:51:40.070 --> 02:51:43.940
<v Speaker 1>So it connects to the aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extends and then once it does that,</v>

3925
02:51:43.941 --> 02:51:46.910
<v Speaker 1>then they bring in this huge cement</v>

<v Speaker 6>We're not playing by those rules.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's amazing that they built it that</v>

3978
02:54:14.981 --> 02:54:17.860
<v Speaker 6>quick back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then think of that like less than five</v>

3979
02:54:17.861 --> 02:54:19.780
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They built this incredible bridge that's</v>

3980
02:54:19.781 --> 02:54:22.840
<v Speaker 6>still up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why they did it in the stone age.</v>

3981
02:54:22.841 --> 02:54:24.530
<v Speaker 6>It's a lot more slaves back then.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3982
02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:26.950
<v Speaker 6>they weren't,</v>

3983
02:54:26.951 --> 02:54:28.690
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Chinese people that built the</v>

3984
02:54:28.691 --> 02:54:30.550
<v Speaker 6>railroads,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they weren't technically slaves,</v>

3985
02:54:30.551 --> 02:54:33.670
<v Speaker 6>but they weren't going anywhere either.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Brooklyn Bridge was in 1870</v>

3986
02:54:35.290 --> 02:54:39.220
<v Speaker 6>we did it first started in 1870</v>
<v Speaker 6>beginning.</v>

3987
02:54:39.221 --> 02:54:41.980
<v Speaker 6>That's a technically 1869 because it was</v>
<v Speaker 6>January 3rd.</v>

3988
02:54:42.130 --> 02:54:44.620
<v Speaker 6>You know what's interesting about that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're tearing down a bridge in</v>

3989
02:54:44.621 --> 02:54:47.270
<v Speaker 6>downtown La Right now.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Everything the Samsung note.</v>

4112
02:59:46.420 --> 02:59:50.660
<v Speaker 6>So like these everything is like I was</v>
<v Speaker 6>watching a video comparison and there</v>

4113
02:59:50.661 --> 02:59:53.160
<v Speaker 6>are nitpicking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean these guys are nit picking,</v>

4114
02:59:53.400 --> 02:59:56.250
<v Speaker 6>try to find anything wrong with any of</v>
<v Speaker 6>these phones and like these things are</v>

4115
02:59:56.251 --> 02:59:59.850
<v Speaker 6>like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're literally like science fiction</v>

4116
02:59:59.851 --> 03:00:01.740
<v Speaker 6>from 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>10 years ago.</v>

4117
03:00:01.741 --> 03:00:05.160
<v Speaker 6>The things that these things can do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the opens with your face,</v>

4118
03:00:05.370 --> 03:00:07.770
<v Speaker 6>you look at it and it opens the one ft</v>
<v Speaker 6>has that too.</v>

4119
03:00:08.700 --> 03:00:11.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One plus my note has it,</v>

4120
03:00:11.220 --> 03:00:12.900
<v Speaker 6>my note eight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It does have that or whatever.</v>

4121
03:00:12.901 --> 03:00:14.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean he has it but it's not,</v>

4122
03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:15.510
<v Speaker 6>it's the same level.</v>

4123
03:00:15.820 --> 03:00:18.510
<v Speaker 6>Like you have to like stick it in your</v>
<v Speaker 6>face and be like do like if that was the</v>

4124
03:00:18.511 --> 03:00:22.410
<v Speaker 6>thing that the note has a retina</v>
<v Speaker 6>detection,</v>

4125
03:00:22.470 --> 03:00:25.260
<v Speaker 6>which is different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is facial recognition.</v>

4126
03:00:25.620 --> 03:00:29.490
<v Speaker 6>And then the one plus ft has an even</v>
<v Speaker 6>better version of [inaudible] facial</v>

4127
03:00:29.491 --> 03:00:32.160
<v Speaker 6>recognition than the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Louis was showing a quick,</v>

4128
03:00:32.161 --> 03:00:33.640
<v Speaker 6>it opens this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Wow.</v>

4129
03:00:33.700 --> 03:00:35.510
<v Speaker 6>Maybe pan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4130
03:00:35.550 --> 03:00:37.380
<v Speaker 6>And it also has a fingerprint sensor in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the back,</v>

4131
03:00:37.381 --> 03:00:38.870
<v Speaker 6>which the iphone doesn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4132
03:00:39.100 --> 03:00:41.130
<v Speaker 6>And a big ass screen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's got a big ass green,</v>

4133
03:00:41.131 --> 03:00:44.360
<v Speaker 6>a little tiny ass bezels look smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the level,</v>

4134
03:00:44.380 --> 03:00:47.940
<v Speaker 6>my point is just super high right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're dorks like you and me.</v>

4135
03:00:48.550 --> 03:00:51.270
<v Speaker 6>Very lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they're saying the next year one,</v>

4136
03:00:51.690 --> 03:00:54.120
<v Speaker 6>they're already guessing at what nick</v>
<v Speaker 6>next year's.</v>

4137
03:00:54.150 --> 03:00:55.730
<v Speaker 6>I don't fold.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4138
03:00:55.740 --> 03:00:58.150
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they got a patent for folding fold,</v>

4139
03:00:58.230 --> 03:01:00.370
<v Speaker 6>which is cool in some ways.</v>

4140
03:01:00.610 --> 03:01:02.410
<v Speaker 5>Like imagine having like a normal size</v>
<v Speaker 5>phone,</v>

4141
03:01:02.411 --> 03:01:05.320
<v Speaker 5>but then you could fold it and make it</v>
<v Speaker 5>an ipad.</v>

4142
03:01:05.590 --> 03:01:08.710
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently they're really close to doing</v>

4143
03:01:08.711 --> 03:01:09.544
<v Speaker 5>something like that</v>

4144
03:01:09.600 --> 03:01:12.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's at one point in time</v>

4145
03:01:12.501 --> 03:01:14.480
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna figure out a way to put it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>

4146
03:01:14.510 --> 03:01:15.343
<v Speaker 1>in your glass.</v>

4147
03:01:16.430 --> 03:01:17.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's going to be more like,</v>

4148
03:01:17.830 --> 03:01:21.740
<v Speaker 5>like glasses or even just like a contact</v>
<v Speaker 5>lens that you never take out.</v>

4149
03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:22.633
<v Speaker 5>Kind of like</v>

4150
03:01:22.810 --> 03:01:26.830
<v Speaker 1>dope sunglasses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some cool like frame,</v>

4151
03:01:26.831 --> 03:01:31.831
<v Speaker 1>like Elton John's style frames and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have like just a full screen computer</v>

4152
03:01:32.020 --> 03:01:34.030
<v Speaker 1>playing a virtual reality in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all the time.</v>

4153
03:01:34.270 --> 03:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be the way to go.</v>

4154
03:01:35.950 --> 03:01:39.150
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe Google glasses didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>really take off too much stuff that</v>

4155
03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:39.850
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4156
03:01:39.850 --> 03:01:41.860
<v Speaker 1>it was too small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were looking at it.</v>

4157
03:01:42.100 --> 03:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I tried it once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

4158
03:01:43.180 --> 03:01:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I've worn during one of the UFC wayans</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

4159
03:01:45.400 --> 03:01:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at this little thing over</v>

4160
03:01:47.231 --> 03:01:49.540
<v Speaker 1>here and you look down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see it and you can look up and</v>

4161
03:01:49.541 --> 03:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of look past it but it's kind</v>

4162
03:01:51.511 --> 03:01:53.110
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't right.</v>

4163
03:01:53.200 --> 03:01:56.590
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think augmented reality where you</v>

4164
03:01:56.591 --> 03:01:59.350
<v Speaker 1>either looking through your phone or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have glasses on,</v>

4165
03:01:59.530 --> 03:02:02.440
<v Speaker 1>like that's what I think you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have like clear glasses on and you're</v>

4166
03:02:02.441 --> 03:02:04.960
<v Speaker 1>going to have your phone and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to do is switch to</v>

4167
03:02:04.961 --> 03:02:07.930
<v Speaker 1>glass mode and your phone will be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your pocket and it'll bluetooth with the</v>

4168
03:02:07.931 --> 03:02:10.600
<v Speaker 1>glasses and the glasses will be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull up anything.</v>

4169
03:02:11.150 --> 03:02:12.970
<v Speaker 1>That was the other thing that's pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy about,</v>

4170
03:02:13.050 --> 03:02:14.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the new google devices.</v>

4171
03:02:15.400 --> 03:02:18.190
<v Speaker 1>You take a photo of something and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells you what that thing is.</v>

4172
03:02:19.570 --> 03:02:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Like you take a photo of the coliseum</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it'll say there's the colosseum in</v>

4173
03:02:22.631 --> 03:02:23.081
<v Speaker 1>Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

4174
03:02:23.081 --> 03:02:23.651
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4175
03:02:23.651 --> 03:02:25.420
<v Speaker 1>the new pixel does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has that built in.</v>

4176
03:02:25.510 --> 03:02:26.410
<v Speaker 1>This isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about this.</v>

4177
03:02:26.620 --> 03:02:28.420
<v Speaker 1>They have this thing called the pixel</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

4178
03:02:28.450 --> 03:02:32.320
<v Speaker 1>We've seen the pixel book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You buy a pen and you circle things on a</v>

4179
03:02:32.321 --> 03:02:34.180
<v Speaker 1>screen and it tells you what those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are.</v>

4180
03:02:34.390 --> 03:02:35.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My it has that.</v>

4181
03:02:35.771 --> 03:02:36.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My no aid.</v>

4182
03:02:36.870 --> 03:02:39.670
<v Speaker 5>My note eight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can just circle like a sentence and</v>

4183
03:02:39.671 --> 03:02:41.980
<v Speaker 5>it will translate it on four year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

4184
03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:43.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty second how long</v>

4185
03:02:44.060 --> 03:02:47.150
<v Speaker 1>for that becomes just standard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4186
03:02:47.151 --> 03:02:51.260
<v Speaker 1>and how much we're going to get to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of Rosetta stone type situation</v>

4187
03:02:51.290 --> 03:02:54.890
<v Speaker 1>where we can read each other's thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you'll be able to just talk.</v>

4188
03:02:55.400 --> 03:02:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now the note taking software is</v>

4189
03:02:58.041 --> 03:03:00.140
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty God damn good.</v>

4190
03:03:00.590 --> 03:03:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Like if you talk into your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's with Google notes or</v>

4191
03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:06.800
<v Speaker 1>anything else with apple notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll pick up your voice very,</v>

4192
03:03:06.801 --> 03:03:08.580
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>

4193
03:03:08.610 --> 03:03:10.460
<v Speaker 1>what is it going to be like in five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years from now?</v>

4194
03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:12.590
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're gonna be able to do it in</v>

4195
03:03:12.591 --> 03:03:14.420
<v Speaker 1>real time like they're doing with those</v>
<v Speaker 1>ear buds,</v>

4196
03:03:14.421 --> 03:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>those Google earbuds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4197
03:03:16.280 --> 03:03:18.200
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna be able to do that in real</v>
<v Speaker 1>time all the time.</v>

4198
03:03:18.201 --> 03:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>And so there's going to be no language</v>
<v Speaker 1>barriers than anybody ever has with</v>

4199
03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:21.770
<v Speaker 1>anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing,</v>

4200
03:03:21.771 --> 03:03:23.310
<v Speaker 1>isn't it weird?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4201
03:03:23.690 --> 03:03:26.210
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you have the robot fights</v>

4202
03:03:26.630 --> 03:03:29.510
<v Speaker 1>between the robot fights and no language</v>
<v Speaker 1>barriers.</v>

4203
03:03:29.690 --> 03:03:31.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arrange.</v>

4204
03:03:31.820 --> 03:03:34.740
<v Speaker 5>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw this at twitchcon.</v>

4205
03:03:34.780 --> 03:03:37.460
<v Speaker 5>Is this eye tracking new?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4206
03:03:37.570 --> 03:03:40.550
<v Speaker 5>it's replaces your mouse basically using</v>
<v Speaker 5>your eyes.</v>

4207
03:03:40.610 --> 03:03:41.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a little sensor that's on the</v>

4208
03:03:41.841 --> 03:03:43.570
<v Speaker 5>bottom right below your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4209
03:03:44.250 --> 03:03:46.280
<v Speaker 5>right below your screen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kind of like where the folders on your</v>

4210
03:03:46.281 --> 03:03:49.580
<v Speaker 5>laptop basically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you do a little bit of setting up</v>

4211
03:03:49.610 --> 03:03:52.280
<v Speaker 5>and it literally tracks everything</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're looking at.</v>

4212
03:03:52.340 --> 03:03:53.740
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God did it really well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw,</v>

4213
03:03:53.810 --> 03:03:55.430
<v Speaker 5>I saw a little test right in front of</v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

4214
03:03:55.750 --> 03:03:57.050
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that worked for games.</v>

4215
03:03:57.080 --> 03:03:57.913
<v Speaker 5>That's the idea.</v>

4216
03:03:58.700 --> 03:04:02.030
<v Speaker 1>If you're a tired though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you bitch,</v>

4217
03:04:02.870 --> 03:04:05.030
<v Speaker 1>that'd be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine if you got that down to</v>

4218
03:04:05.031 --> 03:04:05.930
<v Speaker 1>games and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

4219
03:04:05.931 --> 03:04:08.360
<v Speaker 1>your cursor moved exactly where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to go.</v>

4220
03:04:08.510 --> 03:04:11.090
<v Speaker 1>It might be too easy be fucking people</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with that.</v>

4221

4222
03:04:12.630 --> 03:04:14.820

<v Speaker 5>Because it just said like,</v>

4223
03:04:14.821 --> 03:04:19.200
<v Speaker 5>they were just advertising the head u s</v>
<v Speaker 5>2.09 instead of 3.0 I just works over</v>

4224
03:04:19.201 --> 03:04:20.910
<v Speaker 5>two point doesn't need 3.0 I see.</v>

4225
03:04:21.380 --> 03:04:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tagged your enemies by glancing at them.</v>

4226
03:04:24.740 --> 03:04:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

4227
03:04:26.570 --> 03:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

4228
03:04:27.370 --> 03:04:29.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So whether or not games actually needed</v>

4229
03:04:29.981 --> 03:04:31.180
<v Speaker 5>or it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4230
03:04:31.240 --> 03:04:34.000
<v Speaker 5>something actually useful in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll see.</v>

4231
03:04:34.060 --> 03:04:36.340
<v Speaker 5>But that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been announced and that's coming</v>

4232
03:04:36.341 --> 03:04:39.130
<v Speaker 5>soon or it's out now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some alienware laptops that think or</v>

4233
03:04:39.131 --> 03:04:40.210
<v Speaker 5>having it built into it.</v>

4234
03:04:40.720 --> 03:04:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I do not even with my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>daymond my eyes.</v>

4235
03:04:43.440 --> 03:04:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Just forget the face of your father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4236
03:04:47.461 --> 03:04:48.300
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4237
03:04:48.301 --> 03:04:50.880
<v Speaker 1>we're at the cusp of some really wacky</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtual reality,</v>

4238
03:04:50.881 --> 03:04:54.000
<v Speaker 1>augmented reality type shit that's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the corner.</v>

4239
03:04:54.030 --> 03:04:57.300
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take us by storm and it's</v>

4240
03:04:57.301 --> 03:04:59.160
<v Speaker 1>going to be just like all these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we use,</v>

4241
03:04:59.161 --> 03:05:02.490
<v Speaker 1>like automatically wouldn't even think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because before twitter existed</v>

4242
03:05:02.570 --> 03:05:04.860
<v Speaker 1>that you didn't even think about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>before podcasts existed,</v>

4243
03:05:04.861 --> 03:05:06.900
<v Speaker 1>you'd never even thought this would</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be a possibility.</v>

4244
03:05:07.380 --> 03:05:09.420
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be the new one that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>

4245
03:05:09.930 --> 03:05:13.120
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some augmented reality type shit that</v>

4246
03:05:13.130 --> 03:05:16.230
<v Speaker 1>you were then eventually they're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have the robot eyeballs.</v>

4247
03:05:17.280 --> 03:05:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Brian's going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be an early adopter.</v>

4248
03:05:19.471 --> 03:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them starts hard,</v>

4249
03:05:20.970 --> 03:05:23.550
<v Speaker 1>worn glasses can read my phone.</v>

4250
03:05:24.080 --> 03:05:29.080
<v Speaker 5>I've lost my glasses but I would do one</v>
<v Speaker 5>first if if after a few years of testing</v>

4251
03:05:29.631 --> 03:05:31.490
<v Speaker 5>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

4252
03:05:31.750 --> 03:05:35.330
<v Speaker 1>what did you do one and try one out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's gonna be a bunch of</v>

4253
03:05:35.331 --> 03:05:37.280
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be options in</v>

4254
03:05:37.281 --> 03:05:41.690
<v Speaker 1>terms of like augmented parts and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think there's also going to be options</v>

4255
03:05:41.691 --> 03:05:44.690
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like dumb being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>regenerate parts.</v>

4256
03:05:44.900 --> 03:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just around the corner</v>
<v Speaker 1>too cause they already being,</v>

4257
03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:50.180
<v Speaker 1>they can regenerate a lot of shit now</v>
<v Speaker 1>with stem cells.</v>

4258
03:05:50.530 --> 03:05:54.350
<v Speaker 1>They grew a woman's bladder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made a bladder with skin cells and</v>

4259
03:05:54.590 --> 03:05:56.150
<v Speaker 1>grew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had bladder cancer,</v>

4260
03:05:56.180 --> 03:05:57.290
<v Speaker 1>they grew her a new bladder.</v>

4261
03:05:57.680 --> 03:06:00.860
<v Speaker 5>There was that guy that's growing a new</v>
<v Speaker 5>nose on his forehead.</v>

4262
03:06:00.930 --> 03:06:01.790
<v Speaker 5>Have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you see that?</v>

4263
03:06:01.870 --> 03:06:03.530
<v Speaker 5>Is that from the same thing from stem</v>
<v Speaker 5>cells?</v>

4264
03:06:03.920 --> 03:06:05.890
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's weird like on his 40</v>

4265
03:06:05.891 --> 03:06:09.950
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] he has a nose growing or</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an ear and he's growing it for him.</v>

4266
03:06:09.980 --> 03:06:10.813
<v Speaker 5>His nose</v>

4267
03:06:10.950 --> 03:06:14.820
<v Speaker 1>let us do that for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where hats,</v>

4268
03:06:14.830 --> 03:06:16.200
<v Speaker 1>no one would know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a dude.</v>

4269
03:06:16.201 --> 03:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>We're a video rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where dude was getting,</v>

4270
03:06:18.450 --> 03:06:19.560
<v Speaker 1>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

4271
03:06:19.780 --> 03:06:21.210
<v Speaker 1>It's going to have a crazy knows guide</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4272
03:06:23.520 --> 03:06:25.650
<v Speaker 5>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks fake,</v>

4273
03:06:25.651 --> 03:06:28.380
<v Speaker 5>but it's on national geographic's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4274
03:06:28.381 --> 03:06:30.690
<v Speaker 5>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's wrong with his regular knows it.</v>

4275
03:06:30.800 --> 03:06:31.633
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

4276
03:06:31.900 --> 03:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what happened.</v>

4277
03:06:33.530 --> 03:06:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so strange.</v>

4278
03:06:35.060 --> 03:06:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it was burnt,</v>

4279
03:06:37.190 --> 03:06:39.020
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4280
03:06:39.200 --> 03:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>that's another really crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen what they do with,</v>

4281
03:06:41.721 --> 03:06:44.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a skin that's been burnt now?</v>

4282
03:06:44.900 --> 03:06:48.650
<v Speaker 1>They spray stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the skin and it kills the burns</v>

4283
03:06:48.770 --> 03:06:52.040
<v Speaker 1>and a regenerates fresh tissue in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas and you don't have a scar.</v>

4284
03:06:52.160 --> 03:06:54.320
<v Speaker 1>That's sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like science fiction.</v>

4285
03:06:54.410 --> 03:06:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's literally out of star wars</v>

4286
03:06:56.160 --> 03:06:57.870
<v Speaker 6>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when you see it,</v>

4287
03:06:57.920 --> 03:06:58.460
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

4288
03:06:58.460 --> 03:07:02.010
<v Speaker 6>they show people with these like really</v>
<v Speaker 6>bad third degree burns are pretty fucked</v>

4289
03:07:02.011 --> 03:07:07.011
<v Speaker 6>up and they spray this stem cell mist</v>
<v Speaker 6>all over them and then their skin just</v>

4290
03:07:08.161 --> 03:07:12.230
<v Speaker 6>regenerate tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like sweet feeling.</v>

4291
03:07:12.640 --> 03:07:14.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's really,</v>

4292
03:07:14.191 --> 03:07:17.160
<v Speaker 6>essentially we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 6>something that had just a decade or two</v>

4293
03:07:17.161 --> 03:07:20.640
<v Speaker 6>ago would be absolutely witchcraft.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4294
03:07:21.450 --> 03:07:22.500
<v Speaker 6>fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they're,</v>

4295
03:07:22.520 --> 03:07:26.070
<v Speaker 6>they're blocking it to like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we could be farther ahead in this whole</v>

4296
03:07:26.610 --> 03:07:31.610
<v Speaker 6>field if they let stem cell shit be</v>
<v Speaker 6>little bit more legal here now then it</v>

4297
03:07:33.650 --> 03:07:36.370
<v Speaker 6>then it used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think the real issue was during</v>

4298
03:07:36.371 --> 03:07:39.100
<v Speaker 6>the Bush administration,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was like fetal stem cells</v>

4299
03:07:39.101 --> 03:07:41.680
<v Speaker 6>they had a problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're really worried that people are</v>

4300
03:07:41.681 --> 03:07:46.300
<v Speaker 6>going to get abortions just on purpose</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they could sell the babies to stem</v>

4301
03:07:46.301 --> 03:07:49.570
<v Speaker 6>cell places and that people would be as</v>
<v Speaker 6>super immoral and just have a bunch of</v>

4302
03:07:49.571 --> 03:07:51.640
<v Speaker 6>abortions and make money off the baby</v>
<v Speaker 6>tissue.</v>

4303
03:07:51.641 --> 03:07:52.474
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ooh.</v>

4304
03:07:53.080 --> 03:07:55.510
<v Speaker 6>Which it tells my son.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's the problem,</v>

4305
03:07:55.870 --> 03:07:56.880
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The problem has like,</v>

4306
03:07:56.890 --> 03:07:59.170
<v Speaker 6>like no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nobody would do that.</v>

4307
03:07:59.350 --> 03:08:01.870
<v Speaker 6>Yes they would.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Motherfucker hasn't been approved yet.</v>

4308
03:08:02.500 --> 03:08:04.840
<v Speaker 6>So put it on paypal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jane's crimes when you're waiting</v>

4309
03:08:04.841 --> 03:08:08.080
<v Speaker 6>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ah Dude.</v>

4310
03:08:08.081 --> 03:08:09.730
<v Speaker 6>If you got burnt and they offered it to</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

4311
03:08:09.940 --> 03:08:11.950
<v Speaker 6>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's videos.</v>

4312
03:08:12.170 --> 03:08:13.120
<v Speaker 6>The videos are good.</v>

4313
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:19.060
<v Speaker 6>Just here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All the people that are like crazy</v>

4314
03:08:19.061 --> 03:08:23.370
<v Speaker 6>conspiracy theorists and worried about</v>
<v Speaker 6>science and Ugh,</v>

4315
03:08:23.920 --> 03:08:27.250
<v Speaker 6>you got to realize that science is</v>
<v Speaker 6>responsible for this kind of shit.</v>

4316
03:08:27.280 --> 03:08:29.260
<v Speaker 6>Science might be able to save one of</v>
<v Speaker 6>your kids.</v>

4317
03:08:29.560 --> 03:08:34.150
<v Speaker 6>Science might be able to fix your body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These people are smarter than us.</v>

4318
03:08:34.480 --> 03:08:38.770
<v Speaker 6>We need to respect them and they're not</v>
<v Speaker 6>lying about this stuff.</v>

4319
03:08:38.800 --> 03:08:40.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's people in the medical industry</v>

4320
03:08:40.151 --> 03:08:42.940
<v Speaker 6>that make a lot of money off of</v>
<v Speaker 6>pharmaceutical drugs at a bunch of</v>

4321
03:08:42.941 --> 03:08:45.910
<v Speaker 6>things that make people super addicted</v>
<v Speaker 6>and fuck up your life.</v>

4322
03:08:45.911 --> 03:08:48.100
<v Speaker 6>There's that too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there's also this,</v>

4323
03:08:48.400 --> 03:08:49.630
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not perfect.</v>

4324
03:08:49.720 --> 03:08:51.520
<v Speaker 6>You should definitely call out the parts</v>
<v Speaker 6>that are bad,</v>

4325
03:08:52.150 --> 03:08:55.570
<v Speaker 6>but you kind of respect the people that</v>
<v Speaker 6>are smarter than us that are making all</v>

4326
03:08:55.571 --> 03:08:58.570
<v Speaker 6>the awesome shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cause it's not you and it's not me.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>

4329
03:09:01.520 --> 03:09:03.950
