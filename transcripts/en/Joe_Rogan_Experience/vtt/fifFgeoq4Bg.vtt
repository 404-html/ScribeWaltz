67
00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 2>and I was into it,</v>

68
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 2>but down on the second to last one I felt something.</v>

69
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 2>And then I spent at my mom's house,</v>

70
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I literally this,</v>

71
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 2>this is my rotation for the entire week at my mom's house,</v>

72
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

73
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 2>I went to the chiropractor twice.</v>

74
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 2>If that ever happens,</v>

75
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 2>forget the our Mukund deep tissue massage.</v>

<v Speaker 2>loosen up to soft tissue.</v>

78
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:42.631
<v Speaker 2>That's almost all.</v>

79
00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 2>But really,</v>

80
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.771

83
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that I've found is a lot of chiropractic is bullshit.</v>

84
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.833
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

85

<v Speaker 2>And Not really recognized by science or medicine either.</v>

86
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a broad word design.</v>

87
00:02:58.441 --> 00:02:59.970
<v Speaker 2>Even one type of chiropractor.</v>

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.393
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

150
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.000
<v Speaker 3>Parking set everything.</v>

151
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.080
<v Speaker 3>If I could in and I mean just on and on and on and just tons of this stuff and</v>

152
00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:26.070
<v Speaker 3>these guys are suffering.</v>

153
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:27.120
<v Speaker 3>We know failure,</v>

154
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.920
<v Speaker 3>so it's horrific,</v>

155
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.461
<v Speaker 3>horrific,</v>

156
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:30.294
<v Speaker 3>horrific stuff.</v>

157
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.133
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

158
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you had a son but you want him to play for,</v>

159
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.100
<v Speaker 3>I would not have that happen.</v>

160
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:35.520
<v Speaker 3>Fight.</v>

161
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather have my kid fuck cause I think that's a teacher.</v>

162
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.660
<v Speaker 3>Kids judo,</v>

163
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.590
<v Speaker 3>any day over football and you could fight intelligently and you could have a</v>

164
00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:44.424
<v Speaker 3>good camp.</v>

165
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.270
<v Speaker 3>Let's listen.</v>

166
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.590
<v Speaker 3>We could talk about that on the podcast.</v>

167
00:05:46.591 --> 00:05:46.791
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

168
00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:47.624
<v Speaker 3>that's actually a good thing.</v>

169
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.093
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it Jeremy.</v>

170
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

171
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's brutal now.</v>

172
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:57.210
<v Speaker 3>There's like over 500 players suing the NFL.</v>

173
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

174
00:05:58.011 --> 00:05:58.791
<v Speaker 3>What's talking about that?</v>

175
00:05:58.791 --> 00:05:59.624
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about that.</v>

176
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Has the drawback changed?</v>

177
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 3>It makes it a little bit slower.</v>

178
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.570
<v Speaker 3>It's such a powerful photo.</v>

179
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.251
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter,</v>

180
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 3>but it makes it more accurate.</v>

181
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.100
<v Speaker 3>It makes it easier to,</v>

182
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 3>as long as,</v>

183
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.953
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

184
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 3>they got a national,</v>

185
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:26.774
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>

186
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.281
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

187
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:29.114
<v Speaker 3>no totally.</v>

188
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 3>This is different but it's super accurate because of that.</v>

189
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 3>What I have to do.</v>

190
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 3>The reason why I brought it here as I have a chronograph and the back that tells</v>

191
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:47.681
<v Speaker 3>me the exact speed and then you have to calculate how fast he,</v>

192
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:49.064
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

193
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.880
<v Speaker 3>the car was going to travel and that will let you put in what's called a sight</v>

194
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:58.010
<v Speaker 3>tape site</v>

195
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 3>piece of equipment,</v>

196
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.620
<v Speaker 3>like a work of art.</v>

197
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.140
<v Speaker 3>This is a pretty rare one because this is a 90 pound bow hold back or 90 pound</v>

198
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 3>bow.</v>

199
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.990
<v Speaker 3>So it's very rare</v>

200
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 3>they don't make them.</v>

201
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.370
<v Speaker 3>So I see the way it's curved.</v>

202
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 3>So you can only pull it back with one.</v>

203
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.940
<v Speaker 3>I can pull up with your right.</v>

204
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.013
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

205
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:30.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

206
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:31.604
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

207
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.170
<v Speaker 3>This is a stabilizer,</v>

208
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.920
<v Speaker 3>attach this on to it nicely and then wants to stabilize</v>

209
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.530
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

210
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:43.363
<v Speaker 3>this</v>

211
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:46.863
<v Speaker 3>site.</v>

212
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.193
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

213
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

214
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.720
<v Speaker 3>This is the stabilizer.</v>

215
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.510
<v Speaker 3>This sort of helps balance it out while you're shooting.</v>

216
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.630
<v Speaker 3>And this year that's a site.</v>

217
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 3>This is a hell of a weapon.</v>

218
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:02.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

219
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:03.890
<v Speaker 3>This is no joke.</v>

220
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

221
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.590
<v Speaker 3>my thought is if you're going hunting you,</v>

222
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

223
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.360
<v Speaker 3>well you really helped me.</v>

224
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

225
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:16.340
<v Speaker 3>You really should use the most powerful thing that you can and did.</v>

226
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 3>The issue really is that a lot of people think,</v>

227
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:20.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

228
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:20.871
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

229
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 3>if you know you don't need that kind of power.</v>

230
00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:24.180
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

231
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of criticism in the bow community,</v>

232
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:32.201
<v Speaker 3>the archery community of people who use like really heavy pound bowls,</v>

233
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.611
<v Speaker 3>they think that,</v>

234
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:34.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

235
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 3>you're being a meathead and it's not necessary and you're,</v>

236
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 3>you're over bode,</v>

237
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:39.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

238
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 3>you don't need that much bow.</v>

239
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:41.683
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

240
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.330
<v Speaker 3>I've kind of thought that through.</v>

241
00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 3>I think what's a regular guy?</v>

242
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 3>What strong to a regular guy is not that strong to a person who lives a lot of</v>

243
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:51.430
<v Speaker 3>weights.</v>

244
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

245
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.513
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

246
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.360
<v Speaker 3>Straight as revenue.</v>

247
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:55.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

248
00:08:55.201 --> 00:09:00.201
<v Speaker 3>For me to use a 90 pound ball and a guy who is weak to use a 60 like why does he</v>

249
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:00.830
<v Speaker 3>think that?</v>

250
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.570
<v Speaker 3>That this is harder for me to use it.</v>

251
00:09:02.571 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 3>It is for him to use a 60 like if you don't lift a lot of ways.</v>

252
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

253
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

254
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 3>but it's so weird.</v>

255
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:09.221
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>

256
00:09:09.221 --> 00:09:09.371
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

257
00:09:09.371 --> 00:09:10.141
<v Speaker 3>it's weird,</v>

258
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 3>this ego thing that goes on,</v>

259
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 3>it's weird criticism thing like,</v>

260
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 3>oh that's old.</v>

261
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:15.361
<v Speaker 3>That's great guy.</v>

262
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:16.320
<v Speaker 3>You don't need that.</v>

263
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:17.041
<v Speaker 3>Why do you use that?</v>

264
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to,</v>

265
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 3>but I really think it's because they can't do it.</v>

266
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 3>So they have this weird thing there have,</v>

267
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 3>I personally wouldn't want to go.</v>

268
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.750
<v Speaker 3>That would be as powerful as I could possibly 12 but yeah.</v>

269
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:28.561
<v Speaker 3>Well come on over here.</v>

270
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:31.920
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you how you use the chronograph in worse than maybe an animal.</v>

271
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.920
<v Speaker 3>Can I put the site tape on his,</v>

272
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:37.401
<v Speaker 3>that was his,</v>

273
00:09:37.401 --> 00:09:38.160
<v Speaker 3>his 20 yards.</v>

274
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:38.361
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

275
00:09:38.361 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 3>This from here.</v>

276
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.171
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

277
00:09:40.171 --> 00:09:41.004
<v Speaker 3>From this,</v>

278
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.150
<v Speaker 3>he's pretty far off man.</v>

279
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.770
<v Speaker 3>No real shot or Vr.</v>

280
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.863
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>

281
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Is any movement at all</v>

282
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.393
<v Speaker 3>football?</v>

283
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 3>This is cause we're in the door.</v>

284
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:52.703
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

285
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.900
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of trial and error.</v>

286
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.933
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

287
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.030
<v Speaker 3>So lots of really long shot then.</v>

288
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.010
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

289
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.330
<v Speaker 3>What's a real long shot?</v>

290
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean what's considered a long longtime?</v>

291
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.720
<v Speaker 3>Anything over 40 the real,</v>

292
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.850
<v Speaker 3>real marsh or real archer</v>

293
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.930
<v Speaker 3>just keep that's right.</v>

294
