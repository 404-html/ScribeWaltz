There's been no 10 greater.

10
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:36.630

homey.com and if you,
I'm also a,

13
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:48.540
we're sponsored by on it.com the makers of Alpha brain,
Alpha brain,
a cognitive.

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.480
I'm going to give you some of these men.
They're,
they're interesting.

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.080
They're pills that are supposed to make you think better.
I love it.
Um,

16
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.850
and a lot of debate on these things.
And this is my,
my take on any of this.

17
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:04.230
If anybody has questions about whether or not they should buy something like

18
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.060
this,
please don't buy it.
This is what you should do.

19
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.510
Just research the word nootropic.
Look up nootropics,

20
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:13.110
look up whatever sketchy evidence there is on whether or not they work.
Look up,

21
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.650
you know,
buy a book on it for research the ingredients,

22
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.040
test them on yourself and if you want to try off a brain,

23
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.150
try it by buying the ingredients in bulk.
Buy them in bulk.

24
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:27.360
Don't even buy it from us by,
it's from whatever it is,

25
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.730
the exact amount of each ingredient are listed on the website,
on a dog,

26
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:35.520
Tom o,
n I t and just copy it,

27
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.210
copy it and steal the formula and don't give us any money.

28
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.110
I just hope you try it.
I it's,
it's uh,

29
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.690
to me it's a fascinating sort of,
uh,

30
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.430
an idea that you can enhance your health through supplements and you can enhance

31
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:52.950
your thinking through a mental supplement.
I mean,

32
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.550
I'm totally work for me and I quick.
Yeah,
it's nice.
I,

33
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.780
it was very interesting to see myself think clear like I saw,
like they,

34
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.880
it was weird.
It's doing something,
you know,
and they did use it,

35
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.180
some of the ingredients on Alzheimer's patients,

36
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:09.120
so they know that there's something going on with what the does and how it

37
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.450
interacts with the human mind.
But uh,
and the,
the,

38
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.830
the bottom line about it is there's a money back guarantee,

39
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:17.370
100% money back guarantee and we stand by that.
So,
uh,

40
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:21.000
if you go to Joe rogan.net and see the link for that and clicking the link and

41
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.320
put in my name and uh,
enter in the code name Rogan,
you get 10% off that too.

42
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.060
All right.
That's fucking commercials are over their gross to me,
to David.

43
00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:30.210
Tell here bitches.

44
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.870
<v 1>Thanks for having me on a ride.</v>

45
00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:35.790
Kids Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

46
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.593
<v 2>Okay,</v>

47
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.150
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen,
my pow Mr. David Towel.</v>

48
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:48.570
<v 1>I haven't,</v>

49
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.090
<v 0>I've known David Tell for many,
many a moon the frog.</v>

50
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.210
I remember the first time I ever saw you on stage two is at catch a rising star

51
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:57.450
in New York.
That was a fuck.
It was like,
wow.

52
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.980
[inaudible] 91 or something like that place is long

53
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.790
<v 3>gone.</v>

54
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.830
<v 0>Great little spot.
It was a great club.
You're right.</v>

55
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.680
The only thing that was weird about that club was there was a god damn mirror

56
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:08.200
behind you.
So you looked at yourself when you were on stage.

57
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.000
You remember like your eye?
Yeah.
Cross a.
So while you on stage,
you,

58
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.530
you see yourself like a whole huge mirror was ridiculous.

59
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.050
Did you catch yourself?
Like acting,
posing,
and I taught,
I felt excited.
Get My,

60
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.900
my manager [inaudible] he called me on it.
He goes,

61
00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:25.360
what are you looking at yourself in the mirror?

62
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.090
You could see yourself bombing your watch your own dream and float on a cloud.

63
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.440
That's gotta be a nightmare on stage.
Watch yourself bomb.
Yeah.
I only,

64
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:38.830
I only performed there a couple of times.
It was a great club.
Cool little spot.

65
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.190
Yeah.
I forget like that.
You did some time in New York?
Yeah.
Yeah,

66
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.070
when I first moved there.
But you know what?
I was so used to,

67
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:46.540
the way they did it in Boston,

68
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.170
I was so used to driving and doing road gigs that I would be like in town,

69
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:52.350
I couldn't make any money.
It was like they were like,
you know,

70
00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:53.680
sent was like not much money.

71
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:58.681
Like what was it set at like a like or Carol likes to go weekday set or I guess

72
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:00.610
it wouldn't be Caroline.
See,
it'd be like the comic strip.

73
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.140
<v 3>Well it used to be like a cab fare,
you know,</v>

74
00:04:03.141 --> 00:04:05.790
I remember like in the late eighties,
early nineties,

75
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:10.170
it was just like cab fare and a meal and then now it's probably like 25 bucks a

76
00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:14.120
set.
And that was after like a big,
you know,
strike that we had.
And uh,
yeah,

77
00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:16.740
for a while there there was no money and isn't that crazy?
Yeah.

78
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.970
<v 0>Think about it then you're performing and that's the only reason they're open.</v>

79
00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:24.750
They're open because they're selling comedy performers don't get any money.

80
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.120
<v 3>Is that like the audience comes in,
like,
especially on a,</v>

81
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:30.250
it's not a headliner show,
it's just like,
you know,

82
00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:33.130
a showcase show where it's just like tag teaming and they'll come in like

83
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:37.450
they're,
you know,
expecting to see like some kind of like,
you know,
uh,
whatever,

84
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:40.300
like a Cirque de Solei or something.
And it's like,
no,

85
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:43.840
we're just all coming up here trying or dick and pussy jokes,
you know,

86
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:47.170
trying to like build material and they get really disappointed and like we're,

87
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:49.760
we're making like,
you know,
less than you would if you,
you know,

88
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.540
were a fluffer on a fucking Mexican donkey show.

89
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.110
<v 0>So,
yeah.
How did that happen?
How did it become such a,
a,</v>

90
00:04:57.111 --> 00:05:00.140
a club owner centric environment?
I don't know.

91
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.500
<v 3>It's like earning your bones,
you know,
how it is.
Like,
you know,
like first of all,</v>

92
00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:07.190
like I'd say like my first 10 years,
it was debatable whether,

93
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.520
whether I deserve to be paid or not,
you know,
it was like,
so touch and go like,

94
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.860
hey,
easy.
But I agree.
I know that feeling.
But yeah,

95
00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:19.100
and then like there's,
you know,
then once you finally like realize that like,

96
00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:21.980
you know your power,
you know,
you know how to do it and then you're like,

97
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.800
I can't believe you know,
this is like slavery.

98
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.320
Just pure slavery.

99
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.870
<v 0>Yeah.
Well I guess a certain level for a guy like you,
it's,
it becomes,</v>

100
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:34.390
well you need a place to work out.
You don't need the money.

101
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.080
I don't need your 15 bucks or whatever.
So I don't mind doing it for free.

102
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.310
But when you were starting now and then you were just going all around New York,

103
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:43.420
that was how you were making a living.

104
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.500
<v 3>Yeah,
that's the whole thing.
You're right Joe.
It's like,</v>

105
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.000
it was like five big clubs and you would try and bounce from set to set to set

106
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.960
and do as many as manager can,
especially on the weekend.
And you,

107
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.050
you could rock out maybe 600 bucks,
you know,
a night.
So you'd be like,
Oh man,

108
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.470
this is,
I can't believe it.
I'm going to go.

109
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.690
But then you blast it all out on booze and Shit,
you know?
So it was like a,

110
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:05.990
you know,
net loss.
What's the most amount of sets you've ever done it in a night?

111
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.040
I think.
I know I don't hold the record for in New York City the most amount,

112
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:13.880
but uh,
I think the record is 13 to 15 with prom shows.

113
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.610
Cause during the prom season they would,
he's a ton of them,

114
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.280
but I think I've probably done like 10 to 12 in one night

115
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.750
<v 0>I did a prom shows with auto and George.
Wow,</v>

116
00:06:22.751 --> 00:06:27.210
that's totally Alan Lubell.
Oh Man.
Really?

117
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.640
There were crazy because what they did was they never took anybody out.

118
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.400
So what they told you what they would recycle the Comedians,
you know,

119
00:06:33.401 --> 00:06:36.130
you would do like a half an hour set.
I think it was a half an hour.

120
00:06:36.131 --> 00:06:37.480
I'm pretty sure it was a good long set.

121
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.760
And then the other guy would go on after you and he would do half now and then

122
00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:44.440
they'd have four people on the show and then they wanted you to come back on for

123
00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:47.030
the next show.
And it was the exact same crowd.
Oh.

124
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.910
So what they said is you have to do the same material.

125
00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:51.220
You have to do the same material because if you do,
yeah,

126
00:06:51.221 --> 00:06:53.020
because if you do new material,
they're going to stay.

127
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.620
So even though you know it's the same crowd,
it was like they didn't even,

128
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.420
they didn't know who was who.
It was like a pigsty.
Like they push these pigs,

129
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.980
the sky,
they didn't know who was one from one show who was from another show.

130
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.210
So their way of dealing with all these unruly kids was to just keep pushing more

131
00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:11.920
in there.
It was insane.

132
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.180
Total health code violations and the shows went all night.

133
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.230
You would do a show at 6:00 PM I did a,
me and auto and George did one once.

134
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.920
I remember we did a show and we started out at like you started out when it gets

135
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:27.610
dark and it was actually probably before it got dark and we were done at like

136
00:07:27.611 --> 00:07:31.060
six in the morning.
Man.
It was like bright out when we left the club.

137
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.640
<v 3>Well that's the beauty of it.
I can't believe.</v>

138
00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:35.680
You said you did prompt shows with auto and George.

139
00:07:35.681 --> 00:07:39.220
Can you think of his last that's like,
it was awesome.

140
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.650
Filthy dirtiest and the puppet world is Hitler.

141
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.670
He is like fucking evil and these poor kids and he's 16 year old,

142
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.060
these twilight kids to come down and they're like getting old.

143
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.850
I can only amount the protein slurpee joke that really must have a hate hard

144
00:07:54.851 --> 00:07:57.370
that night.
You know that's his blowjob material.

145
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.360
<v 0>Yeah,
proteins.
Graham's got some,
he's got some great fucking lines.</v>

146
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.940
I remembered the people don't get it though.

147
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:07.660
It's like it's not about him faking now.
He's really doing this.

148
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.610
His lips move man.
I mean he know.
He's like,
come on,
we playing games.

149
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.980
He knows the fucking puppet so he doesn't like do a good job of like,

150
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.450
so like these kids were yelling at

151
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.700
these dumb kids were like hassling him.
They weren't getting them.

152
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.550
The Majesty of the auto and George Experience,
they were too young.

153
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.080
They were too young and dumb.
They were like,
oh,

154
00:08:29.081 --> 00:08:30.880
this guy's back and see his lips moving.

155
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.950
<v 3>You know that?
That's so cool because in New York when we,</v>

156
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.600
when we got that wave of like Boston guys like you,
uh,
Louis C K,
Nick Depalo,

157
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.900
you know,
that was like the beginning of like the new start of comedy.

158
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:46.550
Cause I remember like,
uh,
you know the old eighties comedy,
you know,

159
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:49.640
like a,
I'm not going to name names,
but it's just like all the sweater comics,

160
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.020
the guys who would come up there and with like a rap tunes,
here's my,
you know,

161
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.000
crazy rap too.
And then it was over.

162
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.180
They do some kind of like impression and that was a bill Cosby like,
yeah.

163
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.790
But then like when you guys came in then it became like the new wave of comedy

164
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:06.390
and that's,
that was,
that was cool.
That was really like when it started again,

165
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:08.980
I think,
you know,
while comedy was dead,
dead,
you know?

166
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.080
<v 0>Yeah.
Well their key becomes waves when it becomes a community.</v>

167
00:09:12.081 --> 00:09:14.990
But we were the last guys from the Boston community really.

168
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.840
It was like burr and Patrice were like the last guy.
Yeah,
I know.

169
00:09:17.841 --> 00:09:19.340
There's still some really funny guys.

170
00:09:19.341 --> 00:09:22.490
They have been there and I've seen some of the funny up and coming guys,

171
00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:26.090
but for whatever reason they're not getting the kind of attention that the

172
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.490
younger guys got.
You know,
back in the day it doesn't seem like the scene is,

173
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:31.720
is like dance to be.
Yeah.

174
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.670
Like Nick's comedy stop is kind of still around,

175
00:09:34.671 --> 00:09:37.370
but stitches is gone and the,
you know,

176
00:09:37.371 --> 00:09:40.340
the Improv is gone and duck soup to connection's gone.

177
00:09:40.341 --> 00:09:42.640
The connections now a giant theater,
you know,

178
00:09:42.641 --> 00:09:44.330
and so it's like guys are kind of forced.

179
00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:46.790
I know Tim Mcintyre has a room somewhere in Faneuil hall.

180
00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:50.570
I think it's a small room,
like a hundred seater.
I'm sure that's really good.
But,

181
00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:54.140
and then there's a Chinese restaurant in Cambridge.
I did it once.

182
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.920
And then other than that,
it's like Boston's not,
it's not what it used to be.

183
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.830
It used to be,
man,
when I started out in the late eighties,

184
00:10:00.831 --> 00:10:05.760
I started in 88 it was a hive man,
John.
Um,

185
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.360
Jonathan Katz was the host of the open mic night.

186
00:10:08.361 --> 00:10:12.620
Tude Jonathan Katz brought me up for the first time on stage.
Brilliant comedian.

187
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.080
I got to see Teddy bears,
Ron when he was in its prime.
Wow.
You know,

188
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.660
do you know tests I did Teddy Berge on for ladies and gentlemen,
we won't know.

189
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:25.760
Might've been one of the most brilliant with the best timing.

190
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.540
I've never seen a comic with better timing than Teddy Berge.

191
00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:31.820
Ron just casual,
relaxed.

192
00:10:31.821 --> 00:10:36.380
He would hit the punchline and you would at one point you'd be laughing at

193
00:10:36.381 --> 00:10:40.700
another point you'd be going,
God damn this motherfucker.
God Damn,
he's good.

194
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.960
<v 3>I'll say that about the Boston guys.
Like you know,</v>

195
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:46.890
cause I was a bunch of long island is that like the Boston guys are not only

196
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:47.724
fearless,

197
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.300
but they also were like intelligent and they could really quickly switch from

198
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:55.380
like rowdy drunk college crowd to like more of a sophisticated crowd.

199
00:10:55.381 --> 00:10:59.040
Whereas on long island we were basically townie people,
you know,
and like,
uh,

200
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.600
there'll be like a couple of like,
you know,
like PG 13 acts.

201
00:11:02.601 --> 00:11:05.760
But then the rest of us were like just dirty drunk,
you know,
kind of like county,

202
00:11:05.761 --> 00:11:06.180
you know.

203
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.260
<v 0>I think every community needs someone who's really good to show you how the fuck</v>

204
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:15.090
to do it.
Oh yeah.
Boston had Steve Sweeney done.
Gavin,

205
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.830
Lenny Clarke,
legend,
legend Kenny Rogers,
and they just had all these animals.

206
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.360
Don Galvin was a fucking savage when he was younger.
Man.
Damn,

207
00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:25.194
he was good.

208
00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.530
<v 3>The guys were like,
I dunno,</v>

209
00:11:26.531 --> 00:11:29.510
like gunfighters cause like as good as they were onstage,
offstage.

210
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.080
Jay were better in terms of like,

211
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.900
<v 0>it was just like,
you know,
they were the real deal.
Listen,</v>

212
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.860
there's only one way you get a comic like that.

213
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.990
You don't get a comic like that through yoga.

214
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.980
You get so fucking,
that's a guy who's living a real life.
I Lenny Clarke,

215
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.580
I fucking love Lenny Clarke.

216
00:11:49.581 --> 00:11:52.880
He's like one of the funniest old school Boston guys and I got the chance to

217
00:11:52.881 --> 00:11:53.980
work with him on this

218
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.240
<v 4>movie.
He was telling me a story,</v>

219
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.070
<v 1>but my whole day's Joe back when I was doing blow.
He goes,</v>

220
00:11:59.071 --> 00:12:02.520
one day I woke up,
I was in the fucking Bahamas.

221
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.680
You just have no idea.
We got to The Bahamas.
I was not,
I was partying.

222
00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:10.860
I was hanging out in New York.
Next thing you know,
boom.
In the fucking Bahamas.

223
00:12:10.861 --> 00:12:13.680
I woke up,
I looked at the beach.
I thought I was on long island.

224
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.630
<v 4>Oh,
that's so gross,
dude.
He's,
he's brilliant.
It's amazing.
Those guys were alive.</v>

225
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.040
I mean it's just,
unfortunately it took it to a level.
Kevin Knox isn't,

226
00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:26.360
we lost him recently.
He loved that guy.
He was another one,
another real wild,

227
00:12:26.361 --> 00:12:30.590
fun guy.
We've lost so many great guys in the last three years.
I would say.

228
00:12:30.591 --> 00:12:35.450
It's just a,
it's,
it's so sad and depressing and it's terrifying.
I don't know.
No,

229
00:12:35.451 --> 00:12:37.140
you look good man.
You think he didn't work out?

230
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:41.990
I exercise and I take vitamins for important brand that brain healthy and the

231
00:12:41.991 --> 00:12:45.800
brain stuff.
Brain pills and Alpha brain furious masturbation.

232
00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.510
They say that that's the best way to keep your prostate healthy.
Do you think so?

233
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:52.820
Yeah.
Shooting loads.
Yeah.
That's when dudes,
the prostate starts rotting off.
Wow.

234
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.910
Stop shooting loads.
They think it's actually a preventative measure.

235
00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.920
I'm usually like a two,
two a day guy.
You know,
they still wanting to get a sleep,

236
00:13:00.921 --> 00:13:05.540
one to just be alive,
to be alive,
just to feel alive.
Nothing sexual,
just like,

237
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.051
am I?

238
00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:09.800
Am I a cognizant person or if you wake up at nine and you want to get an extra

239
00:13:09.801 --> 00:13:13.100
two hours sleep bang one off right there.
God tambien.
Yeah,

240
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.030
yeah.
I wonder if that works that way for women.
It doesn't seem,

241
00:13:17.031 --> 00:13:19.730
it seems like it at all in orgasms they get energized.
Yes.

242
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.050
They want to go do something.
Yeah.

243
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.720
They want to just run around and fucking look at stuff.

244
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.260
I'm going to just amazing.
They beat us in every battle there is,

245
00:13:27.261 --> 00:13:31.040
you know they have hearts,
they have,
they grow humans inside of them.

246
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.930
They have to be crafty and adaptable.
Yeah.

247
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.020
It's to take care of those little humans.
It's what it is,

248
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.820
but I do know that women like with the,

249
00:13:37.821 --> 00:13:41.000
with the vibrators and I'm sure going to talk about it endlessly on that because

250
00:13:41.001 --> 00:13:42.440
your crowd is cool.
You know?

251
00:13:42.441 --> 00:13:44.590
Sometimes like I'll talk about vibrators onstage and I was like,

252
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.570
you feel like the people tighten up and you're like,
am I,

253
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.630
is this like the scarlet letter or something?
Am I,

254
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:53.200
is this like a puritan community here?
It's like vibrator.
You know it.

255
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.030
They're like selling them at like Dwayne Reed or cvs now.

256
00:13:56.031 --> 00:13:58.830
It's not like it's a big,
you have to go into like a shack and see,

257
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.790
you see a guy with an eyepatch,
what are you looking forward?

258
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.300
They're like right out there,
but people are like,
Ooh,
you know,
whatever.

259
00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.450
It's a funny thing,
man.
It's a funny thing to be embarrassed about.
You know?

260
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.890
I think it's ridiculous.
Yeah.
All sex toys and all that stuff.
It's funny.

261
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.130
It's a funny thing to be embarrassed about beating off,
you know,

262
00:14:16.131 --> 00:14:18.860
being embarrassed about sex.
Really.

263
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.940
I've been using my girlfriend has is I'll wage masturbate lately.
Really?

264
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.970
You just do it so quick and you're like,
dude,
that's just like,

265
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.790
I just masturbated using her as well.
You're being rude like that.

266
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.500
I don't know what I,
I've been a horrible person lately.
Really?
Yeah.
Do you get,

267
00:14:33.501 --> 00:14:37.710
do you get lazy when it comes to sex and I'm just so tired and so much.

268
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.590
Yeah,
you got to fuck girls correctly and I didn't want to keep them around.

269
00:14:42.591 --> 00:14:45.650
That's what I've found.
I think it's very important to never do that.

270
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.610
It's very important to and less and less like they don't want to wake up and

271
00:14:49.611 --> 00:14:51.110
like,
cause there's some sleep issue.

272
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.540
They go go ahead and stick it in real quick and you're like,
all right,
cool.

273
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.700
But it's gotta be like an agreement.

274
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.170
Otherwise you're going to have problems when he can't just dump inside of her.

275
00:14:59.171 --> 00:15:03.410
I just rollover.
Right.
Is that what you're doing?
Yeah,
pretty much.
I mean,

276
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.620
I mean like I'm like I've upgraded from the fleshlight to using my girlfriend.

277
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.390
Meanwhile his girlfriend is super hot.
I can't believe it.

278
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.970
Stupid hot dude.
There's something about red heads.

279
00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:18.570
They are just so you want to bite him,
bite him,
right?
Yeah.

280
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:24.320
That's all I want to bite redheads.
I do.
Yeah.
You want to bite them?

281
00:15:24.321 --> 00:15:25.510
I want to choke them.
I want to,

282
00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.590
<v 3>I like how,
like you're,
you're a guy who knows his history,
how,</v>

283
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.080
like back in the day the red head was like a sign of like,
you know,
whatever.

284
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:37.310
The apocalypse wasn't really,
and now it's like the sign of a really cool time,

285
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.273
you know,
on a check.

286
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.490
<v 4>Got It.
Dude.
It's hard to,
well,
Lou pulls it off.
Well,
Louise,</v>

287
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.510
a redhead and bill burr who was on my arm,
Dave's all porn show.

288
00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:48.530
He's ready to have a red head,
but he's more kind of a brown haired guy.
It's,

289
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.250
he's not quite a red head.
He looks a little Kris kringle Lee lately.
He's like,

290
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:57.230
really?
Yeah.
Sam is else,
you know,
he's adorable.

291
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.260
He always looks like he's like 28 or older than that,
but slow.

292
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:06.870
It's like whatever.
He's like,
he's hilarious.
Yeah.

293
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.630
We were real lucky.
Like we were talking about,
you know,
being in Boston,

294
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.400
you had that environment where you got to be influenced and inspired by so many

295
00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:20.150
really good guys.
But New York had a bunch of fucking good guys too,
dude.

296
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.310
But in Long Island didn't,
not so much.
Right.

297
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.590
The guy's like auto and George was absolutely brilliant.
Well they were,

298
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.280
those doers are a few of those guys that would be the road guys.

299
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.160
Like I don't always struck me as something different than some of those guys

300
00:16:32.161 --> 00:16:36.110
because a lot of those guys there would be kind of like getting by but just real

301
00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:40.490
hacky,
just doing what they could do to get through this stage with Otto.

302
00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:45.050
It was like he was making art out of being the filthiest Ooh,

303
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.580
horrible things.
Just the filthiest possible but art,

304
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.060
but brilliant.
You know,
but you cry laughing.
Yeah.

305
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:56.670
He's definitely a one of a kind and and like,
um,
uh,
watch for call it,

306
00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.730
who is the prop guy,
you know?
Um,
countertop,
not carrots up the other guy.

307
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.690
Um,
great evil prop dude.
Oh,
you know what I'm talking about?

308
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:07.960
Shit,

309
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.680
<v 3>Shit.
He's another guy who always pleased jersey.
Really cool.
Like,
like chip,</v>

310
00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:17.330
chip Cooney and those kind of guys are like classic Vaudevillian type evil,

311
00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:21.790
you know,
like Coppola esque acts,
but on long island,

312
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.220
this Jerry Seinfeld,
Kevin James,
you know,

313
00:17:24.221 --> 00:17:27.460
and then a couple of other really good guys.
There was a lot of guys like me,

314
00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.910
but I really like started in New York City,
like,
oh,

315
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.720
the open mic scene there for years and years and years.

316
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.740
<v 4>So you lived in Long Island and you community not to stand up?</v>

317
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.040
<v 3>Oh No.
I went to Nyu and I,
and I,
uh,
stayed in the city,</v>

318
00:17:38.041 --> 00:17:40.200
but I would go out to the island to do road gigs.

319
00:17:40.201 --> 00:17:43.200
And the first one Gig I ever did was in queens with Adam Sandler.

320
00:17:43.201 --> 00:17:47.160
And we did a disco and he brought me along because we both went to Nyu and he

321
00:17:47.161 --> 00:17:51.000
brought me along and I totally tanked it.
And then we,
you know,
the old,
you know,

322
00:17:51.001 --> 00:17:53.940
we're standing under the disco ball as we're circled by these,
you know,

323
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.660
basically Guido's,
you know,
and they're circling us.
And uh,

324
00:17:57.661 --> 00:17:59.820
he totally killed and you know,
he was just like,

325
00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:03.660
he knew what he wanted to do immediately,
you know,
like he was an actor,

326
00:18:03.661 --> 00:18:06.300
he was a comic and all that kind of stuff.
And I catch a rising star.

327
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:08.070
He was the golden child.
Honestly.

328
00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:11.970
He was the first guy to make it on to MTV and then SNL and all that kind of

329
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:13.650
stuff.
And uh,
you know,
Colin Quinn,

330
00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:17.940
who is at bigger moments on anybody who's was in that era.
And like in New York,

331
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.340
he totally like a,
you know,

332
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.820
basically there was like a cool scene there of where you could see guys do

333
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:25.380
different,
different things.
But I always slept.

334
00:18:25.381 --> 00:18:29.910
Boston guys definitely came in hard,
able to do the road like right away.

335
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.500
Whereas us like meek little like New York guys,
you know,
it'd be like 45 minutes.

336
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.570
<v 0>Holy Shit.</v>

337
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.770
We got used to doing half hour and a horrible boss environment.

338
00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.010
We did a lot of crazy gigs.
That was,
but there was so many of them.

339
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.250
The beautiful thing about being in Boston as you could make a living,
I mean,

340
00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.920
I was in comedy a year and I started making,
you know,

341
00:18:48.921 --> 00:18:52.850
a couple of hundred bucks a week.
And today that's really hard to do.
Yeah,

342
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.390
it's really hard to pull any money out and after a year's worth of comedy.

343
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.930
But in Boston there were so many gigs you could,
you could mc these gigs.

344
00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:03.380
Like Lenny Clarke took me on the road.
I am seed for him.
You know,

345
00:19:03.381 --> 00:19:06.560
you just do an opening set,
just trying to try and get the crowd warmed up.

346
00:19:06.561 --> 00:19:09.380
Everybody wants someone to do that and they'll pay you 50 bucks,

347
00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:12.620
they'll pay 100 bucks and next thing you know you're actually making a hundred,

348
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.740
you know,
50 bucks a night,
$200 a night sometimes.
Absolutely.

349
00:19:15.741 --> 00:19:17.480
So when I came to New York and I was like,

350
00:19:17.481 --> 00:19:21.470
what I gotta do sets for free and that can only do like 10 minutes or something

351
00:19:21.471 --> 00:19:24.410
like that.
And I'm like,
fuck this.
I'm going to get,
I'll just drive to New Jersey.

352
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:28.040
So it was just drive to New Jersey.
I do sets there.
I drive to Connecticut.

353
00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:31.580
I did a lot of sets and Connecticut,
John Schuler Gigs.
You ever do those gigs?

354
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.040
He had them all over the past.
It was crazy.

355
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.460
<v 3>You know,
one of those like,
uh,
you know,
here's the thing,
you Joe,</v>

356
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.460
you're like pure,

357
00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.620
like really good to comedy is like the thing that really now that I'm all,

358
00:19:42.621 --> 00:19:43.840
they've been doing it like 26 years.

359
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.200
The thing that really bothers me the most is that these guys that I know that I

360
00:19:47.201 --> 00:19:50.260
bring out on the road that are headline,
headline and quality,
you know,

361
00:19:50.261 --> 00:19:51.880
some of them have credits,
some of them don't.

362
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.690
It's like they're not going to be able to headline even like a B room until like

363
00:19:56.691 --> 00:19:57.730
to get a TV show.

364
00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.180
And that's what sucks because I was like headline and for years and years and

365
00:20:01.181 --> 00:20:05.470
years before I was a even like,
you know,
a whatever,
a name.

366
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.800
And it was great because like nobody really knew me and it was really just me

367
00:20:08.801 --> 00:20:10.840
like learn the headline and that was cool.

368
00:20:10.841 --> 00:20:14.710
Now it's like you need like a TV show or you need like,
you know,
pocket.

369
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.570
Well who even knows

370
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.740
<v 0>and what he's saying is he didn't need anything back then.
He neither,
he nor I.</v>

371
00:20:19.741 --> 00:20:21.600
All we had was like a little credits.

372
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:25.770
I had like Mtvs had comedy hour and I would headline all over the country.

373
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.180
It's really,
you can't really do that anymore

374
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.210
<v 3>in an hour.
Special teams,
nothing,
you know,</v>

375
00:20:29.211 --> 00:20:32.210
cause the club owners and I get their deal,
I get it.

376
00:20:32.211 --> 00:20:34.160
They got to fill these seats.
You've got,
you know it's a business.

377
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.400
But like for these younger guys who like I bring out and I'm like this guy is

378
00:20:37.401 --> 00:20:39.590
blowing me off the stage.
He should be headlining.

379
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.710
And like I'll go to the club owner,
like you must have a slow week somewhere.

380
00:20:42.711 --> 00:20:45.200
Like you're bringing these guys,
I'm like working out and they're like,

381
00:20:45.201 --> 00:20:48.100
you know what?
We never,
we can't afford to do anymore.
We got to always

382
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.160
<v 4>be making money.
So that really sucks about comedy now I really hate it.</v>

383
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.370
But the win for these young guys is like,
I don't know,

384
00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:57.610
there's some in the water pipe but just self promotion,

385
00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.150
always self promoting friends checks.
I don't know what to tell you.

386
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:02.590
There are talking to themselves up.

387
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.530
We have a couple friends that are brilliant that have had those problems.

388
00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:08.490
Are Is your fear,
right?
A Duncan Trussell,
Joey Diaz,

389
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.480
those are the three of my friends that have had their,

390
00:21:10.481 --> 00:21:13.610
their brilliant comedians and they've had that problem with the podcast is

391
00:21:13.611 --> 00:21:15.130
straight and all that shit out.
Chill.

392
00:21:15.131 --> 00:21:17.590
We got a fucking standing ovation in Buffalo.

393
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:21.920
He got on stage and he got a standing ovation.
They know who the fuck he is.

394
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.500
It's the podcast.
That's why I did death squad transfer.

395
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.120
All my friends that all these guys that don't get TV credits,

396
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:31.540
they get commercials once in a while and then next thing you know,

397
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.810
because of the podcast,
because of the Internet,
those guys,

398
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:38.080
they get developed a huge following and it's like,

399
00:21:38.081 --> 00:21:40.000
and they all the sudden they go from,

400
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:43.950
I can't get work anywhere to like Ari's work in pretty much every weekend.
Our,

401
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.810
he's like,
he's all over the place.
So he's a great guy too.

402
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.030
I seen him at the comedy store all the time and,
and you know,

403
00:21:49.031 --> 00:21:51.760
he does it right because he's always trying out new shit down there.

404
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:55.840
He's a writer and he's pushing it and that's what that club especially in my

405
00:21:55.841 --> 00:21:59.090
mind is for.
You know,
it's just to like constantly be working on new shit.

406
00:21:59.091 --> 00:22:00.790
So yeah,
there's no industry there.

407
00:22:00.791 --> 00:22:03.940
But that was always the thought about the stores.
You can go crazy at the store.

408
00:22:03.941 --> 00:22:07.210
Like they would say,
don't do the,
we got some new dirty bit you're working on.

409
00:22:07.211 --> 00:22:08.710
Don't do it at the Improv cause what does it,

410
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.840
what if it bombs and what have some of the importance and the crowd.
Yes,

411
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.390
that happens man.
If someone sees you,

412
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.580
I got to seat people see me when I was starting out where really no one should

413
00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:23.050
have ever seen me and they never raised that memory,
that memory of shit.

414
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.840
It doesn't matter how you kill and your next special,

415
00:22:25.841 --> 00:22:28.540
doesn't matter how honed you have your hour,

416
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:32.080
it's just they remember that time you ate a dick at the laugh factory.

417
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.680
I love the memory too.
And it's always like if you're,

418
00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.540
if you're not hip to the fact that there are industry people,
and I like,

419
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.790
that's the cool thing about New York.
There's none of that shit.
You know,

420
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.960
maybe some guy will come up to you afterwards.
Like,

421
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.260
I own a beefsteak Charlie's somewhere.

422
00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:47.260
I want you to come down and do a bachelor party.
It'll be a fun time,
you know,

423
00:22:47.261 --> 00:22:50.140
like some weird set up.
But here it's like every,

424
00:22:50.141 --> 00:22:53.030
every person in the crowd has something to do with show business and like you're

425
00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.610
looking at might become someone.
So,
but I mean,

426
00:22:55.611 --> 00:22:56.770
you never know when someone's in the crowd.

427
00:22:56.771 --> 00:22:58.990
That could be just someone's assistant.
And next thing you know,

428
00:22:58.991 --> 00:23:01.630
five years later they're the head of some studio and they,

429
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:06.190
I remember when you ate shit on stage at the comedy store at about one in the

430
00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:09.280
morning,
you ain't shit on stage.
They're like,
oh,
I did.

431
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.690
I had some writers from news radio come to see me once.

432
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.630
And it was a long set in the main room.

433
00:23:16.631 --> 00:23:20.210
And truth be told I wasn't that good back then anyway.
I mean I just,

434
00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:23.380
I don't have been doing comedy for six years or something like that.
Seven years.

435
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:26.480
It was,
it.
I wasn't that good.
I just,
I,
I had sloppy nights,

436
00:23:26.481 --> 00:23:28.390
so like I could have nights where I nailed it,

437
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.180
but then I would have a night where I just fucking completely fell off the

438
00:23:31.181 --> 00:23:33.970
tracks and into the woods and I don't know what went wrong.
You know?

439
00:23:33.971 --> 00:23:36.480
That's how it is.
When you first started out,
the first seven,

440
00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.370
one of those nights where we said that Richard Lewis and somebody the first

441
00:23:39.371 --> 00:23:43.020
seven years or like the the hardest,
you know,
and I'll,
I'll,

442
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:47.880
I'll push that back to the first 10.
Honestly,
the first 10 years just suck.
Yeah.

443
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.450
Is fucking hard.
It's hard to figure out what the hell.

444
00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:54.530
I did my first CD after 11 years in it and I'm super glad that I waited that

445
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:57.110
long.
Cool.
That's cool.
Yeah.
Well it didn't have any,

446
00:23:57.111 --> 00:23:59.840
it's not like I had a lot of people beating down my door to do a CD.

447
00:23:59.841 --> 00:24:03.650
It was actually my idea to try to put it together.
So I was just lucky though,

448
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:05.900
because I could have released something earlier and it would have been a piece

449
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:07.780
of shit.
You know,
and I've,

450
00:24:07.781 --> 00:24:10.130
I've listened to some old recordings of myself and it's like,

451
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:15.050
I wouldn't even want to pull them on line is a goof fucking door like Stan hope

452
00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:15.950
did it.
He's brave.

453
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.910
Stan hope to put like some videos of his like first year on stage.

454
00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:26.030
He's my guy.
Love.
There's no when there's no,
no in that guy.

455
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.030
He's just amazing.
He's like a cool,
like when you listen to you,

456
00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:32.840
you're like your shit.
Cause I think growing up that was how I,

457
00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:34.530
that's how I fell in love with comedy.

458
00:24:34.531 --> 00:24:38.120
It was like listen to cds and ray and a watchman call it just like the five

459
00:24:38.121 --> 00:24:40.010
o'clock funnies,
whatever they had back then.

460
00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:44.720
And just like albums and like every time I see a standup special,
you know,

461
00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:48.590
it's like the same shit.
Some poor dude up there trying to like,
you know,
milk,

462
00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:48.921
milk,

463
00:24:48.921 --> 00:24:53.780
the labs and he looks so not having fun and it's like such a set up thing.

464
00:24:53.781 --> 00:24:57.320
It's like nobody can ever recapture like the Richard Pryor error of like,

465
00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:01.250
you know,
he's wasted.
The crowds wasted fucking rambling.

466
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.970
And every word ever in his fucking mouth is like a delicious fucking Angel Fart

467
00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:09.620
of just like wisdom,
you know.
Do you ever hear the old those Richard Pryor tapes?

468
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.010
There was a gas station that was selling these tapes near my house,

469
00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:15.560
a gas station and little box of cassettes they would sell.

470
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:19.950
And somehow or another,
this guy was selling these Richard Pryor tapes.
So I,

471
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:24.010
I bought a bunch of them.
Man,
I forget,
like it was like Richard Fox,
uh,

472
00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.590
Richard prior to Red Fox theater.
I think that's what it was.

473
00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.170
It was like red files,
this club.
I've heard bits of that.

474
00:25:30.171 --> 00:25:33.710
I haven't heard like reg red Foxx is nightclub.
He's just up there talking shit.

475
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.200
Just high as fuck talking shit.

476
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:40.280
And every other word out of his mouth was just a jam to gem.

477
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.750
But the crowds were so cool.
They were like there for the party.
Yeah.
Yeah.

478
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:48.290
It's like everybody's so like hyper aware of themselves and like they're so

479
00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:51.290
afraid to laugh at fucking anything.
You know?
There's a lot of that,

480
00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:52.820
but there's a lot of cool people out there too.

481
00:25:52.821 --> 00:25:55.400
It's just got to figure out how to attract only them.

482
00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.840
Well you have a cool audience.

483
00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.600
I mean honestly I don't know how I pulled it up cooler for a cooler crowd.
No,

484
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:04.150
and you play like some really cool off the wall venues and that that's,

485
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.080
that's what it's about.
You know,

486
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.870
I always hear from waitresses and it's one of the coolest things ever.

487
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.710
I always hear from waitresses that my people are nice and generous.
Yeah,

488
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.680
she goes tippers.
I love that.
That is,

489
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.780
to me that is the ultimate compliment that somehow or another of of of

490
00:26:18.781 --> 00:26:22.640
accumulated a bunch of Nice people and unless the the greatest thing that could

491
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:25.380
ever pull off.
Oh they love it.
Like when your crowd good drunk,

492
00:26:25.381 --> 00:26:27.260
it's like my crowd was like master drunk.

493
00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:31.220
They know what the fuck do you do it and was another little kids.

494
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.920
He's the first person I talked to do standup because of that.

495
00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.950
It really being a the insomnia show and he caught me.

496
00:26:36.951 --> 00:26:38.360
I recording him cause I didn't,

497
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.290
I never went to a comedy show so I didn't know like what do you like?

498
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:44.290
I was using the bands always try to sneak my camcorder

499
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.930
<v 3>in and try to take like a clip or something so I'm going to be $8 according to</v>

500
00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.110
in it on stage.
The videos,
him pointing at me,
he goes,
hey,
you know what,

501
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:56.370
the camera,
I turned out
I wanted to bring that clip.

502
00:26:56.371 --> 00:27:00.420
I forgot them should have brought that probably was fatter and just like all

503
00:27:00.421 --> 00:27:05.040
puffy.
I love that.
I love that.
Like 20 pounds of booze on you.
The puffiness.

504
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:09.300
It's really not the booze,
it's the Burger and fries and more fries.

505
00:27:09.301 --> 00:27:11.700
And then of course you got to have a piece of cake.
Yeah.
You know,

506
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.460
porn for your stomach.
Oh,
after gigs,
man,
I eat like several people.

507
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.430
<v 4>Would I do a two show Saturday night,
Brian?
I'll tell ya,</v>

508
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.980
he rested ridiculous amounts of food where people,
they don't even,

509
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:29.600
didn't only think I'm being honest,
the waitress three times give me two entrees.

510
00:27:29.601 --> 00:27:32.390
I want a steak and I want a chicken.
I'll wait to,
it's always the leaves

511
00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:34.610
<v 3>like you're like,
I'm not done.</v>

512
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.110
And then I order stupid amounts of food after gigs.
Ma'Am.

513
00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:39.861
What's your like,

514
00:27:39.861 --> 00:27:43.250
what's your like fucking guilty but what's your like waffles swap after the

515
00:27:43.251 --> 00:27:46.720
sheriff.
Fuck,
I love options.
Would crazy amounts of butter on them,
dude.

516
00:27:46.721 --> 00:27:50.420
Just Slatter that shit and butter cover that motherfucker.

517
00:27:50.421 --> 00:27:53.030
Maple Syrup and I'm not really down with those Belgium waffles.

518
00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.190
I like the waffles they give you when you go to Roscoe's.

519
00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.450
Roscoe's chicken and Waffles,

520
00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.600
they have the thin waffles that then rifles are the real deal.

521
00:27:59.601 --> 00:28:02.060
Those big stupid Belgium waffles.

522
00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.890
Those puffy fucking stupid waffles did too much.
That's it.

523
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.640
That's all you got.
I'll take the Belgium waffle,
but God,
goddammit.

524
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.700
Regular waffles or better.
What's your stays?
What's your night?
I was like,

525
00:28:13.701 --> 00:28:16.880
well you know,
cause I always professional drunk so it'd be like a,
you know,

526
00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.390
lots of me.
I needed to me to like fight the booze and my stomach,

527
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:22.580
but it always came up like,
you know,

528
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:27.590
shitting blood and just horrible fucking just like how many times you shed
blood.

529
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.190
I'll tell you like I've shipped blood for weeks

530
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.660
<v 4>and then I've shipped to,
you know,</v>

531
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:37.210
be like you don't have healthcare so you gotta kind of like do your own

532
00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.640
analysis,
taste it.
I don't know if it's too sweet.

533
00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.490
I do my own kind of,
maybe I need less oranges in my diet,
but a,
I'm like,

534
00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.120
<v 3>you know,
all those horrible experiences,</v>

535
00:28:49.121 --> 00:28:52.360
but I definitely meet was the thing that would help me fucking fight the booze.

536
00:28:52.361 --> 00:28:54.610
But I'll tell you like now that like I don't drink,

537
00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.720
there's something about cake that like,
it's like pussy,
you know,
it's like,

538
00:28:58.721 --> 00:29:01.220
you know,
like you'll stare at it and like try not to be,
you know,

539
00:29:01.221 --> 00:29:04.960
like let it know that you love it.
Do you try to eat healthy?

540
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.690
I'm trying to eat like a,
which we call it,

541
00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.770
you know like oatmeal cause like oatmeal.

542
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.630
It's like this like when to hit like I'm 46 so they'll like,
oh meal,
I'll take,

543
00:29:13.631 --> 00:29:16.060

I was like,
nothing's going to fucking help them.

544
00:29:16.061 --> 00:29:19.780
Chain smoking,
drinking black fucking coffee here.
Like coffee's good for,

545
00:29:19.781 --> 00:29:23.260
this is fucking great copy.
Is it really from all,
it's Kona coffee.

546
00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:27.160
I love this shit.
Is stopping drinking,
help the blood,
like he's still bleed now.

547
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.110
I only bleed for the economy.

548
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.600
<v 4>Good job troops for Joe.
I believe for the troops and the economy.
We know jobs.</v>

549
00:29:34.601 --> 00:29:39.390
When you,
um,
you know,
you just sort of let it stop bleeding.
No,
it just,
you know,

550
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:43.480
whatever.
I don't know you're wrong.
I'm a blood brother.
I did the same thing.

551
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:49.560
My body,
it happens for weeks for me to honestly,

552
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.433
I mean,
I'm,

553
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.860
<v 3>some days I'm still alive and like the fact that like,
you know,</v>

554
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.590
I'm so self destructive like my mother,
you know,
like she's such a sweetheart,

555
00:29:56.591 --> 00:29:58.690
like,
you know,
I kinda like,
we're responsible for her.

556
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.380
So that's what the only thing that keeps me from like crossing that line of
like,

557
00:30:02.381 --> 00:30:05.710
you know,
like fuck yeah,
I'm going to huff paint and you know,
the dual,

558
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.810
that kind of stuff.
I mean,
because honestly,
you know,

559
00:30:07.811 --> 00:30:10.960
when you're a comic and you're out there balls deep in the road,
it's like,

560
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.310
do you really care?
You know,

561
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:17.200
it's like you just looking for the next fucking wild.
This tonight.
It's fun,

562
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.040
it's fun now it's,
yeah,
now whatever.

563
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:25.290
<v 4>It's fun to have a bunch of shots with some people and kind of do my five and</v>

564
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:26.310
the problem is the next,

565
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:30.310
<v 3>oh yeah.
And that's the problem.
But then now you get older,
right?</v>

566
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:32.390
And like you got a mortgage and you've got to do,
you know,

567
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:34.450
you got kids and everything like that.
It's like,
ah,

568
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.240
<v 4>I just wished boots didn't do any damage.</v>

569
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:39.460
I wish booze was like weed or you did it.
You never felt the next day,

570
00:30:39.461 --> 00:30:40.900
you're fine.
Well,
because we're Americans

571
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.700
<v 3>do,
you know,
we fucking work hard and we drink hard and we,
and we,
and we're like,</v>

572
00:30:44.701 --> 00:30:45.900
fuck you,
we have the right to do it.

573
00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.250
<v 4>I know it was your reengineer booze.
You know,</v>

574
00:30:49.251 --> 00:30:52.100
some scientists need to get on this whole Buddhist thing and figure out,

575
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:55.610
give me the effects of booze,
you know,
make it tastes like booze.

576
00:30:55.611 --> 00:30:57.800
But figuring out a way where it doesn't wreck your system.

577
00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.140
There's gotta be a way to recreate being drunk without testing,

578
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:06.050
without making you just poisoned,
you know,
I mean really,
we're so retarded.

579
00:31:06.051 --> 00:31:07.130
We go poison each other

580
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.810
<v 3>like so many good effects for it.
But it was never my drug.
But I like,
I totally,</v>

581
00:31:11.811 --> 00:31:16.460
I'm like,
we're all like or don't like it rather Stan hope doesn't like it.
Yeah,

582
00:31:16.461 --> 00:31:18.650
no we were boozing and like,
you know drug guys,

583
00:31:18.651 --> 00:31:22.340
we weren't about the weed that you didn't like.
Well no offense,

584
00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.990
but I thought it was kind of prissy.

585
00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.670
I always thought it was a sit around and like there's something about weed and

586
00:31:28.671 --> 00:31:31.880
like sitting on a couch and then all of a sudden there's a guitar there for some

587
00:31:31.881 --> 00:31:36.350
reason and then now you're hearing a million parodies or you're hearing a

588
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.530
million fucking days and everyone's giggling.
And then me,

589
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.250
<v 4>if you're around,
if you're hanging around with idiots and they get high,</v>

590
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:45.040
you're in for some profound stupidity.

591
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:48.340
But I think it facilitates thinking.

592
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.790
Definitely a lot of people don't like it cause it makes you paranoid though.

593
00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:54.610
Cause it can.
It's if you're not into that,
if you're not in

594
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:58.100
<v 3>can out yourself,
it can fuck with you.
Well,
Dr Drew,
you know,
not to bring it up.</v>

595
00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:01.100
I love toxin germs.
No.
Okay.

596
00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:06.160
Well just the Rehab Rehab I've watched a few times because just to go whoa,

597
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.550
well like they had a guy on there,
I'm not going to say whatever movie,
sorry.

598
00:32:09.551 --> 00:32:14.300
It was like his vaporizing pot and like,
oh yeah.
Not say his name.
Eric.

599
00:32:14.301 --> 00:32:16.820
Robert.
Okay.
Eric Roberts.
So I don't know if he's done the podcast or not,

600
00:32:16.821 --> 00:32:20.070
but we have on the podcast by the code,
you know,
whatever.

601
00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.880
Pick up my fucking thumbs.
Charlie.
He's the most,

602
00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:27.850
he's the most celebrity to be rehabbed in my mind.
I'm like,
yeah,

603
00:32:27.851 --> 00:32:32.450
that's an amazing actor.
If that's all he's doing,
so be it.
It's La,

604
00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:36.300
he's an actor getting high.
It's like,
you know,
isn't that part of the think?

605
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.980
That was just a shit career move.
It was just a terrible move.
I

606
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.200
<v 4>mean,
come on.
He's saying that he's got an addiction to pod.</v>

607
00:32:42.201 --> 00:32:44.240
That's so just stop smoking pot.
Yeah.

608
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:47.900
Everybody's shaking their all shitting blood.
It's like reading the papers,

609
00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:50.180
drinking a cup of coffee.
It was like nothing was wrong with,

610
00:32:50.181 --> 00:32:51.680
this is one guy that doesn't have a problem.

611
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.450
They showed him vaporizing in this beautiful bathroom in this house.

612
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:59.050
Like that's not the sign of a drug addict.
Okay.

613
00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.930
That's like should be like an a shack.
The trailer park.
It's just silly.

614
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.420
So whatever.
But uh,
but it's a different effect.

615
00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:07.520
It's not that freewheeling carefree.

616
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:12.020
I don't give a fuck effect that alcohol is alcohol.
I like,
I liked that.

617
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.040
I've looked at Brian and I like it.
We've,
you know,

618
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.240
when we go out and we'd do a weekend at a club somewhere for,

619
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.760
and it's always the question you want to do a shot?

620
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.560
And I don't think he said no one's ever said no.
Probably be too drunk.

621
00:33:27.561 --> 00:33:31.960
Done into stoned.
Definitely.
It's,
it's too stoned to me.
It's like a heart,

622
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.450
a heart attack.
I can't think of anything straight.

623
00:33:34.451 --> 00:33:37.700
I can't even make sentences drunk is like,
I could probably get through drawing.

624
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.630
I agree with you.

625
00:33:38.631 --> 00:33:42.290
But I liked that experience because I always learned something about myself from

626
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:46.040
it.
Whenever I have bad trips,
whenever I go too deep into the rabbit hole,

627
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:50.210
I always come out of it with a good knowledge of whatever is fucking with me.

628
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.490
Yeah.
Because sometimes the way to look at it,
sometimes you,

629
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:57.770
sometimes you can put shut off,
you know there's things that you,
you,

630
00:33:57.771 --> 00:34:00.800
you really need to be concentrating on.
You don't go out,
you know,

631
00:34:00.801 --> 00:34:03.620
and then you don't realize how much your,
you know,

632
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:08.300
how much it's in the back of your hand until you have like some crazy Brownie

633
00:34:08.301 --> 00:34:12.770
high where you get way too scared and nervous and then you start realizing

634
00:34:12.771 --> 00:34:15.800
yourself,
like the full reality of all,

635
00:34:15.801 --> 00:34:19.550
you're the way you're thinking and all your weird experiences and how you

636
00:34:19.551 --> 00:34:23.090
process them and couldn't really mind.
Fuck the shit out of you.

637
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:25.880
And it's not comfortable,
man.
It doesn't feel good at all.

638
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:30.680
But when it's over you go,
oh,
okay,
I see what's wrong with me now.
I see what's,

639
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:32.870
what's been bugging me now.
I see.
You know?

640
00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.710
But then pushing to the back of my head,
don't you feel it like a comedy,

641
00:34:36.711 --> 00:34:39.560
which is like an ultimate like especially when you're first starting out,

642
00:34:39.561 --> 00:34:42.980
when you suck and you're really standing in front of a group of people who

643
00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.310
smelled blood in the water.
Oh Shit.
Blood.

644
00:34:46.311 --> 00:34:51.311
I'm talking about like there's like a weak fucking animal rip it apart and like

645
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.220
that's,
you're never as alive as you are in that moment.

646
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.200
That's addictive to me at least.

647
00:34:57.201 --> 00:35:00.680
Is that that moment of like where you're like one against many,
you know,

648
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.260
outnumbered out.
I used to get off on that.

649
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:07.460
Booze was really just a side sidetrack.
But you've been in like experienced.

650
00:35:07.461 --> 00:35:11.060
Especially like with fighting,
you know it's like he can't like the high,

651
00:35:11.061 --> 00:35:15.350
the intensity of that.
It's very hard thing.
That's why guys keep coming back.

652
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:15.980
You know,

653
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:20.170
even guys like sugar ray Leonard kept boxing like way past his prime and a lot

654
00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:24.050
of their old,
they all do.
They all come back and they get fucked up and you know,

655
00:35:24.051 --> 00:35:26.750
it's like a story as old as time.
It's cause they,
the,

656
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:31.810
the addiction of being out there and winning and just the high of the

657
00:35:32.301 --> 00:35:35.450
experience.
And then when it's over there,
their definition,

658
00:35:35.451 --> 00:35:38.130
their self definition is all based on their fighting.

659
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.480
<v 0>You know,
like this is the classic example of the old fighter that it's always,</v>

660
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.950
you know,
telling war stories,

661
00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:47.310
reminding everybody about what he did and how annoying everybody thinks that

662
00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:51.780
shit is.
They don't want to hear that.
Back on 69 I was fighting Mickey,
you know,

663
00:35:51.781 --> 00:35:55.530
you know those guys,
you know,
and why is that guy that like I somehow or another,

664
00:35:55.650 --> 00:36:00.650
his life went from being this wild ride of intense experiences,

665
00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:05.520
too mundane nothingness.
Every day he's doing nothing.

666
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:10.020
Every day he's seeing his kids and every day he's getting the paper and every

667
00:36:10.021 --> 00:36:14.550
day he's nothing.
He's not a fighter anymore.
It doesn't have this intense life.

668
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:18.900
And he's addicted to like this super high frequency of life.
So they go,

669
00:36:18.901 --> 00:36:20.530
you know what?
I'm going to give it a comeback.
I've been,

670
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.460
they'd get up and training.
I dropped 20 pounds,
I'm gonna run around the block.

671
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.460
They just want to have that intense experience again,

672
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.560
that's like a regular lifestyle enough.

673
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.820
<v 3>That's what I think like,
especially with,</v>

674
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:33.180
I know you've got a lot of like bedrooms,
a lot of that's coming up by the way,

675
00:36:33.181 --> 00:36:36.720
veterans day.
And uh,
I've done some shows,
Uso tours and stuff like that.

676
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:37.880
And I see the look in the,

677
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.740
in these young kids eyes who definitely have been like,
you know,

678
00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.350
in combat rotated many,
many times.

679
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.270
They come back here and it's all surreal for them,
you know,
whether they're,

680
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:51.600
uh,
you know,
just like walking down the street,
whatever.

681
00:36:51.601 --> 00:36:55.650
It's got to be such a real adjustment that like none of us could ever
understand.

682
00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:58.260
But I will tell you what comedy that like once you,

683
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.370
everybody thinks they're a comic,
but once you like drink the fucking lifestyle,

684
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:04.690
like when the lifestyle is like,
we,
like,

685
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:08.220
you only feel comfortable hanging out at a comedy club,
you know,
that's like,

686
00:37:08.221 --> 00:37:10.710
you know,
it's like,
it's like your secret garden.
That's when you know,

687
00:37:10.711 --> 00:37:13.320
you're like,
you're never gonna go.
It's not like your parents are always like,

688
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.470
maybe you'll go back to school and it's like fuck that.

689
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.570
That's never going to happen.
I'm never going to whatever.

690
00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:21.540
And you know the fact that I'm the biggest loser loser in the family yet,

691
00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:25.510
you know,
I pay the mortgage,
they're like pretty stoked about that.
So you know,

692
00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:29.400
you know,
I was like I'm the most uneducated fucking zero,
you know,

693
00:37:29.401 --> 00:37:33.600
whatever my family but still like,
you know,
kick in and do my part.
So,
uh,

694
00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.470
I'll just say that like the lifestyle is the fucking addiction and the comedy is

695
00:37:37.471 --> 00:37:41.850
like the,
you know,
is the gravy cause uh,
doing the shows,
man,
it's fucking,

696
00:37:41.851 --> 00:37:44.250
I wouldn't trade even a bad one for,
for the experience.

697
00:37:44.251 --> 00:37:45.950
I'll tell you that like looking back in hindsight,

698
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.090
like the bad ones were like lessons you needed.

699
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.390
The good ones were like just fucking jerk and off cause the bad ones were like

700
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.770
fucking hard,
hard lessons.
Like,
like Batman on ice when it had a fight.

701
00:37:55.771 --> 00:37:56.604
You know what I'm saying?

702
00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.140
<v 0>Yeah.
These are a few that really stand out.</v>

703
00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.400
I've got some with some bombs like from my past where it just still to this day

704
00:38:03.401 --> 00:38:07.070
I just go,
Oh God,
yeah,
like brushing my teeth in 2011 thinking about a,

705
00:38:07.071 --> 00:38:11.480
said I had 92 and just go
fuck.

706
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.660
I ate some dick up there.
I would be like,

707
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:18.470
<v 3>I would walk out of the theater and like nobody,
no eye contact,
you know the,
Oh,</v>

708
00:38:18.471 --> 00:38:21.960
let's route it.
And then you'd walk out and you're like,
please,

709
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.410
some kind of automobile hit me.
Or it's just something,

710
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.530
something horrible softball,
more horrible thing to think about.

711
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:31.050
<v 0>But yeah,
people don't know that.</v>

712
00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:33.660
I'd have no idea what the experience of bombing feels like.

713
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.980
I always say it's like sucking a thousand Dick's in front of your

714
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.500
<v 4>mother.
It's probably worse.</v>

715
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.740
It's probably worse than that because somewhere out there someone would like to

716
00:38:41.741 --> 00:38:46.630
suck a thousand Dixon Front.
It was the ultimate naughty thing and amazing race.

717
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.530
That would be cool.
I think a thousand dicks.
It's almost so it's like,

718
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.380
when do you like,
I'm sorry mom,
it's like a hot dog eating contest,

719
00:38:56.381 --> 00:38:58.990
but without the,
you know,
you definitely don't do it outdoors.

720
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.310
People don't gather going to be dicks would get rancid.
It wouldn't be good.

721
00:39:03.311 --> 00:39:05.390
By the time he got to him,
there's no countdown either

722
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.700
998.
You lose track.

723
00:39:10.701 --> 00:39:15.410
How many loads of I swag speaking of porn,
speaking to porn,
your show man,

724
00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.350
Dave's old porn on showtime.
So what,
what does this show?

725
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:21.400
What's going on in your watch porn and you just goof on it.
Yeah,

726
00:39:21.401 --> 00:39:23.010
it's the mystery science theater of porn

727
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:27.840
<v 3>kicking this idea for like four or five years.
And uh,
you know,
uh,</v>

728
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:31.710
finally found the place that it's cool enough to let us do it.
Showtime.
And,
uh,

729
00:39:31.711 --> 00:39:33.300
I came up with the idea with Stuart Bailey,

730
00:39:33.301 --> 00:39:37.650
who's a exact on another TV show and we just been like,
you know,
having a ball,

731
00:39:37.651 --> 00:39:42.630
like working the comics,
gray comics on it.
And uh,
just like legends of Porn,

732
00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.390
you know,
porn is better if not as well as me.
And you're a man over here.

733
00:39:46.391 --> 00:39:48.360
And I was a tons of porn,
you know,

734
00:39:48.361 --> 00:39:52.800
like Seiko who like growing up like you know Uber Goddess.

735
00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.010
I always thought she was like some German like being a Jew.
I'm a Jew.
Okay.

736
00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.080
Like this is like so like blonde fucking super hot Uber fucking chick.

737
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.600
She's like,
you know,
she's a country girl from Kansas.

738
00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.390
I'm not going to say exactly where she's from,
but she's like,
you know,

739
00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:10.980
it's a regular chick,
Nina Hartley who was the kind of a crossover but yet very,

740
00:40:10.981 --> 00:40:14.220
very sweaty.
The comedy store.
I'm very nice lady.
Very cool.

741
00:40:14.221 --> 00:40:16.140
And then of course Ron Jeremy,
who was like,
you know,

742
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:18.840
everybody's a porn star and millennium.

743
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.840
<v 4>Can you remember the first time you met someone in person that you had beaten</v>

744
00:40:21.841 --> 00:40:24.340
off to?
Who?
Ron.
Jeremy?
No,
no,

745
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:28.380
it was Doris as forwarding.
The worst is when you,

746
00:40:28.381 --> 00:40:30.120
you recognize a guy's Dick.

747
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:33.720
That's when you know you've seen too much for Peter North.
You're like,

748
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:37.680
oh Jesus Christ,
the fuck is wrong with me.
I'm recognizing dude's dicks.

749
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:43.450
You know,
just free HD,
little tiny fucking

750
00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:45.750
<v 3>foreign screen.
This is like a,</v>

751
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.770
the thing about it is like I've jerked off to all of them and like,

752
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:49.910
like you know,

753
00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:53.160
there was the jerking off from when I was just like a guy jerking off.

754
00:40:53.161 --> 00:40:55.020
Like any guy out there like let's jerk off.

755
00:40:55.110 --> 00:41:00.060
And then there was like the research for the show jerk off you sitting in my

756
00:41:00.061 --> 00:41:03.780
apartment with hundreds of classic Retro Harry Porn tapes and like watching,

757
00:41:03.781 --> 00:41:06.420
watching,
watching,
watching and then like going like,
okay,

758
00:41:06.421 --> 00:41:07.980
we're going to have to like take a break.
And like,

759
00:41:07.981 --> 00:41:09.420
I'd have to like shoot like this massive,

760
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:14.640
<v 4>like my dick was owed.
Like my Dick had been so good dog.</v>

761
00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:15.493
You know,

762
00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.160
my Dick had led me and all the right directions and then to finally got a chance

763
00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:23.800
to hold the ball,
you know?
Oh my God.
It was like,
I just have to have to,

764
00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:28.020
you know the,
so you watched all this stuff just hours watching it hours.
Yeah.

765
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:30.720
Wow.
That must be a mind fuck.

766
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:34.070
<v 3>Well it was just weird to just have piles of porn.
Like everybody,</v>

767
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.280
that was always my big joke.
The duffle bag full of VHS porn,
you know,

768
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:39.080
moving from one apartment to the next one.
Like

769
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:44.020
<v 4>did anybody order a sad sailor?
You know,
the new roommate.</v>

770
00:41:44.021 --> 00:41:48.680
Gulp,
what's this guy going to be like?
But uh,
you know,
uh,
I love tape

771
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:48.961
<v 3>you saying,</v>

772
00:41:48.961 --> 00:41:52.050
I can tell you I like it better than the downloads and under the downloads it's

773
00:41:52.051 --> 00:41:55.900
killing porn,
but you know,
who can,
who can afford it?
You to tape slugger CD's,

774
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.590
a CD,
you know,
like a CD,
DVD,
whatever.

775
00:41:58.591 --> 00:42:02.550
But I used to have the old VHS VHS tapes,
so my mom's laws,
the machine.
So,

776
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.230
you know,
sometimes we will watch together.

777
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.530
Horn guys were always coming to the comedy store,
handing out DVDs.

778
00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:10.440
There's no weird porn dudes.
Yeah,
it's hard being a dude in point.

779
00:42:10.441 --> 00:42:12.710
It really is like the unsung hero really.

780
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:16.320
Before Viagara Ron Jeremy said it on his show with Whitney Cummings.
He was like,

781
00:42:16.321 --> 00:42:19.400
you know,
there's only like 10 guys who could do this without,
by Agra.
You know,

782
00:42:19.401 --> 00:42:22.650
it's like you really had to like love to be a zen master,
like,

783
00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.560
and to come when they want you in August.
So that was like back in the day.

784
00:42:25.561 --> 00:42:28.530
Now it's like,
you know there's a lot of enhancement.
There's a lot of training.

785
00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:34.700
<v 4>They squeeze their balls to try to keep like men can do like kegels sorta like</v>

786
00:42:35.181 --> 00:42:36.014
girls.

787
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.140
If you really want to become a professional and you sit around and just you know

788
00:42:39.141 --> 00:42:41.450
that you think of squeezing your deck,

789
00:42:41.451 --> 00:42:44.790
think I'm just right now I'm doing it to ready you.

790
00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:50.590
Just like a count of 20 like where are you squeezing?

791
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:55.250
Like Paul area you bought like from the tank top?
Yeah,
from the tank top.

792
00:42:55.251 --> 00:42:56.930
Just trying to squeeze that whole area.

793
00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.150
They get about the same muscles that you would use.

794
00:42:59.151 --> 00:43:03.650
You try not to Piss your pants
and you do that man.

795
00:43:03.651 --> 00:43:08.180
Do that for like 20 seconds.
Do Reps of 20 you've got to get real Zan with that.

796
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:10.130
Do you ever like hang a weight on your cock?

797
00:43:10.131 --> 00:43:13.550
I'm like trying to do the whole like,
Oh I haven't done that yet.
Yeah,
that's,

798
00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:16.930
that was worry that that would rip it or,
yeah,

799
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:18.920
or just terrify bar.

800
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.920
Have you heard about silicone that that guys have been shooting in their dicks

801
00:43:21.921 --> 00:43:25.790
for us?
I saw one guy,
oh,

802
00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.680
to make it look bigger or younger.

803
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.600
Silicone was a salient salient or something to make it look younger.

804
00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.940
Make it look,
because that's what women want.
A younger looking deck

805
00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:40.300
it way it gives the age away.

806
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:43.060
The ball sack is the definite pin code on your cock.
So it's like,

807
00:43:43.061 --> 00:43:45.890
it's not exactly,
exactly Hanson,
but it's time it comes out.

808
00:43:45.891 --> 00:43:49.310
If you got to that point,
it's going to get buried,
going to get buried somewhere.

809
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.940
Don't worry about it.
But these guys,
they,
they shoot it into their balls.

810
00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:56.150
Was it Saint Lena?
Was it silicone?
It might have been.
So I'm known as silicon,

811
00:43:56.151 --> 00:44:01.151
but they did his balls became this big giant like floppy sort of water bag

812
00:44:03.441 --> 00:44:06.470
thing.
It's like almost like,
uh,
like uh,

813
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.310
like the inside of a water bed or something.
It was like sloshy you know,

814
00:44:10.311 --> 00:44:13.160
and his Dick was all sloshy.
It was really weird.

815
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:16.760
It was like everything was big and fat and plump.
I love oddities.

816
00:44:16.761 --> 00:44:20.480
That would be like a good,
like a mystery.
Like what else?
Kelsey shows,
you know,

817
00:44:20.481 --> 00:44:21.314
oddities,

818
00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.050
you know the ones where it's like I didn't know I was pregnant and the girl wore

819
00:44:24.051 --> 00:44:25.790
coat and her house for like nine months.

820
00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:29.580
It shows and showtime allowing you to show penetration and things like that.

821
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.980
They cover it up with like a green screen type thing where they have

822
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.060
<v 3>like their couch sitting.</v>

823
00:44:33.061 --> 00:44:37.320
You know I use the couch was very much like mystery science theater kind of

824
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:39.960
where they do a lot.
It's the same five clips of it.

825
00:44:39.961 --> 00:44:43.620
But once they started actually penetrating,
you don't show that.
We show tits,

826
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:44.371
tits,

827
00:44:44.371 --> 00:44:48.090
we show actual when I want to show much penis cause all that was the one of the

828
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.601
very cool,

829
00:44:48.601 --> 00:44:51.720
cause there's a lot of fans of this stuff there and I don't know this stuff half

830
00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:54.920
as well as these guys do like a retro stuff,
you know and they're like,
you know,

831
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:57.900
I want to see more dick or whatever.
I would love to show gay.

832
00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.810
Like I think all porn is the same.
You know what I'm saying?
It's all good.

833
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.140
You know,
it's all fighting the fight,
the good fight,
but it's like they're like,

834
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:06.690
we want to see more peanuts,
but they have a thing about pain.
Is there like on,

835
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.730
I think on all premium channels,
you know,

836
00:45:08.731 --> 00:45:11.550
like you're allowed to show more hooch then you are a penis for some reason.

837
00:45:11.551 --> 00:45:15.710
I don't know who digs her offensive.
Well,
yeah,
well dicks are ugly as you said,

838
00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:20.160
but yeah,
they're just fucking fantastically whatever.

839
00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:22.530
But I guess the penis,
you know,

840
00:45:22.531 --> 00:45:25.110
whatever you're allowed to show for like a second.
But the hood,

841
00:45:25.111 --> 00:45:27.750
she could show there's more area of the vagina that a,

842
00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:32.100
especially if it's incredibly hairy and these boxes are like fucking wow.

843
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:36.810
Like pulling Hussein out of that hole.
The spider hole.
That's like that.
Every,

844
00:45:36.811 --> 00:45:39.430
every time I would see one of these porn,
I'm like,
we got them.

845
00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:45.330
I mean,
Joe,
I don't know if you guys like Harry and Harry,
I had already bought,

846
00:45:45.331 --> 00:45:48.780
I don't like that idea.
I dealt with those young,
not your girl.

847
00:45:48.781 --> 00:45:51.180
Your girl has gotta be like cleaning the for for work right now.

848
00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:54.030
But I like having a look,
a little patch.
I got the girls,

849
00:45:54.031 --> 00:45:57.270
I just shave it all the time.
I don't like that.
I like it.

850
00:45:57.271 --> 00:46:00.990
Maybe once every three weeks you have a little patch or something.
You know?

851
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:05.430
Isn't it funny that the intense violence they show on a network like showtime on

852
00:46:05.431 --> 00:46:09.390
a regular basis?
Like Riddick?
Like did you see the movie drive?
Yeah,

853
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.660
they'll probably show that uncut on showtime.
Right.

854
00:46:12.661 --> 00:46:16.190
That was incredibly violent fucking movie.
Right?
Some of those scenes.
Yeah.

855
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.150
There were some scenes that were pretty deep.

856
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:22.920
That scene in the elevator with Oh God.
Yeah,
it's really intense.

857
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.640
It's showtime would play it because it's like check them.
They won't show Dix.

858
00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.300
Well,
I think it has to do with this like some kind of standard thing.
But Dexter,

859
00:46:30.301 --> 00:46:32.130
which is like a really cool serial killers,

860
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:35.760
like you're seeing like a disempowerment.
So,
but we're Americans,

861
00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:39.990
so like we're were into violence.
But the sex thing is like,
it's amazing.

862
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:44.100
It's amazing how intense the violence can get and everybody's cool with it.

863
00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:47.970
It's never enough.
Right.
The next movie always has to have more fucking,
you know,

864
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:52.520
beheadings and shit like that.
That's why overseas,
like when you go overseas,
you,

865
00:46:52.521 --> 00:46:54.330
you've done like shows in England and all that kind of stuff.

866
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:58.170
They have this impression office of like this is a gun fucking nuts.
You know,

867
00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.090
I love guns personally.

868
00:47:00.091 --> 00:47:03.480
I respect them and I think everybody should be able to laugh at one.
But I agree.

869
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.520
It's like over you go overseas and then they'll like,
you know,

870
00:47:05.521 --> 00:47:07.860
you cow boy blah blah blah blah blah.

871
00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:11.260
And they try to imitate our movies with their Shitty,
you know,
whatever,
you know,

872
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.530
stories.
And I'm like,
dude,
you know,

873
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.730
I wish America was as cool as you see in these movies cause it ain't to strip

874
00:47:17.731 --> 00:47:22.050
mall.
All right.
It's a petty cure.
Fucking strip mall.
Fucking Sam's Club.

875
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.990
It's not Stallone and Cobra.
It's none of that dude.

876
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:29.710
It's no hanging off the skid steer,
the helicopter Red Dawn.
It's fucking,
yeah,

877
00:47:29.711 --> 00:47:31.060
it's really pretty tame here.

878
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:34.720
<v 0>Yeah.
But most of them,
the countries you go to,
like they do,</v>

879
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.210
they look at you like you've done something in America.

880
00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:42.490
It's most countries hate us right now.
It's,
it's Kinda,
I mean,
not us,

881
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:45.640
but hate what this,
you know,
as a unit is doing

882
00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:51.750
<v 3>well.
That's why whenever you go overseas,
you know,
like a,
you know,</v>

883
00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.750
some guys would go like,
if it gets really bad,
pretend you're Canadian.
I'm like,

884
00:47:55.090 --> 00:48:00.030
no,
I'm going to do that.
It gets really bad.
That's like,
I'm not going to do that.

885
00:48:00.031 --> 00:48:02.880
And it's been fucking go head to head with this Moroccan kid who's fucking,

886
00:48:02.881 --> 00:48:05.660
you know,
I'm going to go balls deep with it.

887
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.250
I'm going to fucking not pull back on that.
I mean,
honestly,

888
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:12.330
I like how they always like make us like we the creator of evil.
And it's like,

889
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:14.490
it's like you talked to some guy from Holland and it's like,

890
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.790
didn't you start slavery?
I mean,
honestly,
I mean,
you know,

891
00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.630
we're pretty dumb in America,
but really doing,

892
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.180
what are you the first guys to do it?

893
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.440
I think everybody's towards your goal or something.
You know?

894
00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:27.510
What are they all do in slavery?
I mean,
who we just did a better and longer.

895
00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:30.570
That was the problem.
You know,
you gotta like get out and get out early.

896
00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:34.430
How long did the Romans do it for?
Oh,
I dunno,
but I was,
I mean,

897
00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:37.230
have there been periods where there was slavery in the,
no.
Slavery.
How,

898
00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:40.040
how's that work?
We're all slaves now too.
Or debit cards or,
I mean,

899
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.050
that's fucking caught him up right now.

900
00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:47.330
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean,
when,
you know,
when,
when slaves are fed,
you know,</v>

901
00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:48.920
and they're housed.
Um,

902
00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:52.080
and when you look at someone who gets minimum wage and you look at that,

903
00:48:52.081 --> 00:48:54.060
like you cannot even feed you in housing.

904
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:59.390
Like you might've been better off being a slave if you could quit.

905
00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:04.440
Right?
I mean,
if you like the weekend,
yeah,
you could be a slave.

906
00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:04.710
Like,

907
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:08.100
but as long as they're not mean to you and they just feed you and make you work,

908
00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:09.060
it's almost like they have,

909
00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:12.780
they're just giving you a job because most people can't even feed themselves and

910
00:49:12.781 --> 00:49:15.420
how's themselves for what they're getting paid.
I obviously,

911
00:49:15.421 --> 00:49:18.240
it's worse to be a slave because you don't have a choice,
you know?

912
00:49:18.241 --> 00:49:21.810
But it's really crazy when you think of the idea that you can have someone work

913
00:49:21.811 --> 00:49:25.200
for 40 hours in a week and they can't even have a roof over their heads.

914
00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:28.740
They can't even,
they'll work all day long and what their,

915
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:33.090
their physical presence is worth is not even enough to sustain it.

916
00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:36.140
<v 3>So fucking true.
I was thinking about it the other day,</v>

917
00:49:36.141 --> 00:49:39.830
how like 40 hour week was like what everybody was taught in this country.

918
00:49:39.831 --> 00:49:41.840
Anybody who's doing 40 hours,

919
00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:46.460
that's the minimum people will work in 50 everything he can.
Yeah.
Whatever.

920
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:51.050
And,
and,
and that's because like whatever,
like my brother's a pilot,

921
00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.830
he makes like 12 bucks an hour.
You know,
when,
whenever your mind pilot,

922
00:49:54.831 --> 00:49:57.950
he's an airline pilot,
12 bucks for a bigger line,

923
00:49:57.951 --> 00:50:01.730
but a regional airlines and like stolen.
It's like,
you know,
it's like,

924
00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.790
he's like almost an astronaut dude.
You know,

925
00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:08.270
he's like her dead people's lives,
his thing.
And he's like,
you know,

926
00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:12.260
they're always a cutting back on their pensions and you know,
the pilots

927
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.780
<v 0>paid so little,
I don't know,</v>

928
00:50:13.781 --> 00:50:16.740
pilots would be someone who you'd want to really fucking take.

929
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:21.320
<v 3>Exactly.
Especially like,
since like the turnover is,
is like,
you know,</v>

930
00:50:21.321 --> 00:50:23.690
they don't get enough rest and they don't get doors.

931
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:28.280
So it's amazing the disparity in terms of like income for some people,

932
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.010
<v 4>whatever.
And same thing with teachers.
Like I got come from like,
you know,</v>

933
00:50:31.011 --> 00:50:34.640
parents who are teachers and they treat them like shit.
And honestly,
I mean,

934
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:38.810
you got kids,
you know how it is.
It's like,
you know,
it's day to day grind,

935
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:39.410
you know,

936
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:42.470
trying to keep your kids on the right path and these people have to do it every

937
00:50:42.471 --> 00:50:42.771
day.

938
00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:45.170
A lot of kids come from a lot of different backgrounds and they've got to Meld

939
00:50:45.171 --> 00:50:47.810
that together into a class and they get,
you know,
everybody's like,
you know,

940
00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:51.620
they don't deserve her pension.
Well fuck,
I think they do.
You know?
Yeah.

941
00:50:51.621 --> 00:50:55.370
It's weird.
I guess it's just because we aren't forced,

942
00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:59.240
we aren't forced to pay teachers more.
We aren't forced to pay cops more.

943
00:50:59.241 --> 00:51:03.200
We are forced to pay pilots more,
so they just don't get paid more.
Well,
I mean,

944
00:51:03.201 --> 00:51:04.310
they can't,
they,
there's,

945
00:51:04.311 --> 00:51:07.550
they don't have enough bargaining power to step away from it.
Yeah.

946
00:51:07.551 --> 00:51:11.510
I think that I'm not smart enough to like say exactly why it's happening.

947
00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:15.950
I just know that it's definitely an abusive tactic by a corporation to keep

948
00:51:15.951 --> 00:51:18.800
these people to,
to whatever.
Cause they can do it.
Yeah,

949
00:51:18.801 --> 00:51:22.550
and they said they and they know they can do it and people can't really go

950
00:51:22.551 --> 00:51:24.010
anywhere else.
Yeah.

951
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:28.540
If you told me that my ticket was going to be 20 bucks more or 50 bucks more,

952
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.420
whatever the fuck it was,
and you could pay the pilots a fair wage,

953
00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.270
as long as it's not an unreasonable,
I would take that

954
00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:40.000
<v 3>easy.
Easy.
Yeah.
20 bucks.
You don't think all those people,</v>

955
00:51:40.001 --> 00:51:42.340
I'm just kidding everybody on the plane and pays 20 bucks,

956
00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:46.240
but the baggage shit shit go like,
what's that?
What's that going for it?
That was,

957
00:51:46.241 --> 00:51:49.720
I understood it at that when we're going through that gas problem that we're

958
00:51:49.721 --> 00:51:53.200
having,
but now it's just ridiculous that they even charge for bags.

959
00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:55.300
If you have three bags,
that shouldn't be a hundreds of dollars.

960
00:51:55.301 --> 00:51:57.430
Why don't they just add that into the price?
You know?

961
00:51:57.490 --> 00:51:59.200
Well if they're going to charge 50 bucks for a bag,

962
00:51:59.201 --> 00:52:02.080
when it gets to everything in that bag should be folded nicely.

963
00:52:02.081 --> 00:52:04.820
Maybe a little tree to put it in there with a thank you.
Did you see that

964
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.170
<v 4>where the uh,</v>

965
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:10.160
the opened up her bag and they found a vibrator in it and they wrote a note,

966
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:14.090
a little letter and said,
get your freak on.
Oh,
cool.
And now that's a lawsuit.

967
00:52:14.091 --> 00:52:15.920
I'm sure they're going to fucking have the gun

968
00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.620
<v 3>killed.
What about that guy catches died?</v>

969
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:21.500
I think it was American or continental airlines.

970
00:52:21.501 --> 00:52:25.290
Lots of studies and they found it and it was so mountain nutrition.

971
00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:30.540
Then the cat was like on life support and on Facebook it got thousands and

972
00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.470
thousands and thousands of people backing it up.
And it just died this week.

973
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:39.020
The loss of for like a long time I lost,
it was hiding out in the uh,
whatever.

974
00:52:39.021 --> 00:52:42.980
Like you went into the,
the have it a long time ago.
Yeah.

975
00:52:42.981 --> 00:52:46.940
A couple of patches died two days ago.
Oh,
it happened a couple of weeks.
Penguin,

976
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:50.970
nobody seems to keep dragging the penguin.
Who didn't go to a,

977
00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:53.090
where were supposed to go in New Zealand,
they were like raising them.

978
00:52:53.091 --> 00:52:56.160
They kept releasing him.
But he kept coming back.
Whatever happened.
Yeah.

979
00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.030
Like I mean,
not that they were tracking that bitch for a walk cause I was like,

980
00:52:59.120 --> 00:52:59.301
you know,

981
00:52:59.301 --> 00:53:02.530
if he comes back one more time they should really just fucking kill them.
Yeah,

982
00:53:02.531 --> 00:53:05.270
I think so.
Cause he just doesn't want to be penguin.
He's wants to be a

983
00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:09.700
<v 4>whatever,
a parrot.
They found a buff up by the way.</v>

984
00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:14.300
They found a bunch of gay penguins in the zoo and a in Toronto.
And they're,

985
00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:18.100
they're like people getting mad because they're separating the gay penguins and

986
00:53:18.101 --> 00:53:22.300
put in the gay penguins and with the female penguins,
like separating them.

987
00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:25.950
Oh that's not right.
And then people are mad,
they're like,
you know,
against gays.

988
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.590
And they're like,
no,
but we,
we've got a trick.
These,

989
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.230
these gay penguins in the fucking,
these girls,

990
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:33.600
otherwise like the species is going to probably die.

991
00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:37.860
Like it's the first survival of the species.
I mean not,
you know,

992
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:43.530
it's survival of the zoo species.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
So what are they going to do?

993
00:53:43.531 --> 00:53:47.510
Like I don't know.
There are African penguins and uh,
there,
there,
uh,

994
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.370
I guess there's not that many of them.
I think I must be what they're saying.

995
00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:54.920
And so they got gay.
Are they,
they,

996
00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.900
you know,
they bang a chick just for a goof.
I mean that would be,

997
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:02.160
I think a lot of gay guys would do that.
A lot of gay guys,

998
00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:06.060
girlfriends that they might get the freak on with every now and then.

999
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:08.150
I think that's cool.
Yeah.
I mean if,
you know,

1000
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:12.300
I think it's probably way easier for a gay guy,
more Hawaiian coffee to do that.

1001
00:54:12.301 --> 00:54:16.020
No thanks.
I'm good.
I think it's probably way easier for a gang guy to do that.

1002
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:19.760
You know,
the gay punk.
Um,

1003
00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.910
I was going to say the gay penguin thing I think is a good,

1004
00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:26.640
good thing cause I think they have every right to marry.

1005
00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:30.870
They should marry them and then they should watch for call it,
let them adopt.

1006
00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.730
It's kind of Douchey that they separate them.
Yeah.
I think that was the,

1007
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.170
every 90% of every species that's ever existed has gone,

1008
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:38.850
are we going to keep the penguins forever?

1009
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:41.910
What if like we get to the future and the future,

1010
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:46.470
you know that we all can communicate with each other with our minds and you
know,

1011
00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:48.960
we live in some place where energy is created.

1012
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.660
Do you think about that shit a lot.
I do too.
All the time.

1013
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:53.070
Do you think we're going to keep penguins?

1014
00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.200
They're just going to be shit all over the place.

1015
00:54:55.201 --> 00:54:59.370
Waddling around this supposed to die off as opposed to,
I love that show.

1016
00:54:59.371 --> 00:55:02.270
I'm not perfect.
You ever see that?
The jail like,
uh,

1017
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:05.670
without people the earth without people and like what would happen?

1018
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:09.740
Like all the stuff we've ever built,
like within years we'll turn into like,

1019
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:12.900
there's like only like three things that'll survive.
Like the pyramids,

1020
00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:16.220
the Hoover Dam for awhile,
you know,
like something,
you know,

1021
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:19.890
Star Dome and Birmingham,
Alabama,
some weird comedy club.

1022
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:24.300
They'll be like a funny bone chain it.
But yeah,
I love that kind of Shit.
And,
uh,

1023
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.520
I also think about like all the food we eat,

1024
00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:29.990
we're like choices that like people will like,
you know,
corn and you know,

1025
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.540
they made corn the way it was.
It used to be wilder,
you know,

1026
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:36.630
it'd be like fucking Indian Shit you put on your door for like that kind of

1027
00:55:36.631 --> 00:55:39.450
stuff.
That was like real food.
It wasn't just like,
Hey,
I'm weird.
You know,

1028
00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:41.850
watch out Wiccan,
crazy corn.

1029
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:45.900
And there's like probably were seeds that like no longer exists that probably

1030
00:55:45.901 --> 00:55:48.330
had all the cures for cancer and all that kind of stuff.

1031
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:52.110
But we'll never know now because like we,
we eat like 20 things,
you know.

1032
00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:56.010
And that's about it.
Well also we change things to make them more durable.

1033
00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.230
You ever have some heirloom tomatoes,

1034
00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:03.060
heirloom tomatoes or tomatoes at Umaine when those old seeds,
God damn,

1035
00:56:03.061 --> 00:56:05.520
they're fucking good dude.
It's incredible.

1036
00:56:05.521 --> 00:56:09.010
What do they with the tiny or they're big now.
They're big,
big fucking shoot,

1037
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:12.060
you know,
regular size and big,
and some of them are even smaller,

1038
00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.090
even have heirloom cherry tomatoes,
but God damn,

1039
00:56:15.091 --> 00:56:18.120
that's when you realize that tomatoes are supposed to be a fruit.

1040
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:20.550
Tomatoes are not supposed to be a vegetable.

1041
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:22.980
It's become a vegetable because it's durable.

1042
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:28.030
So we've sucked all the deliciousness out of it and it's this pale,
pinkish,

1043
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.930
sloppy fucking thing that melts in your mouth when you bite into it.

1044
00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:33.340
That's not what those other,

1045
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.150
the old tomatoes were like the ultimatums or like a kind of a weird fruit.

1046
00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:41.070
There was fucking delicious.
Yeah,
they're delicious,
man.
Wow.

1047
00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:42.430
I remember when I lived in New Jersey,

1048
00:56:42.431 --> 00:56:46.450
my grandfather used to grow tomatoes in his backyard and they were fucking

1049
00:56:46.451 --> 00:56:51.010
amazing.
You know?
And this is like probably the 1970s you know?

1050
00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:55.330
And these tomatoes were just ridiculous and we would eat slices these tomatoes

1051
00:56:55.331 --> 00:56:58.080
and we've never had tomatoes like that since then.
My Grandmother,

1052
00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:01.130
I had those and rhubarb and rhubarb and stuffy.
My,

1053
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:04.680
like my kind of my sneaky dessert that I thought was delicious,

1054
00:57:04.681 --> 00:57:08.820
but now I look at,
tastes so sour into just raw,

1055
00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.860
I guess those big tomatoes that my grandfather grew.

1056
00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:15.100
You can't get those and put them in a truck.
They just,

1057
00:57:15.101 --> 00:57:18.040
they'll be useless in a day or two.
I got to check that out there.

1058
00:57:18.041 --> 00:57:21.520
They'll rot like way quicker,
you know,
they go bad quick.

1059
00:57:21.521 --> 00:57:24.850
The heirloom tomatoes go bad pretty quick.
I've never had,

1060
00:57:24.851 --> 00:57:28.360
I've got to try that out on their fucking delicious man.
Tell you eat meat,
right?

1061
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:29.970
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
for sure.

1062
00:57:29.971 --> 00:57:33.030
Like did something like a army and then like when you go like,

1063
00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:36.190
and I was like in Brazil or something like that and we hate stake down there.

1064
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:40.470
I was like,
wow,
what the fuck is this?
This is like really tasty grass fed.
Yeah.

1065
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:43.720
It's like,
it's like different than army,
but uh,
you know,

1066
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:48.430
it's like I'm such a fat,
said God that I'll eat any meat.
I mean,
I liked it more,

1067
00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:51.940
but I still like,
you know,
like they know what the Mcdonald's in Brazil,

1068
00:57:51.941 --> 00:57:55.900
they know what the fuck they're doing.
The two husker Korea's,

1069
00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:57.100
did you ever eat one of those?

1070
00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.110
What did they go and they bring the meat on a stick.

1071
00:57:59.111 --> 00:58:03.010
Like they have a full body check and all that kind of place that those places

1072
00:58:03.011 --> 00:58:06.100
are amazing.
They,
they,
they,
you know,
I went to one of those in,

1073
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:09.550
one of the things in Brazil is they serve like Oregon's shit.

1074
00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:13.330
I went to those and they had like chicken hearts and all these different things

1075
00:58:13.331 --> 00:58:17.230
that you don't owe you.
How could you,
oh Gotcha.
Sounds good.
We'll try them.
Yeah,

1076
00:58:17.231 --> 00:58:20.230
I've never had that.
Oh my God.
They like sort of,

1077
00:58:20.231 --> 00:58:23.290
they put some sort of a glaze on it and they grill it,
you know,
everything,

1078
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:25.090
the way they cook everything.
And the true Hoss Korea is,

1079
00:58:25.091 --> 00:58:28.570
they have these steaks and they stick them like in front of the fire and they

1080
00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:29.111
rotate.

1081
00:58:29.111 --> 00:58:32.440
It's basically sort of like a rotisserie thing going on and then they glaze it

1082
00:58:32.441 --> 00:58:35.470
with this.
I don't know what they're,
they're basting saucers.

1083
00:58:35.471 --> 00:58:38.230
I don't know what the fuck it is,
but it's damn delicious.

1084
00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:42.040
And when you go to Brazil and the Brazil ones,

1085
00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:43.960
they had a lot of organs and shit.

1086
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:45.820
They had like livers and hearts and stuff like that.

1087
00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.230
Have you always ate like such crazy things?
Like you eat bone marrow,

1088
00:58:49.231 --> 00:58:52.740
you eat like they always get like liver and stuff.
Do you,
do you always,

1089
00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:55.500
have you always been like that or is that something you got into later?
No,

1090
00:58:55.501 --> 00:58:58.740
I've always been attracted to eating Oregon's harried lamb.

1091
00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:03.000
I had to man the other day and it tastes like eating farms in Oregon.

1092
00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:06.180
I love it.
I love lamb,
a lamb all the time.

1093
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.490
I think meat and Oregon's and stuff like that.

1094
00:59:08.491 --> 00:59:12.720
It connects you to your assertion connects you to a,
your,
your,

1095
00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:15.730
your roots as a predator.
Yeah.

1096
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:18.630
It's a cheap way to do it cause you're,
you know,

1097
00:59:18.631 --> 00:59:22.160
you're not actually going out and getting it yourself,
but you get the,
uh,

1098
00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:24.380
<v 0>the charge of it.
You know,</v>

1099
00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:28.430
I'm with you on that energy you get from meat that you don't,

1100
00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:32.360
I don't believe you get from vegetables when people can debate me on this.

1101
00:59:32.361 --> 00:59:36.290
And I've tried to,
I've tried vegetarian diets before.
I have a,

1102
00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:40.010
I did a vegetarian diet for over a year when I was doing martial arts and I was

1103
00:59:40.011 --> 00:59:44.210
competing.
I tried to stay at a certain weight.
All right.
Yeah,

1104
00:59:44.211 --> 00:59:47.750
I didn't like the way I felt.
Didn't,
I felt like weaker.
I Dunno,

1105
00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:51.840
<v 3>it made his power.
I mean,
it gives you the fucking power.
Some bad ass</v>

1106
00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:55.360
<v 0>out there,
don't get me wrong,
but,
um,
but I think they're doing it wrong.</v>

1107
00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:57.390
<v 3>I Dunno.
As I'm older now,
I,</v>

1108
00:59:57.430 --> 01:00:01.830
it's like all the steaks and all that shit that I used to eat,
like Burger,

1109
01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:04.990
Burger,
Burger over,
and it was a club diet because it was like,
you know,

1110
01:00:04.991 --> 01:00:07.090
you're up late and was like three things to eat.

1111
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:11.770
All that fat and grease is going to having a great time.

1112
01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.250
But now,
now that you're older,
now you're like,
you know you like go to Taco Bell,

1113
01:00:15.251 --> 01:00:19.210
let's say,
you know it's like a treat and like it blows your fucking body apart.

1114
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:24.500
Yeah.
If you take some time off fucking fuck me or something.

1115
01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:28.240
I really just have that feeling after eating a whole pizza.

1116
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:33.520
Oh it's in a whole year.
Really a hole.
I was using that as a,

1117
01:00:33.521 --> 01:00:34.990
as a thing to do my show.

1118
01:00:34.991 --> 01:00:38.500
Like we still wanting to do the post production that like I was like okay I

1119
01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:41.920
won't eat pizza or fries.
And those were like my big food groups and like,

1120
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:46.520
you know I was like as a treat I was like waiting and waiting way.
So like pizza,

1121
01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:50.010
a pizza party or something.
Wow.
Isn't that lame?
No.

1122
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:53.770
A smart guy ever.
It's like,
yeah,

1123
01:00:53.771 --> 01:00:56.670
it's like I can only fantasize about it,
you know,
cause pizzas.

1124
01:00:56.671 --> 01:01:00.940
So like especially like deep dish or whatever.
New York supposedly as good pizza,

1125
01:01:00.941 --> 01:01:04.900
but this way cooler pizza out there right now that the New York,
New York,

1126
01:01:04.901 --> 01:01:06.040
I love a slice,
you know,

1127
01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:09.140
but like there's places like Chicago I think has like fucking them.

1128
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:14.080
Well that deep dish pizzas,
not like a real pizza casserole design.

1129
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:16.520
Your pizza is delicious.

1130
01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.110
It's great when you get like a deep dish one with like,

1131
01:01:20.111 --> 01:01:24.460
I remember I got a deep dish seafood pizza with like the fake crab and like

1132
01:01:24.461 --> 01:01:27.610
scallops and clams and shit.
I was like,
okay,

1133
01:01:27.611 --> 01:01:32.450
how is this a pizza California casserole,
Goddamn casserole.
Delicious.
Yeah.

1134
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:36.040
So whatever it's going to be,
it's probably going to be like,
oh man,
I can't wait.

1135
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.270
Yeah,
there's surprise.

1136
01:01:37.271 --> 01:01:40.690
I think I have to give up forever now cause like they're like cigarettes,

1137
01:01:40.691 --> 01:01:42.280
you know,
there's so bad for you,

1138
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:45.400
<v 0>you don't realize it.
But you know when you,
when you eat healthy,</v>

1139
01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:48.730
whenever I eat pretty healthy.
But every now and then I'll go off the deep,

1140
01:01:48.731 --> 01:01:52.420
but then you know,
Oh yeah,
you've got to keep moving.
It's still,
you feel it.

1141
01:01:52.421 --> 01:01:55.710
You feel the fries,
you feel the,
the fucking,

1142
01:01:55.990 --> 01:02:00.650
the breaded chicken sandwich from Jack in the box sliding down your intestines

1143
01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:04.290
<v 3>so you feel it.
Do I have a question?
Um,
do you like this song?</v>

1144
01:02:04.291 --> 01:02:07.410
Because this to me is a cheesy song,
but it's horrible.

1145
01:02:07.411 --> 01:02:10.620
But every time I listened to it,
I can't stop thinking if you like,

1146
01:02:10.621 --> 01:02:14.770
this is that song cause I work out.
I do know that

1147
01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:20.160
Jersey shore there as well.
Listen,
this,
I went from,
I don't,

1148
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.540
<v 0>I don't know.
I got my all,</v>

1149
01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.740
I don't know any music that's playing today.
All Day.

1150
01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:30.060
All I listened to his like seventies I lifts in into,
this is what I listen to.

1151
01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:32.670
I listen to led Zeppelin,
I listen to Jimi Hendrix.

1152
01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:35.850
I listened to the almond brothers.

1153
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:40.500
I listened to talk radio or listen to Dwight Yoakam lately.

1154
01:02:40.850 --> 01:02:42.270
That's it.
All right.
For this show,

1155
01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:46.230
I don't want to hear some new music for this show Thursday.
Don't play it for me.

1156
01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:49.830
And when you walk out
to do it,

1157
01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:53.550
your fuck up dairy,
I don't know.
I don't know any music,
man.
I,

1158
01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:57.360
I hear new music and I'm like,
what the fuck is this?
And so on and be like,

1159
01:02:57.361 --> 01:03:00.450
that's a huge hit.
And I'm like,
what are you talking about?
How's that possible?

1160
01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.210
Do you,
do you feel like it's like yourself when you're a kid of like,

1161
01:03:03.211 --> 01:03:06.060
my dad would always like,
I play nights,
you know,
he's like,
that shit is awful.

1162
01:03:06.061 --> 01:03:08.440
He was always screaming at me.
Luckily I don't get it.
I'm an old man.

1163
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:13.440
What I became just like every other person's dad became just like when you were

1164
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:15.600
a kid and your dad didn't get your shit,
you know,

1165
01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.460
<v 3>damn well here's the cool thing about porn,</v>

1166
01:03:19.461 --> 01:03:22.550
which is like everybody has that walk.
I'll walk up whatever porn thing.

1167
01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.950
And like I've been watching all these old tapes,

1168
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:28.640
there was like some really like just hardcore fucking tunes in there,

1169
01:03:28.641 --> 01:03:32.960
if not like classical Vivaldi,
you know,
like they,
they really,

1170
01:03:32.961 --> 01:03:36.470
these movies were really more movie than they were sex.
And,
uh,

1171
01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:37.670
they would have like,
you know,

1172
01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:42.050
they'd have like ambient music and then they didn't have love themes and all of

1173
01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:44.900
a sudden like a sax solo would start playing as the girls coming get going down

1174
01:03:44.901 --> 01:03:47.150
on a dude.
So it's weird that like,
you know,

1175
01:03:47.151 --> 01:03:52.070
everybody has this image of the pouring of just like that Waka Waka are fucking

1176
01:03:52.071 --> 01:03:55.160
bullshit.
But that's like every comic's joke their first couple of years.
Yeah,

1177
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:59.450
the chicken boom,
boom bang.
It's not,
it's not all like that.
It's,

1178
01:03:59.451 --> 01:04:00.284
I know it's weird.

1179
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:02.500
<v 0>Sort of a meme.</v>

1180
01:04:02.890 --> 01:04:03.723
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1181
01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:09.310
It must have been someone's joke and everyone else has just been sort of swiping

1182
01:04:09.311 --> 01:04:11.440
it.
I mean there's a lot of that in the form,

1183
01:04:11.441 --> 01:04:14.650
but then there's also like this weird,
you know,
just crazy,
you know,

1184
01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:17.230
like Gregorian chanting or something.

1185
01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:22.640
I was in like tons of the porn music cause I know like where is it from you,

1186
01:04:22.871 --> 01:04:23.610
I've got to make sure I have it right.

1187
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:26.820
<v 0>So when you're watching these you put them aside and go,
okay,</v>

1188
01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:29.380
this one is interesting because of this.
And you're like,
mark it.

1189
01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:30.660
<v 3>Yeah.
Well,</v>

1190
01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:33.690
it really had to do with what we'd be doing the show of like who he get to be on

1191
01:04:33.691 --> 01:04:35.000
the show.
So you know,

1192
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:38.550
a lot of these alleged ends having done porn in a while and they moved on to do

1193
01:04:38.551 --> 01:04:41.490
other things and like,
I'm sure there's a million people asking them to do shit.

1194
01:04:41.491 --> 01:04:44.460
So I didn't want to be a jerk off and just be like whatever.

1195
01:04:44.461 --> 01:04:46.590
So wait to see where we had access to do

1196
01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:50.480
<v 0>the girls that were in the films and then they're here today.</v>

1197
01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.260
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
And they'd be like a play by play kind of stuff.</v>

1198
01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.950
And we asked them like,
it's not like a James Lipton accuracy,
it's a porn party.

1199
01:04:57.951 --> 01:05:01.250
It's just like this,
like serious like yeah,

1200
01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:04.300
you'd love to do it just hanging out.

1201
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.460
But they have to be willing to like embrace their past.
Oh,

1202
01:05:07.461 --> 01:05:08.750
they're totally cool with it.
I mean,

1203
01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:12.110
I don't see why they wouldn't be because it's like you don't have any
resistance.

1204
01:05:12.111 --> 01:05:14.030
Like none of them say,
hey,
that's in the past.
Oh,

1205
01:05:14.031 --> 01:05:17.000
some of them don't want to do it.
They've moved on in their lives and we respect.

1206
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:19.210
But uh,
you know the ones that do do it,

1207
01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:22.870
it's all celebration and tribute to their films.
Right.
And like Georgina Spelman,

1208
01:05:22.871 --> 01:05:24.520
who's the devil in Ms. Jones,

1209
01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:27.310
which is people always talking about the behind the green door is like the

1210
01:05:27.311 --> 01:05:30.640
ultimate della Ms. Jones is like a way cooler movie if you asked me,

1211
01:05:30.641 --> 01:05:35.200
cause it's got like a really interesting,
like a hell damnation kind of plot to,

1212
01:05:35.201 --> 01:05:38.440
it really came out the same year as the extra cyst or around that time.

1213
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:42.160
And I played in movie theaters and it blew people away.
And it's a good movie.

1214
01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:42.311
Yeah,

1215
01:05:42.311 --> 01:05:45.760
I think it's a really good movie because it's about a woman who kills herself,

1216
01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:48.920
a Georgina spell have in place like a spinster woman who calls herself.

1217
01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:53.200
She's did not spoiler.
Oh,
okay.
Well we don't want them can watch the whole movie.

1218
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:55.090
But at the end,
you know,

1219
01:05:55.091 --> 01:06:00.091
she goes to hell and she gets to sample all the pleasures of the flesh and the

1220
01:06:00.731 --> 01:06:04.720
devil in Ms. Jones Devil and Michelle and,
and Ms. Jones.

1221
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:07.120
And I'm at the end,
you know,

1222
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:11.530
what happens is she was a spinster who denied herself and she becomes like a
sex,

1223
01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:15.080
you know,
she's awakened sexually.
And,
uh,

1224
01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:18.520
the ending is a very cool twist ending for a porn movie or any movie,

1225
01:06:18.521 --> 01:06:23.020
which is like,
you know,
she has spend eternity with,
uh,
uh,
I assume it's a,

1226
01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:26.890
a priest or a man who doesn't like policy and she needs to be fucked.

1227
01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:31.780
So you would know.
It's very cool.
It was like before the x files was weird.

1228
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:36.250
I'm trying to relate it to something you,
you would know this or um,
because,
uh,

1229
01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:40.390
you,
you,
you're so deep into that world at what?
And when deep throat came out,

1230
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:44.020
they thought that was going to be like the beginning of like legit movies where

1231
01:06:44.021 --> 01:06:45.730
they showed people fucking right.
Yeah.

1232
01:06:45.731 --> 01:06:49.540
D throw we never had access to because that's like a legendary film that like

1233
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:53.790
everyone says they own and I need unreal license,
everything.
So everyone says,

1234
01:06:54.450 --> 01:06:58.690
well,
deep throat,
I can't,
I can't give you the exact company who distributes it,

1235
01:06:58.691 --> 01:07:02.800
but uh,
they deep throat is definitely one of the movies that everybody goes to.

1236
01:07:02.801 --> 01:07:05.520
Like Debbie does.
Dallas is another one where it's right.
You know,

1237
01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.310
it's really hard to like lock down the rights to use that kind of stuff.

1238
01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:12.490
And sure.
I had rights to use all the stuff that we use.
Debbie does.

1239
01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:15.090
Dallas just had a great name.
It wasn't the best port in the world.

1240
01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:19.330
It wasn't the best porn,
but it's still like that girl,
the girl who plays Debbie,

1241
01:07:19.331 --> 01:07:23.050
I forget her name right now.
She's super hot and like,
uh,
we had on,

1242
01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:25.510
this was like the pilot for the show.

1243
01:07:25.511 --> 01:07:29.350
I did was the greatest name of all time though.
Uh,
yeah,
like we,

1244
01:07:29.351 --> 01:07:34.120
we had on Robert Kerman who was the guy who bangs Debbie and Debbie does Dallas,

1245
01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.400
super cool guy lives in New York and like,

1246
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.140
he was like one of these legends who were like,

1247
01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:41.890
I can't believe he's going to do the show.
You know,
we were like so excited.
And,

1248
01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.150
uh,
that was like for a different,

1249
01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:46.060
actually that was the pilot that we have never shown.

1250
01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:49.720
Does he not do porn anymore?
No,
he doesn't do it.
He's,
you know,
like,
uh,

1251
01:07:49.721 --> 01:07:52.240
I'm sure he would love to do it because like anything else,
you know,

1252
01:07:52.241 --> 01:07:54.250
that was his,
his scene.
But you know,

1253
01:07:54.251 --> 01:07:58.570
it was just cool to watch him watch himself in the porn movie and like you said,

1254
01:07:58.571 --> 01:08:01.480
you're right.
It wasn't that great.
It was like really tongue in cheek and like,

1255
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:06.280
um,
Debbie,
whether she's alive,
dead or just doesn't want to be found,

1256
01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:07.840
I the song about her man,

1257
01:08:07.841 --> 01:08:11.590
she's like just super hot and like she's fluffing her lines and she's basically

1258
01:08:11.591 --> 01:08:15.500
laughing the whole way through the movie.
And you know,

1259
01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:17.510
just like at the end when you finally get to see your fuck,
you're like,

1260
01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:21.020
it was worth it.
You know what I'm saying is like,
it's like a nice pay off,

1261
01:08:21.021 --> 01:08:25.060
like the pin,
Yada,
broke lots of candy for everybody.
Good Times.
So you,

1262
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:28.820
you a,
you can't use that one.
No,
I can't.
Like,
I,

1263
01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:31.220
I'd love to use this so many other ones.
So there's,

1264
01:08:31.221 --> 01:08:34.320
there's a few movies like that that are worth like a lot of money I guess.
Yeah,

1265
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:37.010
no,
honestly,
yeah,
they're definitely collectors.

1266
01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:40.120
Is there a way that you could license it for probably down the road,

1267
01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:44.060
down the road and she'll give you doing a season two and season one successful I

1268
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:46.280
hope.
Come on.
Who the fuck ever it is that owns Debbie.

1269
01:08:46.281 --> 01:08:50.140
Does Dallas don't be a whore with this.
Debbie does Dallas,
uh,

1270
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:53.290
behind the green door and um,
you know,
uh,

1271
01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:55.040
they'll move back just talking about the delta.

1272
01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.580
Those are the ones that everyone kinda knows.
But then there's,
Joe,

1273
01:08:58.581 --> 01:09:03.200
you'll back me up on this hundreds and thousands of tapes that no one has ever

1274
01:09:03.201 --> 01:09:08.090
seen or like ultra flesh with sake is a great fucking movie.
I mean,

1275
01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:09.260
it's hilarious.

1276
01:09:09.261 --> 01:09:13.040
I watch it with Jim Norton and Sake and Jim knows porn better than me any day,

1277
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:15.520
every day,
all day.
And like he was gay.

1278
01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:19.300
He was digging it and like it's got like crazy scenes in it.
It's a Scifi thing.

1279
01:09:19.530 --> 01:09:23.120
And e three the extra testicle,
which is one of the points parities,
Ron,

1280
01:09:23.121 --> 01:09:24.710
Jeremy actually wrote it and you know,

1281
01:09:24.711 --> 01:09:27.260
he took us through some of it and like unfortunately killing me,

1282
01:09:27.261 --> 01:09:28.850
watch clip by clip by clip.

1283
01:09:28.851 --> 01:09:31.220
We can't watch entire movies cause then we'd just like,
you know,

1284
01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:36.690
half an hour to half hour an hour man.
Oh God man,

1285
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:42.760
you should do it like full on mystery science theater side where they do,

1286
01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:46.190
they do the whole movie and I wanted to make sure that it was different enough

1287
01:09:46.191 --> 01:09:49.280
from them because they're their thing with the robots where they're looking at

1288
01:09:49.281 --> 01:09:52.620
the movie,
we kind of like turn,
we're always facing the crowd.

1289
01:09:52.650 --> 01:09:55.960
Like we're different and we pop in and out and it's not like that scene where

1290
01:09:55.970 --> 01:10:00.500
like they used to have like really cool segments with Joel hot,
hot Hodges.
Right.

1291
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:04.490
He would like have to run in with the puppets and watched the movie and then

1292
01:10:04.491 --> 01:10:08.240
they run out and do like some kind of crazy,
you know,
like sketch.
And I was like,

1293
01:10:08.241 --> 01:10:11.240
that really worked,
you know,
and I,
I want,
I didn't want to do any of that.

1294
01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:14.240
I just wanted to get to the heart of like what,
what I,
what I wanted to do,

1295
01:10:14.241 --> 01:10:17.420
which is like get comics talking and it's not about porn only.

1296
01:10:17.421 --> 01:10:19.460
It's a lot of justice,
like rail and each other.

1297
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:21.950
And then bring them out the porn star to legitimize the show.

1298
01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:24.110
And I think just from the feedback we've got,

1299
01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:28.370
thank you so much to all the people who like this stuff,
the people who do it,

1300
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.020
you know,
can't thank you enough.

1301
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:34.160
And I'm hosting the Avian Porn awards this year and you know,
I've,

1302
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:38.440
this is my second time and this time I'm letting them stick it in this time.

1303
01:10:38.441 --> 01:10:41.720
It's anal.
No,
this time we're going full tilt.
But uh,

1304
01:10:41.721 --> 01:10:44.030
it's like these people really do.
Honestly,

1305
01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:48.200
they're super cool and the fact that they let us even just like hang out with

1306
01:10:48.201 --> 01:10:52.250
them was,
was really cool.
So you've embraced her,
the porn comedy connection.

1307
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:55.670
Oh yeah,
absolutely.
We're all loners were Ronan,
you know what I'm saying?

1308
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:58.080
We were fucking warrior for road warrior.

1309
01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:01.550
I'm sort of a connection this fucking evil.
And that's what I think is like,

1310
01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.440
well we were talking about like jobs and security.

1311
01:11:03.441 --> 01:11:06.800
Like you and I both know that like we work week to week,
whether it's a,
you know,

1312
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:10.760
like,
you know,
we've both done okay.
But you remember back in the day like wow,

1313
01:11:10.761 --> 01:11:13.930
if I don't get anything this month and I don't know what's going to happen.

1314
01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:17.700
<v 4>Like one of those weird really wondering whether they should be doing this.</v>

1315
01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:20.700
You're like,
you know what,
here,
can I sell that?
Uh,
yeah,

1316
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:24.450
I sold all my comic books.
Did you darkest moment.
I'm like God,

1317
01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:29.540
Sola my comic books and still just terrible collector dude.

1318
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:31.920
Like what,
what a deal.
How about coins?

1319
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.650
I would find that it's like the weirdest collection.
No,

1320
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.900
I've never collected it.
I clicked pool cues.
I play pool.
So I collect,

1321
01:11:39.970 --> 01:11:42.540
not on like when you were a kid,
fights like artwork,
you know,

1322
01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:45.540
it's like canned card.
Most of them were like made by,
you know,

1323
01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:47.760
master pool cue manufacturers.

1324
01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.030
<v 3>You know,
when I was a kid,</v>

1325
01:11:49.031 --> 01:11:52.270
like I collect the army men like I loved it but not like the really cool ones.

1326
01:11:52.271 --> 01:11:54.140
Just like cons of army men.
Right.

1327
01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:56.020
It's to set them up and have these amazing wars.

1328
01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:00.970
Like they do like jokes on it now.
Like the war of the couch pillow,

1329
01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:04.660
the pillow pillow.
People wouldn't let the what are in my own head

1330
01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:08.870
<v 4>and they were all on like snowboards.
Yeah.
Just like slap,
set them down.</v>

1331
01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:12.140
The fucking does amazing battles would be like all stuck to like one little

1332
01:12:12.141 --> 01:12:13.580
platform and you put them places.

1333
01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.400
Me and my friend used to do these battles where we would put army men on each

1334
01:12:16.401 --> 01:12:19.930
side of the kitchen and with a golf ball kind of like bowling where you'd roll

1335
01:12:19.931 --> 01:12:21.500
and trying to talk each other.
Yeah.

1336
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:23.480
That's the shit people did before video games.

1337
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:25.750
<v 3>Yeah.
And what,
what,
what,
what happened?
And it's like,
um,</v>

1338
01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:28.510
every time like my parents would get thrown out of their house or something like

1339
01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:32.260
that,
you know,
like they move,
they go like,
okay,
we've got to throw stuff out.

1340
01:12:32.261 --> 01:12:35.080
What do you want to like the army man and I'll be like,
no,
hold on to that.

1341
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:36.490
I think I know someone who wants that.

1342
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:39.970
It's like that was like on one like treasure from the head to keep the army men.

1343
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.700
They were crazy and it was like some were big,
some were tiny,

1344
01:12:42.701 --> 01:12:46.000
so I'd have to make up stories in my head of like how they would be,
whatever

1345
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:50.860
<v 4>that was in the marbles for awhile just to play marbles,</v>

1346
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:54.040
illegal toy and kids.
Now someone could swallow.

1347
01:12:54.041 --> 01:12:57.530
One kid might swallow it and ruined it for everybody else.
Yeah.

1348
01:12:58.130 --> 01:13:02.470
We played with marbles and Jack's Jackson just designed so you could slip on one

1349
01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:05.870
and it impales.
You're fucking skull.
Yeah.
Think about what that is.

1350
01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:07.930
Little metal spikes you're playing with.

1351
01:13:07.931 --> 01:13:10.980
You could throw those on the road and flatten so woods fucking car,
but that's a

1352
01:13:13.090 --> 01:13:16.530
little shurikens.
I mean think of Jack A.
Ball in Jackson.

1353
01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:19.600
You just set yourself up for a scenario where someone's going to step on that

1354
01:13:19.601 --> 01:13:22.690
fucking ball in,
in Pale.
Those Jackson or eyeballs.

1355
01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.980
<v 3>My Mom's friend's kids,
they're like allergic to like candy or something,</v>

1356
01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.670
but it's not like one of those like it's just like something that they like gum.

1357
01:13:30.671 --> 01:13:31.780
I don't think they're allowed to have gum.

1358
01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:34.880
<v 4>Oh.
And I'm like,
wow,
like what?
What do you,</v>

1359
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:39.420
what do you want to hold the battery?
I'd be like,
yeah,
you know,
like we're kids.

1360
01:13:39.421 --> 01:13:43.710
Eventually.
I'm like,
oh,
I don't know what we can get you off the wind.

1361
01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.430
I don't,
I don't know.
I'm only going to be so safe.

1362
01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:51.330
Well I guess that's the problem with these kids,
you know,
whatever.

1363
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:56.820
Nobody judge today.
D Do you ever look back at like,

1364
01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:58.040
you know when you,

1365
01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:01.200
when you first started out in comedy and you looked at all the years that you

1366
01:14:01.201 --> 01:14:04.570
put in now he think come,
what if I had to do that again?
Oh Shit.

1367
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:08.850
I have to go through all the early part again.

1368
01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:10.980
I don't know if I could do with,

1369
01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.580
I don't know if I could actually do it because I,

1370
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:18.760
back then I was so like I hated myself so much and I still hate myself,

1371
01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:19.810
but the heat,

1372
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:24.340
the self hate propelled me forward cause where I was was a dark place.

1373
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:27.840
So it kept propelling me forward.
It about comics and hating themselves.

1374
01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:30.490
You hate yourself?
No.
No.
Yeah.
You don't know.

1375
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:34.150
I think I hated myself when I was young.
Yeah.
No,
I,
I dunno.
It's just like,
hey,

1376
01:14:34.151 --> 01:14:36.240
did other people too.
How you doing now?

1377
01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:39.550
I really hated myself and I still hate myself and it's like,

1378
01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:43.770
it's such a great propeller of forward that though.
Will you try,
what is,

1379
01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:46.850
is the motivation to not hate yourself anymore?

1380
01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:50.790
To push toward my secret weapon.
I mean,

1381
01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.610
when you say that it propels you,
how does it propel you?
The self hate?

1382
01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.950
Does it propel you in that inspires you to not want to hate yourself more so you

1383
01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.710
know harder and kindness to propel you?
I don't know.
I feel like it

1384
01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:02.810
<v 3>gives you like power of like,
you know,</v>

1385
01:15:02.811 --> 01:15:05.320
just like you're an evil place and like whatever.

1386
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:07.940
Like especially back in the early days with the heckling,
you know,

1387
01:15:07.941 --> 01:15:10.520
it was like they were fucking heckling me and I already hated myself.

1388
01:15:10.521 --> 01:15:11.840
So like it just fit

1389
01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:15.840
<v 4>it,
made it feel right shit on yourself.
Whether it has,
yeah.</v>

1390
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:18.610
Like I just felt good.
It just felt like normal,

1391
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.450
like verbally abusive fucking like homecoming,
you know?

1392
01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:24.780
So I don't know man.
I do.

1393
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:28.210
You're a younger comics so you probably don't feel that way.

1394
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:33.610
I don't have time to feel anything.
Right.
You go
bro.

1395
01:15:33.611 --> 01:15:34.510
Stay numb.
Yeah.

1396
01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:37.240
Well you got like the super hot girlfriend and that's great cause you're

1397
01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:41.490
emotionally like numb.
Right?
So she'd be like,
what are you thinking?
Nothing.

1398
01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.180
How many I've got left and how many loads are left?

1399
01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.220
It's like that movie about time.
How many loads are left.
Yeah.

1400
01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:51.820
It's an amazing number though.

1401
01:15:51.821 --> 01:15:54.850
How many comics just have something in the back of their head?

1402
01:15:54.851 --> 01:15:59.570
Either sort of self hate or just to an intense,
uh,
uncomfortable.

1403
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:02.950
Yeah,
I'm kind of comfortable feeling about themselves.

1404
01:16:02.951 --> 01:16:07.120
And the world they live in and socially awkward.
There's a lot of those dudes,

1405
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:11.460
<v 3>you know,
the fact that like,
we lose all these really good guys like Geraldo,</v>

1406
01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.210
Greg Giraldo,
and uh,
you know,
even before that,
uh,
you know,
uh,

1407
01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:18.810
Jerry Redd Wilson who was a guy from,
you know,
years,
years back,

1408
01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:23.610
he was not a self hate and guy who was like a party guy,
fun guy,
you know,

1409
01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:27.480
horrible experience.
A meningitis is what,
it wasn't drugs or anything like that,

1410
01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:29.220
but he was about to be engaged and everything.

1411
01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.100
And I was looking at guys like that who would like so full of life and I'm like,

1412
01:16:32.190 --> 01:16:34.110
Gee,
you know,
what the fuck am I doing?
You know,

1413
01:16:34.111 --> 01:16:37.140
this guy was like always had a smile on his face,
always.
You know,

1414
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:42.000
he was so excited about like comedy and not being,
you know,
leaving his day job.

1415
01:16:42.001 --> 01:16:45.150
It's like I had day jobs and I was like,
you know,
I don't give a shit,
you know,

1416
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:50.490
fuck,
I don't know what to say.
It's just really weird.
Um,
the experience.

1417
01:16:50.491 --> 01:16:52.140
So when you say,
can you do it again?
I don't know.

1418
01:16:52.170 --> 01:16:53.910
I don't know if I could ever do it.
Do it again.

1419
01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.880
I would think I'd like to do something cooler than comedy now.

1420
01:16:57.150 --> 01:17:01.260
Like locksmith thing or like something you know like something loan,
you know,

1421
01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:02.250
loan fucking

1422
01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:03.260
<v 4>Gamer,</v>

1423
01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:07.910
a gamer maybe or celebrity poker kind of do like you're like really good at

1424
01:17:07.911 --> 01:17:10.070
poker or something.
You know?
I wouldn't want to be some kind

1425
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.660
<v 0>of an artist.
Grades.
Yeah,</v>

1426
01:17:11.661 --> 01:17:15.500
maybe a comic book artist or sculptor or something like that.
I'd want to do,

1427
01:17:15.501 --> 01:17:18.410
I mean I think it's all the same thing.
I think it's just putting your,
your,

1428
01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:22.910
your energy into something that you create and for us it just happens to be that

1429
01:17:22.911 --> 01:17:25.880
our personalities are fucked up enough that we want to being on stage.

1430
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:30.490
<v 3>I'm just lucky I don't want to be an actor cause that fucking like I feel bad</v>

1431
01:17:30.491 --> 01:17:30.651
for them.

1432
01:17:30.651 --> 01:17:34.230
It's like everybody in this town grows up and then comes up with the whole

1433
01:17:34.231 --> 01:17:36.720
feeling of like I can be an actor and like you know,

1434
01:17:36.721 --> 01:17:39.590
everybody can be an actor but like being a really good one.
Like,

1435
01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:42.360
like a really good one is like fucking difficult.

1436
01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:44.900
And that's what that would be like.
Cause I know it's a good roles.

1437
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.530
The good roles are very difficult.

1438
01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:50.040
I can only imagine because I could give a shit about like that kind of that

1439
01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:51.360
world,
you know,
it's not my world,

1440
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:53.700
but like being a really good comic is important to me.

1441
01:17:53.701 --> 01:17:56.940
So I assume it's the same thing for acting,
you know,
for the real actors.

1442
01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:01.020
But the amount of shit,
like you said,
roles that they have to do.
Shucks.
You know,

1443
01:18:01.021 --> 01:18:04.200
and they can only be as good as what they're asked to do.
The hardest comedy,

1444
01:18:04.201 --> 01:18:05.040
you can do whatever you want,

1445
01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.930
<v 0>you know?
So the hardest part about sitcoms is finding good writers.</v>

1446
01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.930
Really fucking for sure.
You know,

1447
01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:15.990
I had a couple of development deals after news radio and I was super spoiled

1448
01:18:16.331 --> 01:18:20.770
because I went from a show where Paul Simms is amazing,
brilliant fucking guy.

1449
01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.540
I mean he just had a sense of comedy.
He knew how to do it.
He's an amazing,

1450
01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:28.140
you know,
he just,
he had a sense of creating characters and the whole,
the ending.

1451
01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:32.500
But you go from that to some of the shit that people are slinging out there and

1452
01:18:32.501 --> 01:18:36.310
you're like,
well,
if you're an actor and this is all that's available to you,

1453
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:40.810
you find yourself on some shitty fucking show slang in some canned comments.

1454
01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:43.030
You know,
like some two and a half men type shit.

1455
01:18:43.031 --> 01:18:45.370
Like I watched one of the one episode of that show,

1456
01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:49.210
or Charlie sheen was on a couch with some key,
the little fat kid and they're,

1457
01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:53.200
they're going back and forth.
And I'm like,
wow.
And I was imagining myself,

1458
01:18:53.201 --> 01:18:56.170
what if I had a fucking say this?
What if I had to do,

1459
01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.200
even if I had to do it for 2 million bucks a week,
I mean,
I'd fucking do it.

1460
01:18:59.201 --> 01:19:02.230
Don't get me wrong.
What if I had to do that?
And I was like,

1461
01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:06.090
I'd probably go crazy too.
I'd probably go on a nutty coke bench.
Yeah.
He,

1462
01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:07.053
he said there was

1463
01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:11.780
<v 3>redundant.
Yeah.
But he still honestly,
yeah,
I thought that everybody's like,</v>

1464
01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:12.110
you know,

1465
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:14.300
one show was better than the other and there was some really great shows,

1466
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:17.570
but I could give a shit.
I know it's all set up punchline the punchline,

1467
01:19:17.571 --> 01:19:21.530
whether it's really well disguised or not watching to see what it is.

1468
01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:23.550
<v 0>If they were smart,
they'd let you help.
Yeah.</v>

1469
01:19:23.551 --> 01:19:24.990
There's a lot of people that don't want you to help.

1470
01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:27.300
They don't want you to be afraid of you because you're going to want you to ad

1471
01:19:27.301 --> 01:19:28.200
Lib.
I yeah,

1472
01:19:28.201 --> 01:19:32.580
we had that on news radio the last season when every season,

1473
01:19:32.581 --> 01:19:35.760
but the last season we had a new producer in the last season and they just sort

1474
01:19:35.761 --> 01:19:37.920
of like cut down,
lay on the ad libs.

1475
01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:42.420
What it used to be is we would take a scene and Dave Foley would like go over it

1476
01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:45.510
and we'd find out like what was kind of,
what was,

1477
01:19:45.511 --> 01:19:47.940
what wasn't working and what didn't feel right,

1478
01:19:47.941 --> 01:19:52.470
what you know and fully was always creating new lines and creating new things

1479
01:19:52.471 --> 01:19:52.800
and you know,

1480
01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:56.130
here's like a sort of a secret producer of the show and you sort of cut out.

1481
01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:01.070
He's a cool dude,
great guy,
genius,
brilliant,
brilliant comic actor.
The

1482
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:02.080
<v 3>kids in the hall like,
Ah,</v>

1483
01:20:02.081 --> 01:20:04.850
I don't want to turn this into like a big comedy stroked out,
but that that's,

1484
01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:08.100
that's an underrated ope sketch show.
Amazingly,
I think

1485
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.460
<v 4>that's probably one of the best I've ever seen personally,</v>

1486
01:20:11.461 --> 01:20:14.040
and I never was really a sketch comedy guy,
but I love that show.

1487
01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:16.830
I was really sketch comedy guy either.
I've always said that it's like,

1488
01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:20.400
I'll laugh three times for not laughing seven.
It's not a good ratio,

1489
01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:25.110
you know what I mean?
It's like three out of seven gigs or gags on.

1490
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:27.210
Those things are good.
Yes,
absolutely.

1491
01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:31.170
<v 3>Whatever.
These sketches go on and on.
If you can find it strong ending,</v>

1492
01:20:31.171 --> 01:20:33.870
you're there.
You know?
If he asked me,
you could smoke if you want.

1493
01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:36.420
I'll turn on the air thing.
Oh,
I don't want to,
I don't want to go.

1494
01:20:36.690 --> 01:20:40.770
I see he's got the new laptop because I'm in the process of buying some new

1495
01:20:40.771 --> 01:20:44.430
computer.
Think that's an admission.
Oh,
is it?
See that's how far behind I am.

1496
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:49.260
This is a newer one.
What does that,
Gee,
what is it?

1497
01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:51.810
A Mac book pro 17 inch one.

1498
01:20:53.250 --> 01:20:55.200
I don't know if I can travel with that now.
You're like a Douche.

1499
01:20:55.201 --> 01:20:56.610
If you travel with that theater.

1500
01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:58.580
He and I've taken it out and put it in that little,

1501
01:20:58.810 --> 01:21:02.490
<v 4>are you really a Douche if you do that?
I don't know like everybody else down,</v>

1502
01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:04.200
you know he's gotta to have like a droid,

1503
01:21:04.201 --> 01:21:09.120
aren't they do old style or your phone?
Your phone is ridiculous.
Hey,

1504
01:21:09.121 --> 01:21:12.520
easy.
Trawlers don't gang up on the old man colors.

1505
01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:17.450
What time is it?
Uh,
it is four 49.
Okay.

1506
01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:20.340
I had a question now is insomnia.
You guys released,

1507
01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:22.770
you didn't release it on the Act insomniac?
I'm sorry.

1508
01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:26.040
They went in some you guys released like the best of insomnia but you never

1509
01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:30.240
released every single episode right?
On DVD or blu ray or anything like that.
Um,

1510
01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:33.270
that's up to the comedy central people cause they own the shell.

1511
01:21:33.271 --> 01:21:35.700
But I assume that they did release,

1512
01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:39.120
I know that there was a season two and then they'd never released the next

1513
01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.820
season.
And people ask me that all the time and I'm like,
I wish,

1514
01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:45.900
but I assume it's all on Netflix now.
So that sound the background,

1515
01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:48.180
ladies and gentlemen here,
that horrible noise.

1516
01:21:49.190 --> 01:21:52.770
That's cause I'm smiling cause cause David tells smoking.
I'm sorry guys.

1517
01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:56.700
I know I knew you needed it.
I looked at you and go like an hour.

1518
01:21:56.730 --> 01:22:01.230
I saw it in your face.
It's okay.
Everybody.
You're never smoked cigarettes?
No,

1519
01:22:01.231 --> 01:22:03.660
I tried it once when I was 15 I tried it.

1520
01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:07.830
My sister smoked and I smoked weed with some friends and she wound up being a

1521
01:22:07.831 --> 01:22:11.870
smoker from that day on.
Oh yeah,
sister smoked since she was 14 holy shit.

1522
01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:15.660
I think she's quit now.
Pretty sure she quit a while ago.
But God,

1523
01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:20.670
there's no way you could smoke and do a martial law.
No,
no,
no,
no,
you couldn't.

1524
01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:21.390
No Way.

1525
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:26.100
Cause you know I did Jujitsu for like a couple of years where I'm on long
island,

1526
01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:29.100
you know,
and I was horrible at it and it was like really?

1527
01:22:29.130 --> 01:22:32.310
But I really do wish that it's like one of my big regrets is that like I really

1528
01:22:32.311 --> 01:22:35.460
wished that I had stuck with it because I think that's the coolest thing.

1529
01:22:35.461 --> 01:22:37.470
And that would have kept me off the booze and the smoking.

1530
01:22:38.190 --> 01:22:41.280
It really wouldn't really well tend to focus on it.
And the most important thing,

1531
01:22:41.281 --> 01:22:45.300
it calms you down.
It's so,
so bad.
Maybe a little too loud.

1532
01:22:45.301 --> 01:22:46.440
I'm going to turn this thing down.
I know.

1533
01:22:46.441 --> 01:22:50.940
I can hear people complaining on Twitter already.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry dude.

1534
01:22:50.941 --> 01:22:52.410
I'll put out a cigarette in a minute.

1535
01:22:56.370 --> 01:22:58.800
You've met that the host of a pawn stars,

1536
01:22:58.830 --> 01:23:02.580
it says on your Wikipedia like seven years before they actually had to show off.

1537
01:23:02.850 --> 01:23:05.770
He was working on the show as he was working on my show.
But uh,

1538
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:10.410
<v 3>that is a cool place in Vegas.
The porn.
The porn star people.
Yeah.</v>

1539
01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:15.310
Well you can't quit those things,
Huh?
Now I gotta quit.
I mean,

1540
01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:19.940
I don't want,
do you have to,
because I'm now I'm like really old and like I,
I,

1541
01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.750
she could go wrong.
Well,
I'm sure shit is already wrong,

1542
01:23:22.751 --> 01:23:27.680
but it's really more about like,
I've run out of reasons not to,
not to not quit.

1543
01:23:28.190 --> 01:23:29.110
Like,
you know,
I'm always like,
well,

1544
01:23:29.111 --> 01:23:31.880
I'm doing this on after I do a special or whatever,
I'll to it.

1545
01:23:31.930 --> 01:23:35.050
But it's like there's always some excuse and all my friends have quit now and

1546
01:23:35.051 --> 01:23:38.740
they're doing the electronic cigarettes or they're just,
you know,
just fucking,

1547
01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:42.190
I dunno,
white knuckling it.
Does it help you right?
No,
no.

1548
01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:45.490
What it really does help me do is kill the fucking many hours.

1549
01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:50.760
A fucking downtime of like in between shit like radio or like outside of an

1550
01:23:51.491 --> 01:23:56.170
airport.
Like just waiting for my flight.
Just smoking is like something to do.

1551
01:23:56.410 --> 01:24:00.280
I never really get off on like hitting the gift shop or like seeing what new

1552
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.170
good stores.
I haven't these fucking airport mall.
So I was like,
smoking is cool,

1553
01:24:05.171 --> 01:24:07.720
you know.
And then there's some airports where they only let you smoke outside,

1554
01:24:07.721 --> 01:24:11.260
which I think is ridiculous since that cigarette paid for that airport.

1555
01:24:11.290 --> 01:24:12.940
Motherfucker,
you go taxes.

1556
01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.930
<v 4>Do you,
um,
when you go on the road,</v>

1557
01:24:14.931 --> 01:24:16.940
do you bring people with you and do you go on the road by yourself?

1558
01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:17.351
<v 3>Man,</v>

1559
01:24:17.351 --> 01:24:20.020
I used to bring all these really cool dudes with me and I'll just yell at some

1560
01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:23.110
names.
Jay.
Oh cause saying Mike,
Vicki [inaudible] Kurt,

1561
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:28.390
Kurt Metzger a monster.
Yeah,
Curtis Super.
Now what that dude up in Montreal,

1562
01:24:28.391 --> 01:24:32.320
he's a great comic comics.
Very funny guy.
And uh,
you know,
these guys were like,

1563
01:24:32.370 --> 01:24:36.640
uh,
they were,
they were already,
I thought they were like headline and material,

1564
01:24:36.641 --> 01:24:40.450
but they wrote like earning their bones and they were dirty like me and like

1565
01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:44.660
Yoshi comes out with me something.
But now like we can't afford fly.
But my,

1566
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:49.720
my opener for years and years was showing rouse and Doug Stanhope used to Sean.

1567
01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.180
Sean is sick right now.
He's got rheumatoid arthritis,

1568
01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.890
but he's one of the filthiest,

1569
01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:58.270
dirtiest smartest comics I've ever fucking like his jokes just in my head.

1570
01:24:58.271 --> 01:25:00.610
Like sometimes they just ricochet around and like,
you know,

1571
01:25:00.611 --> 01:25:02.410
he's just got to get out there more and do stand up.

1572
01:25:02.411 --> 01:25:05.020
That's what I think we're right in.
He's not feeling too good.
So yeah,

1573
01:25:05.021 --> 01:25:06.070
his health is kind of jacked.

1574
01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:09.660
<v 4>That's like makes an ash tray in the flesh.</v>

1575
01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:16.760
How many do you smoke in those day?
About two packs.
So that's why.

1576
01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:20.250
So we had done like an hour and you already started to shake and he's trying,

1577
01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:21.800
you reach into your pockets.

1578
01:25:24.610 --> 01:25:26.940
Predatory.
I really will find your a,

1579
01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:31.660
this is actually him smoking made me feel good though.
Yeah,

1580
01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:34.130
but just smelling it made me feel.
Have you,
uh,

1581
01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:37.260
how many of you cut yourself down to I'm a pack a day now.

1582
01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:41.750
Why is these filters now too?
Which is cool.
You can.
So where do you get that?

1583
01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:45.210
I still don't know.
They're made in China.
So you know,
they're right.

1584
01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:48.520
You get to see what's going into your lungs.
God,
why did I do that?
Oh,

1585
01:25:48.570 --> 01:25:52.020
I want another one.
Something that you could substitute it with the gum.

1586
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:54.950
You went to the grossest thing sometime if you really went gross out,

1587
01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.960
you probably Dennis million times,

1588
01:25:56.961 --> 01:25:59.630
but you take a hit of a cigarette and then you blow it through a paper towel and

1589
01:25:59.631 --> 01:26:04.040
then you look at what,
it's just a black mark from the paper towel.
So bad

1590
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.540
<v 0>for you man.
Might meanwhile small joints all day sun.
Yeah.</v>

1591
01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:12.740
But that's not,
that's not the same thing,
right?
It actually opens up your lungs.

1592
01:26:12.741 --> 01:26:16.370
It's good for people that have asthma.
I said,
yeah,
my favorite asthma,

1593
01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:19.280
it's mostly marijuana is good for that.
It's good.
Uh,

1594
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:21.950
it's supposedly dilates your something in your lungs

1595
01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:25.470
<v 3>and it's also like,
it also has something else that's really good.</v>

1596
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:26.690
Like there's something else,
like

1597
01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.870
<v 0>there's tons of shit that's good.
Cannabinoids,</v>

1598
01:26:28.871 --> 01:26:31.150
all the different stuff that the way it affects your brain.

1599
01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.230
Supposedly it's supposed to a retard the growth of tumors and even shrink them.

1600
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:37.930
Oh Wow.
There's a lot of amazing things.

1601
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.630
Your body is all,
most people's body,
you know,
like when you're,

1602
01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:47.350
your body goes wrong.
It's because of malnutrition.
It's cause of poor genetics,

1603
01:26:47.351 --> 01:26:51.580
which cause of stress intention.
And if you could take any of those,

1604
01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:53.470
I have a mix.
Things are going to be better.

1605
01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.050
And the best way to take off stress intention is weed.

1606
01:26:56.051 --> 01:26:57.460
It's a great way to take it off.

1607
01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:01.150
You hit that and just everything just kind of comes into perspective.

1608
01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:03.610
You're there.
I'm going to be okay.
It's going to,
you're going to be fine.
You'll,

1609
01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:07.280
you relax significantly or you overthinking.

1610
01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:10.270
If you go too deep in the rabbit hole,
well you gotta become a,

1611
01:27:10.630 --> 01:27:12.850
you gotta learn how to ride the waves.
You know,

1612
01:27:12.851 --> 01:27:15.700
like nobody's good at surfing the first time on the water.
You Fall,

1613
01:27:15.701 --> 01:27:18.550
you fucking hate your head.
It's like,
it's an uncomfortable balanced thing.

1614
01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.230
You got to learn how to surf correctly.

1615
01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:23.530
When you watch those guys and they're fucking getting on a 50 foot wave there in

1616
01:27:23.531 --> 01:27:25.840
the tube that they didn't learn that yesterday.

1617
01:27:25.841 --> 01:27:29.800
That shit takes a long time to master surfing.
Marijuana is just,

1618
01:27:29.801 --> 01:27:33.790
it's very similar.
You have to learn how to regulate the experience.

1619
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.850
You got to learn how to just go with the high.
Right.

1620
01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:38.111
<v 3>I loved it.</v>

1621
01:27:38.111 --> 01:27:42.130
The other day you were at the Ice House and somebody was talking to you and

1622
01:27:42.131 --> 01:27:45.340
you're like,
I can't talk right now.
I just got,
I'm to stone.

1623
01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:50.210
You said something about like driving really fast and that your car freak you

1624
01:27:50.211 --> 01:27:52.770
out.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1625
01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:57.930
<v 0>Driving really fast.
Um,
I was just,
uh,
I was just thinking when we got there,</v>

1626
01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:58.771
we smoked some pot.

1627
01:27:58.771 --> 01:28:01.500
I was just thinking how stupid am I driving around in a convertible?

1628
01:28:01.770 --> 01:28:05.220
What if this thing flips cause nothing above your head.
Like what the,

1629
01:28:05.221 --> 01:28:08.780
what am I retarded?
I seen flip cars before.
I'm like why do I have a card?

1630
01:28:08.781 --> 01:28:12.750
It doesn't have a roof.
What?
Cause I liked the top down and the wind in my hand.

1631
01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:16.440
Well what am I doing?
What am I retarded?
It's still a safe move.
It's cool.

1632
01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.540
It is cool.
You know

1633
01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:23.400
<v 3>I was,
I'm sorry I was just gonna say like pod is so prevalent in La and like</v>

1634
01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:26.250
everywhere else in the country like it's hard to get,
it's hard to get.

1635
01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:27.481
I remember one time,

1636
01:28:27.481 --> 01:28:30.960
I was like years ago I was walking down sunset and you know how like there's

1637
01:28:30.961 --> 01:28:34.170
always traffic there.
So like there's like a light and like,

1638
01:28:34.171 --> 01:28:36.990
you know I was waiting to cross and this kid and like some shitty car that you

1639
01:28:36.991 --> 01:28:41.550
only see like in movies,
like some kind of like Datsun,
fucking Hugo,
whatever,

1640
01:28:41.670 --> 01:28:42.900
all beaten up.
Mangled.

1641
01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:47.650
He pulls out a bong and he's time in the light.
I saw that.

1642
01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:52.310
I was like,
you see that in every,
like Harold and Kumar knock off movie.

1643
01:28:52.311 --> 01:28:55.130
But I was like,
I really saw it in real life and I was like,
wow,
this is la.

1644
01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:59.390
You know what he's like puts it back down and he's driving off to his fucking

1645
01:28:59.391 --> 01:29:01.900
whatever music or it's a very strange

1646
01:29:02.110 --> 01:29:03.750
<v 4>book.
It's an old man with a pipe.</v>

1647
01:29:03.751 --> 01:29:05.880
The other day I had a red light and he was just like an old man,

1648
01:29:05.881 --> 01:29:09.790
just lighting a Piko at a red light.
Wow.
Classic.
Well that's why these guys,

1649
01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:12.700
<v 0>them joints of their role and today with those cigarette machines are perfect</v>

1650
01:29:12.701 --> 01:29:13.810
because it looks like a cigarette.

1651
01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:15.360
<v 3>Yeah,
like a joint over a pipe.</v>

1652
01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:18.880
<v 0>Yeah.
I don't think you should keep lighting things when you like them.</v>

1653
01:29:18.881 --> 01:29:22.120
You're supposed to use like a hemp WIC because then you're just dealing with

1654
01:29:22.121 --> 01:29:24.650
only in the fire and some organic material in the Hamp,

1655
01:29:24.670 --> 01:29:26.500
but when you're lighting it with a lighter man,

1656
01:29:26.501 --> 01:29:29.560
you're dealing with lighter fluid,
like you can taste it on the pipe.

1657
01:29:30.190 --> 01:29:33.610
I don't like that taste.
I think that's bad for your joints.

1658
01:29:33.611 --> 01:29:36.970
I light it at the tip and the smoke,
the whole thing.

1659
01:29:36.971 --> 01:29:40.930
And you're good joints all day.
Joy to the way to go or a vaporizer.

1660
01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:43.720
They sent me this new vaporizer but I haven't figured out how to do it yet.

1661
01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:47.160
<v 3>So when you go to like Amsterdam you'd been there?
I'm sure.
Never,
never,
never.</v>

1662
01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:48.600
When I go to Europe

1663
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:49.680
<v 0>it's only for the UFC.</v>

1664
01:29:49.681 --> 01:29:52.920
And you know I have kids so when I go to Europe I just don't,
I want to be there.

1665
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:56.010
It's small time as possible and then shoot back over.

1666
01:29:56.011 --> 01:29:59.400
So when I'm over there for the UFC I don't have the time to go an extra day.

1667
01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:01.740
It's an extra day.
I don't see my kid so I always fly

1668
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:04.380
<v 3>back home.
Well maybe one day you take a vacation,</v>

1669
01:30:04.381 --> 01:30:06.000
you go over there with the kids and stuff like that.

1670
01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.240
I don't know if they still do it but like the pot there,
you know,

1671
01:30:09.241 --> 01:30:11.340
cause we all smoked pot,
you know,
cause it's free.

1672
01:30:11.341 --> 01:30:14.430
And they also had hash and I think mushrooms at the time.

1673
01:30:14.431 --> 01:30:18.360
So like you can go on and do like all these crazy things in this little area.

1674
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:21.580
But then once you walk out on the street,
like Tom Rhodes,
who's great comic,

1675
01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:24.930
you know,
he lived there for a long,
long host of a show there,
right?
Yeah.

1676
01:30:24.931 --> 01:30:28.050
He was hosting a talk show,
which I think he,
you know,
everybody's like,

1677
01:30:28.051 --> 01:30:29.010
you should write a book.
I'm like,

1678
01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:31.620
once Tom Roads going to write a fucking book because that guy has some fucking

1679
01:30:31.621 --> 01:30:34.470
amazing experiences.
Sure.
He's like one of my favorites.

1680
01:30:34.471 --> 01:30:38.030
And he also is like a great joke writer.
Great Dude is a great deal.

1681
01:30:38.031 --> 01:30:38.731
Really Nice cat.

1682
01:30:38.731 --> 01:30:42.900
His Dad was a Vietnam helicopter pilot and he recently passed away and that was

1683
01:30:42.901 --> 01:30:45.840
like a big loss for all of us because I was always like asking him questions

1684
01:30:45.841 --> 01:30:47.150
about that shit.
And I was like,
you know,

1685
01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:49.740
tell me more shit about your dad because that was really cool.

1686
01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:53.100
As brother special forces,
uh,
like Greenbury dude.

1687
01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:56.580
So talk about the different roads in life.
You don't want guys like,
uh,
you know,

1688
01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:00.660
comic fucking pothead fucking great dude.
And the other guys,
uh,
you know,

1689
01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:05.070
contract fucking killer elite dude.
You know,
it was really,
I was like,

1690
01:31:05.071 --> 01:31:10.010
that's the Sitcom I want to see.
You know.
How was your day?
A mercenary.

1691
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:13.860
Yeah.
But Tom is like,
you know,
he should write a fucking book man.

1692
01:31:13.861 --> 01:31:16.620
Cause he's like been places like Vietnam and all those different places.

1693
01:31:16.621 --> 01:31:20.670
He probably knows where to get weed anywhere,
I'm sure.
Right?
Yeah,

1694
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:21.720
he's an explorer.

1695
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:26.410
<v 4>You got Nina Hartley coming on your show and Bill Burr.
I just,</v>

1696
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:28.210
I was talking to somebody the other day,

1697
01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:32.710
she's thinking about getting into comedy and doing comedy.
She is,
yeah.

1698
01:31:32.711 --> 01:31:34.990
I was going to have her on a future desk squad show you.

1699
01:31:35.170 --> 01:31:38.000
How long has she been doing comedy?
I,
and I think she's just about to start.

1700
01:31:38.230 --> 01:31:42.550
I think she's doing her first set that night.
Thursday at Bria impro.
Oh Wow.

1701
01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:46.930
I think,
I'm not sure,
but uh,
she didn't go on stage a few times.
It would just be,

1702
01:31:46.931 --> 01:31:49.270
it'd be like,
it'd be like a,
see what happens

1703
01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:53.890
when people pay to see those shows and I'm sure she's going to do fine.

1704
01:31:53.891 --> 01:31:56.710
But you know,
I,
I have a very strong,
no opinion

1705
01:31:56.710 --> 01:31:59.860
<v 0>on people who have just started doing comedy,
getting on stage in front of</v>

1706
01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:03.160
<v 4>[inaudible].
That's always the big thing.
When you did it,</v>

1707
01:32:03.161 --> 01:32:07.270
you had already done it in the past a bunch and Brian took a long time off.

1708
01:32:07.271 --> 01:32:11.680
Once went up,
he took like fucking eight years or seven years.

1709
01:32:11.681 --> 01:32:15.520
I could never do that.
And then he went up in front of a UFC crowd.

1710
01:32:15.521 --> 01:32:18.460
This is his first time doing standup in seven years.

1711
01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:23.560
He went up in front of a sold out crowd in Atlanta.
Yeah,
we three the wolves,

1712
01:32:23.561 --> 01:32:23.861
dude,

1713
01:32:23.861 --> 01:32:28.810
you went up in a midnight show and everybody was Hammad show Friday.

1714
01:32:29.670 --> 01:32:31.330
Yeah,
sold out midnight show Friday.

1715
01:32:31.331 --> 01:32:34.510
That was his first time on stage at seven years have been brutal.

1716
01:32:36.190 --> 01:32:39.160
He pulled the head some good.
He had some good jokes.
I want to do it.

1717
01:32:39.161 --> 01:32:43.000
What of these shows,
Joe?
I don't give a time Thursday.
I fucking love your crowd.

1718
01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:47.410
My crowd loves you.
I,
anything you want to do is show up Thursday.

1719
01:32:47.411 --> 01:32:51.660
If you in town at the Pasadena Ice House.
Oh Fuck No.
I'm a guy.
I met the,

1720
01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:54.470
where am I in Phoenix?
A big place.
Comedy shows stand up,
live,

1721
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:57.440
standup live Friday,
Saturday.
I got just a new place,
right?
Yeah.

1722
01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:01.930
That place is huge and that's
huge for UFC.

1723
01:33:01.931 --> 01:33:02.830
A lot of two camps.

1724
01:33:02.831 --> 01:33:05.110
They're too big and there's somebody that just did it and he's like,
dude,

1725
01:33:05.111 --> 01:33:08.830
that is the best club ever.
That not only is the club amazing and huge,

1726
01:33:08.831 --> 01:33:12.450
but they also put you up and they're like the nicest hotel ever.
Sweet.

1727
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:15.760
Like a human.
They're killing that Tempe Improv.
If that's the case,

1728
01:33:15.761 --> 01:33:19.210
the Tempe Improv was it,
that was a great club and rake club,
right?
I mean,

1729
01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:22.990
unless the town can support that many people,
which I guess it can,

1730
01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:26.500
if you have two completely different guys,
if you have like,
you know,

1731
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:30.190
a one show you have like an urban guy and another show you have like,

1732
01:33:30.250 --> 01:33:33.520
you know someone else,
I'm like bill burr or something like that.

1733
01:33:33.521 --> 01:33:36.370
I bet you could fill to comedy clubs up,
but it's gotta be hard.

1734
01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:40.030
One's a four 50 and one's a 600 they'll be able to fill it.
I'm like,

1735
01:33:40.090 --> 01:33:44.260
I can't do it.
You know,
it's like hundreds,
a lot of people and like,
you know,

1736
01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:45.580
it's like almost a theater.

1737
01:33:45.581 --> 01:33:48.280
That's where we talked about how active are you with the social media?

1738
01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:50.180
<v 3>I hate it but that's the,
I do it.</v>

1739
01:33:50.181 --> 01:33:53.090
But you know the point of it is like your crowd like it,

1740
01:33:53.450 --> 01:33:56.600
I always like hear that like you would just add the town or you're coming to

1741
01:33:56.601 --> 01:34:00.290
town.
I was like,
you know it's like Joe,
like you know you were mysterious dude.

1742
01:34:00.291 --> 01:34:01.130
Like I know you like,

1743
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:05.840
like the fact that you found these people and they found you is great.

1744
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:09.550
And like I would just like to fucking perform in front of all wild crowd.
Like,

1745
01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:12.920
cause I feel like the wild crowd is like the dying,
you know,

1746
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:15.230
it's like everyone's on the reservation now.

1747
01:34:15.231 --> 01:34:17.500
This few people still out there fighting the good fights up.

1748
01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:20.180
Your crowd is wild and I want to like fucking,
you know,

1749
01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:24.540
<v 4>well you know you are there people.
I hope so.</v>

1750
01:34:24.541 --> 01:34:26.730
I mean for fucking free man.

1751
01:34:26.731 --> 01:34:31.020
I swear they love crazy fucking night.
Any shows you're ever doing,

1752
01:34:31.021 --> 01:34:35.580
let me know and I'll tweet it and retweet it and,
and people will come,
man.
No,

1753
01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.160
I just want to see you in front of you.
Yeah.

1754
01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:38.760
<v 3>Your crowd and like,</v>

1755
01:34:38.761 --> 01:34:42.060
I just want to see how fucking while that is because I know you like will not

1756
01:34:42.061 --> 01:34:45.660
stop.
You're like relentless.
You'll take it and take it and take it.
So you know,

1757
01:34:45.661 --> 01:34:48.300
it's cool when you have an audience that will also,
you know,

1758
01:34:48.690 --> 01:34:50.250
go along on the ride with you.
Otherwise,

1759
01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:52.620
<v 4>yeah,
we'll need to know what you're doing.
Fucking rambling.
You know,</v>

1760
01:34:52.621 --> 01:34:54.350
that's what I sometimes feel like I'm just rambling.

1761
01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:58.070
Do you find that most of the people that come to see you,
most of them are

1762
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.470
<v 0>big fans.
Most of them know all your shit.</v>

1763
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:02.860
<v 3>They know me from TV but they don't really know my acts.</v>

1764
01:35:02.861 --> 01:35:05.050
And whenever it got comes up to me with a CD goes like,
you know,

1765
01:35:05.051 --> 01:35:07.600
I listened to this,
you know,
this is like really important.

1766
01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:10.940
Like my dad and I were truckers and we used to listen to this story.

1767
01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:13.990
I love those.
That's like,
you're like,
wow,
there really are comedy fans.

1768
01:35:13.991 --> 01:35:15.700
And some of them like me and I'm like,
wow,

1769
01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:18.790
here I am feeling like a Douche bag hating myself.
You know?
I was like this guy,

1770
01:35:18.791 --> 01:35:21.640
you know,
said hey listen to this.
When I was in Iraq and me and my buddies,

1771
01:35:21.641 --> 01:35:24.070
you know,
we kept quoting lines and it really helped us kill the time.

1772
01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:26.170
That makes you feel good.
Like you're doing something.

1773
01:35:26.171 --> 01:35:29.770
But I'd see most of the people come out because either they like so you TV show,

1774
01:35:29.771 --> 01:35:33.910
which is good or that they want to just do something and then you heard your

1775
01:35:33.911 --> 01:35:35.770
name and then like when they tighten up on me,

1776
01:35:35.771 --> 01:35:40.570
then I fucking take it to the evil place and then comedy fans are with me.

1777
01:35:40.810 --> 01:35:43.550
But then the other people like we're not going to go that far.
You know?

1778
01:35:43.551 --> 01:35:45.320
I was like,
oh,
hold on.
Just guys.
You know,

1779
01:35:45.321 --> 01:35:47.950
that's like five midget jokes on her own will.

1780
01:35:47.951 --> 01:35:50.780
There's always going to be people that don't want to go there with you.

1781
01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:54.820
I respect it,
but I still got to do it.
Right.
Well,
I fuck it.
That's who I am

1782
01:35:55.890 --> 01:36:00.540
<v 0>talking about this.
Um,
when,
uh,
it came up with a Dick Tracy Morgan thing came up.</v>

1783
01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:02.940
Oh right.
And I was like,
you know,
that's,
uh,

1784
01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:08.300
that's a type of art form the going deeper than he's supposed to go through.

1785
01:36:08.490 --> 01:36:12.810
Really fucked up jokes that I like that.
I know it's not sincere.

1786
01:36:12.811 --> 01:36:15.420
These aren't sincere thoughts.
These are the days are ridiculous.

1787
01:36:15.450 --> 01:36:16.560
Rambling all over the top.

1788
01:36:16.561 --> 01:36:21.300
Ramblings exaggerations comedy and much like auto and George talked about auto

1789
01:36:21.301 --> 01:36:24.180
and George and you know,
and the Tracy Morgan thing where,
you know,

1790
01:36:24.181 --> 01:36:27.930
he went around saying that if his son was dead or if someone was gay,

1791
01:36:27.931 --> 01:36:32.270
would stab that little faggot.
Right.
Well look,
he didn't really mean that stop,

1792
01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.990
but he didn't really,
that was an hour.
Yeah.
He's just going,

1793
01:36:37.170 --> 01:36:39.840
he's saying the most ridiculous shit you can say.

1794
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:43.470
It's not like a statement in front of a fucking jury.
You know what I mean?

1795
01:36:43.471 --> 01:36:47.310
It's not like a he,
he wrote this down,
this is doctrine.

1796
01:36:47.311 --> 01:36:50.730
This is how I feel about these people.
I mean I see both sides,

1797
01:36:50.731 --> 01:36:53.570
but you're absolutely right.
Absolutely.
See both got to everybody's got it right.

1798
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.690
Be

1799
01:36:53.690 --> 01:36:55.550
<v 3>Right there and people have a right to be pissed off about it.</v>

1800
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:59.090
But that's where it should end cause it is a comedy club and if anything he

1801
01:36:59.091 --> 01:37:00.230
should go like,
you know what,

1802
01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:04.970
if I'm going to say something that fucking explosive and whatever,

1803
01:37:04.971 --> 01:37:06.620
it better be funny.
And that's my whole thing.

1804
01:37:06.621 --> 01:37:09.110
It's like say whatever you're going to say but make it as funny as fucking

1805
01:37:09.111 --> 01:37:09.890
possible.

1806
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:13.160
Otherwise these people do have a point where you just either like being hateful

1807
01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:15.770
or you know,
you're just being abusive and I get it.

1808
01:37:15.771 --> 01:37:19.640
But like a lot of it is exploring the fucking like how far are these?

1809
01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.680
Are you going to do it?
And there is like a,

1810
01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:26.630
there was like a self fucking jerking off to that.
You know,
I was like,

1811
01:37:26.631 --> 01:37:29.290
I'm going to say Stan hope is the ultimate guy.
Like,
you know,

1812
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:31.010
he will take it to the point where you're like,

1813
01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:35.240
either you're fucking uncomfortable with how you're laughing at this

1814
01:37:35.241 --> 01:37:39.610
uncomfortable fucking moment of his is sick fucking twisted life or you're,

1815
01:37:39.611 --> 01:37:43.190
you're just like,
you know,
I cannot believe this guy is saying that.

1816
01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:46.630
And he shocks even me and I felt like I was unshockable so,
well,

1817
01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:50.420
he's another one who hates himself.
I know,
but he's,
he's,
he's perfect.
Brilliant.

1818
01:37:50.421 --> 01:37:51.680
He's perfect.
I think he's just,

1819
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:54.680
he's one of my favorite human beings from one of the favorite people that I've

1820
01:37:54.681 --> 01:37:56.070
ever met.
That's a good way to

1821
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.100
<v 4>get to the point was I just fucking sad every fucking thing.</v>

1822
01:37:59.101 --> 01:38:02.250
And there's nothing to fucking say.
It's like,
what am I doing?

1823
01:38:02.251 --> 01:38:06.100
Am I repeating myself?
And then we'll go up and crush about open,

1824
01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:10.820
just find some new angle for some new idea.
And he's,
he,

1825
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:15.290
like you said,
he's out there really doing it for reals.
Told me like,
you know,

1826
01:38:15.291 --> 01:38:17.610
like we're more like,
I would check jokes like,
you know,

1827
01:38:17.611 --> 01:38:20.250
I was like look fanatical checking.
Like make sure like you know,

1828
01:38:20.251 --> 01:38:22.590
nobody's doing this or like,
have you heard something like that?

1829
01:38:22.890 --> 01:38:24.690
And like with stand up I'd always call him up and I'd be like,

1830
01:38:24.691 --> 01:38:25.740
do you have like a,
you know,

1831
01:38:25.741 --> 01:38:30.160
like you're saying like you have a bit worried that you might have her check do

1832
01:38:30.161 --> 01:38:33.150
that,
check with your buddies and see if they have an,
and you know,

1833
01:38:33.151 --> 01:38:37.220
you try and like at least figure out that like,
you know,

1834
01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:39.910
it seems weird,
right?
Yeah.
If it fits to purpose.

1835
01:38:39.930 --> 01:38:44.160
Like why do I knew it felt like a harness.
You can't remember if you have,

1836
01:38:44.190 --> 01:38:46.590
it gets blurry and it bothers you too.
Like when you're like,
you know,

1837
01:38:46.591 --> 01:38:48.060
I hope I didn't hear this cause I don't want to,

1838
01:38:48.061 --> 01:38:51.390
Jack actually bothers me because all the people talking shit about people that

1839
01:38:51.391 --> 01:38:54.060
have stole jokes and like,
you know,
there's a lot of,

1840
01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:56.550
there's a lot of gray area in the whole like whose bed is it?

1841
01:38:56.551 --> 01:38:58.900
But like when you hear it like word for word?
Yeah.

1842
01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.780
It's basically just when you know a guy,

1843
01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:04.320
like there's a few guys where you know that the only bits that they have,

1844
01:39:04.321 --> 01:39:07.200
they're any good or the similar bids to other people's rights.

1845
01:39:07.201 --> 01:39:10.320
And then they have other bits that aren't like anybody else's bits and they're

1846
01:39:10.321 --> 01:39:14.550
fucking terrible.
You know,
the,
the,
and that's when you can really tell.
Well,

1847
01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:17.640
I just know that like the,
what I would call Stan hope.
And I go like,

1848
01:39:17.641 --> 01:39:22.410
do you have anything like a Unicorn's fucking,
you know,
grape soda.

1849
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:25.550
And then he'd be like,
what?
He's like,
nobody thinks that way.
And I,

1850
01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:28.770
and I don't do jokes anymore,
man.
I don't know when I do look there,

1851
01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:30.270
and it's true,
he's like jazz.

1852
01:39:30.271 --> 01:39:33.330
He just goes up there and just starts fucking doing these thoughts.

1853
01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:37.370
They love him in England.
And that usually is a sign that they're pretty purist.

1854
01:39:37.410 --> 01:39:41.010
What the comedy over,
they're great over there.
I only do it every now and then,

1855
01:39:41.011 --> 01:39:45.390
but I just did Birmingham,
uh,
did,
uh,
this past weekend is fucking amazing man.

1856
01:39:45.391 --> 01:39:47.880
He's the nicest,
most polite crowd ever.

1857
01:39:48.630 --> 01:39:52.350
Sometimes that's not good when they're too polite.
I don't like that.
I agree.

1858
01:39:52.351 --> 01:39:55.860
But there were brightening one guy sorta kinda heckled but it just sort of

1859
01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:57.690
yelled at.
It was actually fun.

1860
01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.190
I don't like when they just sit there and upload it,

1861
01:39:59.191 --> 01:40:03.390
but I don't like over the top craziness.
Yeah.
Unless I can fucking partake.

1862
01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.760
Well I think this crowd was a little self conscious cause it's like I said,

1863
01:40:05.761 --> 01:40:08.460
I could see them all.
They were all lit up.
See I don't like that either.

1864
01:40:08.461 --> 01:40:12.510
I don't like to,
I like a dark.
I think the crowd needs to be in dark.
Just feel.

1865
01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.370
What do you like?
Do you like a small place?

1866
01:40:14.371 --> 01:40:18.660
Like if you had like 200 seats is your favorite or loves?
I love clubs,
theaters,

1867
01:40:19.370 --> 01:40:21.000
specials in theaters.
I'm not a theater act.

1868
01:40:21.001 --> 01:40:23.520
I have no big fucking point to my act.

1869
01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:26.600
Nobody wants you to do a special on a club,
right?
You have a job.

1870
01:40:26.601 --> 01:40:28.050
We're going to do when I'm in a club and the next one I do,

1871
01:40:28.051 --> 01:40:30.990
I promise myself I'm doing it in a club and that's a definite,

1872
01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:34.140
but I've done them in theaters and like,
it really makes you feel like,
you know,

1873
01:40:34.141 --> 01:40:36.510
wow,
I made so many mistakes and comedy and this is one of them.

1874
01:40:36.511 --> 01:40:40.680
Like I'm not a theater act.
I'll never be a theater act.
I'm a Dick joke.

1875
01:40:40.681 --> 01:40:44.490
Fucking late night comics.
And I'm like,
you know,
I'm proud of it now.
It's like I,

1876
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:48.340
yeah,
that's what I want to be and you know,
kind of comedy.
My opinion,

1877
01:40:48.370 --> 01:40:52.580
it's just like who I am.
So funny,
silly comedy,
you know,
it's the,

1878
01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:55.510
it's the real shit,
you know,
it's the best stuff.

1879
01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:57.400
But there's some great theater acts.
I mean,
yeah.

1880
01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:00.990
<v 3>Louis Louis Black and Mitch Hedberg.
I told him what those two guys,</v>

1881
01:41:01.050 --> 01:41:03.690
both of them I thought were like very theater friendly.

1882
01:41:03.691 --> 01:41:05.790
Very like they worked really good in a big room.

1883
01:41:06.370 --> 01:41:09.580
<v 4>Yeah.
Louis,
well Hedberg was great in a small room too,
man.</v>

1884
01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:12.670
The weirdest acts ever.
Man.

1885
01:41:13.230 --> 01:41:17.580
<v 3>Crazy following to man his,
his people.
Wow.
They were like,
this was before all,</v>

1886
01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:18.593
all the media.

1887
01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:19.121
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1888
01:41:19.121 --> 01:41:22.200
They figured out how to get in touch with each other and then that with these

1889
01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:26.380
kids,
man,
he would have been fucking huge if he stayed alive.

1890
01:41:27.150 --> 01:41:30.930
<v 3>Imagine the jokes that he would have had,
you know,
like,
cause he was,</v>

1891
01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:33.540
he was probably the most prolific I ever met.

1892
01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:38.330
<v 4>Yeah.
In terms of clean comedy too.
He never had to go that thing like,
oh,</v>

1893
01:41:38.331 --> 01:41:41.200
I'm doing Letterman.
I can ever take out the fucking,
the shit.

1894
01:41:41.310 --> 01:41:45.050
It's like he's always clean,
you know.
He had,
fuck,
it was rare.

1895
01:41:45.051 --> 01:41:49.040
He had like one fuck every 15 minutes or something.
And he was always,

1896
01:41:49.041 --> 01:41:53.040
he didn't need it because,
fuck man,
that's who he was.
Yeah.

1897
01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:56.390
He would have broke Twitter.
Oh yeah.

1898
01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.850
No one would have been able to fuck with him.
Twitter was written for,

1899
01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:03.770
the jokes are so tweetable.
Someone said,
do you want a frozen banana?
I said,

1900
01:42:03.771 --> 01:42:07.340
no,
but I want a regular banana later.
So yes.

1901
01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:10.700
It's like his style was so weird,
man.

1902
01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:13.280
And then there was a bunch of dudes who started sounding like,

1903
01:42:13.281 --> 01:42:18.080
a lot of people sound like there's a lot tell babies out there too.

1904
01:42:18.081 --> 01:42:21.510
But a lot of guys,
hey,

1905
01:42:22.930 --> 01:42:24.920
where'd you out when you hear somebody's up there doing you,

1906
01:42:24.921 --> 01:42:29.050
cause I know you've seen it.
Yeah,
yeah,
I see it.
But I,
you know,
I'm,
I'm so

1907
01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:29.930
<v 3>joke,</v>

1908
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:33.410
like I'm like a joke or like it's really all about jokes that like if they're

1909
01:42:33.411 --> 01:42:35.960
going to do the cadence,
I'll do it with different cadence cause I can,

1910
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:39.190
<v 4>no,
your cadence is your,
whatever you fuck you want it to be,
you know,</v>

1911
01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.140
you could change it.
Yeah.
Just what you have confidence in.
Right?

1912
01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:44.430
<v 3>Yeah.
It's really,
it's really about like the joke,</v>

1913
01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:47.100
like if they're doing like my cadence where the joke that's kind of like mine,

1914
01:42:47.101 --> 01:42:50.820
then I'm like,
dude,
you know,
wait til the next week when I'm not here.

1915
01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:53.290
<v 4>Do you ever find yourself when you were young,</v>

1916
01:42:53.291 --> 01:42:57.280
when you first started out sounding like someone?
Oh,
absolutely.
Oh,
absolutely.

1917
01:42:57.770 --> 01:43:02.080
<v 3>Uh,
Alan Hevian,
Collin Quinn were the two big influences.
And Richard,
Jenny,</v>

1918
01:43:02.150 --> 01:43:05.570
the man,
I forgot Richard.
Jenny who no longer is with.
There's also another,

1919
01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:07.810
<v 4>he was [inaudible],</v>

1920
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:13.470
I was at the comedy connection in Boston,

1921
01:43:13.471 --> 01:43:17.790
a little one when it was like a 115 seat room.
That's crazy.
Yeah,

1922
01:43:17.791 --> 01:43:21.330
and I sounded like I heard the punchline like I'm like,
wow,

1923
01:43:21.331 --> 01:43:26.280
okay now that like crossed the line.
Sounds like him.
You know,

1924
01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:28.750
<v 3>I did a bill Burroughs podcast and we'll be talking about Richard,</v>

1925
01:43:28.751 --> 01:43:30.610
Jenny and like running a couple of other podcasts,

1926
01:43:30.890 --> 01:43:33.400
but I think you're the only guy who really does get that.

1927
01:43:33.401 --> 01:43:36.340
Like he really was a huge influential,

1928
01:43:37.090 --> 01:43:40.480
he was the biggest touring act for a while.
I think in comedy,

1929
01:43:40.481 --> 01:43:42.790
like there was like dice and then Sam Kinison all those people,

1930
01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:45.940
but then like late,
he didn't get the credit he deserved for whatever reason.

1931
01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:46.121
Yeah.

1932
01:43:46.121 --> 01:43:49.380
Like in the late eighties and nineties it really was Richard Jenny's moment and

1933
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:52.010
he got the ace awards,
which is like the cable.

1934
01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:56.090
<v 4>He was doing theaters in show.
Absolutely.
No,
he was always on deck for a Sitcom,</v>

1935
01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:00.050
you know,
like this.
It was going to be did one member.
Platypus.
Man.
Yeah.

1936
01:44:00.110 --> 01:44:03.320
I don't know what that was all about,
but he was,
his thing was,
look man,

1937
01:44:03.321 --> 01:44:05.870
they were always trying to plug them into something else who was in the mask

1938
01:44:05.871 --> 01:44:09.080
with Kerry and he wanted to be an actor.
He wanted to be famous.

1939
01:44:09.081 --> 01:44:12.860
I understand he wanted to be famous,
but he was a brilliant fucking comedian.

1940
01:44:12.861 --> 01:44:15.830
It's really,
it was our unfortunate that,
you know,

1941
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:19.460
people don't appreciate how good he was when he was in his prime.

1942
01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:22.970
You know when we,
when I saw him in the late eighties I saw him,

1943
01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:24.470
I paid to see him.

1944
01:44:24.471 --> 01:44:28.850
I think I hadn't done comedy yet or maybe I had done like one open mic and I saw

1945
01:44:28.851 --> 01:44:31.190
him do an hour and a half at catch a rising star.

1946
01:44:31.190 --> 01:44:35.140
I saw him like three times and he did different hours all three times.
Oh yeah,

1947
01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:39.710
absolutely.
Completely different.
And all of it solid as a rock.
No,

1948
01:44:39.711 --> 01:44:42.740
no bad material and one punch line after the other punch line.

1949
01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:44.480
What I learned from that night,
yeah.

1950
01:44:44.481 --> 01:44:49.280
I learned from that guy how to cover the most ground that you can in a bit.

1951
01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:50.170
Bingo.

1952
01:44:50.170 --> 01:44:54.460
He beat a subject to the point where I'm at,

1953
01:44:54.510 --> 01:44:55.490
I'm like a chess player,

1954
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:59.270
which makes you disappointed when you see a young comic that like starts a

1955
01:44:59.271 --> 01:45:01.400
little bonfire,
starts an idea,

1956
01:45:01.490 --> 01:45:03.460
then abandons it and goes to a completely different stuff,

1957
01:45:03.461 --> 01:45:06.830
different kinds of file and you can't,
you can't get a rhythm with them.

1958
01:45:06.831 --> 01:45:08.180
But with Richard,
Jenny,
he would,

1959
01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:10.670
whatever the subject was someone trying to sell him a car,

1960
01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:15.020
he would go into this thing and take you on a fucking journey and every bit was

1961
01:45:15.021 --> 01:45:18.050
like a five minute bit and because of that it was just like you would date take

1962
01:45:18.051 --> 01:45:21.770
you deeper and deeper and you really like appreciated the way he like looked at

1963
01:45:21.771 --> 01:45:25.610
things.
You know you got sucked into his sense of humor.
That's so fucking,

1964
01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:25.950
you know,

1965
01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:29.420
I'm glad you said that because I always say this to like the younger comics,

1966
01:45:29.421 --> 01:45:31.940
they were like,
who did,
how did you learn how to like tag a joke and all that?

1967
01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:34.370
Something like Richard Jannie was the guy that choked it up.

1968
01:45:34.371 --> 01:45:38.930
Milk a premise and even though a lot of this stuff now is hackney just because

1969
01:45:38.931 --> 01:45:41.960
it's been done a million times of like,
you know,
the dating,
you know,

1970
01:45:41.961 --> 01:45:43.970
like going through the French restaurant and whatever,

1971
01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:46.490
like all that stuff has been done over and over and over.

1972
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:49.790
But when he was doing it,
it was,
it was basically really well written,

1973
01:45:49.791 --> 01:45:53.000
well crafted new material.
It's all,
it's like any joke,
you know,

1974
01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.080
it gets a little stale but they're always like this that sparked to it and yeah,

1975
01:45:57.081 --> 01:45:59.750
you're exactly right where he would just fucking take a topic.

1976
01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:04.550
He would not let go of it until he milked every possible fucking angle out of
it.

1977
01:46:04.551 --> 01:46:08.090
And I was like,
wow,
that's how you headline we'd materials and I never could,

1978
01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:11.350
I never could reach is like,
cause he would act out the two.

1979
01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:16.200
And I never had that kind of competence,
like both parts and the thing.

1980
01:46:16.201 --> 01:46:20.870
And he would occasionally play in birth parts and stuff.
He would occasionally,

1981
01:46:20.890 --> 01:46:25.460
um,
like uh,
go over a subject that you had heard people go over before.
Like,

1982
01:46:25.461 --> 01:46:28.730
you know,
he would do a bit like a,
about what you remember.

1983
01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:31.610
Everybody had a bit about when I was your age.

1984
01:46:31.611 --> 01:46:35.930
We had to walk 10 miles through the snow.
A lot of guys had those.

1985
01:46:35.931 --> 01:46:39.380
It was uphill both ways.
A lot of guys have those types of jokes.

1986
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:41.810
A lot of comedians did and he did too.

1987
01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:44.090
So he had a subject that he knew had been covered,

1988
01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:49.190
but he covered it's so fucking,
well it's like he was as some master joke writer,

1989
01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:49.980
he knew how to

1990
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.660
<v 0>like really get the most angles out of a a premise and he wasn't,
you know,</v>

1991
01:46:54.661 --> 01:46:59.661
he wasn't trying to be a some obscure hipster sort of weird reference or

1992
01:47:01.231 --> 01:47:05.010
anything.
Yeah,
it was just,
he was just a really prolific comic.
He was just,

1993
01:47:05.011 --> 01:47:06.900
he considered himself a real comic.

1994
01:47:06.970 --> 01:47:10.990
<v 3>He was the act that you would take your mom and your buddy,
hey buddy too.</v>

1995
01:47:10.991 --> 01:47:14.560
And you'd be like,
wow,
that could be like below blew.
Blew me away.

1996
01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:16.780
And when everybody says like he did a whole new hour,

1997
01:47:16.781 --> 01:47:18.910
it's like people love to say you're absolutely right.

1998
01:47:18.911 --> 01:47:22.750
He could do like five hours of different materials,
just like,
you know,

1999
01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:26.980
he was built for Vegas and like just headlining and like not many guys can like

2000
01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.150
crush in both places.

2001
01:47:28.151 --> 01:47:32.020
Like either you're crushing Vegas or you crushed like in like Shitty,
you know,

2002
01:47:32.021 --> 01:47:33.750
all over the country and like,
you know,

2003
01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:37.750
he was like bill for both and the heel is great power in theaters.

2004
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:40.050
<v 0>He was,
um,
he was a monster in the,
like I said,</v>

2005
01:47:40.051 --> 01:47:42.780
in the late eighties when I went to see him,
he was one of the best comics alive,

2006
01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:44.150
<v 3>but he was not a Boston guy though.</v>

2007
01:47:45.890 --> 01:47:50.210
He was from Brooklyn and a B started at pips.
Right.
Pipsy that's right.

2008
01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:54.260
And I think when he,
like if you're in New York act,
then you went up to Boston,

2009
01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:58.330
like you would get your,
you get schooled because like they want you up though.

2010
01:47:58.370 --> 01:48:00.800
They would set you up to like,
I had to follow Steve Sweeney one time,

2011
01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:05.060
like with my 39 minutes of material and they do it at the verbal lounge and
they,

2012
01:48:05.061 --> 01:48:05.201
yeah.

2013
01:48:05.201 --> 01:48:07.640
And he would go up there and just do like five impressions that the place would

2014
01:48:07.650 --> 01:48:11.450
Florida all Boston centric.
Absolutely.
But you know what it was,

2015
01:48:11.451 --> 01:48:12.790
it was a good fucking school.
And then,

2016
01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:16.560
cause I wasn't cocky or anything like that,
but I never had to fuck to,

2017
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.310
to face the home team the way I did in Boston.

2018
01:48:19.311 --> 01:48:23.810
And you really do face the home to you if you bomb and Boston,
you fucking,

2019
01:48:23.811 --> 01:48:27.770
you're not the legend that was,
that was,
that was,
that was a righteous,

2020
01:48:27.771 --> 01:48:28.640
a fucking bomb.

2021
01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:31.030
<v 0>They used to do that to people.
They used to set people up.</v>

2022
01:48:31.031 --> 01:48:33.730
I saw them set a lot of people up at the Nick's comedy stop.

2023
01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:36.670
They would have like literally Sweeney Gavin.

2024
01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:41.700
Kevin Knox had lost three guys who are just destroying,

2025
01:48:42.791 --> 01:48:43.121
I mean,

2026
01:48:43.121 --> 01:48:48.121
20 minutes of Samurai Sword Comedy where they've folded that steel over and over

2027
01:48:49.871 --> 01:48:52.330
again.
They've been,
those guys didn't do HBO specials.

2028
01:48:52.331 --> 01:48:55.650
So they were doing the same material for years and they,

2029
01:48:55.651 --> 01:48:59.180
it was a real problem because they kept,
like,
especially some of them,
uh,

2030
01:48:59.230 --> 01:49:00.070
you know,
you'd go see,

2031
01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:03.820
see him 10 years later and they had virtually the same act.
It became stale.

2032
01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:06.320
<v 3>The town was too good to them and made them like,</v>

2033
01:49:06.321 --> 01:49:08.600
the point of the whole thing is like,
you've got to move to the next level.

2034
01:49:09.050 --> 01:49:10.670
And it was too good.
They're making too much money

2035
01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:13.260
<v 0>and something happened.
The new ones here,</v>

2036
01:49:13.261 --> 01:49:16.460
it wasn't nearly as good as the old material and they just weren't the same gun

2037
01:49:16.461 --> 01:49:19.280
that they used to be.
But they were monster rocks too.
But when it,
when,

2038
01:49:19.281 --> 01:49:22.490
when these guys would,
when we're sending people up in the late eighties,

2039
01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:27.110
they were perfect.
They were just destruction machines.

2040
01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:30.230
But I saw a bunch of people get through A.
Dot.
My rare,
I got through it,
fine.

2041
01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:35.040
Dom Irrera went up there and that was,
yeah,
he was loved.
Um,
Thompson,
Larry,

2042
01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:38.840
he's a great guy too.
And back in the day,
like in the late eighties,

2043
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:42.230
he was one of the top guys for short and he still is,
but I mean he was,

2044
01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:46.100
he was killing him back then and he went up after all those guys,

2045
01:49:46.101 --> 01:49:46.934
they set them up.

2046
01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:51.910
Gavin Sweeney just crushed Lenny Clarke meant it might've been letting one,

2047
01:49:51.911 --> 01:49:52.744
one of the nights

2048
01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:55.050
<v 3>guys.
I,
I would,
I would,</v>

2049
01:49:55.170 --> 01:49:58.350
I would fucking die a million deaths trying to follow those guys in Boston.

2050
01:49:58.370 --> 01:49:59.570
It's fucking hard.
They would,
they would,

2051
01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:01.470
they were like polished like you said and,

2052
01:50:01.471 --> 01:50:04.250
and like they just knew how to work that crowd.
Yeah.
But like,
uh,

2053
01:50:04.290 --> 01:50:06.120
like shemot another guy who I looked,

2054
01:50:06.210 --> 01:50:11.070
I looked up to starting out like he was a joke dude and then dark dude and like

2055
01:50:11.071 --> 01:50:12.690
his life backed up that darkness.

2056
01:50:13.050 --> 01:50:15.360
But like he was another guy where you talking about like material,

2057
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:19.170
it's like every time I saw him he had a new bit about a new horrible thing that

2058
01:50:19.171 --> 01:50:22.590
happened to him.
Cams or wife or something like that.
Yeah.
And it's like,
you know,

2059
01:50:22.591 --> 01:50:24.660
everybody's like,
talk about your life.
It's like,

2060
01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:28.890
this dude's life is so fucking dramatic.
Even Oprah won't touch it,
you know,

2061
01:50:28.891 --> 01:50:33.190
it's like so,
so,
so full of highs and lows and all that stuff.
But his,
his,
his,

2062
01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:36.870
his stuff.
When I look back on my earlier stuff,
I'm like,
you know,

2063
01:50:36.871 --> 01:50:40.770
I was always trying to be dark and like evil and like,
you know,
go to the,

2064
01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:43.770
go to the evil place or right.
Really clean.
But I'm like,

2065
01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:47.190
what I really should have been doing,
it's like watch Schimmel,
just watch,
right.

2066
01:50:47.191 --> 01:50:51.030
A great joke and just like let the natural organic of the,

2067
01:50:51.210 --> 01:50:55.550
of the sadness inside of me like,
you know,
come out,
you know?
But uh,

2068
01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:58.350
shit Shammo like is his stuff is classic.

2069
01:50:58.351 --> 01:51:01.620
I think his stuff is more evergreen than a lot of people's,
cause it's really,

2070
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:06.630
you know,
about topics that are,
you know,
evergreen,
whatever relationships and,

2071
01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:09.600
you know,
health and all that kind of stuff.
So I'm a big fan of his.

2072
01:51:09.790 --> 01:51:12.430
<v 0>Yeah,
he was great.
He,
you know,
he had some brilliant jokes</v>

2073
01:51:12.730 --> 01:51:16.560
<v 3>and I love a fucking,
the fact that like,
you know,
uh,</v>

2074
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.270
he did that special and then at the end he showed us the pictures,

2075
01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:25.970
you know,
did you see his last question?
It's a fucking,
it's sweet.
Special.

2076
01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:29.690
Yeah.
You know,
cause he had just beat,
you know,
cancer and you know,

2077
01:51:29.930 --> 01:51:32.600
it's just like no one ever would have thought that he would end it the way he

2078
01:51:32.601 --> 01:51:35.770
did.
It's sad ending.
Well,
a car accident,
you know,
I mean,

2079
01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:38.810
what do you do any special?
He finally,
you know,

2080
01:51:38.811 --> 01:51:41.340
Ba and shows pictures of his kids,
you know,
like the,

2081
01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:45.350
he supposedly wasn't able to have children because of other treatments.

2082
01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:49.730
The Chemo therapy and of course,
you know,
he Shem also,

2083
01:51:49.731 --> 01:51:53.700
he has two beautiful twins and I was like a real sweet thing.
I thought,
you know,

2084
01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:57.740
it's weird for comedy like after an hour of Dick Jokes and see pictures of

2085
01:51:57.741 --> 01:51:59.120
children.
But yeah,

2086
01:51:59.350 --> 01:52:01.930
<v 0>I miss that dude.
I,
I used to see him around.
I wish I knew,</v>

2087
01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:06.550
lived in my neighborhood.
I lived in this area.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I used to run into,

2088
01:52:06.551 --> 01:52:08.680
I ran into him a couple times.
It's great guy.

2089
01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:13.110
<v 3>It's fucking,
yeah,
that,
that's a sad thing.
But I,
I I,
oh,
tons to those,</v>

2090
01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:14.580
those kinds of things.
We all do my guys,

2091
01:52:14.690 --> 01:52:18.350
<v 0>right?
We all do.
We,
I mean we,
we owe to each other.
I think,
you know,
it's,
it's uh,</v>

2092
01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:20.890
one of the things,
the reasons why,
you know,
you were talking about the,

2093
01:52:20.891 --> 01:52:24.830
the wave of Boston comics that came up,
you know,
the Depaulo is,

2094
01:52:24.831 --> 01:52:27.560
and all those guys,
they all know each other.
You know,

2095
01:52:27.561 --> 01:52:30.800
the reason why everybody was so good is because so many people were so good.

2096
01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:32.270
You just had to do well.

2097
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:35.510
<v 3>What's the predictive power was the first guy that I saw that was kind of my age</v>

2098
01:52:35.511 --> 01:52:39.980
who was a killer,
had water and I was like,
wow.
Yeah.
And he fucking,

2099
01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:43.250
his crowd work took,
made everyone else's crowd work,

2100
01:52:43.251 --> 01:52:46.130
look like you were doing bingo.
Like you go right for the throat.

2101
01:52:46.131 --> 01:52:51.131
And to this day I always have memories of just him taking on bachelor parties

2102
01:52:51.261 --> 01:52:55.490
and like just fucking drama.
A great and just like,
you know,
you're like,

2103
01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:00.320
it was like watching an epic battle like Godzilla vs Mothra kind of a great

2104
01:53:00.321 --> 01:53:04.340
joke.
Right?
He has a great joke writer and he's also a great political,
you know,

2105
01:53:04.341 --> 01:53:07.830
even though he's really hardcore right wing,
his stuff is dead on.
So

2106
01:53:08.410 --> 01:53:11.830
<v 0>no,
he doesn't have anything that he says it isn't backup with thought.</v>

2107
01:53:12.970 --> 01:53:16.590
I saw nick like early on and nick like actually,
uh,

2108
01:53:16.630 --> 01:53:19.840
gave me a lot of hope cause I used to go on stage and I'd be like,
man,

2109
01:53:19.841 --> 01:53:22.970
I look like I'm meathead does.
I never saw you guys when you were young comics,

2110
01:53:22.971 --> 01:53:27.040
you were already polished guys.
Oh really?
When did you,
uh,
when did we meet?

2111
01:53:27.041 --> 01:53:27.874
We met in the night.

2112
01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:30.450
<v 3>Yeah,
but you already were headlining and you were like,
you know,</v>

2113
01:53:30.451 --> 01:53:33.270
like you said you're doing all these gigs and I'm sure you were like already had

2114
01:53:33.271 --> 01:53:36.180
at least a half hour special lawyers.
We're on deck for one.
Yeah.

2115
01:53:36.210 --> 01:53:39.090
<v 0>Well,
I think I did a an MTV half hour comedy on our first.</v>

2116
01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:41.850
Maybe I did that maybe right before you and I met or something like that.

2117
01:53:41.851 --> 01:53:45.240
It was in that,
in that neighborhood.
I still suck.
Then I was just,
I was,

2118
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:49.750
<v 3>I feel like I'm going to suck this weekend.
I'm just telling you,</v>

2119
01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:54.000
but it's good to see you watch you suck.
Where Phoenix,

2120
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:59.550
it'd be a new type of suck.
That's the only thing.
Fresh paint on the old suck.

2121
01:54:00.230 --> 01:54:03.990
Um,
I forgot what my point was about sucking in the beginning.
I love that.

2122
01:54:03.991 --> 01:54:07.050
I love that you say that.
You know,
cause I always feel like I,
it's like,

2123
01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:08.760
am I ever going to get good at this?

2124
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:11.540
<v 0>People say differently.
You know,</v>

2125
01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:15.160
I heard this one guy say that he's never bombed and he said,
yeah,
that's creepy.

2126
01:54:15.170 --> 01:54:16.760
It's,
that drives me nuts.
Really.
What do you mean?

2127
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:19.430
How has he that even impossible?
What have you learned?
Nothing.

2128
01:54:19.610 --> 01:54:22.550
That's like a person walking through life saying,
I've never made a mistake.

2129
01:54:22.670 --> 01:54:24.510
You want something to drink or we'd done I think wrap this up.

2130
01:54:24.570 --> 01:54:28.190
I gotta I know I've got a role,
but uh,
I better sounds a cigarette outside.

2131
01:54:28.210 --> 01:54:32.840
It's five 20.
We've had a long show.
Hey Joe,
amazing show

2132
01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:37.320
<v 3>Joe for going way too long and honestly,
uh,
not seeing you.</v>

2133
01:54:37.321 --> 01:54:40.950
And I want to see you live.
And I'm like,
I said,
uh,
you guys have a sweet thing.

2134
01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:44.130
Thanks for helping me get the word out about the show.

2135
01:54:44.131 --> 01:54:47.100
Let's do a Gig together somewhere.
I would just do a theater degree.
Honestly.

2136
01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.600
I would love it.
Let's do it.

2137
01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:51.270
I hope your people would want me on the shelf because I know they're like

2138
01:54:51.271 --> 01:54:54.540
fanatical.
You know,
this is a little bit because I sucked down and I suck.

2139
01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:58.890
Now we should all come up with our first bit.
I'll do my first wreck right now.

2140
01:54:58.891 --> 01:55:03.240
The crying Indian Joe.
Which one is it?
Which was like the crying Indian.

2141
01:55:03.241 --> 01:55:05.880
You remember like what the pollution,
how old,
you know,

2142
01:55:05.881 --> 01:55:08.550
you could actually say the word Indian,
native American.

2143
01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:12.030
It's like the crying and it was like,
you know,
people,
it's not the pollution.

2144
01:55:12.031 --> 01:55:15.600
He has an allergy and I've seen that joke redone like a million different ways

2145
01:55:15.601 --> 01:55:18.330
on in cartoons and all that stuff.
But that was like the first time I was like,

2146
01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:22.380
wow,
I really came up with something edgy here.
Wow.
Wow.

2147
01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:27.180
<v 0>Joke was about,
uh,
uh,
hot girls never get speeding tickets.</v>

2148
01:55:27.181 --> 01:55:30.390
It was so bad that it was like,
this is what it's like.
I'm already jealous.

2149
01:55:30.450 --> 01:55:33.950
Do you realize how fast you were going?
No,
I don't.
Do you like my tits?
You know,

2150
01:55:33.951 --> 01:55:38.160
so I do.
Here's a warning.
That was my bed.
I actually wrote that.

2151
01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:40.980
Everyone thought I'm like,
fuck I exactly what?
This is a good one.

2152
01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:43.470
That's a notebook with a big star next to it.
That's what I

2153
01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:49.090
<v 4>circled.
That put a star next to that bitch.
I'm close with that motherfucker.</v>

2154
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:51.880
Week tools to work with.
You know,

2155
01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:55.830
you ever go back and like look at some of your old books.
Love it.
No,

2156
01:55:56.190 --> 01:55:57.060
no.

2157
01:55:57.061 --> 01:56:01.200
I used to have this joke about Bette Midler's gynecologist and it was like,

2158
01:56:01.810 --> 01:56:02.760
it was like,
Oh,

2159
01:56:02.761 --> 01:56:07.650
a fucking long joke about him pulling things out of her vagina.
No,

2160
01:56:07.651 --> 01:56:11.820
I love that.
I love tax.
I love it.
And you,
but Jimmy Hoffa,

2161
01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:14.760
Jimmy Hoffa was in her vagina and I thought he was buried in giants stadium.

2162
01:56:14.761 --> 01:56:17.340
Holy Shit.
That is giant stadium and here comes the giants

2163
01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:22.020
and so bad it just such a terrible,

2164
01:56:22.170 --> 01:56:27.030
I didn't think any of those thoughts other than this might work.
You know,

2165
01:56:27.031 --> 01:56:29.910
these aren't like things that really resonated with me.
It was just,

2166
01:56:29.911 --> 01:56:33.070
I was just trying to put together some tool that I could use on stage and get a

2167
01:56:33.071 --> 01:56:37.410
laugh.
Well that's,
I love that you like look back on the joke and you're like,

2168
01:56:37.450 --> 01:56:38.790
oh I know.

2169
01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:42.060
But you know somewhere if someone's doing a version of that joke right now to

2170
01:56:42.190 --> 01:56:46.140
drive you crazy when you put out like a CD or something and then you have the

2171
01:56:46.141 --> 01:56:49.890
joke for another month and you'd come home with a new fucking tax.
I hate it.

2172
01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:54.060
I hate it.
I,
I tried send,
it will be fixed by a software update.
You know,

2173
01:56:54.061 --> 01:56:55.730
where you can update your,
your CV.

2174
01:56:56.810 --> 01:57:00.720
It was really easy to record like CD quality stuff.
It wouldn't be,

2175
01:57:00.721 --> 01:57:03.240
but you know when you record a CD,
it's a pain in the ass.

2176
01:57:03.241 --> 01:57:06.450
You have to have an audio engineer and you have to make the crowd and you know,

2177
01:57:06.930 --> 01:57:07.920
that's another thing,
man,

2178
01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:11.040
I'm glad you said it where you always come up with like you figured out the

2179
01:57:11.041 --> 01:57:13.680
puzzle,
but the game's over and you're like,
oh my God,

2180
01:57:13.681 --> 01:57:17.520
I just came up with the best part of it and then that new tagline leads into a

2181
01:57:17.521 --> 01:57:19.800
way better bit.
You're like,
oh,
what do I do?

2182
01:57:19.801 --> 01:57:23.130
Because now I have the first part on this CD and everybody's heard it.

2183
01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:26.190
But the second part is like,
it doesn't stand alone,

2184
01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:28.320
but with that other part it becomes amazing.

2185
01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:31.770
You just have to rewrite something similarity and it's really hard to do.

2186
01:57:31.771 --> 01:57:34.050
Ari has a couple like that where he's really,
like I said,

2187
01:57:34.051 --> 01:57:36.990
I asked him about a tagline.
I said,
you said it like this before.
He goes,

2188
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:41.430
actually I stole my joke from another joke that I had stole it from myself.

2189
01:57:41.470 --> 01:57:46.250
He like stole parts of it.
I'll go,
oh,
see you.
I see you.
You redid your own joke.

2190
01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:51.690
Oh yeah,
you did.
You swapped it around the gods of comedy work like that,

2191
01:57:51.691 --> 01:57:52.021
which is,

2192
01:57:52.021 --> 01:57:54.300
I'm glad you brought that up because that is like one of those things where you

2193
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:57.630
never know.
But then like how about the joke that you've never told before,

2194
01:57:57.631 --> 01:58:02.250
but you say it on the CD and it works.
So that's how the God balances out.

2195
01:58:02.251 --> 01:58:04.920
Like you know this.
Isn't that the most fun moment ever?

2196
01:58:04.921 --> 01:58:07.980
When you're onstage and you say,
I say I did something in Manchester.

2197
01:58:07.981 --> 01:58:10.230
I don't know what it is.
I have to go back and listen to the recording,

2198
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:14.790
but I went on this totally new tangent and it was crushing and I was listening

2199
01:58:14.791 --> 01:58:18.350
to,
I even said when I was on stage,
somebody right downtown.
Yeah,
I say that.

2200
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:24.540
I don't know what the fuck.
Yeah,
I love that too.
Yeah.
I like this fucking thing.

2201
01:58:24.541 --> 01:58:27.300
And then,
then,
then you'll hear it and you're like,
oh,
I can make it better.

2202
01:58:27.301 --> 01:58:30.660
And then you'll keep twisting into until it sucks and you're like,

2203
01:58:31.050 --> 01:58:33.460
what the fuck I've created and now I have destroyed.

2204
01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:36.870
Worst is when you're tired or saying something and then you'd go into it and you

2205
01:58:36.871 --> 01:58:41.040
wish you didn't like as you started it,
as you started the bit,
you're like,
oh,

2206
01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:45.010
have I done,
I don't like this bit anymore.
And I'm talking to him coming down.

2207
01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:49.440
I'm faking my enthusiasm and uh,
oh,
that's the word.
It's like when you got it,

2208
01:58:49.441 --> 01:58:51.790
it's a high energy bit.
Oh,
it's the worst.

2209
01:58:51.791 --> 01:58:55.570
And you're faking it and you just feel like such an idiot as you're about to go

2210
01:58:55.571 --> 01:58:57.580
into the big part.
And we really going to do the big part here.

2211
01:58:57.610 --> 01:58:59.590
Let's do the big part.
And you're like,
oh,
it's funny.

2212
01:58:59.810 --> 01:59:02.320
Like a phone call on your pocket and the audience,

2213
01:59:02.321 --> 01:59:06.550
now the audience knows the audience knows the smell it,

2214
01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:08.860
those animals.
You're right.
Those fucking savages.

2215
01:59:09.070 --> 01:59:12.850
Go see Dave Attell this weekend.
People of Phoenix.

2216
01:59:12.851 --> 01:59:15.330
Sorry for clapping about,

2217
01:59:16.100 --> 01:59:19.690
that's the weed and the coffee talking then and watch Dave's old porn

2218
01:59:19.691 --> 01:59:24.691
thursday@eleventhirtyeleventhirtyonshowtimedarn.com.

2219
01:59:25.121 --> 01:59:28.150
Can I be on one?
I'd love for you to do it.
I'm hoping.

2220
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:31.120
I'm hoping there's another season because there's so many great comics who could

2221
01:59:31.121 --> 01:59:34.750
do it and this porn people like are into it.
So it's like,
you know,

2222
01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:38.710
we're just scratching the surface here now.
So it's,
it's great.
And uh,

2223
01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:43.840
for those of you,
like I said,
who support not only Joe and also,
uh,
you know,

2224
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:47.690
just live comedy.
Thank you so much for,
uh,
coming out and helping us.

2225
01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:49.740
We love better.
So thank you.
Yeah.

2226
01:59:49.830 --> 01:59:52.460
If it wasn't for the audience members mean this is the only odd,

2227
01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:54.460
it's the only art form really.
You have to,

2228
01:59:54.461 --> 01:59:57.070
we have an audience in front of a crowd.
You have to,

2229
01:59:57.071 --> 02:00:00.580
it's an interactive art form.
There is no other way I have to write,

2230
02:00:00.581 --> 02:00:03.310
I have to have to sit alone and come up with ideas and stuff,

2231
02:00:03.311 --> 02:00:07.000
but there's no doubt about it that we need the crowd so we can only be as good

2232
02:00:07.001 --> 02:00:10.930
as the crowd.
And you have a great crowd.
I'm still a huge fan of standup comedy.

2233
02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:15.340
I know that you are to it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's fun fucking art form to watch,
man.

2234
02:00:15.341 --> 02:00:18.850
And we're very fortunate that we have with friends like Norton and Bill Burr and

2235
02:00:18.851 --> 02:00:22.330
Nick Depaula and all these I love,
I love watching the new guy,

2236
02:00:22.331 --> 02:00:26.350
like to just build the,
build a bit up there or like find something.
I think it's,

2237
02:00:26.351 --> 02:00:28.780
you know Brendan Walsh,
you know what?
I don't know.

2238
02:00:28.810 --> 02:00:31.510
I don't know these guys as well as I should,
but I've seen like snippets,

2239
02:00:32.410 --> 02:00:35.830
I like just anybody who's like trying to fight the good fight.

2240
02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:38.290
He's exactly fighting the good fight.
That's cool.

2241
02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:40.720
And there's a lot of those guys,
they're coming up now and you know,

2242
02:00:40.721 --> 02:00:44.350
because of podcast,
because of stuff like this,
they have a venue.
They have,

2243
02:00:44.530 --> 02:00:46.790
I mean we,
we let people know about Sam triple.

2244
02:00:46.820 --> 02:00:49.470
You will let people know about Ari Shaffir it.
Yeah.
It's,

2245
02:00:49.471 --> 02:00:52.060
so this is a beautiful thing to be able to do this.
Never,
you know,

2246
02:00:52.061 --> 02:00:53.480
when we were younger we had to,
you know,

2247
02:00:53.590 --> 02:00:57.490
come up with a set and do it somewhere in seven minutes and keep it clean.

2248
02:00:57.491 --> 02:01:02.320
And really this is the real deal and I,
thanks for having me please.

2249
02:01:02.321 --> 02:01:03.040
It's been an honor.

2250
02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:05.590
It's been an honor and we'll figure out a way to do a gig together for sure.

2251
02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:09.130
That's it.
That one does.
Even a guest spot.
I just want to please,

2252
02:01:09.730 --> 02:01:11.360
let's do a big one together,
man.
Fuck.
You.

2253
02:01:11.470 --> 02:01:13.110
See some crazy place like Chicago or something,

2254
02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:15.940
but something like a haunted prison or something that's like when the pot

2255
02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:18.170
[inaudible] house.

2256
02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:23.200
It's play on the stage where Johnny Cash recorded full shitty button down.

2257
02:01:23.530 --> 02:01:26.440
There's so many options out there.
Yes.
Thank you to everybody.

2258
02:01:26.441 --> 02:01:30.670
Thank you to all the people.

2260

2261
02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:39.970
