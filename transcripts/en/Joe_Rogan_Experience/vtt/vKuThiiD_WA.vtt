00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.333
Hypnotize

2
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.730
<v 0>[inaudible] your average tourist cabbage off instinct</v>

3
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.090
Detroit players.

4
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.460
Since those girls never lose,

5
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.580
never choose to do something to us,

6
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.080
talk to us girls,

7
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.600
job hopper and functions like stars and just stick the crash there.

8
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.140
I squeeze three at your cherry

9
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.100
easily recently,

10
00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:48.934
Nigga starting again

11
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.490
<v 1>saying nothing is there.</v>

12
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:53.880
I just speak my piece to keep my piss Cubans with the Jesus keys.

13
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.270
My keys test,

14
00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:55.571
test,

15
00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:56.404
test.

16
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.080
Is that something that someone did actually with Siri?

17
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.250
It's hacks.

18
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.560
This is somebody hacked her iPhone.

19
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.340
You can tell when he opens it and closest is a,

20
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.150
it has a weird,

21
00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:07.490
uh,

22
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.081
I look to it.

23
00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:08.914
So I think somebody just,

24
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.700
you know,

25
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.821
oh,

26
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:10.361
they do that.

27
00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:10.811
They do that.

28
00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:12.340
They root I iPhones as well.

29
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.233
Oh yeah.

30
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.730
I didn't know that people were hacking into I of course,

31
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:18.880
I think there's like websites you can just go to and it's just,

32
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.720
uh,

33
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.531
were you,

34
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:21.130
uh,

35
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.450
what Hell looks hacked about that?

36
00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:23.590
That looks like just the iPhone.

37
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.230
Uh,

38
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.063
when we say that.

39
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

40
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.010
<v 1>Uh,</v>

41
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.670
I guess,

42
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.911
I guess,

43
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:29.200
no,

44
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.120
it looks like I thought the icons on the two top or something,

45
00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:33.190
but that looks like soundcloud.

46
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.030
So yeah,

47
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.240
that looks like a normal iPhone.

48
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.140
Well,

49
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.910
I think that's the only way you could possibly do it.

50
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.170
I think that has to be a Haq di phone or the whole thing is fake because of the

51
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:44.990
whole thing is much more likely fake because there's one thing I noticed at the

52
00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:46.070
very end of this video,

53
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:47.300
which you can find on Vimeo,

54
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.990
uh,

55
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.823
he,

56
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.920
it says something different than she says on the writing here.

57
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.660
So maybe this writing part was just,

58
00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:53.901
you know,

59
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:54.230
an I,

60
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.561
you know,

61
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:55.730
final cut pro or something.

62
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.001
Well,

63
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:56.631
it's a Siri,

64
00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:56.931
Siri,

65
00:01:56.931 --> 00:01:57.261
Siri,

66
00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:58.180
can't you see too,

67
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.490
I mean,

68
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.380
someone typed that in and what is that?

69
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.501
Oh,

70
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:00.601
yeah,

71
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:00.801
yeah.

72
00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:01.634
It's definitely not,

73
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.870
it's definitely not Siri.

74
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.900
They definitely did it either fake the video or they,

75
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.040
they routed their iPhone,

76
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:08.320
but I think it's probably more fake.

77
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.070
That's like a big thing with the android people,

78
00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:10.460
man,

79
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.911
android,

80
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:12.080
that's the one thing that they love about it.

81
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:13.220
The fact that you can do that.

82
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.323
Yeah.

83
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.710
Do to get into Andrew,

84
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:16.544
they're like,

85
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.760
dudes were like really into fucking Unix and shit.

86
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.330
Right.

87
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.750
You know,

88
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.160
like rooting things.

89
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.761
I'm a,

90
00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:25.850
I'm a Linux contributor dude.

91
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:28.100
We forgot to record the video blog again.

92
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.360
Yeah.

93
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.193
We keep forgetting.

94
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.163
Sorry folks.

95
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.310
So he had to go though.

96
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.173
You really did that go.

97
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.000
He he did had to go to,

98
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.140
did have to leave.

99
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.880
That was a fascinating guy though,

100
00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:38.211
wasn't it?

101
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:38.391
Yeah.

102
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.090
That was really interesting and it definitely,

103
00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:42.680
it was a shit that I've already thought about before,

104
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:43.101
you know?

105
00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:46.240
And it's kind of interesting to hear it from somebody that has some credit.

106
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.540
Yeah.

107
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.961
I think,

108
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:48.351
you know,

109
00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:51.710
as you get older in life and you have a certain amount of experiences and you

110
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:52.970
sort of learn

111
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.200
<v 0>okay</v>

112
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.600
<v 1>the way the world's been working for you,</v>

113
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.400
you know,

114
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.940
you start thinking,

115
00:02:58.941 --> 00:02:59.500
I,

116
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.730
if it works like this,

117
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.950
I wonder if this is really what's going on.

118
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.810
And that's basically like every I wonder that I ever had and he just comes out

119
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:08.141
and says,

120
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:09.190
yes it does.

121
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:10.024
Yes.

122
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.590
Your,

123
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.261
your mind,

124
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:12.790
your consciousness controls everything.

125
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:15.220
Your environment controls how the genes are made.

126
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:15.430
Like,

127
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.070
what the fuck,

128
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.911
by the way,

129
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:19.300
dude,

130
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.470
fear factor last night.

131
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.740
It was so great to see it.

132
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.180
Like I forgot how much I missed it.

133
00:03:23.181 --> 00:03:23.300
I,

134
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.491
I,

135
00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:23.650
I,

136
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.860
yeah,

137
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.101
I've,

138
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:25.690
I've watched every single episode,

139
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.980
even till the very end,

140
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:27.791
I watched it.

141
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:28.990
And it wasn't because of you or anything,

142
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:29.291
I just,

143
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:32.710
that was a show that I thought was always fun to Crane Jack and just,

144
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:33.010
you know,

145
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.181
you,

146
00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:33.580
you,

147
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.790
you had more emotion of just sitting there with a blank look staring at a TV.

148
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.480
You're actually like,

149
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.661
like,

150
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:38.110
I'm just like,

151
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.561
Ooh.

152
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:38.831
You know,

153
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:42.070
like if it freaks you out a little bit better than most shows.

154
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.410
So last night it was also awesome seeing it,

155
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:45.440
taking it to the next level.

156
00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:49.120
It's what's the HD I thought was so awesome that you could actually see like the

157
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:49.930
bugs,

158
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.430
intestines and stuff like that,

159
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.150
you know,

160
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.980
in more detail and the explosions.

161
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.270
I'm pretty sure sound editing on that show's awesome.

162
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.720
Bad ass dude.

163
00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:00.640
I watched it was very surreal watching it.

164
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.660
Very surreal.

165
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.500
Yeah.

166
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.550
And you know,

167
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.563
it's just,

168
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.280
it's a strange,

169
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.930
the whole thing was strange.

170
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.450
It was something strange to live it and strange to do it again.

171
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:11.590
It's strange to see it on TV again.

172
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.930
I fucking never thought I would be doing that shogun.

173
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.550
I never thought how could it happen?

174
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:19.680
This is a I just a chapter in my life and I've moved past that now and then to

175
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:20.320
do it again.

176
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.860
But I,

177
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.970
I enjoyed it man.

178
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.690
I really did.

179
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.530
I thought it was fun.

180
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.880
I thought it was a fun fucking show.

181
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.630
Was that,

182
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.890
was that mom and uh,

183
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.730
uh,

184
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.800
the sun thing real.

185
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.210
That's all real disturbing.

186
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.200
Oh yeah.

187
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.351
Well,

188
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:36.280
you know what the casting my boy rich really knows how to fucking bring these

189
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.114
people in.

190
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.700
They know how to pick a man at this point in time too.

191
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:43.540
There's so many people that want to do any sort of a reality show that you could

192
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:46.030
find some real characters and you can find some that,

193
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.980
that one character that the guy that,

194
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.281
uh,

195
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:52.510
that was like a self motivator guy with the hot blonde.

196
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:53.740
She left,

197
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.580
she didn't know how to swim and he just left her drowning like in the middle of

198
00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:58.090
the water.

199
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.280
That was felt bad for that girl.

200
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.611
You know,

201
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:03.100
I felt bad that she didn't know how to swim and she'd tried to do that.

202
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.550
You know,

203
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.821
she like,

204
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:06.280
she wanted to win and she thought maybe once you got in there she should figure

205
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:06.881
out how to do it,

206
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:07.930
but she didn't know how to swim.

207
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.610
That was disturbing at a rescuer.

208
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.340
It's weird.

209
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.520
You guys didn't see it idea.

210
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:13.450
I think they had a plan.

211
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:15.100
I think the plan was he said,

212
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:16.000
I know you don't know how to swim,

213
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:16.780
but I'll carry you.

214
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.230
Right.

215
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.820
I don't think you realize how hard that is to do.

216
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:22.180
It's really hard to do and you swim slow as fuck when you're doing that.

217
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.760
Like you can't just swim when you're carrying someone's body.

218
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.050
It takes a long time.

219
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:27.610
It takes like more than half,

220
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.250
more than twice the time to,

221
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.160
you know,

222
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.130
she was pulling him down and he was panicking so he left her out there.

223
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.240
It's they thinking not,

224
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.410
not being able to swim,

225
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:37.090
that you should not be a grown adult,

226
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:40.090
that that should be like something that they have to teach you in like third

227
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:41.530
grade and you have to pass a test.

228
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.770
She apparently she didn't grow up in the best neighborhood.

229
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.131
You know,

230
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:46.420
she wasn't happy about it.

231
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.980
Obviously grew up in Vegas.

232
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:48.261
Right?

233
00:05:48.261 --> 00:05:49.240
That hot chick.

234
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.800
I Dunno.

235
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.633
They're changing.

236
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.250
She grew up,

237
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.540
she grew up in that Mandalay bay.

238
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.260
She's so high.

239
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:57.530
She was so hot that check.

240
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.433
She was very pretty.

241
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.700
I wonder if she was like his friend and they came on like as a,

242
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:01.990
uh,

243
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.110
like he hired her.

244
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.710
Yeah.

245
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.100
That's,

246
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.400
that seems like it makes more sense.

247
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.631
Yeah,

248
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:06.680
it's very possible.

249
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.960
And then she just agreed to get it.

250
00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:08.181
I mean,

251
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:08.631
why not?

252
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:09.470
Why not just say,

253
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:09.771
you know,

254
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:11.540
say it's my boyfriend and I would do that.

255
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.880
You want to get on couples here fact together we do.

256
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:14.690
We have to be coupled.

257
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.871
Yeah.

258
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:15.500
We'll just pretend.

259
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.860
Okay.

260
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.180
That's why he left her in the water.

261
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:18.740
That makes that 100% sense.

262
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:19.150
Right?

263
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.370
Well,

264
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.551
never.

265
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:23.090
You'd never leave your girl in the water if you thought you were drowning.

266
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.720
You might,

267
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.790
if you thought someone would rescue her,

268
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.020
if you separated,

269
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.010
you might separate,

270
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:29.150
but you would say something.

271
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:29.811
Save her.

272
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:30.920
You would say saver.

273
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.551
You know,

274
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:32.390
that's what I would say.

275
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:32.961
I would say,

276
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:33.201
you know,

277
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:36.170
if I knew that I couldn't rescuer if like if she like first of all,

278
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:39.500
if someone does not swim at all and they're flailing around,

279
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.820
they can drag you under.

280
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.031
Right?

281
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:42.500
You have to get them to relax.

282
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.090
So you have to be fucking good at that.

283
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:45.170
That's not an easy thing to do.

284
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.460
Like when just start kissing them.

285
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:46.671
Right.

286
00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:47.890
And then they get in a couple of fear,

287
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.290
embrace stuck her finger and put it right in the pooper.

288
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.851
Calm him down.

289
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:56.120
Like when you've got a whole good hold over their pooper and especially the

290
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:56.481
thumb,

291
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:58.580
you press the thumb on the coccsyx instead of,

292
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.230
I just want to say toxic six.

293
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.860
And it was also so weird seeing it cause it was all ex boyfriend

294
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.581
ex-girlfriend's,

295
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:07.610
which I thought it was a great idea for casting wise.

296
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.430
But it was weird seeing that like that one guy that where I,

297
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.540
there was a guy in this girl that was like fake boobs or I think she had fake

298
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.160
boobs but like kind of a weird body,

299
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:16.540
you know,

300
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.090
like hot,

301
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.923
older body.

302
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.793
And he,

303
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.550
she,

304
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.960
he just like fucking with her.

305
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.940
Like she controlled the whole relationship.

306
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:26.450
It was weird seeing like why people broke up probably because he,

307
00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:27.280
she was like,

308
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.590
like,

309
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:27.770
you know,

310
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:28.130
he was,

311
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:28.941
yes ma'am.

312
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:29.660
Yes ma'am.

313
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.500
I don't know if you remember that,

314
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:30.700
that,

315
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.580
that guy that,

316
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.600
uh,

317
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.950
like he pretty much took orders from her the whole time during fear factor.

318
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.370
Yes.

319
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.651
Yeah,

320
00:07:37.651 --> 00:07:37.970
totally.

321
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.181
Yeah.

322
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:42.170
So you can kind of see why like the relationships like ended like it was so

323
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:43.004
interesting.

324
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.921
I like it.

325
00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:45.380
It's why they chose those people,

326
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:45.711
you know,

327
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:48.170
they chose them because they knew there would be fascinating to watch.

328
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.471
You know,

329
00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:49.304
it's,

330
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.390
it's weird how my,

331
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.160
how bad some people's relationships are.

332
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.263
It's weird,

333
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.103
you know?

334
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.580
But there was some people that were fun,

335
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.870
like fun relationships,

336
00:07:56.871 --> 00:07:57.681
like the one couple,

337
00:07:57.681 --> 00:07:58.580
they were exes,

338
00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.390
but uh,

339
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.230
now they're just friends.

340
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:01.100
The twilight kid.

341
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:02.600
Here's the deal.

342
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.370
Pretty friendly to team twilight.

343
00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:05.204
That was so funny,

344
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.890
hilarious and hard writer or easy rider,

345
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.980
but they were very nice people.

346
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.120
They're super cool.

347
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:11.973
Yeah,

348
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:12.860
she was gorgeous.

349
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:13.041
Yeah,

350
00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:13.761
she's really pretty.

351
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:15.410
And he was a good looking guy and they were,

352
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.610
they were actually friends.

353
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.360
I mean it was legit is they used to date and they didn't work out and they both

354
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:23.780
have different girlfriends now or boyfriends and their friends.

355
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.460
It was still the healthiest fucking group by far out of any of them.

356
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.770
The other ones like so fucking easy riders.

357
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:32.660
Those guys were fighting like cats and dogs.

358
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.300
And then the other guy you felt sorry for that one dude,

359
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.980
I felt controlled by his wife,

360
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.300
his ex.

361
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:38.901
It was sad,

362
00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:39.261
you know,

363
00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:40.910
and she would say shit and you're just like,

364
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:41.211
oh,

365
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:42.320
hoard dude.

366
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.120
He has to just sit there and eat that.

367
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:44.540
You know,

368
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.950
I couldn't do that with my exes.

369
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.630
I not most of them.

370
00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:49.760
I could sue is you don't want to be in that position.

371
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:50.620
Everyone knows that.

372
00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:54.020
You don't want to be in that disadvantageous position where you are.

373
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.100
You are giving into them all

374
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.700
<v 2>the time.</v>

375
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:56.911
Right.

376
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:57.061
You know,

377
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:57.990
you don't want to be there,

378
00:08:57.991 --> 00:08:58.710
man.

379
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.510
You don't want to be there where they're yelling at you.

380
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:01.560
You don't want to be there that,

381
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:01.830
that,

382
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.030
that position sucks.

383
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.301
Yeah.

384
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:04.500
And that one guy even was like,

385
00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:04.831
you know,

386
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:07.350
like he dropped a cow heart,

387
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:08.184
I think it was,

388
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.160
he dropped the cow heart and uh,

389
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.920
and you could tell that she was blaming him for losing it and then like somebody

390
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:15.210
else dropped it and he goes,

391
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:15.391
yeah,

392
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:15.630
see,

393
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:15.841
look,

394
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:16.680
it was hard to see.

395
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:17.191
It was hard to see,

396
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:17.371
you know,

397
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:18.170
like he,

398
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.631
it was,

399
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:20.440
it was so sad to see that.

400
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.330
Yeah.

401
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:21.901
It's hard.

402
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:23.690
It's hard dealing with people like that.

403
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.391
Not dealing with them.

404
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:24.661
I mean,

405
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:25.320
but you know,

406
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.360
being around them and going,

407
00:09:26.361 --> 00:09:26.491
hey,

408
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:27.690
you guys are just fucking up.

409
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:28.360
He took his life.

410
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.390
You don't need to get the fuck away from her dude.

411
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.770
I know you feel like some,

412
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.150
I know that you've got this connection with her,

413
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.340
right?

414
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:33.670
You know,

415
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.310
you got to see her get your kids from her.

416
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:38.820
But other than that stay away because this woman is chopping you down.

417
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.300
Yeah.

418
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.340
You know what to do.

419
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:43.510
Can't get a chicken anymore.

420
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.860
When a girl is no longer impressed with the guy when the fucking magic is over

421
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:48.900
and she is not attracted to the guy at all,

422
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.350
that is the worst time you can be around that girl cause she will have you

423
00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:55.800
feeling like you are worthless and that will in turn,

424
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.000
it's not going to motivate you.

425
00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:59.580
It's going to make you feel like shit and it's gonna probably ruin all these

426
00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:00.750
other aspects of your life too.

427
00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:04.410
So if you want a regular relationship with someone who treats you like shit and

428
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:06.230
is not whatsoever attracted to,

429
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.580
that's devastating for you as a person.

430
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.530
And so like when we were around this poor guy,

431
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:11.630
we have to see this like,

432
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.770
oh you can't blame her.

433
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:14.970
She knew you like who you like,

434
00:10:14.971 --> 00:10:15.450
man,

435
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.260
but you got to,

436
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:16.561
you know,

437
00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:16.981
for him,

438
00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:18.270
he's got to get the fuck away,

439
00:10:18.271 --> 00:10:19.081
man run.

440
00:10:19.081 --> 00:10:21.930
This is your reality you're creating as Bruce Lipton would tell us,

441
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:22.800
right?

442
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.110
Yeah,

443
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.760
exactly.

444
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.451
Speaking of which,

445
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:24.691
man,

446
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:27.030
I have to apologize to uh,

447
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.170
to Todd bridges.

448
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:28.860
Man,

449
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.420
I fucked up and a,

450
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:32.580
I did this interview and um,

451
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.301
they,

452
00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:33.590
uh,

453
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.810
you know,

454
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.760
they always ask you what was it like the old fear factor.

455
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:37.650
You do a hundred interviews and after awhile he just,

456
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.490
you just run out of shit to talk about and you'll,

457
00:10:40.491 --> 00:10:41.460
you'll talk about anything.

458
00:10:41.461 --> 00:10:42.600
And one of the things that came up,

459
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.800
we were talking about c listers that were on the show and I'm gonna just read it

460
00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:49.500
so there's no mistake whatsoever.

461
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.810
And what I said the question was,

462
00:10:51.811 --> 00:10:52.201
the guy says,

463
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:54.720
I remember it was more c listers and blast from the past,

464
00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:55.740
like Todd bridges.

465
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:56.371
And I said,

466
00:10:56.371 --> 00:10:56.671
yeah,

467
00:10:56.671 --> 00:10:58.320
he was a really weird one.

468
00:10:58.321 --> 00:10:59.340
He's an angry dude.

469
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:00.810
I think he murdered somebody.

470
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.673
Don't go,

471
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.450
did he get away with manslaughter?

472
00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:04.284
I'm serious.

473
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.940
You shouldn't print that.

474
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:06.810
Uh,

475
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.660
because I think it says you shouldn't print it.

476
00:11:09.661 --> 00:11:10.740
Said you should print that.

477
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:11.551
But that's not what I said.

478
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:11.731
I said,

479
00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:14.940
you shouldn't print that because I think he got in some sort of a fight in a

480
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:16.440
crack house and wound up killing someone.

481
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:17.040
Hold on,

482
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.330
let me fact check right now.

483
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:19.980
They actually put the whole thing and me saying,

484
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.540
why bother?

485
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.690
Let me fact check right now.

486
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:22.741
And then I say,

487
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:23.011
yeah.

488
00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:26.430
Todd bridges attempted murder and attempted voluntary manslaughter charges.

489
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.070
He shot somebody five gunshots and a knife wound.

490
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.360
The jury acquitted him though.

491
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.470
That was 1989.

492
00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:32.460
He was 23 years old.

493
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:33.080
Uh,

494
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.511
then I said,

495
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:34.051
but yeah,

496
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:35.430
I didn't enjoy being with him.

497
00:11:35.431 --> 00:11:36.121
He was a weird,

498
00:11:36.121 --> 00:11:36.781
angry guy.

499
00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:37.620
Blamed his,

500
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:37.890
uh,

501
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:42.630
losing on the producers like they wanted to get rid of him.

502
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:43.201
Uh,

503
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:46.050
there's some people who just think that the world is out to get them.

504
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.490
And he felt like that in a big way.

505
00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:49.440
It was interesting from a psychological standpoint.

506
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.580
This is one of the reason why,

507
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:50.881
so this,

508
00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:54.040
he got upset at me when he got eliminated from the show and wouldn't believe

509
00:11:54.041 --> 00:11:55.240
that he was actually eliminated.

510
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:57.340
He believed that they wanted him to get eliminated.

511
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.860
I went to shake his hand and he wouldn't even shake my hand.

512
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.510
He just like put his hands back and walked away.

513
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:01.781
I was like,

514
00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:04.120
this is so fucking childish that thought about,

515
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:04.990
I'm like this poor guy,

516
00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:05.470
man,

517
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:05.621
you know,

518
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:06.910
he grows up in the,

519
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:08.620
in the limelight on a fucking big show.

520
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.530
Like different strokes,

521
00:12:09.531 --> 00:12:12.970
like try developing on television like that.

522
00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.170
We've talked about that so many times,

523
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:17.350
like how insane that must be tried developing on television.

524
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.660
So all I did was comment on him,

525
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.703
like,

526
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:21.311
you know,

527
00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:23.250
like he wasn't a person common Emily,

528
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.040
like I wasn't,

529
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.740
I wasn't concerned with his feelings that he would listen to it.

530
00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:27.730
And despite the fact that,

531
00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:28.180
you know,

532
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.310
he wasn't some sort of a situation to crack house.

533
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:30.611
You know,

534
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:33.460
this was a long time ago and you know,

535
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.310
I don't know him and I just said it and I shouldn't have said it.

536
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.001
It's really,

537
00:12:37.001 --> 00:12:37.360
you know,

538
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.660
even whether it's true or not is not the point.

539
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.400
The point is there's no reason for me to say it.

540
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.390
And he's friends with my friend Dave and my friend Dave and him talked and he

541
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.840
said he's been sober for 19 years and this upset Him and I'm thought about it.

542
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.021
I'm like,

543
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:53.560
who the fuck am I to just randomly bring up some shit about some dudes passed

544
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.210
that's going to make him feel bad.

545
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:55.661
You know,

546
00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:55.960
it's,

547
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.620
it was not,

548
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:56.950
it was,

549
00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.420
there was no reason why I should have done it.

550
00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.410
I did it.

551
00:12:59.410 --> 00:12:59.980
Uh,

552
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:00.250
I was,

553
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.990
it was lazy thinking on my part.

554
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:04.300
I should have never done it and I should have,

555
00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:04.990
you know,

556
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.820
looked at his life as like one picture.

557
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:07.631
I don't know that dude.

558
00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:11.380
And apparently he's been sober for like 19 years and he does a lot of good

559
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:11.681
things.

560
00:13:11.681 --> 00:13:13.000
It does interventions and shit.

561
00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.270
So I opened up my mouth when I shouldn't have and a,

562
00:13:16.271 --> 00:13:17.140
I apologize.

563
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.190
So Todd bridges,

564
00:13:18.191 --> 00:13:18.761
if you're out there,

565
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:19.810
please accept my apology.

566
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.201
I'm sorry,

567
00:13:20.201 --> 00:13:20.861
I shouldn't have said that.

568
00:13:20.861 --> 00:13:21.340
It wasn't he.

569
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.000
He's right.

570
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.140
I totally agree.

571
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.730
I could have totally avoided saying anything about his past or anything about

572
00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:28.570
him as a person.

573
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.690
I get bored sometimes men,

574
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:32.650
and this is no excuse,

575
00:13:32.651 --> 00:13:33.340
but it's true.

576
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:33.581
You know,

577
00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:36.100
he'd do a hundred interviews about fear factor and stuff like that.

578
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:37.690
You can get psychologically lazy,

579
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:38.200
you know,

580
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.980
he gets sloppy with what you say and you as you can see everything I said there

581
00:13:41.981 --> 00:13:45.910
including don't print that which actually says or instead of shouldn't print

582
00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:46.091
that.

583
00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:47.350
It actually says should print that.

584
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:51.040
But I most certainly said shouldn't print that because I went into some sort of

585
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:51.310
a,

586
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.660
I went to fact check that.

587
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.780
So because of that they put every single word I said.

588
00:13:55.781 --> 00:13:56.280
So you've got to,

589
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.800
you get a chance to see my whole thought process on it.

590
00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:01.510
So I don't know what the fuck happened to him.

591
00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:03.640
Obviously I wasn't there and the guy got acquitted.

592
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.270
Good.

593
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.110
That's beautiful.

594
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.681
You know,

595
00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:06.010
um,

596
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:06.670
I don't,

597
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.810
I don't hold any ill will towards him and I feel bad that I brought it up and I

598
00:14:10.811 --> 00:14:11.470
shouldn't have.

599
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.550
So I apologize.

600
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:13.601
You know that,

601
00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:13.841
that,

602
00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:15.620
that the NT and they shouldn't,

603
00:14:15.621 --> 00:14:17.770
it shouldn't is going to be the new tower seven for you

604
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.530
because we're going this way.

605
00:14:20.531 --> 00:14:22.210
I said well I'm a mumble and fuck.

606
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.770
You know you talked to me over the phone,

607
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.740
especially with these goofy headsets that I insist on wearing,

608
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:27.140
you know,

609
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.120
visiting those things I have,

610
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.840
I walk around my house so I like it cause I can talk on the phone and do shit at

611
00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:32.530
the same time.

612
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:33.131
Crew style.

613
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:35.070
But Tom Cruise 1984 yeah.

614
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.820
Actually I've got a cord and the cord goes directly into the cordless phone but

615
00:14:39.821 --> 00:14:41.780
it's the best way to do it because the phone's cordless.

616
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.240
Deponent's Dixon my back pocket.

617
00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:45.040
It's got a little clip and I can walk around the house.

618
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.690
I play pool when I'm on the phone sometimes.

619
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:46.901
Yeah.

620
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:49.810
But that's why radio shack is still in business because of people like you

621
00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:51.980
buying those created from radio shack.

622
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.000
<v 1>You got to get them from hello,</v>

623
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:55.630
direct direct fat.

624
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.121
Hello.

625
00:14:56.121 --> 00:14:59.510
Direct is the best company in the world for business phones.

626
00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.290
Hello?

627
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.561
Yeah.

628
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:05.561
They make a big conference phones and they make a really good headsets that you

629
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:08.450
listen to a cordless phone on where it's like real high end.

630
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.590
It sounds really good,

631
00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:10.340
really strong,

632
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.720
but he's expensive equipment,

633
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.970
but it's expensive because it's really high end stuff.

634
00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:14.804
It's really worth it.

635
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:15.801
But you know,

636
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:17.000
you get any fucking headset,

637
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:17.181
man.

638
00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:19.100
I got a Sony one that was like 30 bucks.

639
00:15:19.101 --> 00:15:20.360
It's pretty good.

640
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.680
It's not bad at all.

641
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.330
You know?

642
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:22.670
You sure?

643
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.920
Hella direct does not like a home shopping network.

644
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.960
Bluetooth accessories?

645
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:27.950
I don't think so.

646
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.090
I think they make cell phone.

647
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:29.331
I mean,

648
00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:31.670
I think they make a phone headsets.

649
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.750
The John Heffron attorney

650
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.373
payments game.

651
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.141
My in denial.

652
00:15:36.141 --> 00:15:39.140
I think that's what that John [inaudible] has never tried to rip us off.

653
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.000
I just want to be clear about that.

654
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.460
He's a great guy and he would never do anything dishonest,

655
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:46.760
but John Hafod occasionally has these fucking plans.

656
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.331
We're like,

657
00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:47.631
dude,

658
00:15:47.631 --> 00:15:49.400
all I have to do is a,

659
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.950
I start this one business and Uganda,

660
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:52.431
you know,

661
00:15:52.431 --> 00:15:55.730
I give them the keys and they have money that comes to me for the rest of my

662
00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:56.360
life.

663
00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:56.631
Dude,

664
00:15:56.631 --> 00:16:00.560
I'm sad like he's got like this sort of like crazy lottery winner,

665
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.260
scam mentality sort of a thing.

666
00:16:03.261 --> 00:16:08.090
As far as like him wanting to like find some one product that really takes off

667
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.640
like what is it like an Anthony Robbins thing?

668
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.900
Cause I know he's into that shit.

669
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:12.621
I don't know.

670
00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:13.490
I don't even know who that is.

671
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:13.910
That is,

672
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.540
you know Anthony Robin says I googled that was it for me.

673
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.760
I don't know if I answered her need that information.

674
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:20.390
I just use Google.

675
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.530
I might know who you never heard of.

676
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:22.310
Tony Robbins.

677
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.420
Tony Robbins.

678
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.890
You know who Tony Robbins is?

679
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:26.070
The motivational speaker guy.

680
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.010
He's fucking gigantic is huge.

681
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.520
No.

682
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.580
Is he like a bublé because I just found out about bublé and now he's haunting

683
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.110
play some bublé guy that sings a lot and and,

684
00:16:35.111 --> 00:16:36.770
and now it like somebody told me,

685
00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:38.030
do you know who Mike Williams?

686
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.170
And then now how do I go?

687
00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:40.790
I tried to buy a bottle of wine last night and was like,

688
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.121
oh,

689
00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:42.950
you just want a free bublé album.

690
00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.110
I don't know who this bublé guy guys,

691
00:16:45.111 --> 00:16:46.460
but it's just a new character,

692
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:47.390
a new dude.

693
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:47.541
I,

694
00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:48.351
it seems like it's not.

695
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:48.491
I,

696
00:16:48.491 --> 00:16:51.290
I got shamed down because I don't know who bublé is.

697
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:52.430
Do you have some music?

698
00:16:52.431 --> 00:16:52.541
No.

699
00:16:52.541 --> 00:16:53.080
You can't even play,

700
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:53.840
I can't play movie.

701
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.320
We don't want to get sued by the latest and greatest bublé but he's haunting me

702
00:16:57.321 --> 00:16:57.920
down the way.

703
00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.300
It's the holiday season or something.

704
00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.590
I have no idea what you're talking about.

705
00:17:00.591 --> 00:17:01.460
I never even heard of this.

706
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:02.750
Well now you will find,

707
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.370
you'll get boob blade nonstop.

708
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.020
You will find bublé everywhere.

709
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:06.860
I don't think I will.

710
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:07.011
Yeah,

711
00:17:07.011 --> 00:17:07.281
you will.

712
00:17:07.281 --> 00:17:07.540
I'm,

713
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.050
I'm guessing in your reality with the poop like,

714
00:17:10.051 --> 00:17:10.191
Hey,

715
00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:11.750
can you can't win over my reality.

716
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.160
I control my own reality.

717
00:17:13.161 --> 00:17:13.701
You can't get in.

718
00:17:13.701 --> 00:17:14.150
Oh yeah,

719
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.290
it's an impenetrable bubble,

720
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:15.620
sir.

721
00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:16.880
You'll find out who to blame me.

722
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.350
You'll be driving some links.

723
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.580
They won't even enter my mind.

724
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.271
I'll look at it.

725
00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:20.931
I'll click on the link.

726
00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:21.201
I'll go,

727
00:17:21.201 --> 00:17:21.381
oh,

728
00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:21.890
it's Brian.

729
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:22.281
I'm sorry.

730
00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:24.380
You just got me to do you think so?

731
00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:25.460
The blade all over your face.

732
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.830
You think so dude,

733
00:17:27.831 --> 00:17:31.130
I all I know is I want to be on the tonight show on Friday with Ron fucking Paul

734
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:31.830
musical guests.

735
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.580
Bublé w you are my God.

736
00:17:33.581 --> 00:17:34.670
But you imagine if it was,

737
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:36.500
I would just pull my pants down.

738
00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:37.383
Shit over.

739
00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:44.030
Blessed diary over Jay's desk.

740
00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:46.910
I've been on the Kale shakes a lot lately,

741
00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:47.150
man.

742
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.330
My,

743
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:48.830
my poop is fantastic.

744
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.280
I love that dude.

745
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.580
<v 3>It can bublé is the new Kale [inaudible] is the new Kale.</v>

746
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:53.771
Yeah.

747
00:17:53.771 --> 00:17:54.331
It's because I,

748
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:54.960
you came with me.

749
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.370
I was going to be to lose olive garden.

750
00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:57.750
I'm going to throw a fucking bottle of water.

751
00:17:57.751 --> 00:17:58.584
I do.

752
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.900
I went to the olive garden the other day and it wasn't that good.

753
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:05.300
What happened?

754
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:05.910
Um,

755
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.740
I tried all their new stuff and it was like,

756
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.281
oh,

757
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:09.150
they're trying to get crafty.

758
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:09.420
No,

759
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:09.510
no,

760
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.140
it's not even that.

761
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.840
It's like I've found that if I eat late at night,

762
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:16.440
so like I always go like at nine o'clock when it closes at 10 and you could tell

763
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.140
the kitchen starts to break down at a certain moment.

764
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.670
I most restaurants like kitchen,

765
00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:20.881
it's like,

766
00:18:20.881 --> 00:18:21.151
all right,

767
00:18:21.151 --> 00:18:22.110
we can start to break down.

768
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:23.970
Meaning you could stop making new soup,

769
00:18:23.971 --> 00:18:25.650
you can start putting everything away,

770
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:25.861
you know,

771
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:27.660
because there's only a few people left,

772
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:27.961
you know,

773
00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:28.794
to order food.

774
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.260
And I feel like lately,

775
00:18:31.261 --> 00:18:33.630
every time I go to a restaurant at that time period,

776
00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:34.201
it's sucks.

777
00:18:34.201 --> 00:18:35.034
And like the,

778
00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.380
the Ravioli I had was like overcooked.

779
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.340
The,

780
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.173
they have like,

781
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.013
uh,

782
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.840
they have lasagna that's deep fried now or something like that.

783
00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:43.680
It's so awesome.

784
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.001
But that was like,

785
00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:46.980
it felt like it was sitting in the Fryer for 20 minutes.

786
00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:47.581
So they probably,

787
00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:47.970
you know,

788
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.620
pre cooked it or something like that.

789
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.230
But don't go to a restaurant after nine o'clock is what I'm saying.

790
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:52.831
Yo,

791
00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:55.810
you'll have not as good as food as tired.

792
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.251
Well,

793
00:18:56.251 --> 00:18:57.084
it's just because they,

794
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.160
they start closing down in the kitchen because it's about to close and people

795
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:01.890
retired.

796
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:02.580
My fault.

797
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:07.260
Don't go to the olive garden after nine o'clock to 6:00 PM sort of a meal.

798
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:12.360
I'm on the road lunch without any restaurant.

799
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:12.871
Just what I'm saying?

800
00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:13.170
No,

801
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.010
not just all of garden.

802
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.083
Any restaurant.

803
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:15.720
Godsey

804
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.190
<v 2>dinner with Anthony Bourdain.</v>

805
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.940
Oh really?

806
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.420
Yeah,

807
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.253
in Toronto.

808
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.603
Where'd you go?

809
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:21.510
Some restaurant,

810
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.241
some nice place.

811
00:19:22.241 --> 00:19:22.741
It was pretty cool.

812
00:19:22.741 --> 00:19:24.810
We got there when it was about to close and,

813
00:19:24.811 --> 00:19:25.021
uh,

814
00:19:25.021 --> 00:19:27.300
they had a bar and we sat in the bar area and they said,

815
00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:27.570
uh,

816
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:27.781
you know,

817
00:19:27.781 --> 00:19:28.850
the regular menus close,

818
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:29.730
but we've got this menu.

819
00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:30.480
And I said,

820
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:30.810
um,

821
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.790
can you tell the chef that Anthony Bordain is here?

822
00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.420
That's why I said you dropped that burden to totally ditch cause she didn't,

823
00:19:36.421 --> 00:19:37.254
I don't think she knew.

824
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:37.921
She,

825
00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:38.190
uh,

826
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.250
so she ran back and the chefs came back with a book and he fucking sign their

827
00:19:41.251 --> 00:19:41.941
book and Shit.

828
00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:44.130
It was the coolest meal ever.

829
00:19:44.131 --> 00:19:46.640
Me and my pal Anthony Giordano and uh,

830
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.060
Anthony and his crazy wife,

831
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.320
his wife wants to fight.

832
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:50.581
She was like,

833
00:19:50.581 --> 00:19:52.440
could you imagine his wife is a bad ass dude?

834
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.080
She's been doing Jujitsu and Moitai for like four years.

835
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.130
Completely upset.

836
00:19:56.131 --> 00:19:58.080
She doesn't every day one in the morning,

837
00:19:58.081 --> 00:19:58.800
one at night.

838
00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.011
I mean,

839
00:19:59.011 --> 00:19:59.580
she's like,

840
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.640
she's got a thick neck and she's got fucking muscular arms and apparently she's

841
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:03.301
like super,

842
00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:04.170
super aggressive.

843
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:04.771
I'm like,

844
00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:05.041
wow,

845
00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:05.351
what a,

846
00:20:05.351 --> 00:20:07.470
what a strange situation that would be,

847
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.960
have a wife that might be able to kick your ass.

848
00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:11.760
Man might be able to put a beat.

849
00:20:11.761 --> 00:20:12.550
Nothing you do.

850
00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:16.440
You think you could deal with that now you don't think that you deal with that

851
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.730
now what if you checked,

852
00:20:18.731 --> 00:20:21.810
just started getting into Jujitsu and fucking one of them and then eventually

853
00:20:21.811 --> 00:20:22.730
wanted to roll with you?

854
00:20:22.731 --> 00:20:22.841
Uh,

855
00:20:22.841 --> 00:20:23.674
come on bitch.

856
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.613
Come on.

857
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:25.970
What if you were fucking her?

858
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.300
And then in the middle she's like,

859
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:28.050
eat my pussy.

860
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.240
And right when you go down on and she slapped a triangle on you,

861
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.440
it just puts you to sleep.

862
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.940
Could you imagine if that was like fun fire is,

863
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:34.621
where's your leg?

864
00:20:34.621 --> 00:20:35.480
You tried to get off the bed,

865
00:20:35.481 --> 00:20:36.280
he hooks your leg.

866
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.280
Ohm just slaps that sucker down now he wouldn't be into that.

867
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.910
No.

868
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.990
Would that scare the shit out of you know what if she was laughing at it and

869
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.870
when she said,

870
00:20:45.871 --> 00:20:46.171
listen,

871
00:20:46.171 --> 00:20:48.010
I promise I'll blow every day for

872
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.790
<v 1>a year.</v>

873
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.810
Cause I was like nothing.

874
00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:50.081
And it's like,

875
00:20:50.081 --> 00:20:50.291
hey,

876
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:50.670
you want some,

877
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:51.410
oh sorry.

878
00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:52.280
Shuffle and Nichols.

879
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.200
I shouldn't have taking your soul.

880
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:56.711
I should.

881
00:20:56.711 --> 00:20:58.120
They choked you unconscious.

882
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.930
Have you always terrified every time you near me now you have to switch the word

883
00:21:01.931 --> 00:21:02.491
blow jobs.

884
00:21:02.491 --> 00:21:03.550
He has to switch it with something else.

885
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:04.261
Blue top me.

886
00:21:04.261 --> 00:21:05.094
It's an often doing.

887
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.070
Really.

888
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.910
What would she have to do?

889
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:07.863
Give you money?

890
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.903
No,

891
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:09.770
I don't know.

892
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:09.950
Pimp.

893
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:10.900
We go out in the street for you,

894
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.110
show you so that she really loves you cuddle during a movie.

895
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.220
That's all you want.

896
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:15.750
Right?

897
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.380
That's why you want back rubs,

898
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:17.771
you know,

899
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:18.604
massage.

900
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.140
Fucking Weirdo.

901
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:21.240
Did you see?

902
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:21.551
Oh wait,

903
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:22.570
I think you posted it,

904
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.231
uh,

905
00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:23.531
that,

906
00:21:23.531 --> 00:21:25.950
that Christmas short that was supposed to be in front of uh,

907
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:26.780
yeah,

908
00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.613
they built dying.

909
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.330
His holiday special last night was so freaky.

910
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.770
If you DVR,

911
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.270
no reservations,

912
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.560
DVR and checkout the,

913
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:37.190
the or,

914
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.510
or,

915
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.111
or find it,

916
00:21:38.111 --> 00:21:38.251
you know,

917
00:21:38.251 --> 00:21:38.430
you know,

918
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.870
dvrs or you can search it will probably play in a repeat.

919
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:43.600
I think the travel network place it all the time because sometimes I like,

920
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.070
I have it set to record all of them,

921
00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:47.140
my DVR and I'll come home and they'd be like 20 of them.

922
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.700
I've been gone for like a week,

923
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.590
like how the fuck is or 20 of these things on here.

924
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.020
But it's just like they play the shit out of their show.

925
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.000
So if you find the holiday one,

926
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.260
it's crazy.

927
00:21:56.261 --> 00:21:57.190
It's so weird.

928
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:58.151
It's a really,

929
00:21:58.151 --> 00:21:58.910
he told me about,

930
00:21:58.910 --> 00:21:59.860
he told me he's going to be nutty,

931
00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:01.090
but I didn't know what to expect.

932
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.440
I don't want to tell you anything.

933
00:22:02.441 --> 00:22:02.710
No,

934
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:03.550
no spoilers.

935
00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:04.151
You gotta see it.

936
00:22:04.151 --> 00:22:05.140
It's so bizarre,

937
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.520
but awesome.

938
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:08.310
Like it was like,

939
00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:09.160
yeah,

940
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:09.701
you didn't,

941
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:10.570
it came out of nowhere.

942
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:11.120
And that,

943
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.200
that this animation that they pulled from the show,

944
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.760
apparently this is like,

945
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:16.683
did you watch it?

946
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:17.280
No.

947
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:17.600
No.

948
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.433
It was creepy.

949
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:19.120
No,

950
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.260
I can see why they pulled it.

951
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.031
It was a,

952
00:22:21.031 --> 00:22:21.970
it was creepy.

953
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:22.490
It was,

954
00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:23.410
it was almost maybe,

955
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:27.550
I think a viral marketing attempt for that travel channel and the whole thing.

956
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.410
Now,

957
00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:29.141
how does that work?

958
00:22:29.141 --> 00:22:30.610
Can we play that on the podcast?

959
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.533
Uh,

960
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.010
yeah.

961
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.590
Are we sure somebody must own that?

962
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.010
No,

963
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:36.820
no.

964
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:37.653
I don't know.

965
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.790
I'm sure we can play the Siri thing at the beginning,

966
00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:40.720
but you know it's,

967
00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:40.961
yeah,

968
00:22:40.961 --> 00:22:41.761
but someone doesn't know.

969
00:22:41.761 --> 00:22:42.100
Nah,

970
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.630
that's just a stupid computer voice.

971
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:44.470
If anything,

972
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:48.180
the people who won't go the song anymore,

973
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.821
who knows?

974
00:22:48.821 --> 00:22:49.061
You know,

975
00:22:49.061 --> 00:22:49.341
is it,

976
00:22:49.341 --> 00:22:53.290
is it illegal for me to post random movies in the background on the law?

977
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:54.191
You know,

978
00:22:54.191 --> 00:22:56.190
if it was one inch of it,

979
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:57.400
don't talk about that.

980
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.233
She knows though.

981
00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:58.650
You know,

982
00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.483
talk about that shit.

983
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:00.740
You gotta bring that up.

984
00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.770
It's like [inaudible] don't talk about it.

985
00:23:02.771 --> 00:23:03.101
He'll come.

986
00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:03.611
It's like candy,

987
00:23:03.611 --> 00:23:04.300
man.

988
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.160
I'm not allowed to drive Gary Coleman and my,

989
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:07.923
no,

990
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:08.381
no,

991
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:09.214
you're not.

992
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.031
Yeah.

993
00:23:10.031 --> 00:23:11.830
That's how you know how fucked up that show was.

994
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:12.820
Two of them are dead.

995
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.590
I love that show.

996
00:23:14.591 --> 00:23:15.280
And that's when they shows.

997
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.290
I grew up in and I love everything about that show.

998
00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.693
Yeah,

999
00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.080
I need another,

1000
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.940
it's so weird watching TV nowadays.

1001
00:23:21.941 --> 00:23:24.190
They don't have that anymore because that's not like,

1002
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:24.821
who cares?

1003
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:24.980
Oh,

1004
00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:25.180
you're,

1005
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:25.510
you're,

1006
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.130
you have a little black kid that you adopted so you know,

1007
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:28.983
who cares?

1008
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.930
Why is it like a little Air Rakhi kid?

1009
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.141
Oh,

1010
00:23:32.141 --> 00:23:37.120
you got an Iraqi kid to Iraqi kids and you're an old man could up mash if that

1011
00:23:37.121 --> 00:23:38.730
was a fucking calm.

1012
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:40.450
Jesus Christ.

1013
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:42.760
You can't have those kinds of sitcoms anymore.

1014
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.121
You know,

1015
00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:45.500
you could never have a Sanford and son anymore.

1016
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.951
You know?

1017
00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:46.130
So

1018
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.700
<v 2>if you have,</v>

1019
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.400
if you had anything that was like Sam,

1020
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:49.790
I racist like an all in the family.

1021
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:50.120
Right.

1022
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.140
He couldn't have that today.

1023
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.580
So how are you going to have,

1024
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.100
you know what you'd miss out on 80% of the jokes,

1025
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:55.400
right?

1026
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.380
You had some guy with two little Arab kids,

1027
00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:58.910
bublé and Abdul.

1028
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.380
That's what be the name of the whole thing.

1029
00:24:00.381 --> 00:24:02.960
It'd be like the blade with to Iraqi kids.

1030
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:03.740
Stop.

1031
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.000
Stop all in the podcast.

1032
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:05.834
I swear to God,

1033
00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.140
you know,

1034
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.440
bringing me in to you retarded world and your boob lay road.

1035
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:10.853
It can be.

1036
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.410
So let's talk about this mind book thing,

1037
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:12.621
man.

1038
00:24:12.621 --> 00:24:13.970
If these guys wanted us to talk about,

1039
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:14.560
yeah,

1040
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.081
when they left,

1041
00:24:15.081 --> 00:24:15.501
they have a,

1042
00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:17.450
a social networking site they put together,

1043
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.190
these are the people that just left,

1044
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:19.840
um,

1045
00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.840
that were with Mr Lipton and it's called www dot mine book dot dub w s so

1046
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.610
there's mine book.

1047
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.080
Dot.

1048
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:29.630
Ws.

1049
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:31.160
Why didn't I say www?

1050
00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.500
What am I a fucking moron?

1051
00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:37.980
Like people don't know that just by http colon backslash

1052
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:42.501
backslash thing.

1053
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:42.740
What?

1054
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.573
Who Cares?

1055
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:44.390
It's like,

1056
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:45.300
it's forward slows.

1057
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:45.711
That's like,

1058
00:24:45.711 --> 00:24:46.890
it's spelled checking me out.

1059
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.840
It's weird that,

1060
00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:48.890
that it's better.

1061
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.510
But that's the same protocol.

1062
00:24:50.511 --> 00:24:52.280
Lizzy's little simple numbers.

1063
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.500
How long is it going to be before?

1064
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.300
It's just say write the word and you know,

1065
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.830
and go right to it.

1066
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.833
Yeah.

1067
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.680
Http dot doc.

1068
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.250
I mean if you write cnn.com you don't have to write all that other shit.

1069
00:25:04.251 --> 00:25:05.300
Your browser does it for you.

1070
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:06.800
So why do we have to say that?

1071
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.873
Why don't we have to know?

1072
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.920
I don't know,

1073
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.430
but let me,

1074
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.330
let me put it in the word and what's ws really stand for website.

1075
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.610
Apparently they said it probably something funky country and you know,

1076
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.380
probably some weird country like,

1077
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.530
like a lot of uh,

1078
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.920
like TV was like Transylvania or some shit,

1079
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.491
you know,

1080
00:25:22.491 --> 00:25:23.300
people,

1081
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.110
people uh,

1082
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.600
got TV but it wasn't television.

1083
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:30.020
TV stood for an abbreviation of some sort of a country.

1084
00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:31.443
Yeah.

1085
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:32.450
People got that at that.

1086
00:25:32.451 --> 00:25:33.500
A Internet address,

1087
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:34.191
you know,

1088
00:25:34.191 --> 00:25:34.851
you're allowed to.

1089
00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:36.440
So I guess you're allowed to get this ws,

1090
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.363
whatever it is.

1091
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.940
It's probably like some weird country somewhere.

1092
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.160
I wonder when it will go bad.

1093
00:25:43.161 --> 00:25:46.880
So we don't leave people in fucking in the dark here.

1094
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.030
Let me find out what the hell this is the s domain.

1095
00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.161
But yeah,

1096
00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:52.431
mine,

1097
00:25:52.431 --> 00:25:52.761
by the way,

1098
00:25:52.761 --> 00:25:54.010
I'm going Ballz on

1099
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.050
why he's just from watching yourself.

1100
00:25:57.051 --> 00:25:59.810
Money for your factor or that too.

1101
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.370
Yeah.

1102
00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:00.650
That,

1103
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:01.483
that,

1104
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.800
that man to wash myself in high definition.

1105
00:26:03.801 --> 00:26:03.951
Like,

1106
00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:04.251
man,

1107
00:26:04.251 --> 00:26:04.401
man,

1108
00:26:04.401 --> 00:26:05.234
I'm going bald.

1109
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:05.511
Well.

1110
00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:07.070
What's weird is when they showed like,

1111
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.550
like at the beginning because they have this my shaggy young hair,

1112
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.450
I don't like the new opening.

1113
00:26:11.451 --> 00:26:12.600
And is that just temporary?

1114
00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.020
It's to go

1115
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.510
your internist dress.

1116
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.100
Okay.

1117
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.510
The website dot w s story.

1118
00:26:20.511 --> 00:26:20.751
Okay.

1119
00:26:20.751 --> 00:26:25.430
Here it has a ws story but it's weird to see your fucking so much scalp.

1120
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:26.150
What the new,

1121
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.380
it's weird on the opening.

1122
00:26:27.381 --> 00:26:30.860
They should like the young you and then they showed the old order you and it's

1123
00:26:30.861 --> 00:26:31.970
like night and day difference.

1124
00:26:31.971 --> 00:26:33.830
How that you've really transformed you look,

1125
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.960
you look bigger like media now.

1126
00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.360
While I didn't lift weights at all,

1127
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:38.470
when I first started doing the show,

1128
00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:43.620
I got into really lifting weights probably around like 2001 or two which is

1129
00:26:43.621 --> 00:26:46.350
right when fear factor just started because that's when I really got into

1130
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:47.090
Jujitsu.

1131
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:48.930
Right before that I had a problem with my knee.

1132
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:52.080
I had what's called a bucket handle tear and a it was,

1133
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:55.500
it was real bad and it was from years ago and what it would happen was it at

1134
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:59.970
least once every couple of weeks I would be doing something strenuous.

1135
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:00.690
Anything strenuous,

1136
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.180
my knee would pop out and lock in place.

1137
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:07.860
So what it is is the meniscus would lift up like a bucket handle and get stuck.

1138
00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.840
It is fucking horrendous man.

1139
00:27:09.841 --> 00:27:13.350
It was a real pain in the ass and it took me a long time before I ever got it

1140
00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:14.100
fixed.

1141
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.910
And then I finally did get it fixed and then I was able to like really train

1142
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.320
hard again because,

1143
00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:21.390
but until that I would do something like I would lift weights,

1144
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.690
I would bend over to tie my shoe and it would pop out and I would fall to the

1145
00:27:24.691 --> 00:27:27.020
ground and my leg would be like locked out in,

1146
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:27.720
in a fund.

1147
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.370
And then it was fuck for hours dude.

1148
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.020
And then it was sore for weeks,

1149
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:31.470
you know?

1150
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.120
And then I would get like a couple of weeks later,

1151
00:27:33.121 --> 00:27:35.190
I get to the point where I'll go home and just wear a brace,

1152
00:27:35.191 --> 00:27:36.450
go back to class,

1153
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:37.050
boom.

1154
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:37.950
It would pop again.

1155
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.020
And the one time I took it really bad,

1156
00:27:40.021 --> 00:27:43.110
it popped in tour so bad that I could not bend my leg.

1157
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.870
So Eddie had to take me to the hospital and uh,

1158
00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:49.320
we went and had to do an Mri on it and they gave me anti-inflammatories and they

1159
00:27:49.321 --> 00:27:51.570
eventually they shaved it down and the lady was like,

1160
00:27:51.571 --> 00:27:51.751
you know,

1161
00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:53.250
you need to stop doing martial arts.

1162
00:27:53.251 --> 00:27:53.341
You know,

1163
00:27:53.341 --> 00:27:54.390
like they were like really like,

1164
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.190
like judgmental about that shit.

1165
00:27:56.191 --> 00:27:57.090
The lady like cornered me,

1166
00:27:57.091 --> 00:27:57.480
listen,

1167
00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.730
I'm telling you right now you need to stop doing this stuff.

1168
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.260
So I got that fixed and then I started working out like that's when I really got

1169
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:07.170
into like seriously lifting and you're like crazy.

1170
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:07.710
Like,

1171
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:08.550
like on Twitter,

1172
00:28:08.551 --> 00:28:10.710
I'd so some people say usually damn Joe,

1173
00:28:10.711 --> 00:28:14.640
Roman got fat and so I definitely am fatter.

1174
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.020
This is the right.

1175
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.060
Will you ever do an episode with no shirt on the whole time?

1176
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.291
Well,

1177
00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:21.000
people think I'm fatter than I am for sure,

1178
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.510
but I'm definitely fatter than I used to be because when I used to fight,

1179
00:28:24.511 --> 00:28:24.781
you know,

1180
00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:25.111
when I was,

1181
00:28:25.111 --> 00:28:26.640
when I first started doing like news radio,

1182
00:28:26.641 --> 00:28:27.960
I was in like fighting shape.

1183
00:28:27.961 --> 00:28:28.350
I was,

1184
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.360
I was in really good shape and I had like a very thin face and my,

1185
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.710
my whole body fat was like way lower than it is now.

1186
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.850
I can like pinch fat on it and unfortunately that makes me have a big fat face.

1187
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:39.961
It's so funny though,

1188
00:28:39.961 --> 00:28:41.550
when every time somebody says that I'm like,

1189
00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.650
you're well,

1190
00:28:42.651 --> 00:28:43.920
I'm not really fat.

1191
00:28:43.921 --> 00:28:44.101
I mean,

1192
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:45.120
if you saw me with my shirt off,

1193
00:28:45.121 --> 00:28:46.140
you wouldn't say that guy's fat.

1194
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:46.321
No,

1195
00:28:46.321 --> 00:28:46.630
wait,

1196
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:47.610
I'm not fat.

1197
00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:47.911
Like I,

1198
00:28:47.911 --> 00:28:48.540
I'm not thin.

1199
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.171
Like I used to be.

1200
00:28:49.171 --> 00:28:51.120
I used to be shredded when I was,

1201
00:28:51.121 --> 00:28:53.670
when I was constantly doing taekwondo and kickboxing and everything.

1202
00:28:53.671 --> 00:28:54.840
I had like five,

1203
00:28:54.841 --> 00:28:56.460
6% body fat all the time,

1204
00:28:56.461 --> 00:28:57.810
especially when I was going to compete.

1205
00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:58.531
And then,

1206
00:28:58.531 --> 00:28:58.921
you know,

1207
00:28:58.921 --> 00:29:03.270
it never got really heavier than that until I got deep into my thirties when I

1208
00:29:03.271 --> 00:29:05.520
was like working all the time and eating shit food,

1209
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:05.911
you know,

1210
00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:06.900
like after I did that,

1211
00:29:06.901 --> 00:29:07.460
um,

1212
00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:08.970
that men's fitness cover,

1213
00:29:08.971 --> 00:29:09.804
I was in a cover.

1214
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.910
That's why I got those.

1215
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:12.690
That was like the best shape I've ever got in.

1216
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.190
And I just got lazy after that.

1217
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.440
I didn't really lift weights at all anymore.

1218
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.230
I was the today show did,

1219
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:18.501
we didn't,

1220
00:29:18.501 --> 00:29:20.010
haven't talked about that you were on the today show.

1221
00:29:20.011 --> 00:29:21.420
I didn't even get to see some interesting,

1222
00:29:21.421 --> 00:29:22.240
you know,

1223
00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:22.951
it was weird.

1224
00:29:22.951 --> 00:29:23.101
You know,

1225
00:29:23.101 --> 00:29:26.790
they do it outside and this little plaza they do part of it and the plaza,

1226
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:28.070
so Al Roker and I'm,

1227
00:29:28.071 --> 00:29:28.441
I'm sorry,

1228
00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:29.660
I don't remember the other two people.

1229
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:30.810
I don't remember the name.

1230
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:31.883
I apologize.

1231
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:33.240
It's Jane Pauley.

1232
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.270
Is it Jane Paul?

1233
00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:34.980
No,

1234
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:35.940
I forgot their names,

1235
00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:36.960
but they're very cool people.

1236
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:37.560
Um,

1237
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.170
and they're very tall and it looked like a little tiny person out there.

1238
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:41.830
Um,

1239
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:42.150
and it's,

1240
00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.020
so we're out there in the cold and they say,

1241
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:44.231
hey,

1242
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:45.400
fear factors coming back.

1243
00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:45.821
Yeah.

1244
00:29:45.821 --> 00:29:46.211
Yay.

1245
00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:46.811
And it's gone.

1246
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:47.770
It's like it's over and done.

1247
00:29:47.771 --> 00:29:48.071
And like,

1248
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:48.640
you know,

1249
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.440
Al Roker cracks a joke and that's a wrap.

1250
00:29:50.441 --> 00:29:51.730
Did you smoke weed with Al Roker?

1251
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.630
Did I wish I did?

1252
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.990
I would love to come into my outlook is very friendly.

1253
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.760
He's a very nice guy.

1254
00:29:57.761 --> 00:29:58.500
He's very friendly.

1255
00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.890
We see has been every time I met him,

1256
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:00.850
he's a very nice guy.

1257
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:01.541
We is.

1258
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:03.760
Matt lost a shit load of weight too man.

1259
00:30:03.761 --> 00:30:05.050
There's a guy who lost a lot of weight.

1260
00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.830
There's go who recognized that he had like some sort of a problem with his diet

1261
00:30:08.831 --> 00:30:09.251
and you know,

1262
00:30:09.251 --> 00:30:11.290
live in his life that way and just straighten it out.

1263
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.540
Well he did the w the lap band thing.

1264
00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:13.810
Right?

1265
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:14.320
Did he do that?

1266
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:14.560
Yeah,

1267
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.170
I think that's what he did and I think that he was successful at it.

1268
00:30:17.171 --> 00:30:17.381
You know,

1269
00:30:17.381 --> 00:30:17.770
we,

1270
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:20.070
we know many people that have had it but they just ate,

1271
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.033
started going eating.

1272
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.031
I don't know about many,

1273
00:30:22.031 --> 00:30:25.300
but we know about one who just keeps breaking those fucking things,

1274
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.740
which is so scary.

1275
00:30:26.741 --> 00:30:27.131
You know,

1276
00:30:27.131 --> 00:30:30.420
the fact that he's just pumping food in there and snapping that cord.

1277
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:31.840
I don't know what a lap,

1278
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.710
I don't know how it works.

1279
00:30:32.711 --> 00:30:33.490
Do you understand how it works?

1280
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.140
I think they just tie off your song stomach,

1281
00:30:35.141 --> 00:30:35.451
don't they?

1282
00:30:35.451 --> 00:30:38.500
That that can make it smaller and then your stomach does grow.

1283
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.961
You know,

1284
00:30:38.961 --> 00:30:41.620
if you start eating pack and barbecue into that hole,

1285
00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:43.320
that not trying to break it open.

1286
00:30:43.321 --> 00:30:45.630
Why did you say barbecue barbecue would be delicious right now?

1287
00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:49.080
But anyway,

1288
00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:49.510
yeah.

1289
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.870
Um,

1290
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:51.040
this guy actually had it done,

1291
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.340
which is really funny because all it does is like gets you to not eat as much.

1292
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:55.960
Like you could just do that on your own.

1293
00:30:55.961 --> 00:30:57.010
You don't have to get cut open.

1294
00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:57.940
But people like,

1295
00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:58.270
they,

1296
00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.930
they trust their will so little that they would rather get cut open,

1297
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:03.940
you know?

1298
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:04.511
Fuck that.

1299
00:31:04.511 --> 00:31:05.344
That's craziness.

1300
00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:06.853
That's amazing.

1301
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:07.871
It's amazing.

1302
00:31:07.871 --> 00:31:08.704
It's amazing.

1303
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:09.430
You know,

1304
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.701
I mean,

1305
00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:12.430
I can understand that when you're like on death's door and you know,

1306
00:31:12.431 --> 00:31:13.860
like I got to do something or I,

1307
00:31:13.861 --> 00:31:15.220
I'm obviously out of control,

1308
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:15.701
man.

1309
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:17.110
I don't know if that's the thing to do.

1310
00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:19.840
I think you should look at yourself somehow,

1311
00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:20.351
you know,

1312
00:31:20.351 --> 00:31:21.310
whether it's uh,

1313
00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:24.070
some sort of a psychedelic experience or you know,

1314
00:31:24.071 --> 00:31:25.570
read books and get inspired,

1315
00:31:25.571 --> 00:31:26.710
be around positive people,

1316
00:31:26.711 --> 00:31:30.880
I think that's probably the better option that's going to make a real change in

1317
00:31:30.881 --> 00:31:31.630
your life.

1318
00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:33.040
Because having an operation,

1319
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:35.410
even though it's like it pushes you into a certain direction,

1320
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:35.561
like,

1321
00:31:35.561 --> 00:31:35.801
okay,

1322
00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:36.970
now we're moving positive,

1323
00:31:36.971 --> 00:31:38.110
we're getting less food,

1324
00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:39.180
we're going to lose some way.

1325
00:31:39.181 --> 00:31:40.450
You're going to put less pressure on the heart.

1326
00:31:40.451 --> 00:31:41.284
This is all good.

1327
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.500
Even though that it's not being done necessarily by you,

1328
00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.970
it's forcing you to do that.

1329
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.450
And whenever you force yourself to do something instead of learning and adapting

1330
00:31:49.451 --> 00:31:52.750
your behavior naturally and then having that behavior eventually through

1331
00:31:52.751 --> 00:31:54.910
positive reinforcement become the norm,

1332
00:31:54.911 --> 00:31:55.900
this is your normal behavior.

1333
00:31:55.901 --> 00:31:57.940
Now I actually like to eat greens.

1334
00:31:57.941 --> 00:31:59.710
I like to eat a Kale shake in the morning.

1335
00:31:59.711 --> 00:32:00.610
I like to be healthy,

1336
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:01.241
you know?

1337
00:32:01.241 --> 00:32:02.560
So until that,

1338
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.670
until that takes place,

1339
00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.950
you're just going to repeat the same fucking patterns,

1340
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.431
you know?

1341
00:32:06.431 --> 00:32:08.530
And that's what our friend who keeps blowing his shit out.

1342
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:09.603
You know,

1343
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:10.960
the issue is not the,

1344
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.370
this whole,

1345
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:12.801
you know,

1346
00:32:12.801 --> 00:32:13.600
and how to stuff it.

1347
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.100
It's why do you want to stuff it all the time?

1348
00:32:15.101 --> 00:32:15.701
Like this man,

1349
00:32:15.701 --> 00:32:18.100
what the fuck is going on physiologically?

1350
00:32:18.101 --> 00:32:19.850
Psychologically I'm,

1351
00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.930
I mean I'm not against doing whatever the fuck you feel like you need to do to

1352
00:32:22.931 --> 00:32:23.770
get yourself healthy.

1353
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:24.071
You know,

1354
00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:24.970
you want to do a lap band.

1355
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.140
I,

1356
00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.740
I totally think you should be able to do it,

1357
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.870
but I think if I was your friend,

1358
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.411
you know,

1359
00:32:29.411 --> 00:32:30.520
it's a let's not,

1360
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.690
let's not be crazy.

1361
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:32.950
Joey Diaz wouldn't do it.

1362
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.090
That's why Julia wouldn't do it.

1363
00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.600
Joey was like to cut and he,

1364
00:32:35.601 --> 00:32:36.311
once they cut you,

1365
00:32:36.311 --> 00:32:37.480
they cut you open dog.

1366
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.560
Come on.

1367
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.291
You telling me that,

1368
00:32:39.291 --> 00:32:39.621
that um,

1369
00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:41.120
that week I need to do that.

1370
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:43.280
So Julie lost like 80 fucking pounds,

1371
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.090
you know?

1372
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.320
Did he lose something crazy like that?

1373
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.730
He did at one point.

1374
00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:47.421
You did too.

1375
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:48.830
You lost a shit load of weight,

1376
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:49.590
Dude.

1377
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.990
How,

1378
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:51.380
how heavy did you get at one point?

1379
00:32:51.381 --> 00:32:52.370
What's the heaviest you've ever got?

1380
00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:53.204
I think it was like,

1381
00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:53.600
like two,

1382
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:53.860
four.

1383
00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:54.930
I can't spend so loud.

1384
00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.970
It's like two 45 to 50 or something like that.

1385
00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:57.950
Why wasn't it?

1386
00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.120
And then I got down to,

1387
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.560
I know like the lowest I got down.

1388
00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:04.700
I think it was like one 69 one 75 somewhere around in your head looked really

1389
00:33:04.701 --> 00:33:05.180
big.

1390
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:05.770
Yeah.

1391
00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:06.080
Right?

1392
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:06.351
Yeah.

1393
00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:06.651
Funny.

1394
00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:07.311
I looked weird.

1395
00:33:07.311 --> 00:33:08.550
I looked like Carlos Garcia.

1396
00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.470
It looks well.

1397
00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:09.631
No,

1398
00:33:09.631 --> 00:33:10.670
he looks better than you left.

1399
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.533
I'm going to be honest.

1400
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:12.231
When you,

1401
00:33:12.231 --> 00:33:13.340
when you gained weight,

1402
00:33:13.341 --> 00:33:16.160
it's a weird thing like your head gets big too.

1403
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:17.390
You know when you like,

1404
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.760
even if like you gained weight through like muscle lifting,

1405
00:33:19.761 --> 00:33:22.670
you know like guys to like gain a shit load of weight for like power lifting and

1406
00:33:22.671 --> 00:33:22.960
stuff.

1407
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.210
Right.

1408
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.170
It's a not on the sauce.

1409
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.790
The fucking heads get bigger man.

1410
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:31.930
Like I have a friend who's really big when you show him this three d that's

1411
00:33:32.781 --> 00:33:33.614
pretty dope.

1412
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:34.580
Whoa.

1413
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.040
That's a three d that you don't have to wear glasses for.

1414
00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.031
Holy Shit.

1415
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:39.800
This Nintendo ds is bad ass.

1416
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.980
I have a friend who is about 300 320 pounds and his fucking head is enormous.

1417
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:47.360
And I look at his head and I go,

1418
00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:47.691
okay,

1419
00:33:47.691 --> 00:33:49.130
even if he lost all the weight,

1420
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:50.840
how did his head get this so big?

1421
00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:54.410
Did his head grow because it's his body was so fat.

1422
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.921
You're like,

1423
00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:55.131
what?

1424
00:33:55.131 --> 00:33:56.990
What is it that made his head grow too?

1425
00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.050
You know it does it when you get older.

1426
00:34:00.051 --> 00:34:00.291
Your,

1427
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:00.561
your,

1428
00:34:00.561 --> 00:34:03.980
your facial facial fucking nose and your ears.

1429
00:34:03.981 --> 00:34:04.431
Yeah.

1430
00:34:04.431 --> 00:34:08.540
I've noticed that those that might nose seems a larger than it was when I was a

1431
00:34:08.541 --> 00:34:09.290
younger man.

1432
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.860
I feel,

1433
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.693
I feel like it looks,

1434
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.050
it looks different from,

1435
00:34:12.051 --> 00:34:12.801
it doesn't make any sense,

1436
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:13.430
but it looks different.

1437
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:15.080
Since I had that operation on the inside,

1438
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.640
I felt like it got wider or something.

1439
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:17.960
That doesn't make any sense.

1440
00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:18.561
Well,

1441
00:34:18.561 --> 00:34:19.760
maybe they carved out too much.

1442
00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:19.931
They,

1443
00:34:19.931 --> 00:34:20.041
they,

1444
00:34:20.041 --> 00:34:20.250
they,

1445
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.650
they wanted to save something as like a salad.

1446
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.160
It's stupid because there was no change to the structure of my nose at all,

1447
00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.060
but Goddamn,

1448
00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:26.840
it works better now.

1449
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.430
Anybody was ever thinking about doing that.

1450
00:34:28.431 --> 00:34:29.060
I had a,

1451
00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:29.631
what's called a,

1452
00:34:29.631 --> 00:34:30.980
there's a video of it on youtube.

1453
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.731
I forget the,

1454
00:34:31.731 --> 00:34:33.660
the technical scientific term of what the,

1455
00:34:33.661 --> 00:34:34.640
the operations called,

1456
00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.850
but they went in and fix a deviated septum and fuck.

1457
00:34:37.851 --> 00:34:39.590
That was the one of the best things I ever did.

1458
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:41.840
I couldn't breathe out of my notes since I was like a little kid.

1459
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.910
I broke my nose,

1460
00:34:42.911 --> 00:34:44.540
fallen down a flight of stairs when I was like five,

1461
00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:45.374
my nose was crooked.

1462
00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:48.560
So my whole life I've been a mouth breather and fuck,

1463
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.131
you know,

1464
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:50.570
and to actually have,

1465
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:52.430
ah,

1466
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:53.650
it's such an amazing thing for,

1467
00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:56.970
you said 100% now or do you almost want to go back and get some more co cut out

1468
00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:57.110
of them?

1469
00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:57.411
No,

1470
00:34:57.411 --> 00:34:57.651
no,

1471
00:34:57.651 --> 00:34:57.831
no.

1472
00:34:57.831 --> 00:34:58.664
It's great.

1473
00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:58.971
No,

1474
00:34:58.971 --> 00:34:59.451
it's great.

1475
00:34:59.451 --> 00:35:00.284
It's wide open.

1476
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.273
It's amazing.

1477
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.250
I hit the bag with my mouth closed.

1478
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.050
I can hit the bag just breathing out of my nose.

1479
00:35:06.051 --> 00:35:08.120
I don't do it for like long stretches of time.

1480
00:35:08.121 --> 00:35:09.350
I'll take mouth breast too.

1481
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:10.423
But you know,

1482
00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.560
I want to make sure that I can exert myself.

1483
00:35:12.561 --> 00:35:14.090
Like this guy that had been working with,

1484
00:35:14.091 --> 00:35:15.080
I've talked about him before,

1485
00:35:15.081 --> 00:35:16.980
his name is Steve Maxwell and he's on,

1486
00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:17.511
on Twitter.

1487
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:18.060
You find them.

1488
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:22.550
If you go to Steve Maxwell or Maxwell fitness.com or just Google him,

1489
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:22.881
Google,

1490
00:35:22.881 --> 00:35:23.631
Steve Maxwell.

1491
00:35:23.631 --> 00:35:23.850
I don't,

1492
00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:24.600
I'm sorry.

1493
00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.270
I apologize that I don't remember his name.

1494
00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.770
He's a the website name.

1495
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.750
It might be maximal strength and conditioning.

1496
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:30.681
Either way.

1497
00:35:30.681 --> 00:35:33.770
He's a brilliant guy and a brilliant strength and conditioning coach and one of

1498
00:35:33.771 --> 00:35:36.650
the things that he has me working on is a breathing.

1499
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:37.771
And so,

1500
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:38.520
uh,

1501
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:38.851
you,

1502
00:35:38.851 --> 00:35:41.250
you learn like the correct way to breathe,

1503
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:42.510
to calm your heart down.

1504
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.490
Like if it doesn't seem like that would work,

1505
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.490
but there really is like a way to calm yourself down.

1506
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.880
It's very difficult to do because one of the things that happens when your body

1507
00:35:50.881 --> 00:35:52.350
goes into oxygen deprivation,

1508
00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:53.250
when you're exhausted,

1509
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.660
when you just totally worn out,

1510
00:35:54.661 --> 00:35:55.494
you just want to,

1511
00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:56.490
Oh,

1512
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:56.881
you just,

1513
00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:58.770
you just trying to get Aaron.

1514
00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:58.981
Well,

1515
00:35:58.981 --> 00:36:01.980
obviously the air that you have right now is enough to sustain you.

1516
00:36:01.981 --> 00:36:02.940
You are alive.

1517
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.750
I understand that your body is sending messages and saying it needs more air.

1518
00:36:06.751 --> 00:36:07.710
We don't have enough air,

1519
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:08.880
but you know what?

1520
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:09.690
You're going to be fun.

1521
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:10.800
You know what's going to fuck you up?

1522
00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:11.634
Even worse,

1523
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:15.210
if you freak out about this and your heart starts pounding a million miles an

1524
00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:18.390
hour on top of the fact from the adrenaline rush on top of the fact that it's

1525
00:36:18.391 --> 00:36:22.800
tired from being pushed and being exhausted and what he's teaching me how to

1526
00:36:22.801 --> 00:36:23.970
breathe in through your nose,

1527
00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:25.350
like you breathe in like this,

1528
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.190
so you're exhausted,

1529
00:36:29.191 --> 00:36:30.430
completely exhausted.

1530
00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.293
You didn't want to just like,

1531
00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.260
Ooh,

1532
00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:33.860
you want to take these big panic breasts,

1533
00:36:33.861 --> 00:36:36.120
but that sends panic signals to your body.

1534
00:36:36.121 --> 00:36:37.170
You have to control it.

1535
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.490
So you gotta be disciplined.

1536
00:36:38.491 --> 00:36:39.360
So as you're doing this,

1537
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.560
you want to take these breaths,

1538
00:36:40.561 --> 00:36:41.394
but y'all,

1539
00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:43.110
you do.

1540
00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.570
It's amazing how quickly it's amazing thing.

1541
00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:46.160
Relax.

1542
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:46.770
It's good.

1543
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:48.420
It was a huge lesson to me.

1544
00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.441
Like now,

1545
00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:51.030
like when I'm exhausted working out,

1546
00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:55.710
I forced myself into breathing like that and I recover way quicker.

1547
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:56.603
It's amazing.

1548
00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:58.740
And all this is like Pranayama breathing.

1549
00:36:58.741 --> 00:37:00.060
This is all like in the,

1550
00:37:00.061 --> 00:37:00.460
you know,

1551
00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.450
like ancient yoga guys were like bad ass at this.

1552
00:37:03.451 --> 00:37:06.180
Like this is like a big part of yoga was like breath control.

1553
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.110
I said,

1554
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:07.710
we're friend,

1555
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.050
we should call them yoga ray ray Capone.

1556
00:37:10.051 --> 00:37:10.351
He was,

1557
00:37:10.351 --> 00:37:11.130
um,

1558
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:11.660
I think that's,

1559
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.290
I hope I didn't say his last name wrong.

1560
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.370
He would rate Capo.

1561
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.233
Thank you.

1562
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:16.283
Correcting myself.

1563
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:18.630
And he was the head of this band.

1564
00:37:18.631 --> 00:37:19.411
I forget his band,

1565
00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:20.244
but it was like,

1566
00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:20.451
I,

1567
00:37:20.451 --> 00:37:22.560
I'm a hardcore band,

1568
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.470
like crazy wild noise kind of band,

1569
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:25.981
you know?

1570
00:37:25.981 --> 00:37:26.850
And they were real popular.

1571
00:37:26.851 --> 00:37:29.040
And then he got into yoga and he became,

1572
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:29.430
uh,

1573
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.280
this a yoga instructor and eventually it just wound up,

1574
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:37.430
I think he gave up music entirely and he's just like a teaching yoga to people

1575
00:37:38.011 --> 00:37:38.844
at some,

1576
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:42.030
some big corporate retreat somewhere in upstate New York who's going to move up

1577
00:37:42.031 --> 00:37:42.864
there with his family?

1578
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.150
This guy had amazing cardio dude.

1579
00:37:45.151 --> 00:37:45.361
I mean,

1580
00:37:45.361 --> 00:37:45.961
amazing.

1581
00:37:45.961 --> 00:37:48.150
You would never see him cast out ever.

1582
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:48.961
And he told me,

1583
00:37:48.961 --> 00:37:50.940
all he did was breathing exercises.

1584
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.710
He would do these long,

1585
00:37:52.711 --> 00:37:53.401
slow,

1586
00:37:53.401 --> 00:37:57.210
deep breaths where you breathe in through your nose and it takes like a minute

1587
00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.380
and then you hold it and then you slowly let the air out.

1588
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.213
Like

1589
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.553
slowly.

1590
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.513
Like you just want,

1591
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:10.680
your instinct is to just fucking panic and just let it all out and just breathe

1592
00:38:10.681 --> 00:38:12.060
in and take gulps of air.

1593
00:38:12.061 --> 00:38:12.930
Like you're drowning.

1594
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:13.441
No,

1595
00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:13.590
no,

1596
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:13.711
no,

1597
00:38:13.711 --> 00:38:13.821
no,

1598
00:38:13.821 --> 00:38:13.861
no,

1599
00:38:13.861 --> 00:38:14.041
no.

1600
00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:15.240
Slowly let it out.

1601
00:38:15.241 --> 00:38:16.560
It's very difficult to do.

1602
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.471
I've tried to do it.

1603
00:38:17.471 --> 00:38:22.471
I do it when I get into the tank is for me the quickest way to get completely

1604
00:38:22.771 --> 00:38:24.930
relaxed and centered when I get into the tank.

1605
00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.220
Pesticides that certain special plant heat.

1606
00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:33.090
The other thing is I'm doing these breathing exercises.

1607
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:33.631
You know,

1608
00:38:33.631 --> 00:38:37.750
so many people don't know about breathing exercises and don't understand that

1609
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.320
you know,

1610
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:38.651
your,

1611
00:38:38.651 --> 00:38:39.550
your lungs,

1612
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.380
you can condition them and you can,

1613
00:38:41.381 --> 00:38:43.060
you can manipulate them and they're,

1614
00:38:43.061 --> 00:38:43.750
you know,

1615
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:44.111
you,

1616
00:38:44.111 --> 00:38:44.980
you are in control.

1617
00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:48.130
You're deciding when to take it breath and you're deciding when to push it out.

1618
00:38:48.131 --> 00:38:52.940
And you can use like time honored practices of,

1619
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:53.221
of,

1620
00:38:53.221 --> 00:38:56.650
of manipulating that to actually strengthen your lungs and strengthened your,

1621
00:38:56.651 --> 00:38:57.250
your,

1622
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:57.611
your,

1623
00:38:57.611 --> 00:38:57.850
um,

1624
00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:58.840
aerobic capacity.

1625
00:38:59.120 --> 00:38:59.651
Because I'll tell you,

1626
00:38:59.651 --> 00:38:59.801
man,

1627
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:01.990
this dude just had awesome control of his lungs.

1628
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.130
He would never get tired.

1629
00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:05.290
That's a Hixon Gracie principle to Hixon.

1630
00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:07.060
Gracie was like the greatest Gracie ever,

1631
00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:07.421
you know,

1632
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:09.580
pretty widely recognized as one of the greatest,

1633
00:39:09.581 --> 00:39:10.300
if not the,

1634
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:10.780
you know,

1635
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.070
everyone would say number one,

1636
00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.090
every Jujitsu guy,

1637
00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:16.930
almost a hundred percent would say Hixon Gracie and he's that bad ass.

1638
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.700
And the other thing about him is he's a,

1639
00:39:18.701 --> 00:39:20.170
he's a Yogi and he,

1640
00:39:20.171 --> 00:39:24.910
he has these crazy abdomen muscles math where he's doing these breathing

1641
00:39:24.911 --> 00:39:27.880
exercises and the video and he's sucking his whole stomach.

1642
00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:30.790
You knew his rib cage and then moving it left and right.

1643
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.630
It's like the,

1644
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:36.120
the amount of manipulation that he can do his abdominals and his breathing as

1645
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.140
you and I can't even wrap our heads around it.

1646
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:39.430
You watch a video of it,

1647
00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:39.910
man,

1648
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:40.780
it's fucking crazy.

1649
00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.010
Like pull it up on Youtube,

1650
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.610
pull up Hixon Gracie breathing,

1651
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:47.620
breathe a breath,

1652
00:39:47.621 --> 00:39:49.240
exercises breathing.

1653
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:50.470
Hixon Gracie from the,

1654
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:51.850
from the documentary choke.

1655
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:54.760
And it just makes you realize,

1656
00:39:54.761 --> 00:39:55.120
man,

1657
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:55.953
there's um,

1658
00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.770
there's more to harness in your body than we're aware of.

1659
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.670
There's some other shit.

1660
00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:03.280
And Yoga is a really interesting aspect of that,

1661
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:04.390
that whole search,

1662
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:09.460
because I found very few things in life that make my head feel as good as yoga

1663
00:40:09.461 --> 00:40:10.294
does.

1664
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:10.930
Yoga,

1665
00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.030
it puts me in like a real relaxed state.

1666
00:40:13.031 --> 00:40:15.430
I don't necessarily get to it that often these days,

1667
00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:16.773
but um,

1668
00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:17.470
when I,

1669
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:18.400
whenever I do it,

1670
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.330
I'm always,

1671
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:20.860
I'm always happy I did.

1672
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.120
It always makes me feel like a peaceful after it's over.

1673
00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:25.960
And I think,

1674
00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:26.141
you know,

1675
00:40:26.141 --> 00:40:28.360
sometimes when I'm busy with a lot of shit,

1676
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:33.560
I actually subconsciously avoid doing anything enlightening because then it'll

1677
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.010
make me not want to work as hard,

1678
00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.810
not want to get as much shit done,

1679
00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:38.501
you know?

1680
00:40:38.501 --> 00:40:43.180
And so whenever I'm like avoiding yoga or avoiding even practicing a little bit

1681
00:40:43.181 --> 00:40:43.361
of it,

1682
00:40:43.361 --> 00:40:44.230
I'm on my own.

1683
00:40:44.231 --> 00:40:47.620
I always know that I'm probably working too hard to just find the video.

1684
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:50.860
A hair check this screen right here and tell me if you see,

1685
00:40:50.861 --> 00:40:51.694
recognize one.

1686
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:53.253
Hold on a second.

1687
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:53.711
Yeah,

1688
00:40:53.711 --> 00:40:54.161
that's it.

1689
00:40:54.161 --> 00:40:55.330
Hixon Gracie workout.

1690
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:55.901
Yeah,

1691
00:40:55.901 --> 00:40:56.710
he'll do,

1692
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:57.550
he doesn't work out.

1693
00:40:57.551 --> 00:41:00.250
And then at the end of it he does like this crazy breathing shit.

1694
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:00.951
Look at.

1695
00:41:00.951 --> 00:41:01.784
He's

1696
00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:03.351
<v 4>turn this up,</v>

1697
00:41:03.351 --> 00:41:04.184
man.

1698
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.633
So much.

1699
00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:08.840
He's doing sit ups on the beach right now.

1700
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:11.480
This is the greatest Jujitsu artists ever.

1701
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.070
This is the guy where every single family member will tell you Hickson's the

1702
00:41:16.071 --> 00:41:17.220
fucking best man.

1703
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:19.520
Yes,

1704
00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.970
sell and your time to be capable,

1705
00:41:22.971 --> 00:41:26.390
to expose yourself in a way to fight and compete.

1706
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:27.441
That's not me.

1707
00:41:27.441 --> 00:41:30.320
And it's a beat three or defeat or anything,

1708
00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:31.640
but just to be able to,

1709
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.680
to do it.

1710
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.533
You know

1711
00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.760
this motherfucker,

1712
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:39.950
this guy is like,

1713
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:45.230
there's not one person that will tell you that he's not good at Jujitsu.

1714
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:46.071
You know what I'm saying?

1715
00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:48.680
There's not one person that will not tell you that this guy is a master.

1716
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:49.963
You know,

1717
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:55.910
he comes from a whole family of killers and he's the number one killer and he's

1718
00:41:55.911 --> 00:41:56.721
what he's right now doing.

1719
00:41:56.721 --> 00:41:59.450
He's is strengthening his neck with his giant Bungee cord.

1720
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.070
Really brilliant guy too.

1721
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:05.660
I had a chance to eat dinner with him once and went to his house and discussed

1722
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.850
Jujitsu techniques and mixed martial arts,

1723
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.461
the physical,

1724
00:42:09.461 --> 00:42:11.170
the body as a machine,

1725
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:12.131
as a machine,

1726
00:42:12.131 --> 00:42:14.170
we need really take care of,

1727
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.161
you know,

1728
00:42:15.161 --> 00:42:17.620
so I try be beside a fighter.

1729
00:42:17.621 --> 00:42:22.621
I try to keep my physical this smooth as an a combination where they can be very

1730
00:42:25.121 --> 00:42:25.960
flexible,

1731
00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.400
very strong,

1732
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:28.990
very fast,

1733
00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:31.000
very well coordinate.

1734
00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.740
We forgot balance.

1735
00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:34.210
We felt good breathing.

1736
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.280
So those elements,

1737
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:38.203
yeah,

1738
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:39.623
watch this shit.

1739
00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.800
This is going to freak you out.

1740
00:42:40.801 --> 00:42:41.460
I slow this down.

1741
00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:42.000
Stanford.

1742
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.231
No,

1743
00:42:42.231 --> 00:42:42.401
no.

1744
00:42:42.401 --> 00:42:43.234
I'm good.

1745
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.410
Sometimes when I make my routines,

1746
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:50.470
I get in a very special stage of meditation and this is beautiful because Lotus

1747
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:57.190
position and totally crazy breathing myself in the present moment.

1748
00:42:59.010 --> 00:42:59.710
<v 2>The it yet,</v>

1749
00:42:59.710 --> 00:42:59.990
wait,

1750
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.890
wait to hear it goes.

1751
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:01.813
Watch this.

1752
00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:04.610
<v 4>That's so weird.</v>

1753
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.260
How he's going to throw your Brad.

1754
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:11.630
You can actually control yourself mentally and physically.

1755
00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:17.600
You can really understand your fears and your emotional stress.

1756
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:19.160
<v 2>You could freak girls out.</v>

1757
00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:21.780
I like,

1758
00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.270
I like the music playing in the background.

1759
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.251
<v 4>Isn't it amazing though?</v>

1760
00:43:25.251 --> 00:43:26.300
What did can do with his stomach?

1761
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:27.920
It's very strange to watch.

1762
00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:30.461
<v 2>He's,</v>

1763
00:43:30.461 --> 00:43:30.850
um,

1764
00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:31.121
he's,

1765
00:43:31.121 --> 00:43:32.230
what I would say is a,

1766
00:43:32.231 --> 00:43:34.900
a real martial arts master.

1767
00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:35.321
You know,

1768
00:43:35.321 --> 00:43:37.630
there's only a few of 'em out there in the world that,

1769
00:43:37.631 --> 00:43:37.760
you know,

1770
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.660
people universally recognized as a martial arts master.

1771
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.790
And Hixson is a martial arts master.

1772
00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.010
He's such an inspirational dude,

1773
00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:46.570
that documentary choke.

1774
00:43:46.571 --> 00:43:51.310
I guarantee you this thousands of Jujitsu guys all over the world who watched

1775
00:43:51.311 --> 00:43:55.270
that documentary choke all the time just to watch Hixon you know,

1776
00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:56.000
when Hixon,

1777
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.290
you know,

1778
00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:57.123
came on the scene,

1779
00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:59.910
a lot of people don't know about Hicks and they know about hoist cause hoist

1780
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:00.610
one,

1781
00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:02.080
the ultimate fighting championship.

1782
00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:04.810
But even hoists said that if he ever got beat,

1783
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.430
they were waiting to put in Hickson.

1784
00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.391
Hickson was like,

1785
00:44:07.391 --> 00:44:08.230
plan B.

1786
00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:09.910
He was like the atomic bomb.

1787
00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:11.410
Like we'll go in there with troops,

1788
00:44:11.411 --> 00:44:12.250
but if you bitches,

1789
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:13.271
he kills babies.

1790
00:44:13.271 --> 00:44:14.051
Get your shit together.

1791
00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:15.490
We're gonna drop Hicks and Gracie on you,

1792
00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.450
you know,

1793
00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:17.111
and he,

1794
00:44:17.111 --> 00:44:17.470
um,

1795
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:19.450
he went over and fought in Japan instead.

1796
00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.010
He fought in Japan valley too.

1797
00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:21.230
Dot.

1798
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.420
Oh,

1799
00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.570
there's some politics involved,

1800
00:44:22.571 --> 00:44:23.530
some family politics.

1801
00:44:23.531 --> 00:44:23.721
I don't,

1802
00:44:23.721 --> 00:44:24.341
I don't understand.

1803
00:44:24.341 --> 00:44:24.701
All that.

1804
00:44:24.701 --> 00:44:28.180
But I do understand that watching him compete was a amazing,

1805
00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.410
didn't fight enough guys.

1806
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:29.691
You know,

1807
00:44:29.691 --> 00:44:30.760
I really wished that we would've,

1808
00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.100
could've got a chance to see his

1809
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.380
<v 1>high level Jujitsu at work against,</v>

1810
00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:34.640
you know,

1811
00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.570
some of the real best and an a fighters the world.

1812
00:44:36.571 --> 00:44:37.710
But when we did see it,

1813
00:44:37.711 --> 00:44:38.280
man,

1814
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:38.581
his,

1815
00:44:38.581 --> 00:44:39.540
he was so dominant,

1816
00:44:39.541 --> 00:44:41.070
man talking to that dude,

1817
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.080
you ever talked to somebody and you know,

1818
00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:43.800
you just,

1819
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.760
you get inspired and you,

1820
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.430
and at the same time you're like,

1821
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:47.911
wow,

1822
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:50.670
like this fucking guy is on such another level.

1823
00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:51.870
Like with his mind,

1824
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:52.231
you know,

1825
00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:54.220
the way he like so serious about things.

1826
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:56.280
Like when you go to the apple store and talking to those guys,

1827
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.000
no,

1828
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:57.833
totally different.

1829
00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.093
Is that how you feel?

1830
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.140
I wish I was an apple genius.

1831
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.490
I wish I was behind the genius counter anyway.

1832
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:06.000
Uh,

1833
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.100
breath control is fucking awesome.

1834
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.060
It's like hooking,

1835
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:09.893
try that shit.

1836
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.040
It's like cooking,

1837
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:11.850
hooking.

1838
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:12.540
How's it like cooking?

1839
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:13.800
Are you retarded to what's going on?

1840
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:14.100
No.

1841
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.170
Like when you're in the jet plane you got,

1842
00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:17.493
oh,

1843
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:19.470
calm down tiger.

1844
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:20.401
You silly.

1845
00:45:20.401 --> 00:45:20.790
Fuck.

1846
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:22.170
Well you've been saying it's silly shit all day.

1847
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:22.891
I haven't at all.

1848
00:45:22.891 --> 00:45:23.471
I've actually,

1849
00:45:23.471 --> 00:45:23.561
I,

1850
00:45:23.561 --> 00:45:24.660
everything I said makes sense.

1851
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:24.871
Oh,

1852
00:45:24.871 --> 00:45:27.660
what's that guy's name that you keep fucking repeating what?

1853
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.291
Yeah,

1854
00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:28.771
the Sanger.

1855
00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:29.604
That's everywhere.

1856
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:30.241
Yeah.

1857
00:45:30.241 --> 00:45:30.491
You,

1858
00:45:30.491 --> 00:45:31.560
you didn't get silly with that.

1859
00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:32.040
No,

1860
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.170
I'm telling you I can't stop talking.

1861
00:45:34.171 --> 00:45:36.150
Bublé now you're going to see what I'm talking about.

1862
00:45:36.151 --> 00:45:37.740
Now that you know who this guy's name is,

1863
00:45:37.741 --> 00:45:38.640
it's going to haunt you.

1864
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:39.020
I bet.

1865
00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:39.530
Man.

1866
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:42.810
This Nintendo ds thing that you handed me the three Ds thing is amazing.

1867
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.111
Yeah,

1868
00:45:43.111 --> 00:45:44.010
it's really good.

1869
00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:45.180
Like my mom,

1870
00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:47.403
she,

1871
00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.780
the Mario Brothers game,

1872
00:45:48.781 --> 00:45:49.051
there was a,

1873
00:45:49.051 --> 00:45:50.280
if you're a big fan of [inaudible],

1874
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.800
it was so it's done right for the first time.

1875
00:45:52.801 --> 00:45:54.240
Being able to do a three d game.

1876
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:55.080
It's amazing.

1877
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.130
Like I'm looking at it right now.

1878
00:45:56.131 --> 00:45:58.140
It's really a trip because it does,

1879
00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.660
it even works a little bit or off angle.

1880
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:00.901
Yeah.

1881
00:46:00.901 --> 00:46:01.760
But that's the basic,

1882
00:46:01.761 --> 00:46:02.380
see,

1883
00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:02.770
yeah.

1884
00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.890
They have to look at a dead on to really get it.

1885
00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:06.450
You can see like the wiring,

1886
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:07.410
the board,

1887
00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:08.970
there's two things I don't like about it.

1888
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.030
One is that it's,

1889
00:46:10.031 --> 00:46:10.570
it's,

1890
00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:11.520
I have small hands,

1891
00:46:11.521 --> 00:46:15.720
but I still found it was really cramped a play at for a large period of time.

1892
00:46:15.721 --> 00:46:16.610
So yeah,

1893
00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.330
I bet it's period of time.

1894
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:18.810
Yeah.

1895
00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.430
So I got this thing that just snaps into,

1896
00:46:20.431 --> 00:46:21.900
it looks like an Xbox controller,

1897
00:46:21.901 --> 00:46:24.030
so you can just play it like it's an Xbox controller section,

1898
00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:25.470
a button that activate a camera.

1899
00:46:25.471 --> 00:46:26.091
It's got a camera,

1900
00:46:26.091 --> 00:46:27.150
it's got a three d camera.

1901
00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:29.480
You can take photos and three d and,

1902
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:30.570
and uh,

1903
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.921
it does,

1904
00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:33.990
it actually look like three d if I take a photo of me taking a photo,

1905
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:34.680
yeah,

1906
00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.710
that would be interesting if you put something in the front in the back,

1907
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:37.891
you know,

1908
00:46:37.891 --> 00:46:39.540
like a three like that chair or something.

1909
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:40.760
But uh,

1910
00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:40.950
yeah,

1911
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:42.390
it's got a three d camera and uh,

1912
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.930
I,

1913
00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:44.830
I'm having fun with it.

1914
00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:45.330
I think it's,

1915
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:47.520
I didn't know it was that cool,

1916
00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.000
but that's now way,

1917
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:50.820
imagine when TVs are like that though.

1918
00:46:50.821 --> 00:46:51.240
That's us.

1919
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:51.810
That's us.

1920
00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:52.081
You know,

1921
00:46:52.081 --> 00:46:52.891
small little screen.

1922
00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:53.730
But imagine when TV's,

1923
00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.310
the three D is going to be this like are these things,

1924
00:46:56.311 --> 00:46:59.970
he's mobile game boy type devices or these things sort of like digital cameras

1925
00:46:59.971 --> 00:47:02.340
where they're on the way out and it's all going to be incorporated into phone.

1926
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:02.820
The iPhone,

1927
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:03.540
the IPAD,

1928
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:04.351
the IPAD game,

1929
00:47:04.351 --> 00:47:05.760
he had iPad itself.

1930
00:47:05.761 --> 00:47:06.594
There's all,

1931
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.770
this is the coolest thing ever.

1932
00:47:07.771 --> 00:47:08.970
I'm still trying to mirroring.

1933
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:13.380
You've done that right mirror and we can do your apple TV and do something even

1934
00:47:13.381 --> 00:47:13.860
cooler.

1935
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:14.010
Uh,

1936
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:15.760
there's this new thing called Onlife.

1937
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:18.180
I don't know if you've heard it on live.

1938
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.930
It's called online and it's a uh,

1939
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:26.050
video game browser where you can sit here and what it does is it's a service

1940
00:47:26.431 --> 00:47:30.050
that you pay for every month and it has all latest video game

1941
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:32.800
<v 3>so you don't have to have like a high end computer anymore.</v>

1942
00:47:32.801 --> 00:47:34.300
You don't have to have an Xbox anymore.

1943
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:39.130
You play through like this weird streaming technology and it doesn't seem like

1944
00:47:39.131 --> 00:47:40.150
it would work well.

1945
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.320
Meaning like you can sit there,

1946
00:47:41.321 --> 00:47:45.300
I can see her right now and played the new Batman video game from my computer in

1947
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.070
in real time streams the gain to you.

1948
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:48.791
So you're,

1949
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:50.200
there's no downloading a games,

1950
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:51.750
there's nothing and it actually works fine.

1951
00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.710
But what the cool thing is is the IPAD has,

1952
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:57.640
I think it's coming to the iPad soon where you can play like legit video games

1953
00:47:57.641 --> 00:48:02.470
on your iPad so that you'll be able to play Xbox games on your iPad pretty much.

1954
00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:03.573
So

1955
00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.160
<v 2>your finger movements will dictate like how,</v>

1956
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:08.440
what is going to be like your controllers and everything.

1957
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.060
<v 3>Right.</v>

1958
00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.840
And well it's really cool if you can see this.

1959
00:48:10.841 --> 00:48:11.640
This is pretty sweet.

1960
00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.500
What's really cool is that it also,

1961
00:48:13.501 --> 00:48:15.420
if you're bored and you're sitting in your bed,

1962
00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:19.020
you can sit here and watch anybody that's playing video games right now and you

1963
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:23.320
come and you could just go into their game and just explain to everybody.

1964
00:48:23.321 --> 00:48:23.470
Yeah,

1965
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:27.310
<v 2>Brian just pulled up a browser with how many fucking windows was that?</v>

1966
00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.313
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1967
00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:29.343
hundreds.

1968
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.353
What game was this?

1969
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:32.120
Teen fortress or some shit.

1970
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.470
I don't even know what this is.

1971
00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.090
But they have like Batman,

1972
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.750
uh,

1973
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:39.860
they have like any gears drop in on any of these games and just start watching.

1974
00:48:39.861 --> 00:48:40.694
So I've been late late.

1975
00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:41.391
How you play them?

1976
00:48:41.391 --> 00:48:42.224
Can you play?

1977
00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:44.090
You can't on on the iPad yet.

1978
00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.210
That's what I said is just,

1979
00:48:45.211 --> 00:48:46.340
is just watching people play.

1980
00:48:46.341 --> 00:48:47.180
This is just watching.

1981
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:49.670
This is like watching TV though of people playing any video games,

1982
00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.111
which by the way,

1983
00:48:51.111 --> 00:48:52.190
I used to do all the time.

1984
00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:52.460
Yeah.

1985
00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:53.430
When I was addicted to quick,

1986
00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:54.890
I used to watch a lot of quick demos.

1987
00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:55.510
Exactly.

1988
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.250
But on android you can play it.

1989
00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:59.870
They just released the android version so you can play the games.

1990
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:00.640
Uh,

1991
00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.430
I downloaded on my Mac and I can play games from my Mac here without having any

1992
00:49:04.431 --> 00:49:05.171
video games on,

1993
00:49:05.171 --> 00:49:05.420
I think.

1994
00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:06.650
And it works really well.

1995
00:49:06.651 --> 00:49:07.970
Like I was surprised how well it works.

1996
00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.150
<v 2>Wow.</v>

1997
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:11.570
<v 3>At least for the F for right now.</v>

1998
00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.650
And five years from now,

1999
00:49:12.651 --> 00:49:13.461
that'd be the way to go.

2000
00:49:13.461 --> 00:49:15.050
And there's not going to be x boxes anymore.

2001
00:49:15.051 --> 00:49:19.190
You're just going to be fucking using your TV and a Bluetooth remote

2002
00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.740
<v 2>to your remote controller or whatever you're using.</v>

2003
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:23.023
Wow.

2004
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:24.080
Getting very strange.

2005
00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:25.640
But that's called online.

2006
00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.560
I wonder what the next level is going to be.

2007
00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.330
It's with this three d thing.

2008
00:49:29.331 --> 00:49:32.750
It really makes me think that they're eventually going to get a three d thing

2009
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:36.380
that's going to be your regular television will be three d capable.

2010
00:49:36.381 --> 00:49:38.420
Just like everything became HD capable.

2011
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:39.171
You know what I mean?

2012
00:49:39.171 --> 00:49:40.760
Hd has been around for a long fucking time,

2013
00:49:40.761 --> 00:49:43.010
but how long was it before everybody had an HD set?

2014
00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:43.450
Oh,

2015
00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:44.810
still the majority don't.

2016
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:45.870
I didn't really want to draw.

2017
00:49:45.871 --> 00:49:48.800
I bet the majority still does not have an HD set.

2018
00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:49.880
Wow.

2019
00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:50.713
That's amazing.

2020
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:52.940
You know I did this tour,

2021
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.020
this television satellite television tour where you sit down and they connect to

2022
00:49:57.021 --> 00:49:58.280
you with all these different morning shows.

2023
00:49:58.281 --> 00:50:00.560
I want to talk to you about fear factor being back and that kind of shit.

2024
00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:01.371
And uh,

2025
00:50:01.371 --> 00:50:05.030
one of them we have to reset for because one,

2026
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:07.490
one news station somewhere,

2027
00:50:07.491 --> 00:50:07.821
one,

2028
00:50:07.821 --> 00:50:10.850
one TV station somewhere doesn't have HD.

2029
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:11.500
Right.

2030
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.710
So cause because of this one,

2031
00:50:12.711 --> 00:50:15.180
they have to reset everything and smashed the signal and,

2032
00:50:15.181 --> 00:50:16.580
and do something totally different.

2033
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:17.420
I don't know how they,

2034
00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:18.081
they change it,

2035
00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:21.590
but they have to change it for this one network and like fucking in the middle

2036
00:50:21.591 --> 00:50:23.270
of nowhere that does not have HD.

2037
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:24.291
And I go,

2038
00:50:24.291 --> 00:50:24.891
what's that about?

2039
00:50:24.891 --> 00:50:25.251
And they'll go,

2040
00:50:25.251 --> 00:50:26.810
it's like a mom and pop owned TV.

2041
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.190
Why doesn't they,

2042
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:30.260
why don't they just pay for them to upgrade?

2043
00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:30.961
I wonder if that's,

2044
00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:32.750
it would be more expensive than having to do that.

2045
00:50:32.751 --> 00:50:33.800
Super expensive.

2046
00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:34.281
You know,

2047
00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:35.570
I think it's super expensive.

2048
00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.021
I mean,

2049
00:50:36.021 --> 00:50:37.490
it's a worthwhile investment.

2050
00:50:37.491 --> 00:50:40.520
But if you're some rinky dink town and you know,

2051
00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.533
he got,

2052
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:41.901
I mean,

2053
00:50:41.901 --> 00:50:42.860
how many people,

2054
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:47.480
how many people were accessed or how many people have access to each television

2055
00:50:47.481 --> 00:50:47.690
set?

2056
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:48.400
Right.

2057
00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:48.650
You know,

2058
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:49.430
if it's like,

2059
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.910
you know,

2060
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:50.630
Jasper,

2061
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:51.860
Wyoming or some shit,

2062
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.590
some weird place no one's ever heard of and they have a TV station and you're,

2063
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:55.760
you're clinking into it.

2064
00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:57.733
It's not an HD.

2065
00:50:58.580 --> 00:50:59.413
It's crazy.

2066
00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.201
Sorry to hear that.

2067
00:51:00.201 --> 00:51:00.351
The,

2068
00:51:00.351 --> 00:51:02.780
that there's television stations that are not HD,

2069
00:51:02.781 --> 00:51:05.690
but we have 10 80 p on her iPhone.

2070
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:07.340
That is amazing.

2071
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:07.641
Well,

2072
00:51:07.641 --> 00:51:08.690
it's like there's a,

2073
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:11.640
there's a big wave and that not everything is at the front of the way for us.

2074
00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:12.020
A lot.

2075
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.370
A lot of shit going on the sides.

2076
00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:15.400
And at the end it's a,

2077
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.460
it's a curious though.

2078
00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:17.311
It's curious because if,

2079
00:51:17.311 --> 00:51:17.511
if,

2080
00:51:17.511 --> 00:51:18.500
if HD,

2081
00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:18.771
you know,

2082
00:51:18.771 --> 00:51:20.210
eventually it gets replaced by three D,

2083
00:51:20.211 --> 00:51:23.120
all of these people that just switched to HD boy like mother Fucker,

2084
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:24.830
I just got the newest shit.

2085
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.020
If it ever becomes a,

2086
00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:29.600
I'm not a fan of the fucking glasses in the movies,

2087
00:51:29.601 --> 00:51:34.601
but if you can show me movies that are as good from like the sides and the edges

2088
00:51:34.671 --> 00:51:37.400
as the or from the front and it's three days and we can just watch it on the

2089
00:51:37.401 --> 00:51:38.930
screen because right now,

2090
00:51:38.931 --> 00:51:39.764
the way that looked,

2091
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.190
it's big difference between head on and on the edge,

2092
00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:43.520
right.

2093
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.540
If you've got to watch like,

2094
00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:45.530
you know,

2095
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:47.600
Kona in three d on the edge,

2096
00:51:47.601 --> 00:51:48.830
you would get annoyed at yourself.

2097
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:49.040
Right?

2098
00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.270
It's like it's too fucking clothes.

2099
00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:51.943
Yeah.

2100
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:52.371
I,

2101
00:51:52.371 --> 00:51:55.520
it's hard for me to even go to a movie theater nowadays that I never go.

2102
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:55.851
I mean,

2103
00:51:55.851 --> 00:51:58.610
I have big TVs and digital sounds,

2104
00:51:58.611 --> 00:51:59.780
so like even that monkey movie,

2105
00:51:59.781 --> 00:52:00.501
I'd never got to see it,

2106
00:52:00.501 --> 00:52:01.750
but it's out on DVD,

2107
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.870
so I might just go rent it.

2108
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:05.840
I'd been to movies three times in the last month and uh,

2109
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.330
two of those three times people were talking during the movie.

2110
00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:09.740
I don't want that shit.

2111
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:10.590
I don't need that.

2112
00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:11.660
And it was so annoying.

2113
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:12.350
It's like,

2114
00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:12.680
you know,

2115
00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.520
people think it's funny,

2116
00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:14.810
they're laughing at Shit,

2117
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.111
you know,

2118
00:52:15.111 --> 00:52:17.810
they're talking to each other about something totally not related to the movie.

2119
00:52:17.811 --> 00:52:18.680
And you hear them laughing.

2120
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:21.890
There's very few things is distracting when when you know you're,

2121
00:52:21.891 --> 00:52:25.700
you're hearing someone laughing out loud during a scene in a movie and they know

2122
00:52:25.701 --> 00:52:28.160
the problem is there's not a lot of people got into movies these days.

2123
00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.480
So if you go during a week night,

2124
00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:32.420
sometimes you'll go like a 10 o'clock movie and they'd be like,

2125
00:52:32.421 --> 00:52:34.640
fucking three couples in there and that's it.

2126
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:35.840
There's no one in there.

2127
00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:36.940
Then they're on their way out.

2128
00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:37.641
Movie theaters,

2129
00:52:37.641 --> 00:52:38.630
bookstores,

2130
00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:39.351
you know,

2131
00:52:39.351 --> 00:52:40.340
all that shit that day.

2132
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:41.303
IPAD.

2133
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:42.680
That makes me sad.

2134
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:44.510
I'm going to miss both for sure.

2135
00:52:44.511 --> 00:52:45.560
I love movie theaters.

2136
00:52:45.561 --> 00:52:47.870
I love the idea of like a movie's coming out.

2137
00:52:47.871 --> 00:52:49.250
Like when the Avengers comes out,

2138
00:52:49.251 --> 00:52:50.660
I want to be there opening weekend,

2139
00:52:50.661 --> 00:52:51.110
man.

2140
00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:52.660
That's what all the fucking nerves are there.

2141
00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.250
They're real excited to be there at that movie.

2142
00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:56.870
I want to get tickets in advance.

2143
00:52:56.871 --> 00:52:57.570
You know what I mean?

2144
00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:57.830
It's like,

2145
00:52:57.830 --> 00:52:59.450
then it's a fun experience.

2146
00:52:59.451 --> 00:52:59.631
You know,

2147
00:52:59.631 --> 00:53:04.010
if you see a cool movie in a theater with a bunch of people and they're all into

2148
00:53:04.011 --> 00:53:04.221
it,

2149
00:53:04.221 --> 00:53:05.930
that actually enhances the experience.

2150
00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:10.240
But if you see at theater and it's like half empty and the people we're talking,

2151
00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.590
God Damn God damn,

2152
00:53:12.591 --> 00:53:13.424
that's annoying.

2153
00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:14.181
And people,

2154
00:53:14.181 --> 00:53:16.040
something that they feel like they can do that when there's less,

2155
00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:16.970
less people there.

2156
00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:17.511
You know?

2157
00:53:17.511 --> 00:53:18.201
That's when I've,

2158
00:53:18.201 --> 00:53:19.760
I've found that people are really rude.

2159
00:53:19.761 --> 00:53:20.440
It's not when a,

2160
00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.770
the movie theater is crowded.

2161
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:24.440
It's when there's only like a few couples,

2162
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:25.663
you know,

2163
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:28.830
especially if you get more than three boys together,

2164
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:31.170
more than three teenage boys together.

2165
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.033
Like very rarely.

2166
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:33.330
That's all the time for me.

2167
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:34.530
You went three nights,

2168
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:35.363
three teenage boys.

2169
00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:36.783
Is that your move?

2170
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:40.440
I don't want put bookstores to go out either,

2171
00:53:40.441 --> 00:53:40.621
man.

2172
00:53:40.621 --> 00:53:41.550
I love bookstores.

2173
00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:44.100
I liked the idea of walking by and going,

2174
00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:44.431
Huh?

2175
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:46.170
What is this biography on?

2176
00:53:46.171 --> 00:53:46.980
Who?

2177
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:47.790
What did he do?

2178
00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:48.360
Oh,

2179
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:48.800
let me leave.

2180
00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:49.980
Read about this class life.

2181
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:50.933
I liked that.

2182
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:53.130
I liked that I can just walk down an aisle and go,

2183
00:53:53.131 --> 00:53:53.461
you know what?

2184
00:53:53.461 --> 00:53:55.140
Maybe I want to read a biography today.

2185
00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:55.530
You will.

2186
00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:57.330
Or maybe you want to read about cars today.

2187
00:53:57.331 --> 00:53:58.260
I want something mindless.

2188
00:53:58.410 --> 00:53:59.700
I want to know the history of the corvette.

2189
00:53:59.701 --> 00:54:00.120
You know,

2190
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.080
maybe it's a,

2191
00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:01.470
you know,

2192
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:01.950
I want to,

2193
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:02.540
you know,

2194
00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:04.260
know about fucking solar power,

2195
00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:07.260
but I want to be able to just wander through and pick out something.

2196
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.910
It's like the same thing with record stores,

2197
00:54:08.911 --> 00:54:09.300
man.

2198
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:10.560
I used to like record stores,

2199
00:54:10.561 --> 00:54:11.010
man.

2200
00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:12.330
I used to like virgin records.

2201
00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:16.050
We'd go and they would let you listen to the CD you remember and there was no,

2202
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.050
no fucking headphones available because people would just stand there and listen

2203
00:54:19.051 --> 00:54:20.010
to music all day.

2204
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:20.701
And he was like,

2205
00:54:20.701 --> 00:54:21.031
damn,

2206
00:54:21.031 --> 00:54:22.800
I want to find out this fucking records any good.

2207
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:25.650
That was like the first time anybody ever took a chance.

2208
00:54:25.651 --> 00:54:25.861
I said,

2209
00:54:25.861 --> 00:54:26.161
listen,

2210
00:54:26.161 --> 00:54:28.050
I know that you've been burned in the past,

2211
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.190
so here's what we're going to do.

2212
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:32.310
I'm going to let you listen to everything before you buy it.

2213
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:35.400
I remember that was like fucking revolutionary.

2214
00:54:35.401 --> 00:54:36.234
Yeah.

2215
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:40.140
Now people download the whole fucking thing and if they really like it,

2216
00:54:40.141 --> 00:54:41.220
they'll buy it on iTunes.

2217
00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:42.750
<v 3>I still bought you.</v>

2218
00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.200
Most people don't do that,

2219
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:44.721
I don't think.

2220
00:54:44.721 --> 00:54:46.280
I think most people would just steal nowadays,

2221
00:54:46.281 --> 00:54:48.200
but I still buy a CD here and there.

2222
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:48.820
Definitely.

2223
00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:49.653
Yeah,

2224
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:52.520
but the problem is I don't go to a record store.

2225
00:54:52.521 --> 00:54:56.630
I go to Amazon and I just get them delivered to where it was.

2226
00:54:56.631 --> 00:54:57.464
I just add,

2227
00:54:57.590 --> 00:54:57.980
oh,

2228
00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:00.560
I was at best buy and there was like so many things and I'm like,

2229
00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:01.160
oh,

2230
00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:01.551
that's cool.

2231
00:55:01.551 --> 00:55:02.384
I'm going to wait.

2232
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:03.470
Let me just go on Amazon.

2233
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.101
Oh Shit.

2234
00:55:04.101 --> 00:55:04.281
Yeah,

2235
00:55:04.281 --> 00:55:06.080
it's 40% cheaper on Amazon.

2236
00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:08.540
Is it really 40% so many things.

2237
00:55:08.541 --> 00:55:08.900
Here's,

2238
00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.170
here's a good example.

2239
00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:10.610
I here,

2240
00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:11.720
this is kind of obvious.

2241
00:55:11.721 --> 00:55:11.931
So,

2242
00:55:11.931 --> 00:55:12.230

And then that's just like how best buy is.

2252
00:55:26.301 --> 00:55:26.541
You know,

2253
00:55:26.541 --> 00:55:28.100
like best buy is all the time.

2254
00:55:28.101 --> 00:55:29.410
You just go through everything and you're like,

2255
00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:29.730
wow,

2256

2257
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:34.610
How much can you get a good windows laptop?

2258
00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.460
You can get a good windows laptop or 300 bucks,

2259
00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:38.420
Holy Shit.

00:55:46.281 --> 00:55:47.870
Like a Toshiba or something like that.

2267
00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:48.590
Absolutely.

2268
00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:49.230

2269
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:50.160

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.013
That's amazing.

2271
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:54.750
That's one of my favorite complaints too when people start talking about apple.

2272
00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:55.130
Well,

2273
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:59.070
you can get the swims books in a windows box for one third the price,

2274
00:55:59.490 --> 00:55:59.790
but yeah,

2275
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:00.990
but you'd be running windows.

2276
00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:02.040
Do you understand that?

2277
00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:03.361
That's silly.

2278
00:56:03.361 --> 00:56:04.800
Goose people get mad at me.

2279
00:56:04.801 --> 00:56:05.190
Man.

2280
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:06.650
That's one of the things I've had uh,

2281
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:07.590
mentioned on Twitter.

2282
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:08.670
People will say something like,

2283
00:56:08.671 --> 00:56:09.210
dude,

2284
00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:12.390
I think you're cool and everything until you start talking about Mac and PC and

2285
00:56:12.391 --> 00:56:13.980
you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

2286
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:15.840
Like whoa

2287
00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:19.000
<v 3>and want to change to Walmart's or touchy computers.</v>

2288
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:21.130
Someone got a little touchy

2289
00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.010
<v 2>son was a little uncomfortable with the of the fact that</v>

2290
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.010
<v 3>your shit gets viruses will do,</v>

2291
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.540
can make rooms for the mirror platform as well.

2292
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:31.420
It's just not enough people doing it for them to judge for a making it.

2293
00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.493
Yeah,

2294
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:33.550
whatever.

2295
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:34.061
Okay.

2296
00:56:34.061 --> 00:56:38.320
I think those people would be so that the people that write viruses are probably

2297
00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:43.390
on windows and they would probably want to destroy the apple fan boys as much as

2298
00:56:43.391 --> 00:56:43.871
possible.

2299
00:56:43.871 --> 00:56:44.310
If they get it.

2300
00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:46.390
They're trying to extract money is what they're trying to do.

2301
00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:47.510
If it was easy to extract my,

2302
00:56:47.511 --> 00:56:49.930
there's just a big enough market with windows computers,

2303
00:56:49.931 --> 00:56:50.551
why fuck with it?

2304
00:56:50.551 --> 00:56:51.880
It's so easy to get into your shit.

2305
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:53.980
You know I have to do is click a link.

2306
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.330
I mean how stupid is that?

2307
00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:56.980
You Click a link and you get a virus.

2308
00:56:56.981 --> 00:56:57.814
Hi.

2309
00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:58.691
Oh,

2310
00:56:58.691 --> 00:56:59.081

2311
00:56:59.081 --> 00:57:01.740

2312
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.081

2313
00:57:02.081 --> 00:57:04.000
I just snuck into your basis and I got your pregnant.

2314
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:04.541
Sorry.

2315
00:57:04.541 --> 00:57:06.400
Stupid and all your data's no good.

2316
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:07.060
You know,

2317
00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.830
hell spawns inside of your making babies.

2318
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.010
I tell you what's the most annoying thing in the road?

2319
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:12.640
Somebody told me to call this number.

2320
00:57:12.641 --> 00:57:14.830
It was like 1-800-WET-TITS.

2321
00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:15.090
As,

2322
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:16.420
as on one of the other podcasts.

2323
00:57:16.421 --> 00:57:16.660
He's like,

2324
00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:16.901
Oh,

2325
00:57:16.901 --> 00:57:17.660
you know my,

2326
00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:18.311
I got a new one,

2327
00:57:18.311 --> 00:57:19.380
800 number and they settled.

2328
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:21.160
He wanted everyone to call this number and what it was,

2329
00:57:21.161 --> 00:57:23.350
it's like winning a hundred wet hits or boobs or something like that.

2330
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:24.550
And it's just his girl going,

2331
00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:24.911
Oh,

2332
00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:25.430
you want money?

2333
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:26.840
I have really web boobs a,

2334
00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:27.683
it's like a recording.

2335
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.830
And then at the end of like this two minute speech,

2336
00:57:29.831 --> 00:57:30.230
she,

2337
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.970
she goes,

2338
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:31.660
uh,

2339
00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:32.081
she's like,

2340
00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:32.711
call this number.

2341
00:57:32.711 --> 00:57:32.891
You know,

2342
00:57:32.891 --> 00:57:33.131
dad,

2343
00:57:33.131 --> 00:57:33.964
talk to me live.

2344
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:35.940
But the problem is now ever since,

2345
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:38.620
because I called her on my phone and be on speaker phone just so we could play

2346
00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:39.700
on the podcast problem.

2347
00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:40.990
Is that now nonstop.

2348
00:57:40.991 --> 00:57:44.140
Everyday I'm getting a text message like automated like hey,

2349
00:57:44.141 --> 00:57:48.130
me and my crazy roommate want to suck your butthole out in call this number,

2350
00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:48.790
you know,

2351
00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:51.590
and it's like I'm now in a spam on your phone.

2352
00:57:51.591 --> 00:57:53.380
Do you get spam on your phone ever?

2353
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:54.520
Um,

2354
00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:55.061
no.

2355
00:57:55.061 --> 00:57:56.020
I don't get on once.

2356
00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:59.170
He never get like random text messages that are like trying to sell you or do

2357
00:57:59.171 --> 00:57:59.880
something great.

2358
00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:00.760
I don't know what to do now.

2359
00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.720
I am sure I can call a t and t but and tell him I got your number because I

2360
00:58:04.721 --> 00:58:08.950
called a phone number and I got automatically put on some text message calling

2361
00:58:08.951 --> 00:58:09.400
list.

2362
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:10.270
She could block them.

2363
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.300
I'm sure you'd find out what number that's coming from until eight t and t no

2364
00:58:13.301 --> 00:58:14.470
text messages from them.

2365
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:17.350
But that should be a good industry against the law because I mean I call it

2366
00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:19.570
accidentally called that number by mistake.

2367
00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:20.270
Now that you,

2368
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:22.210
you're just signed up for some spamming.

2369
00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.073
That's,

2370
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:23.960
you know what I mean?

2371
00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:24.490
Yeah.

2372
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:25.200
It's true.

2373
00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.010
It's bullshit.

2374
00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:26.470
Yeah.

2375
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:27.550
But whatever,

2376
00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:29.980
it's amazing that it's taken this long for them to infiltrate,

2377
00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:30.731
you know,

2378
00:58:30.731 --> 00:58:33.550
thinking about how long people have been getting text messages and just now

2379
00:58:33.551 --> 00:58:34.780
they're figuring out how to get in there.

2380
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:35.643
That's amazing.

2381
00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:36.100
Yeah.

2382
00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:36.831
You know that,

2383
00:58:36.831 --> 00:58:38.620
that's pretty incredible when you really think about it.

2384
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:39.763
Yeah.

2385
00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:41.060
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

2386
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:41.331
Dude.

2387
00:58:41.331 --> 00:58:42.650
Now with the Patriot Act,

2388
00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:43.970
they can listen to everything.

2389
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:48.260
They can listen to all your calls with every fucking new bill that gets passed.

2390
00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:51.230
They can dig into all your text messages.

2391
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:54.050
It all in the name of you could be a terrorist.

2392
00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:57.410
All you have to do is be like a single guy in your forties you could be a

2393
00:58:57.411 --> 00:58:58.190
terrorist.

2394
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.461
You know?

2395
00:58:58.461 --> 00:58:59.360
All you have to do is,

2396
00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:00.380
this is like such,

2397
00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:02.690
all you have to do is have like a year's worth of food.

2398
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:04.040
It was like someone was,

2399
00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:05.000
I forget who did a,

2400
00:59:05.001 --> 00:59:05.310
a,

2401
00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:06.500
a description of it,

2402
00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:06.891
but,

2403
00:59:06.891 --> 00:59:07.670
uh,

2404
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:08.481
was it John Stewart?

2405
00:59:08.481 --> 00:59:09.314
I forgot who it was,

2406
00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:10.040
but they had this,

2407
00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.310
all these descriptions of what,

2408
00:59:11.311 --> 00:59:12.350
what is defined,

2409
00:59:12.351 --> 00:59:15.140
how it defines a terrorist now it's unbelievable.

2410
00:59:15.141 --> 00:59:15.974
It's ridiculous.

2411
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:17.480
Like if you have missing fingers,

2412
00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:18.340
you,

2413
00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:18.920
you could,

2414
00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:19.280
you should,

2415
00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.180
you could be a terrorist

2416
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:21.673
<v 3>if wear that.</v>

2417
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.330
I see a watch that I have.

2418
00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.230
You're a terrorist.

2419
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.411
Yeah,

2420
00:59:24.411 --> 00:59:24.861
that's right.

2421
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:24.981
Yeah.

2422
00:59:24.981 --> 00:59:25.760
That one watch.

2423
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:26.210
Yeah,

2424
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:29.300
that one watch because they use that for timing shit.

2425
00:59:29.301 --> 00:59:29.541
Right,

2426
00:59:29.541 --> 00:59:29.910
right.

2427
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:33.680
It's just standard standardized just to watch a fucking regular watch.

2428
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:34.310
Right.

2429
00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:35.930
And then you could be on a watch list.

2430
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:37.363
God dammit.

2431
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:39.110
How did this all fall apart?

2432
00:59:39.111 --> 00:59:39.944
Like this?

2433
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:40.260
Yup.

2434
00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:41.780
Bruce Lipton got kind of freaked me out.

2435
00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:42.310
Yeah.

2436
00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:43.250
Do any freak you out a little?

2437
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:44.031
No.

2438
00:59:44.031 --> 00:59:44.331
I mean,

2439
00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:46.370
I think for the most part it was really good.

2440
00:59:46.371 --> 00:59:46.970
It was really,

2441
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:47.803
uh,

2442
00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:48.740
you know,

2443
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.270
I either believe that or don't,

2444
00:59:50.271 --> 00:59:51.290
and I,

2445
00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.240
I've always kind of believed what he talks about,

2446
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:54.170
so I agree.

2447
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.591
I don't know.

2448
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:55.424
It's,

2449
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:57.200
I 100% believe what he says.

2450
00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:57.501
You know,

2451
00:59:57.501 --> 00:59:58.281
who's going to freak you out,

2452
00:59:58.281 --> 00:59:58.910
man.

2453
00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:02.720
Michael Rupert and I get that guy on here who's got to smoke cigarettes with you

2454
01:00:02.721 --> 01:00:05.070
to remember smoked cigarette every five seconds.

2455
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:06.210
That collapsed movie man.

2456
01:00:06.211 --> 01:00:06.391
I know.

2457
01:00:06.391 --> 01:00:07.220
Right.

2458
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:11.300
You know and I want you to talk to him too about the whole thing to be said

2459
01:00:11.301 --> 01:00:12.200
about the cell phones.

2460
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:13.910
Remember he said they were there,

2461
01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:15.620
stopped upgrading their towers and you're like,

2462
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:16.350
oh yeah,

2463
01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:21.350
he's probably changed his mind now cause that's just obvious now that know.

2464
01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:22.410
But,

2465
01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:24.830
but that does speak to a direction,

2466
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:25.190
right?

2467
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:26.090
That he was going in.

2468
01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:26.391
Yeah.

2469
01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:26.990
I need her when,

2470
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.920
when is I want to read,

2471
01:00:27.921 --> 01:00:28.754
watch that movie again.

2472
01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:29.410
Oh No.

2473
01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:31.730
Cause I remember I was really lost out on a few things on that.

2474
01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:32.540
But we're,

2475
01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:34.790
I'm exchanging emails back and forth with his assistant,

2476
01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.490
so we're working that shit out.

2477
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.480
So many people I want to get on the podcast.

2478
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.871
Yeah,

2479
01:00:38.871 --> 01:00:39.171

2480
01:00:39.171 --> 01:00:39.560
Like who,

2481
01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.040
who else?

2482
01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.770
I want to get nick [inaudible].

2483
01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:42.920
Nick Swardson back.

2484
01:00:42.921 --> 01:00:43.131
Yeah.

2485
01:00:43.131 --> 01:00:46.160
We'd love to get nick back if he's got more than 45 minutes to kill Kevin

2486
01:00:46.161 --> 01:00:46.880
prayer,

2487
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.870
Kevin would be great again.

2488
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:50.030
I told you I did talk to the show yesterday.

2489
01:00:50.031 --> 01:00:50.864
You saw it.

2490
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:51.381
He's great.

2491
01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:52.370
I went to his Christmas party.

2492
01:00:52.371 --> 01:00:53.060
It was awesome.

2493
01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:53.421
Oh yeah,

2494
01:00:53.421 --> 01:00:54.380
I saw pictures of it.

2495
01:00:54.381 --> 01:00:56.200
What the fuck was he dressed like that,

2496
01:00:56.201 --> 01:00:58.220

So the P90x cause I have no idea Andy Xmas.

2503
01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.110
This is what it was.

2504
01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:12.690
Yeah.

2505
01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:15.150
And so you had to come there with your favorite uh,

2506
01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.430
ornaments and stuff like that.

2507
01:01:16.431 --> 01:01:20.990
So I cut off the Avatar fleshlight a vagina and put a hook in it.

2508
01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.153
Oh No.

2509
01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:23.000
Yeah,

2510
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.090
I watched it and a hook in it.

2511
01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:27.080
Yeah.

2512
01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.920
And hung it on the tree when I walked in a no.

2513
01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:31.340
And then,

2514
01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:31.551
uh,

2515
01:01:31.551 --> 01:01:31.971
it was,

2516
01:01:31.971 --> 01:01:32.550
it was cool though,

2517
01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:32.961
be his,

2518
01:01:32.961 --> 01:01:33.290
his,

2519
01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:33.590
uh,

2520
01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:35.300
he was one of those arcade games I thought was pretty about this.

2521
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.830
He hasn't mame arcade game.

2522
01:01:36.831 --> 01:01:36.951
We,

2523
01:01:36.951 --> 01:01:38.480
which had like every single,

2524
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:40.580
allegedly every single video game on it.

2525
01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.380
And like he had dragon's layer space.

2526
01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.070
He's like,

2527
01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:44.710
and there was this game called Raskin.

2528
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:45.890
I don't know if you remember this from the,

2529
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:46.790
I think it was the 80s.

2530
01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.950
It was like this Conan O'brien guy and he,

2531
01:01:49.951 --> 01:01:53.650
it was just like a simple slasher like it Conan O'Brien's slasher.

2532
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:56.600
And it was one of the coolest games to see,

2533
01:01:56.601 --> 01:01:57.890
cause I haven't seen it since I was a kid.

2534
01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:00.320
It's a checkout Rasta and see if it brings back memories.

2535
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:01.460
It's like Conan O'brien.

2536
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:01.730
Dude.

2537
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:02.900
I was on watch it and the barbarian,

2538
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:04.970
they were showing some game.

2539
01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:05.721
I don't know what it was,

2540
01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:07.610
but I believe it was a game for the IPAD,

2541
01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.920
some crazy fantasy game.

2542
01:02:09.921 --> 01:02:12.560
You're upgrading your weapons and swards some,

2543
01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:15.140
but it was like really wild fucking animation.

2544
01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.011
And I was watching,

2545
01:02:16.011 --> 01:02:16.221
I was like,

2546
01:02:16.221 --> 01:02:17.180
this is incredible.

2547
01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:17.961
It's on an IPAD.

2548
01:02:17.961 --> 01:02:18.620
It's really new.

2549
01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.490
You know who's that?

2550
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:21.290
It was the room viewing it.

2551
01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:21.610
Yeah,

2552
01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:22.111
it was a cliff.

2553
01:02:22.111 --> 01:02:22.944
He's game

2554
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.350
one of his,

2555
01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:26.070
uh,

2556
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:26.903
the

2557
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:28.741
dude.

2558
01:02:28.741 --> 01:02:30.180
It's fucking amazing looking.

2559
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:30.831
I mean it's,

2560
01:02:30.831 --> 01:02:31.770
it's incredible.

2561
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:32.670
And I'm,

2562
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:33.271
I was watching,

2563
01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:33.571
I was like,

2564
01:02:33.571 --> 01:02:34.110
wow,

2565
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:37.290
we're at the level where that is coming out on a fucking iPad.

2566
01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:38.550
That's incredible.

2567
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.061
Yeah.

2568
01:02:39.061 --> 01:02:42.840
The iPads pretty bad at us and supposedly the third one's going to be the room

2569
01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:43.591
or at the latest rumors.

2570
01:02:43.591 --> 01:02:46.590
There was February 3rd one's gonna Rub your Dick.

2571
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:48.180
It seems like they just came out with a second one.

2572
01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:49.770
I'm kind of getting angry about that shit.

2573
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:49.981
Well,

2574
01:02:49.981 --> 01:02:51.180
it's been almost a year.

2575
01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.980
I think they're doing one a year.

2576
01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:54.420
I still have the first generation.

2577
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:55.590
I'm an old holdout.

2578
01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:57.360
I'm like one of those dudes you meet that has the,

2579
01:02:57.361 --> 01:03:02.361
the iPhone with the aluminum and the bottom guys don't use those anymore things

2580
01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:03.450
without a would,

2581
01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:04.350
you can't use it anymore.

2582
01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:05.183
I mean you have to like,

2583
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:06.780
you barely use them.

2584
01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:07.121
They,

2585
01:03:07.121 --> 01:03:07.421
you can't,

2586
01:03:07.421 --> 01:03:09.540
you have to have to not ever up to your iTunes.

2587
01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:10.250
Yeah,

2588
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:10.591
yeah.

2589
01:03:10.591 --> 01:03:12.690
A few up to your iTunes or you're fucked.

2590
01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:14.730
Everybody says that to what you were saying,

2591
01:03:14.731 --> 01:03:15.250
that when you,

2592
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:18.000
whenever you update your operating system on the older phones,

2593
01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:19.010
it just like,

2594
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:20.220
it seems so clunky.

2595
01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:20.551
Yeah.

2596
01:03:20.551 --> 01:03:21.384
They get a kick

2597
01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:24.330
ass for the,

2598
01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.290
for the new shit,

2599
01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:26.041
for the next level.

2600
01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:26.400
Shit.

2601
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:26.491
Yeah.

2602
01:03:26.491 --> 01:03:27.440
But they do it on computers.

2603
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:28.351
They're forcing you,

2604
01:03:28.351 --> 01:03:29.184
they're holding your hand.

2605
01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:32.070
You can look at it and that they're forcing you in a bad way.

2606
01:03:32.071 --> 01:03:34.590
But actually the forcing you to kiss the fuck up.

2607
01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.120
It's a positive in general.

2608
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.250
Everyone's faster getting shit done faster.

2609
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:39.160
Yeah.

2610
01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.540
Guess playing with yourself faster.

2611
01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:42.990
Right.

2612
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:43.320
Did,

2613
01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:43.620
uh,

2614
01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:46.020
did you see that shootout that happened here on,

2615
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:47.833
yes.

2616
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:49.320
What the fuck was that?

2617
01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:49.891
I don't know.

2618
01:03:49.891 --> 01:03:50.890
But what's crazy is I,

2619
01:03:50.891 --> 01:03:51.630
I found,

2620
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:51.900
uh,

2621
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.130
they released his name.

2622
01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:56.250
I read this small report where they released the stores.

2623
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:56.510
Okay.

2624
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:57.930
So there was this guy on,

2625
01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:00.730
I think it was right next to the movie theater that has settled down,

2626
01:04:00.731 --> 01:04:04.350
I think of Hollywood and vine that just had a gun and he was walking down the

2627
01:04:04.351 --> 01:04:06.720
street and just every time somebody would drive by just Bam,

2628
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:09.000
Bam shooting people like nonstop.

2629
01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:11.670
One guy got hit in the head who was a music executive here,

2630
01:04:11.671 --> 01:04:13.110
and I think he might've died,

2631
01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:13.621
uh,

2632
01:04:13.621 --> 01:04:15.300
hit him in the head of just,

2633
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:17.790
he just pointed him right in his head and just Bam,

2634
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.360
I,

2635
01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.700
and so he was just walking down,

2636
01:04:19.701 --> 01:04:20.534
so you're doing all this shit.

2637
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.820
Finally the police came and they shot him down and they killed him.

2638
01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:24.390
Um,

2639
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.991
but what's crazy,

2640
01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:26.130
they released his name finally.

2641
01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:27.360
It was like a 26 year old.

2642
01:04:27.361 --> 01:04:29.580
And if you go to his Twitter page,

2643
01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.500
uh,

2644
01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.520
I tweeted it,

2645
01:04:31.521 --> 01:04:32.281
I don't know where it is,

2646
01:04:32.281 --> 01:04:33.114
it's on my timeline,

2647
01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.530
but if you go to his Twitter page,

2648
01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:34.771
uh,

2649
01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:35.604
he,

2650
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.001
he,

2651
01:04:36.001 --> 01:04:36.480
uh,

2652
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.420
like was that his photos are the people we followed.

2653
01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:41.510
We're all marijuana activist,

2654
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.000
gun activists and then span shit.

2655
01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:45.480
Oh.

2656
01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.050
And then so I found this Facebook then went on his Facebook and his Facebook.

2657
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:49.251
He,

2658
01:04:49.251 --> 01:04:51.030
he brought his like six days ago,

2659
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.450
uh,

2660
01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:53.880
broke up when she was single and relationships.

2661
01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:55.990
And he was like saying things to,

2662
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:56.191
you know,

2663
01:04:56.191 --> 01:04:59.790
like I finally get what Steve Jobs last words or something like that.

2664
01:04:59.791 --> 01:05:00.720
And then I'm like,

2665
01:05:00.721 --> 01:05:00.871
oh,

2666
01:05:00.871 --> 01:05:01.704
great.

2667
01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:02.431
But what's weird,

2668
01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:03.810
it's like if you looked at what he,

2669
01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:04.521
a watch,

2670
01:05:04.521 --> 01:05:09.521
like his interests on Facebook and stuff was like cspan and like weird shit.

2671
01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:10.523
Like who?

2672
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:12.630
Who wants a cspan one and two?

2673
01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:15.060
That's what it says and yeah,

2674
01:05:15.061 --> 01:05:15.780
that's like,

2675
01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:17.380
that's like looking at your registry,

2676
01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.313
right?

2677
01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:19.180
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2678
01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:20.320
And he also was like,

2679
01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:21.160
uh,

2680
01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.980
his Yoni tweeted like three times and one of his tweets was like,

2681
01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:24.730
ah,

2682
01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:25.090
ah,

2683
01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:26.800
Charlie Sheen need more tiger blood.

2684
01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:28.480
I ran out like,

2685
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:29.343
Whoa,

2686
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.820
Jesus Christ.

2687
01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:33.790
There's some sad crazy fuckers out there man.

2688
01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:34.510
Right.

2689
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:35.540
That's a scary thing.

2690
01:05:35.541 --> 01:05:37.770
Know that this guy would just randomly start shooting people.

2691
01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.720
That scares me to see that the video that,

2692
01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:40.630
that they have are fine.

2693
01:05:40.631 --> 01:05:41.530
It was very scary.

2694
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.460
It was terrifying.

2695
01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:44.440
It just walking down the street shooting at cars,

2696
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.633
innocent people.

2697
01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.180
Yeah.

2698
01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.710
It's scary shit man.

2699
01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:48.581
But you know,

2700
01:05:48.581 --> 01:05:50.680
you have to worry about that whenever you have,

2701
01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:51.790
you know,

2702
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:53.860
more than more than 10 people,

2703
01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:55.600
even when you have 10 people,

2704
01:05:55.601 --> 01:05:56.320
man,

2705
01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:56.531
you know,

2706
01:05:56.531 --> 01:05:58.570
how many people do you ever known someone when they were young,

2707
01:05:58.571 --> 01:05:59.171
they were normal.

2708
01:05:59.171 --> 01:06:02.560
And then as I got older they got crazier and crazier when reality didn't sort of

2709
01:06:02.561 --> 01:06:03.191
fit their,

2710
01:06:03.191 --> 01:06:05.650
their vision of what reality was supposed to be.

2711
01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:08.290
And then they started doing a lot of creepy shit and you know,

2712
01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:13.120
never really sort of saw the world for the way it really is and then they start

2713
01:06:13.121 --> 01:06:13.800
getting crazy.

2714
01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:14.110
Yeah.

2715
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:15.400
Have you ever met people like that a lot?

2716
01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:16.330
Most comics,

2717
01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:17.890
a lot of them.

2718
01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:19.330
We know a lot of them that were crazy.

2719
01:06:19.331 --> 01:06:19.601
Right.

2720
01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:20.120
Yeah.

2721
01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.760
That's an interesting thing to say.

2722
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.690
It's an interesting thing to see someone legitimately lose their grip on

2723
01:06:25.691 --> 01:06:26.524
reality.

2724
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:27.370
Yeah,

2725
01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:28.203
we've seen it.

2726
01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:29.350
You and I have seen it.

2727
01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:30.460
We've seen it many times.

2728
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:31.660
Yeah.

2729
01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.381
It's fucking weird,

2730
01:06:32.381 --> 01:06:33.214
Huh?

2731
01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:33.881
It's weird.

2732
01:06:33.881 --> 01:06:35.230
Weird watching people slip away.

2733
01:06:35.231 --> 01:06:36.160
So what do you do about that?

2734
01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:38.860
I can't do shit.

2735
01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:39.640
Nope.

2736
01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.473
Can't bring them back.

2737
01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.610
They've got to bring back themselves.

2738
01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:48.480
I just totally forgot what we were talking about right before this last thing.

2739
01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.980
Todd bridges and the olive garden.

2740
01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.130
You need to take him to the off guard when that that would,

2741
01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.630
that would be nice if you guys,

2742
01:06:54.631 --> 01:06:55.500
I don't want to hang out with them.

2743
01:06:55.501 --> 01:06:55.851
I just,

2744
01:06:55.851 --> 01:06:58.500
I feel bad that I said that I shouldn't have.

2745
01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:58.951
You know,

2746
01:06:58.951 --> 01:07:02.970
it's not in keeping with my idea of a being a positive person,

2747
01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:04.680
but that's just a,

2748
01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.920
sometimes shit happens when you get tired and you say something you shouldn't

2749
01:07:07.921 --> 01:07:08.754
have said.

2750
01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:10.020
That's why you know,

2751
01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:10.853
no one's perfect.

2752
01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:12.570
We apologize and then we move on.

2753
01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:14.123
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

2754
01:07:14.790 --> 01:07:15.630
<v 1>from where to get to your man.</v>

2755
01:07:15.631 --> 01:07:17.340
Todd bridges is a nice guy,

2756
01:07:17.341 --> 01:07:17.851
I'm sure.

2757
01:07:17.851 --> 01:07:18.400
And he's,

2758
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.233
he gets it.

2759
01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:20.660
He probably,

2760
01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:23.280
well I just don't like when I do something like that and I don't,

2761
01:07:23.281 --> 01:07:24.600
I don't like how I was thinking,

2762
01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:25.710
you know,

2763
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:26.970
sometimes you get tired man.

2764
01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:27.731
Fuck it.

2765
01:07:27.731 --> 01:07:28.950
Make some fucking mistakes.

2766
01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:29.940
You know,

2767
01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:32.250
if you get tired and cranky or if you're a,

2768
01:07:32.251 --> 01:07:33.350
you just overwhelmed,

2769
01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:34.680
overrun or overburdened.

2770
01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:37.350
Do you find yourself like when when you're tired and cranky,

2771
01:07:37.351 --> 01:07:39.450
like you just don't like your behavior?

2772
01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.080
Lately I've just been a complete asshole just because I have no time.

2773
01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.540
I feel like certain times with your girl,

2774
01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:49.920
like sometimes she like it deteriorates your relationship because you're tired

2775
01:07:49.921 --> 01:07:51.510
and you're just snappy,

2776
01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:52.250
you know you're not,

2777
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:56.720
it's to me it's to me it's like I'm in my own road cause I'm trying to deal with

2778
01:07:56.721 --> 01:07:59.500
a thousand things that are coming at me and,

2779
01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.460
and so like the other day I had to check myself and I had to like say,

2780
01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:02.761
all right,

2781
01:08:02.761 --> 01:08:03.210
look,

2782
01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:06.270
I am completely ignoring my relationship right now.

2783
01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:07.193
I'm like,

2784
01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:10.080
I need to stop or stop working as much.

2785
01:08:10.081 --> 01:08:10.891
So I made my,

2786
01:08:10.891 --> 01:08:13.770
I'm making myself not do as much on purpose.

2787
01:08:13.771 --> 01:08:17.750
Like I'm taking a day off here and there where like I went almost two months

2788
01:08:17.751 --> 01:08:20.150
like every day to the Yellow Band,

2789
01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:20.630
Huh?

2790
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.811
Yeah.

2791
01:08:20.811 --> 01:08:25.811
I didn't need to activate long band controlling the situation.

2792
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:29.120
Um,

2793
01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:29.690
well that's,

2794
01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:32.220
that's something like it need to work on like,

2795
01:08:32.230 --> 01:08:34.040
because I have not even talked to him about anything.

2796
01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:36.650
Like the other day I was on stage and I got off stage and they were,

2797
01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.170
they turned off the podcast are nice house chronical and I'm like,

2798
01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:39.570
what?

2799
01:08:39.570 --> 01:08:40.160
And they're like,

2800
01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:40.281
well,

2801
01:08:40.281 --> 01:08:40.941
we wouldn't go to open,

2802
01:08:40.941 --> 01:08:41.740
so did turn it off.

2803
01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:42.200
I'm like,

2804
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:42.560
wait,

2805
01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:42.801
wait,

2806
01:08:42.801 --> 01:08:43.730
you're the guy in charge.

2807
01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:46.100
Don't you know why you knew I was coming back?

2808
01:08:46.101 --> 01:08:46.700
But you know,

2809
01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.260
it's just working out that now.

2810
01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:49.470
He will never do that now.

2811
01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:49.821
I'm like,

2812
01:08:49.821 --> 01:08:50.020
no,

2813
01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:52.790
don't ever do a little bit of trial and error.

2814
01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:54.860
But that's like what's cool about the Joe Rogan experience.

2815
01:08:54.861 --> 01:08:57.770
Like we started off with snowflakes and everyday and allow something new.

2816
01:08:58.150 --> 01:08:58.520
Yeah.

2817
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.230
On a laptop just for a goof.

2818
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:03.110
And now we're coming up on two year anniversary,

2819
01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:04.560
so we're going to have to,

2820
01:09:04.561 --> 01:09:04.910
um,

2821
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:06.410
we're going to have a celebration of this shit.

2822
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:06.990
Yeah.

2823
01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:07.820
We were also,

2824
01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:10.940
this week we're having two shows and Saturday we're having a huge party.

2825
01:09:10.941 --> 01:09:13.000
So maybe that could be the celebration that's going to be our,

2826
01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:13.371
yeah,

2827
01:09:13.371 --> 01:09:14.720
that's close enough to the,

2828
01:09:14.721 --> 01:09:15.050
uh,

2829
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:17.240
the time we started on like New Year's Eve,

2830
01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:17.570
right?

2831
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:18.860
Wasn't it Christmas Eve?

2832
01:09:18.861 --> 01:09:19.670
Christmas Eve,

2833
01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:20.503
Christmas Eve.

2834
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.141
So yeah,

2835
01:09:21.141 --> 01:09:21.974
we're right there.

2836
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.251
I mean,

2837
01:09:22.251 --> 01:09:24.500
what is it like the 13th or something like that today?

2838
01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:24.831
Yeah.

2839
01:09:24.831 --> 01:09:26.270
Have you ever heard of the Rose Bowl parade?

2840
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:27.110
Yeah.

2841
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.240
No,

2842
01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:27.700
I haven't,

2843
01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:28.340
but I've heard of it.

2844
01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:29.173
It's right here.

2845
01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.073
This is,

2846
01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.451
what does that happen?

2847
01:09:31.451 --> 01:09:31.860
I think,

2848
01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:34.610
I think New Year's Eve or New Year's day or something like that,

2849
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:35.930
or Christmas Eve or Christmas Day,

2850
01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:38.270
they podcasts from the Rose Bowl parade.

2851
01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:40.430
They put these things,

2852
01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.860
weird signs on the street outside the studio here.

2853
01:09:42.861 --> 01:09:43.560
And they say,

2854
01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:44.180
uh,

2855
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.013
um,

2856
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:49.790
any cars parked here from December 23rd to January 4th are subject to

2857
01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:50.624
inspection.

2858
01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:51.381
Oh,

2859
01:09:51.381 --> 01:09:53.420
well then that makes sense.

2860
01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:56.060
I know you can't have someone Parker fucking dirty bomb.

2861
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.220
Yeah.

2862
01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.420
But does that mean any kind of inspection?

2863
01:09:57.421 --> 01:09:58.730
And they just want to look at what kind of cds?

2864
01:09:58.731 --> 01:09:59.960
I want to say to his homeland security.

2865
01:09:59.961 --> 01:10:03.440
They're gonna find your weed to fund your weed and your girlfriend's porn.

2866
01:10:03.441 --> 01:10:04.460
They're gonna lock you up in jail.

2867
01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:07.530
I gotta take the anonymous mask out of the window for it.

2868
01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:11.570
Take the fucking anonymous mask out right now and put a fucking American flag.

2869
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:12.370
How about that?

2870
01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:12.550
Oh,

2871
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:13.071
you have these,

2872
01:10:13.071 --> 01:10:13.430
um,

2873
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.850
these,

2874
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:15.380
these things you have in front of the windows.

2875
01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:15.820
You know,

2876
01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:16.970
we hang American flags.

2877
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:17.151
Yeah.

2878
01:10:17.151 --> 01:10:19.760
We needed more American than our our thoughts and ideals.

2879
01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:20.870
It was real America,

2880
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.040
not this bullshit.

2881
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:24.100
Actually corporate swindle fast.

2882
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.741
It's going on,

2883
01:10:24.741 --> 01:10:25.310
Brian.

2884
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:28.100
Real America is about speaking your fucking mind.

2885
01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.570
It's about creating something,

2886
01:10:29.571 --> 01:10:34.130
uniting together in one giant bond as the greatest nation the world has ever

2887
01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:34.610
known.

2888
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:37.400
So we should put up our fucking flag because we truly represent America,

2889
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:39.320
not those cons that we try to stop us.

2890
01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:40.550
I might hang mine upside down.

2891
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:41.211
Oh,

2892
01:10:41.211 --> 01:10:42.044
you're crazy.

2893
01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:42.740
You're too crazy.

2894
01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:43.250
That bad.

2895
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:44.270
Is that most of it?

2896
01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:44.900
Yeah.

2897
01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:47.360
I wouldn't do it if anything that would piss off a soldier,

2898
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:50.000
whether whatever it is for people hanging upside down and look at them flack

2899
01:10:50.001 --> 01:10:53.480
from my rack and he's had a fucking hard time and he's loading up his gun.

2900
01:10:53.481 --> 01:10:53.631
Right.

2901
01:10:53.631 --> 01:10:56.620
When he drives by your window and sees you in an upside down flag decides to

2902
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:58.250
pump nine into your fucking window.

2903
01:10:58.450 --> 01:10:58.970
Huh?

2904
01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:02.450
What if you have somebody hanging upside down and then it's upside down upside

2905
01:11:02.451 --> 01:11:03.284
right for them.

2906
01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:03.681
Oh,

2907
01:11:03.681 --> 01:11:03.921
okay.

2908
01:11:03.921 --> 01:11:04.551
I see what you're saying.

2909
01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:05.960
So you have the world is upside down.

2910
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:08.540
I think you can get away with that as long as you have like little bushes and

2911
01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:10.040
stuff by the guy's feet as well.

2912
01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:13.620
No,

2913
01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:14.010
the theme

2914
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:14.641
<v 2>has to be clear,</v>

2915
01:11:14.641 --> 01:11:16.290
the guys to be glued to the ground,

2916
01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.130
like he's a walking,

2917
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:19.560
walking through the park and the American flag,

2918
01:11:19.561 --> 01:11:19.861
it was just,

2919
01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:21.090
they're all nice and proud.

2920
01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:22.800
Just upside down from your perspective.

2921
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:23.250
Right.

2922
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:24.600
But he lives in Australia.

2923
01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:26.040
It's called thinking up,

2924
01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:26.430
you know,

2925
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:28.530
get them to the land down under where everything's upside down.

2926
01:11:29.230 --> 01:11:30.031
You know what Australia,

2927
01:11:30.031 --> 01:11:31.410
you can't even fuck around outside.

2928
01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:34.030
You got to put sunscreen on because their ozone layers gone.

2929
01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:35.280
Oh that's so weird.

2930
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:36.510
They've got a big hole in the ozone layer.

2931
01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:37.450
So when you're in,

2932
01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:37.890
um,

2933
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:38.723
did I say Alaska?

2934
01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:39.720
I don't know.

2935
01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:39.990
No,

2936
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.381
I think you said,

2937
01:11:40.381 --> 01:11:42.870
I'll start to tell you I'm in Australia if I just say Alaska because it was

2938
01:11:42.871 --> 01:11:44.250
going to say something about Alaska as well.

2939
01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:49.460
But in Australia they have like these ads on the side of buses and they're

2940
01:11:50.191 --> 01:11:51.660
fucking pretty graphic man.

2941
01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.920
And they show people with chunks of their body cut out from skin cancer and they

2942
01:11:55.921 --> 01:11:58.050
show the stitches and it says,

2943
01:11:58.051 --> 01:11:58.331
you know,

2944
01:11:58.331 --> 01:11:58.550
it's,

2945
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.980
you know,

2946
01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:00.240
I forget the ad campaign,

2947
01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:01.200
but the basic messages,

2948
01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:01.710
hey,

2949
01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:03.060
you can get this from the sun dude.

2950
01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:03.930
You gotta be careful.

2951
01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.010
And then interesting.

2952
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:05.640
That's weird.

2953
01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:05.881
Yeah.

2954
01:12:05.881 --> 01:12:06.690
They have a,

2955
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:08.460
they have more issues than we do.

2956
01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:12.270
Apparently that wasn't layers of motherfucker and everybody says it was

2957
01:12:12.271 --> 01:12:16.470
hairspray and all sorts of different things that eroded it boomerangs

2958
01:12:16.471 --> 01:12:17.200
terrifying.

2959
01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.033
We were,

2960
01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:19.770
you imagine was,

2961
01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:23.280
well I guess it just all settles down there by the way.

2962
01:12:23.281 --> 01:12:23.611
The,

2963
01:12:23.611 --> 01:12:23.970
uh,

2964
01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:24.810
the earth is built.

2965
01:12:24.811 --> 01:12:25.580
I don't know if that's,

2966
01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:27.990
that's a theory that's been disproven or proven or what,

2967
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:32.580
I finally watched tangled and I really liked that movie movie man.

2968
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.180
My little,

2969
01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:33.511
my,

2970
01:12:33.511 --> 01:12:33.870
uh,

2971
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:34.500
my middle,

2972
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.970
middle one told me yesterday that she's not a,

2973
01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.030
she's not a fan of tangled anymore.

2974
01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:39.421
Why not?

2975
01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:40.890
She has this tangled fan and,

2976
01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.360
or this tangled thing and her,

2977
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:43.170
her room,

2978
01:12:43.170 --> 01:12:43.680
she's like,

2979
01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:44.820
I don't like tangle anymore.

2980
01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.440
It's funny thing about kids,

2981
01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:49.500
they love something and then they watched the fuck out of it.

2982
01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:51.360
It was Dora the explorer for a little while.

2983
01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:52.860
She would watch the fuck out the door.

2984
01:12:52.861 --> 01:12:55.020
They explore and now she doesn't want to have anything to do with it.

2985
01:12:55.230 --> 01:12:57.690
They move on to the next show and then it becomes the next show that they're

2986
01:12:57.691 --> 01:12:58.890
massively obsessed with.

2987
01:12:59.250 --> 01:12:59.461
You know,

2988
01:12:59.461 --> 01:13:01.110
it's really interesting but tangled down.

2989
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:03.150
But just a year ago,

2990
01:13:03.151 --> 01:13:03.984
man tangled,

2991
01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.320
you know when we took her to see it and then she saw did though in the movie and

2992
01:13:07.321 --> 01:13:09.180
then we got a DVD and brought it home.

2993
01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:10.290
Oh my goodness.

2994
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.090
She couldn't watch it enough man.

2995
01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:13.440
You know what's the craziest thing?

2996
01:13:13.441 --> 01:13:15.630
Because every time I launch a venture and venture time,

2997
01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:19.350
I have to watch the kids commercials that kids commercials for toys or the most

2998
01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:20.580
tripped out insane.

2999
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:21.450
Like if I was,

3000
01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:22.530
if you're a coke addict,

3001
01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:25.260
never watched kids cartoons during the day and look at the commercials.

3002
01:13:25.261 --> 01:13:26.220
There was one about these.

3003
01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:31.360
Th th the toy was little crabs that had makeup on and like really nice

3004
01:13:31.861 --> 01:13:34.500
hairstyles and it was just the commercial made no sense.

3005
01:13:34.501 --> 01:13:38.400
Like why would they be marketing to kids like dressing up crabs.

3006
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:39.630
It was intense.

3007
01:13:40.730 --> 01:13:41.850
That sounds ridiculous.

3008
01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.350
I tweeted something,

3009
01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:43.830
um,

3010
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:47.250
earlier today I retweeted something that someone's sent me where they were

3011
01:13:47.251 --> 01:13:51.690
talking about kids today and all the different people.

3012
01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:52.350
Um,

3013
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:54.870
I'm going to click on it just so everybody knows what it is.

3014
01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:57.180
R s a animate,

3015
01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:02.100
changing education paradigms and paradigm is spelled p a.

3016
01:14:02.101 --> 01:14:04.080
R.

3017
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:04.080
A.

3018
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:04.080
D.

3019
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:04.080
I.

3020
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:04.080
G.

3021
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:04.080
M.

3022
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:04.341
S if you,

3023
01:14:04.341 --> 01:14:05.940
you're a target like myself,

3024
01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:09.503
that was rude.

3025
01:14:09.630 --> 01:14:10.300
I apologize.

3026
01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:10.650
Um,

3027
01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:15.170
but this is a very interesting little thing that someone made a,

3028
01:14:15.171 --> 01:14:20.171
that points out how kids today are inundated with so much fucking massive,

3029
01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.600
massive amounts of information and that,

3030
01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:22.831
you know,

3031
01:14:22.831 --> 01:14:26.740
to take these kids and force them into watching something really boring all day,

3032
01:14:26.741 --> 01:14:27.700
like school,

3033
01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.770
like staring at a blackboard and then,

3034
01:14:29.771 --> 01:14:29.981
you know,

3035
01:14:29.981 --> 01:14:33.070
you wonder why they're incredibly,

3036
01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:34.820
you know,

3037
01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:37.390
detached from what's happening there.

3038
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:42.100
Their world is the world of explosions and fucking video games and intense music

3039
01:14:42.101 --> 01:14:42.400
on there

3040
01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.390
<v 3>on their iPhone.</v>

3041
01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:43.730
It's,

3042
01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:43.961
you know,

3043
01:14:43.961 --> 01:14:47.170
there's loud and emotional and you make them shut that off when you come into

3044
01:14:47.171 --> 01:14:48.880
this room to tell them boring shit.

3045
01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:49.421
You know,

3046
01:14:49.421 --> 01:14:52.890
I mean it's almost like what we know and he was talking about earlier about

3047
01:14:53.010 --> 01:14:53.720
<v 2>programming.</v>

3048
01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.310
I don't think it's like a conscious effort to do that.

3049
01:14:56.311 --> 01:14:59.130
I think it's just they're lazy and it's just the shit design.

3050
01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:03.930
But man to take kids and take them from the world that they can experience now

3051
01:15:03.931 --> 01:15:07.950
with the Internet and video games and movies and songs and cars and and and

3052
01:15:07.951 --> 01:15:12.210
technology and then make them sit in the fucking class and listen to stupid shit

3053
01:15:12.211 --> 01:15:13.044
all day.

3054
01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.550
<v 3>It's amazing what they need to do.</v>

3055
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:18.390
They totally need to do this electronic arts and teach Q and all these big video

3056
01:15:18.391 --> 01:15:22.090
game companies need to start selling video games that have to do with shit day

3057
01:15:22.091 --> 01:15:23.340
and what the teach the people.

3058
01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:23.881
If I,

3059
01:15:23.881 --> 01:15:28.260
if you ask me any question on fallout three or whatever like like about bottle

3060
01:15:28.261 --> 01:15:28.980
caps or whatever.

3061
01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:30.360
I know exactly what you're talking about.

3062
01:15:30.361 --> 01:15:31.021
I've memorized,

3063
01:15:31.021 --> 01:15:32.490
I have this thing memorized in my head.

3064
01:15:32.491 --> 01:15:33.510
I will never forget it.

3065
01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:34.480
I know the manager,

3066
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:35.370
if they should do,

3067
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:38.760
if you could teach kids through a video game that would actually let them like

3068
01:15:38.761 --> 01:15:42.810
go back on an adventure through time and they learn about history and like be a

3069
01:15:42.811 --> 01:15:43.500
part of it.

3070
01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:43.780
Yeah.

3071
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:45.330
You're George Washington,

3072
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:45.680
you,

3073
01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.510
you'll know everything about George Washington by the end of that video game.

3074
01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:49.800
And the kids will remember that.

3075
01:15:49.801 --> 01:15:51.280
Every single kid likes to play videos.

3076
01:15:51.281 --> 01:15:51.421
Yeah.

3077
01:15:51.421 --> 01:15:54.870
But you would go back there and just start pumping people go grand theft auto

3078
01:15:54.871 --> 01:15:57.600
style and started fucking shooting people off their horse and you make it.

3079
01:15:57.601 --> 01:15:59.270
So if you do any of that stuff you,

3080
01:15:59.271 --> 01:15:59.700
you,

3081
01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:02.080
you get taken away recess or you get a detention.

3082
01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.870
If you fucking shoot somebody in the kneecap,

3083
01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:04.890
you get detention.

3084
01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:05.733
<v 2>You know,</v>

3085
01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.430
I guess I can start at the beginning of the end though.

3086
01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:11.523
I Dunno.

3087
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.551
History.

3088
01:16:12.551 --> 01:16:13.384
Interesting.

3089
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:13.571
You know,

3090
01:16:13.571 --> 01:16:15.550
you'd have to have some really entertaining person,

3091
01:16:15.551 --> 01:16:18.750
like who is like a history major or a history professor rather.

3092
01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.130
It was just really good at figuring out the best way to,

3093
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:23.950
to construct the stories,

3094
01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:24.611
you know,

3095
01:16:24.611 --> 01:16:25.150
and getting,

3096
01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:27.490
getting you into it and then showing you cool shit too.

3097
01:16:27.491 --> 01:16:31.150
That's another one like showing you documentaries and cool pictures and stuff

3098
01:16:31.151 --> 01:16:31.870
like,

3099
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:34.600
but you know when you get to certain things like mathematics and stuff like

3100
01:16:34.601 --> 01:16:34.751
that,

3101
01:16:34.751 --> 01:16:38.460
how are you going to make a video game where kids learn math and they and that

3102
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:39.100
it's fun.

3103
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.800
It's fun for someone who wants to play like fallout or they'll do something like

3104
01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.671
call of duty,

3105
01:16:42.671 --> 01:16:45.190
you know you want to play call of duty and then maybe let's play numbers.

3106
01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:46.123
Right.

3107
01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:46.420
You know,

3108
01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:46.871
I wonder,

3109
01:16:46.871 --> 01:16:47.200
I wonder,

3110
01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.490
I don't think you can teach that

3111
01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:51.910
<v 3>unless it was something like a Sim city or some kind of like,</v>

3112
01:16:51.911 --> 01:16:52.720
you know you,

3113
01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:55.660
you're married to the octomom and it's like a math video game thing.

3114
01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.070
I guess so.

3115
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:58.210
Well some people love math.

3116
01:16:58.211 --> 01:17:01.660
I'm just talking shit cause some people actually sit down and do mathematics for

3117
01:17:01.661 --> 01:17:02.020
fun.

3118
01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:03.070
I hate math so much.

3119
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:06.880
We had tear Patrick and the studio the other day and her biggest turn on is a

3120
01:17:06.881 --> 01:17:08.980
guy that knows math can really,

3121
01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.450
you know why?

3122
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:14.030
Because she wants him to know exactly how many dicks she suck.

3123
01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.090
She wants him to really be able to wrap that around his head.

3124
01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:18.680
She was just not to be vague.

3125
01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:19.161
Oh honey.

3126
01:17:19.161 --> 01:17:20.070
I know you stock a couple of things.

3127
01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:20.390
Listen,

3128
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:21.290
I'm telling you bullshit.

3129
01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.250
Listen to me.

3130
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:23.630
Do you know what a million is?

3131
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:23.960
He?

3132
01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.190
Can you wrap your head around a million?

3133
01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:26.330
She was Prager's man,

3134
01:17:26.331 --> 01:17:27.440
she's starting to nice.

3135
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:28.221
She's got that little,

3136
01:17:28.221 --> 01:17:30.620
you know Prager juice on her chunk on her.

3137
01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:30.941
What?

3138
01:17:30.941 --> 01:17:31.581
She's got a little,

3139
01:17:31.581 --> 01:17:32.560
you know like that.

3140
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:33.920
She's got a little chunk tour.

3141
01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.090
You beat off to pregnant checks.

3142
01:17:35.091 --> 01:17:35.421
You sick.

3143
01:17:35.421 --> 01:17:37.190
Fuck I did because it's a different,

3144
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:38.091
do you know?

3145
01:17:38.091 --> 01:17:39.200
I don't look for it,

3146
01:17:39.201 --> 01:17:39.681
but I'll be like,

3147
01:17:39.681 --> 01:17:40.101
damn,

3148
01:17:40.101 --> 01:17:41.240
that girl was pregnant and hot.

3149
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:42.080
Double billing.

3150
01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:42.913
Oh really?

3151
01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:43.670
That's amazing.

3152
01:17:43.670 --> 01:17:45.110
So when you were around her and she was hot,

3153
01:17:45.111 --> 01:17:45.944
it was like exciting.

3154
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:46.280
It.

3155
01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:46.541
She,

3156
01:17:46.541 --> 01:17:47.374
she just,

3157
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.961
she,

3158
01:17:47.961 --> 01:17:48.171
you know,

3159
01:17:48.171 --> 01:17:49.070
there's a few girls,

3160
01:17:49.071 --> 01:17:49.610
like she's,

3161
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:51.230
she's just hot to be around.

3162
01:17:51.231 --> 01:17:51.411
You know,

3163
01:17:51.411 --> 01:17:52.240
there's a few guards with its,

3164
01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:52.460
you know,

3165
01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:54.560
smell like scold the girl school,

3166
01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:56.241
you know.

3167
01:17:56.241 --> 01:17:56.631
But you know,

3168
01:17:56.631 --> 01:17:56.961
she would,

3169
01:17:56.961 --> 01:17:58.160
she's gorgeous and she just,

3170
01:17:58.220 --> 01:17:58.430
she,

3171
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.581
you know,

3172
01:17:58.581 --> 01:18:01.700
she retired so she hasn't shot in like four or five years or something like

3173
01:18:01.701 --> 01:18:01.821
that.

3174
01:18:01.821 --> 01:18:01.901
She,

3175
01:18:01.901 --> 01:18:02.900
she's a born again virgin.

3176
01:18:02.901 --> 01:18:03.440
Basically.

3177
01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.490
She just released a new,

3178
01:18:04.491 --> 01:18:09.080
a photo shoot on some foreign magazine and she brought it and it was nice.

3179
01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:10.340
She has a nice body.

3180
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:14.600
She's pretty odd and a nice husband or boyfriend or father of the baby that's

3181
01:18:14.601 --> 01:18:14.930
coming.

3182
01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:15.763
What's he do?

3183
01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:16.430
A,

3184
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:17.400
he's a makeup artists.

3185
01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:18.110
Oh.

3186
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:20.780
But he just did like the new superman movie and stuff like that and said like,

3187
01:18:20.781 --> 01:18:21.590
he's a legit,

3188
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.741
like,

3189
01:18:21.741 --> 01:18:22.341
he was really cool.

3190
01:18:22.341 --> 01:18:23.240
He's a really nice guy.

3191
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:23.970
It's just a funny

3192
01:18:23.970 --> 01:18:24.221
<v 2>think we're,</v>

3193
01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:25.590
some dudes just can't accept that.

3194
01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:25.831
You know,

3195
01:18:25.831 --> 01:18:28.350
some dudes are never going to be able to accept the fact that check was a porn

3196
01:18:28.351 --> 01:18:28.740
star.

3197
01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:29.220
Yeah.

3198
01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:29.521
You know,

3199
01:18:29.521 --> 01:18:30.510
and some guys just like,

3200
01:18:30.511 --> 01:18:30.750
yeah,

3201
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:31.583
whatever,

3202
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:32.400
whatever.

3203
01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.233
I'm getting mine.

3204
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:34.350
Yeah.

3205
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:35.850
I Dunno.

3206
01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:37.590
It's interesting how weird we are with sex.

3207
01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.440
It's a strange culture where everything is sold with Saks,

3208
01:18:40.441 --> 01:18:41.700
but yet if you,

3209
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:42.810
you know,

3210
01:18:42.810 --> 01:18:44.280
she really get down to the nitty gritty.

3211
01:18:44.281 --> 01:18:46.560
We're really fucking weird about it.

3212
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:50.460
We're really insecure about it and insincere about it.

3213
01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:51.571
It's strange,

3214
01:18:51.571 --> 01:18:52.404
right?

3215
01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:54.750
We have a fucked up culture man.

3216
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:56.220
It is a weird culture.

3217
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:58.530
You actually try to suppress nature.

3218
01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:00.780
It's a strange,

3219
01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:02.250
strange fucking way we live man,

3220
01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.710
but selling things with pussy,

3221
01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:06.090
you know when that makes sense.

3222
01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:06.990
When you get married,

3223
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:08.101
when you get married,

3224
01:19:08.101 --> 01:19:11.100
it makes sense because when you're single and you could,

3225
01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:11.551
you know,

3226
01:19:11.551 --> 01:19:12.151
you know like,

3227
01:19:12.151 --> 01:19:14.700
well if this relationship doesn't work and we break up,

3228
01:19:14.701 --> 01:19:17.730
I'll find someone else and that'll be interesting because it'll be a new person.

3229
01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.850
But when you're married and your commit to this idea that you're just going to

3230
01:19:20.851 --> 01:19:22.680
be with this person for the rest of your life,

3231
01:19:23.010 --> 01:19:25.590
then you start like seeing some chicks selling watches.

3232
01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:25.950
Ooh,

3233
01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:27.000
that dirty bitch,

3234
01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.880
that dirty bitch with a fucking long legs.

3235
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:31.450
Like it really like attracts you.

3236
01:19:31.451 --> 01:19:31.621
Like,

3237
01:19:31.621 --> 01:19:34.200
maybe this Omega Watch is going to get me some of that,

3238
01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.221
you know,

3239
01:19:35.221 --> 01:19:36.420
it really does work.

3240
01:19:36.450 --> 01:19:36.781
You know,

3241
01:19:36.781 --> 01:19:37.051
it's,

3242
01:19:37.051 --> 01:19:37.621
it's funny,

3243
01:19:37.621 --> 01:19:42.180
it's like I guarantee you if you had a commercials for like a cell phone service

3244
01:19:42.181 --> 01:19:46.260
in Ethiopia and you showed like delicious food in the background,

3245
01:19:46.570 --> 01:19:46.801
you know,

3246
01:19:46.801 --> 01:19:47.790
like here's a cell phone,

3247
01:19:47.791 --> 01:19:48.990
it's fucking roast beef.

3248
01:19:48.991 --> 01:19:52.830
They're mashed potatoes and giant pictures of orange juice,

3249
01:19:52.831 --> 01:19:55.560
all this yummy food and these poor Fox would probably look at that like,

3250
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:56.340
oh,

3251
01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.720
and they would want to buy that cell phone.

3252
01:19:58.780 --> 01:19:59.613
Doesn't that make sense?

3253
01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.473
Yeah.

3254
01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:00.841
It's,

3255
01:20:00.841 --> 01:20:01.591
podcasts is over,

3256
01:20:01.591 --> 01:20:02.424
isn't it?

3257
01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.020
Pretty much.

3258
01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:04.201
Yeah,

3259
01:20:04.201 --> 01:20:05.034
sure.

3260
01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:06.940
<v 3>We've done I think over three.</v>

3261
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:08.430
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

3262
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:12.360
Well we had to come back cause I had to give my apology to Todd bridges.

3263
01:20:12.361 --> 01:20:14.940
I really do feel Bob felt I felt stupid about that.

3264
01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:16.920
And uh,

3265
01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:19.760
we really wanted to talk about fear factor because it was pretty fucking crazy.

3266
01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:20.121
Awesome.

3267
01:20:20.121 --> 01:20:20.601
I can't wait for it.

3268
01:20:20.601 --> 01:20:20.870
This,

3269
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:21.780
it was very rainy Monday,

3270
01:20:21.781 --> 01:20:22.110
right?

3271
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.351
Yeah.

3272
01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:24.330
Every Monday for a while we only did eight of them,

3273
01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.171
so it'll,

3274
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:26.070
it'll air quick.

3275
01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.460
But the ratings were giant.

3276
01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.200
There were monster.

3277
01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:28.831
Everybody's super,

3278
01:20:28.831 --> 01:20:29.900
super happy and you're going to,

3279
01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:30.601
next thing you know,

3280
01:20:30.601 --> 01:20:33.420
you're going to be picked up and knows like for another season and you're gonna

3281
01:20:33.421 --> 01:20:33.600
be like,

3282
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:33.921
Oh dude,

3283
01:20:33.921 --> 01:20:35.550
we start filming again in two weeks.

3284
01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:37.003
It could be,

3285
01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.150
and it's going to save you from the Japanese radiation.

3286
01:20:39.151 --> 01:20:40.230
I'm going to have to shave my head.

3287
01:20:40.231 --> 01:20:42.690
I can't keep looking at my balding head on TV.

3288
01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:43.860
It's just too sad.

3289
01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:45.930
I have to do something about this.

3290
01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:46.220
Oh,

3291
01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.120
well we're wigs.

3292
01:20:48.121 --> 01:20:48.660
That'd be funny.

3293
01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:48.760
Oh,

3294
01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:49.591
you wear a different wig?

3295
01:20:49.591 --> 01:20:50.490
Every red wig.

3296
01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:51.961
Red Wig,

3297
01:20:51.961 --> 01:20:52.920
like Bozo the clown.

3298
01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:56.131
That's what I'm gonna get.

3299
01:20:56.131 --> 01:20:56.851
I'm gonna get a red wig,

3300
01:20:56.851 --> 01:20:57.930
but it only on the sides.

3301
01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.100
Only like around the ears,

3302
01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:00.863
ear muffs.

3303
01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:01.710
Um,

3304
01:21:01.710 --> 01:21:02.790
this weekend we have,

3305
01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:03.090
oh,

3306
01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:04.950
if you want to come to that Chicago show,

3307
01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.120
it's almost sold out.

3308
01:21:06.121 --> 01:21:06.540
Folks.

3309
01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:06.721
Uh,

3310
01:21:06.721 --> 01:21:10.410
Chicago 20 January 27th,

3311
01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:14.010
2012 Joe Diaz and Duncan Trussell at the Chicago theater.

3312
01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:19.370
It's going to be off the fucking chain and that is the same weekend that Fox two

3313
01:21:19.531 --> 01:21:20.430
is scheduled.

3314
01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:21.160
So a,

3315
01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:22.760
that card is a great car.

3316
01:21:22.761 --> 01:21:25.890
Does Rashad Evans versus Phil Davis?

3317
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.590
Um,

3318
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:26.921
there's a,

3319
01:21:26.921 --> 01:21:29.310
there's a bunch of great fights on the undercard of that as well.

3320
01:21:29.311 --> 01:21:31.110
Michael Bisping versus Damien Maia.

3321
01:21:31.111 --> 01:21:32.310
That's a great fucking fight.

3322
01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.750
So it should be sick.

3323
01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:36.390
It's a great card for Chicago and um,

3324
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:38.460
it's gonna be awesome to be on Fox again.

3325
01:21:38.461 --> 01:21:42.420
And then the night before that we have a show at the Chicago theater and it's

3326
01:21:42.421 --> 01:21:43.770
the same place where the weigh ins are,

3327
01:21:43.771 --> 01:21:44.820
which is pretty bad ass.

3328
01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:45.571
Yeah.

3329
01:21:45.571 --> 01:21:48.400

a rare one.

3334
01:21:53.401 --> 01:21:54.840

Just chop off the very tip of it.

3352
01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.890
I can't believe you butchered it like that.

3353
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:27.240
It's Mrs Clause.

3354
01:22:27.241 --> 01:22:27.900
I caught it frozen.

3355
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:28.950
Mrs. Loss

3356
01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:31.670

3357
01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:32.341
Oh thank you.

3358
01:22:32.341 --> 01:22:33.840
Also to on at.com.

3359
01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.820
Makers of new mood.

3360
01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.680
These two I use on a regular basis,

3361
01:22:37.681 --> 01:22:38.940
new mood and Alpha brain.

3362
01:22:38.941 --> 01:22:41.010
And whenever I work out I use shroom tech.

3363
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.641
Uh,

3364
01:22:41.641 --> 01:22:41.970
new,

3365
01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:42.210
uh,

3366
01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:45.840
new mood is a five HTP a supplement and it also has,

3367
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:46.590
um,

3368
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:48.390
a field trip to fan which converts to it.

3369
01:22:48.391 --> 01:22:49.050
So it's,

3370
01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:49.471
it's a nice,

3371
01:22:49.471 --> 01:22:54.270
got a little time release effect and it really is like a nice mood stabilizer.

3372
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:55.410
I don't want to say stabilizer.

3373
01:22:55.411 --> 01:22:56.244
It's an enhancer.

3374
01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:57.093
Makes you feel good.

3375
01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:58.920
Neil Brennan is want to turn us onto it.

3376
01:22:58.980 --> 01:22:59.700
Um,

3377
01:22:59.700 --> 01:22:59.990
uh,

3378
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.211
I,

3379
01:23:00.211 --> 01:23:01.230
I appreciate it.

3380
01:23:01.231 --> 01:23:01.681
I like it.

3381
01:23:01.681 --> 01:23:02.670
Alpha brain as well,

3382
01:23:02.671 --> 01:23:04.860
which is a cognitive enhancing supplement that I,

3383
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.041
I swear by it.

3384
01:23:06.041 --> 01:23:06.970
Some people don't like it,

3385
01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:07.960
some people love it.

3386
01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.860
It's all on you.

3387
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:09.790
If you don't want it,

3388
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:10.390
don't,

3389
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:11.050
don't buy it.

3390
01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:12.610
If you do buy it and you don't like it,

3391
01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:14.620
hundred percent money back guarantee,

3392
01:23:14.621 --> 01:23:15.460
which is nice.

3393
01:23:15.670 --> 01:23:16.780
So even if you,

3394
01:23:16.810 --> 01:23:17.051
you know,

3395
01:23:17.051 --> 01:23:18.730
you don't have to send it back in and you eat it,

3396
01:23:18.731 --> 01:23:19.840
you say this shit sucks.

3397
01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:22.300
You get your money back if you're interested in it,

3398
01:23:22.301 --> 01:23:23.470
but you think it's too expensive,

3399
01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.420
please go to the website,

3400
01:23:25.421 --> 01:23:28.840
find the ingredient list and then buy this stuff in bulk and make your own shit.

3401
01:23:28.841 --> 01:23:30.190
And I'm more than welcoming.

3402
01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:31.720
I'm not trying to get rich off this,

3403
01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.750
but these are good products that I personally believe in.

3404
01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:38.140
[inaudible] and it's on a.com oh and and it,

you will get 10% off food and you get smarter.

3408
01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:47.080
What?

3409
01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.760
Flashlight really dropped the ball on that?

3410
01:23:48.761 --> 01:23:51.820
They should definitely have mrs clause fleshlight what the fuck happened?

3411
01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:54.640
Like be like creepy to be the best Christmas toy ever to give us a joke.

3412
01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:54.880
Yeah.

3413
01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.650
With white frosting around it,

3414
01:23:56.890 --> 01:23:57.880
like really wrinkled,

3415
01:23:57.881 --> 01:23:58.710
looking like,

3416
01:23:58.710 --> 01:24:00.140
like to super low.

3417
01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.270
Maybe it's not too late.

3418
01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.130
They have full factory dude.

3419
01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:04.090
First slide.

3420
01:24:04.090 --> 01:24:05.500
Feel free to use Brian's idea.

3421
01:24:05.501 --> 01:24:05.711
Brian,

3422
01:24:05.711 --> 01:24:06.870
you want any money for that now?

3423
01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:09.680
Just sponsored the death squad podcast sponsor that's from class.

3424
01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:10.331
Oh,

3425
01:24:10.331 --> 01:24:11.164
by the way,

3426
01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:13.580
if you want to listen to the icehouse chronicles,

3427
01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.800
we've been doing podcasts,

3428
01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:15.730
podcasts,

3429
01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:16.250
he,

3430
01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:17.530
that's like a podcast for cows.

3431
01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:22.060
We've been doing podcasts for the last four or five weeks doing this.

3432
01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:22.840
Um,

3433
01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.490
and we do them from live,

3434
01:24:24.491 --> 01:24:25.121
from the ice house,

3435
01:24:25.121 --> 01:24:26.470
and they're called the ice house chronicles.

3436
01:24:26.471 --> 01:24:27.340
And is my opinion,

3437
01:24:27.341 --> 01:24:29.980
one of the coolest podcast we do because you know,

3438
01:24:29.981 --> 01:24:30.370
it's not,

3439
01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:32.260
it might not be as structured as today's was,

3440
01:24:32.261 --> 01:24:32.891
which is today's,

3441
01:24:32.891 --> 01:24:33.161
you know,

3442
01:24:33.161 --> 01:24:34.480
this is a different kind of podcast.

3443
01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.810
Today's with Bruce Lipton was brilliant and he was,

3444
01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:37.481
it was amazing.

3445
01:24:37.481 --> 01:24:38.230
It was eyeopening.

3446
01:24:38.230 --> 01:24:39.340
It was like really,

3447
01:24:39.341 --> 01:24:41.380
really made you think about things and I really enjoyed it.

3448
01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:42.460
But um,

3449
01:24:42.490 --> 01:24:43.001
with the,

3450
01:24:43.001 --> 01:24:43.540
the d,

3451
01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:44.650
The icehouse chronicles,

3452
01:24:44.651 --> 01:24:45.550
it's really a hang.

3453
01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:46.511
It's all of us,

3454
01:24:46.511 --> 01:24:47.350
all of us comics.

3455
01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.430
It's a green room.

3456
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:49.930
It's a real green room for real,

3457
01:24:49.931 --> 01:24:50.381
legit.

3458
01:24:50.381 --> 01:24:51.340
It's uncensored.

3459
01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.760
It's everybody's sitting around and sometimes it needs to be censored,

3460
01:24:54.170 --> 01:24:55.820
but to Walsh fiasco.

3461
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:56.270
Oh yeah,

3462
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:58.240
I know I need to do about that.

3463
01:24:58.241 --> 01:24:58.900
I need to do,

3464
01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:00.690
need to delete that and get that off line.

3465
01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:01.973
Um,

3466
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:02.801
but it's,

3467
01:25:02.801 --> 01:25:03.130
um,

3468
01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:03.580
it's,

3469
01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.061
it's a,

3470
01:25:04.061 --> 01:25:08.650
it's a really fun podcast and the only way to get it is if you go to iTunes and

3471
01:25:08.651 --> 01:25:10.180
subscribe to the death squad.

3472
01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:11.610
Death Squad is a,

3473
01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:16.030
the podcast network that Brian Producers and it contains not just,

3474
01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:16.310

3475

3476
01:25:17.351 --> 01:25:19.060

3477
01:25:19.061 --> 01:25:21.060
Thomas Hager and Christina girl,

3478
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:24.580
even though she uses some other fucking name that's called your mom's house and

3479
01:25:24.581 --> 01:25:25.340
they have a great,

3480
01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:25.630
uh,

3481
01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:26.230
John Heffron.

3482
01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:27.300
We just had a lip.

3483
01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:28.120
The guy from,

3484
01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:28.810
uh,

3485
01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:30.610
what type maybe you show me the money.

3486
01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:32.700
Jerry Maguire Maguire and he,

3487
01:25:32.701 --> 01:25:36.490
he's been training Jujitsu and martial arts since he choked the fuck out of

3488
01:25:36.491 --> 01:25:36.611
jail.

3489
01:25:36.611 --> 01:25:37.444
I'm halfway done.

3490
01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.040
We had him on the show.

3491
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:39.940
He was so awesome.

3492
01:25:39.941 --> 01:25:40.774
Very interesting guy.

3493
01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:41.613
That's great man.

3494
01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:42.190
That's great.

3495
01:25:42.190 --> 01:25:42.760
That's good to hear.

3496
01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:42.971
It's,

3497
01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.800
he's a child star that actually survived.

3498
01:25:45.670 --> 01:25:46.630
That's why is that what it is?

3499
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:47.591
But we're also,

3500
01:25:47.591 --> 01:25:50.740
he'd stopped being famous for awhile and kind of like leveled out normal.

3501
01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.090
No good for him.

3502
01:25:52.150 --> 01:25:54.580
A thank you to everybody for tuning in.
