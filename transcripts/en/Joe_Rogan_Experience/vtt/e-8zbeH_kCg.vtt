WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.760
[inaudible].
We good?
Okay,
great.
Oh,
sorry.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.280
Chatting about Kombucha.
I just want to say before this podcast starts,

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.140
you fucked up Bell Toro.
You fucked up.
You fucked up.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.290
I've been telling everybody that Jimmy Smits the best out there forever and you

5
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:19.770
let them go.
That's,
that's,
that's a,
that's a huge error on their part.

6
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.780
We can't talk about anything.

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.590
It might be like some future news we can't talk about that.

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.340
We can put the past is the past is up for discussion.

9
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:33.090
That's passes up for discussion.
The president's good.
Thrilled.

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.330
If somehow or another they were able to work it out where Jimmy Smith was at the

11
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:39.030
UFC,
we shall see.
That would be what I would like to say.

12
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.240
We shall see how that goes.
I would like to see that.
We will,

13
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.550
that that's a big fuck up.
Yeah,
man.
It was,
um,
well let me say it like,

14
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.240
just a little background.
So lot of people been asking me,

15
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.130
I haven't made any real public statements other than I'm to del Toro Hater.

16
00:00:51.131 --> 00:00:55.150
I just want to say,
yeah,
no,
never had a bell toward here.
Respect.
Yeah.

17
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.050
I enjoy watching it and like the fighters and I've always told everybody that

18
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:00.290
you were the best out there.
Thank you so much.
Amazing job.

19
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.600
I really appreciate that.
Um,
number.
Well,
yeah,
it's,
it's not a,

20
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:05.790
it's not a belt with,
I mean,
they were great to work with.

21
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:09.900
They were great about the,
the whole breakup thing.
Someone say it.

22
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.810
Yeah.
So what happened was I was,

23
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.300
<v 1>I had a,
I had a,
a deal with,
with an option year in 2018 was my option here.</v>

24
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.280
And when I was in Verona,
New York doing the Verona show,

25
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.780
my boss sat me down and he said,

26
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:27.320
we're not going to renew 2018 we want a different,
we wanted different deal.

27
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.690
And when they come to you and say,
we want a different deal,

28
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.250
well if you're on a downgrade,
it's never,
it's never your,

29
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.330
when your girlfriend comes to you and says,
I want to talk,
it's never,

30
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.300
I don't give enough blowjobs that's never,

31
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.611
<v 0>that's never what,</v>

32
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:42.640
they never say that it's always going to be a better girlfriend.
Exactly.
Yeah.

33
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.870
It's,
it's always bad.
It's always bad.
So,
yeah,
that was it.

34
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.840
<v 1>When they were like,
we want to change the deal around.
I was like,
okay.</v>

35
00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:53.980
And they did make a like an honors Dev or to keep me,
they,
they,

36
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.740
they really tried,
but they just,
they didn't make an offer.
And that was,

37
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.760
that was worth me coming back.
And that was pretty much a deal.

38
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.340
<v 0>So it was kind of an amicable,
competitively,
amicable.</v>

39
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.160
It's fascinating to me that in,

40
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.980
in the world of a mixed martial arts professional,
mixed martial arts,

41
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.580
there haven't been that many people that have done you.
What you and I both do,

42
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:14.320
this is a small handful of people.

43
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.580
<v 1>You don't,
you,
the weird thing is about our job really in it,</v>

44
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:21.830
and I mean this from the bottom of my heart.
Um,
everybody thinks they got a guy.

45
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.430
It's,

46
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.520
it's one of those jobs that everybody thinks they can do that they really go,

47
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.220
we'll just throw a fighter and then he'll be able to,
it.
I've seen,

48
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.980
I don't know how many of the unfit they want to do,
you know,

49
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.170
even locker room interviews.
I want to get it next fight.

50
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:37.150
And you're that and it's,
it's a job.
It's a situation.
It's really,
I mean it's,

51
00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:40.190
it's one of those things where everybody thinks they can throw somebody in and

52
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:44.270
do it.
And I've seen,
I don't know how many try and it's,
it's tough.

53
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:46.770
You really have to work at it or having a knack for it.
It's,

54
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:50.330
it's not the kind of thing that,
you know,
it's almost like coaching.
I mean,

55
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.420
how many times you've heard,
I've heard of great,
great Jujitsu guys.

56
00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:55.850
Like it's just not a great guy.
He's naturally really good.

57
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:59.570
He's not that good at teaching it because Tim,
it just works and you try it.

58
00:02:59.571 --> 00:03:00.440
It doesn't work,
you know?

59
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.620
That's what I'm saying for a great fighter isn't a great coach,

60
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.940
a great fighters in Australia,
great broadcaster.
It just doesn't work that way.

61
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.020
So yeah,
some guys are just naturally good at it though.
Like for me,

62
00:03:10.021 --> 00:03:14.200
a is naturally fun.
Like when rose number Eunice knocked out,
you want to,

63
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.940
you and Jay check,
he starts yelling thug.
Whoa.
Oh.

64
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.730
Grows like,
that's just pure personality.

65
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:23.180
Like you either have that in you.

66
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.230
You can't fake yelling out thug rose after rose Nama Yunez Kaos are you.

67
00:03:28.231 --> 00:03:32.340
You can't fake enthusiasm and that's I think real enthusiasm.

68
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.570
Do just a few pages to really care about the sport.

69
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.580
There are two things that that,
well,

70
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:40.030
three things that we have to do is number one is to educate people.

71
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.770
A lot of people just most American,

72
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:43.960
it's weird because most Americans didn't grow up wrestling.

73
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:45.930
They didn't grow up doing.
When we tie that didn't grow up doing Jujitsu.

74
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.270
So a lot of our sport is at least partially we're introducing them to it.

75
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.520
My mom doesn't know the difference between a knee bar and a leg lock.

76
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.760
She knows boxing.
She grew up watching boxing,
so she has a background in that.

77
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.170
So you know,

78
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.810
we have to explain line number two is we've got to communicate enthusiasm.

79
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.300
We're happy to be here.
How great this thing is.

80
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.210
You should want to be here to that.

81
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.650
That's number two and number three is the story.

82
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:08.680
Every fight has a story and even if we don't tell the story,

83
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.780
we at least give them the option of the story.

84
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.680
Was Buster Douglas always a great fighter and we didn't know it.

85
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.490
Did he have one great night?
Was Mike Tyson unprepared that night?
Was Mike Tyson?

86
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.390
Not as good as we thought it was.

87
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:23.000
We were literally pops up that in the last podcast,
buster Douglas,

88
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.530
his mom died before the fight and he was just motivated.

89
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:29.500
Like he'd never been motivated before and got himself in really good shape and

90
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:33.100
had a mission.
Right.
Galvanized him like crazy.
The death of his mother.
But,

91
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.030
but it's our job to write an antiplatelet makes it more exciting,

92
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.370
you know,
what are we seeing here?
I was saying,
wow,

93
00:04:40.371 --> 00:04:43.690
it's might just having an off night is buster just having a great night?

94
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:45.370
Was Buster always great and we didn't know it.

95
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.000
There are a million ways to see the story and mostly play by play,
doesn't it?

96
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:51.100
But we do it every now and then about,
hey,
you know,
this is,

97
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.810
this could be a new thing,
could be an old thing.

98
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.730
And it's our job to tell that story a little bit.
Well,

99
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:59.230
especially when it comes to results that we think happened and why they happen

100
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.000
in certain fights and corrections that were made,

101
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:02.580
which is on the technical side of things time,

102
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.820
the worst side of things in the ground too,
which is huge.
And you're one of the,

103
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.890
I mean,
how many guys are doing it,
but you're,

104
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.730
you're a legit Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.
Thank you.
Thanks Bridgette.

105
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.830
I think that's important.
Yeah.
I think you have to understand transitions.

106
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.360
You've gotta understand danger.

107
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.940
You've got an understand when someone's doing the right thing and then the

108
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:22.470
percentages of them getting sub drop substantially with each move you've gotta

109
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.700
be there.
See,
seeing every step of the way going,

110
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:27.460
this guy's going to bail on this anytime now here comes to scramble,

111
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.480
what would I do?

112
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.170
How do I anticipate this going down and being explained to people so they follow

113
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:36.760
along and when you do it and I follow along,
it makes it more enjoyable to me.

114
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.920
And that's so mean.
I think we talked about,
I dunno,

115
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.020
you know if we talked about this before,

116
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:46.021
but I called Dana white about you like how many years ago for lack of trying to

117
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.400
get Jamie Smith hired by the UFC like four years ago,
four years ago.
I was like,

118
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:54.040
dude,
you want better people?
You want more people?
Yeah,
go higher.

119
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:56.890
That fucking guy.
Yeah,
I go that guy.
He knows what he's doing,
man.

120
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.750
He knows what he's doing.
He's excited.
He loves the sport.
And I was telling him,

121
00:06:00.751 --> 00:06:03.500
you're a great guy.
And we talk.
He's genuine.
I go,

122
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:06.130
he's a real fan and he's fucking really good at it,
man.
Go get them.

123
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.630
Really love it.
I mean,
I love the sport.

124
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.650
I love it 100% and know the timing didn't work out then and then now I'm

125
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.550
currently unemployed.
Well,
you got to call some fucking badass fights though,
man.

126
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.900
You know Bella Tours,

127
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.370
welterweight division in particular is God damn stacked right now.

128
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.090
You know what's funny?

129
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.250
There are certain fighters and I was thinking about it as I'm watching the

130
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:26.810
Cyborg fight last Saturday.

131
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.190
There are certain fighters you meet and it's like stunning.
Certain athletes,

132
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:33.830
when you,
when you meet Lebron James,
you go,
Jesus Christ,

133
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:37.100
like I've seen him on TV.
When you see me in real life,
you'd go,
Holy Shit.

134
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:41.280
That guy's being cyborg is one of those.
Douglas Lema is one of those.

135
00:06:41.281 --> 00:06:45.830
If you ever met him,
when you meet that guy,
you go,
God,
you make 170 pounds.

136
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.910
He's huge.
He is massive.
What do you think?

137
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:54.160
He walks around at two 10 to tell me that's what he told you.
Let me put these.

138
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.470
So already,
when King Mo fought rampage,

139
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.880
alright Kimbo was to 18 he stepped on scale to 18 I,

140
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.470
so the night of the fight I got,
you know,

141
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:06.560
Doug scene was there and I walk up to him and I go,
you've walked into a team?

142
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.620
And he goes,
yeah.
He's like,
wow,
I want to eat too much.
I like,
I shouldn't,

143
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:10.454
but I have,

144
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.620
he has walked around at what King Mo walked around at cause chemo would stepped

145
00:07:14.621 --> 00:07:17.670
on on scale really wasn't cut to make you 20.
I mean cause the,

146
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.410
the weight glasses to 20 when you fought rampage.
He walks around chemo size.

147
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.560
Like if they are the same size that is so insane.
He makes one 70.

148
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.610
He has the worst cut in terms of pounds of herbs.

149
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:32.750
He deals with it well.
Um,
but he has one of the biggest cuts I've ever seen,

150
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.301
you know,

151
00:07:33.301 --> 00:07:37.670
if he's really good with [inaudible] wasn't under on any ivy and restrictions.

152
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.330
Um,
I,
I think it's by state.
We weren't as a promotion under it,
I don't think.

153
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:46.331
I think it's by state because I think the hardcore pro testing got instituted by

154
00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:51.320
Usada when Devinsky came along and I think that's when they stopped ivs.

155
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.220
I think states still allow them,
as far as I know,
it's still state for us.

156
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.770
And so what was that?
People don't know what we're talking about.

157
00:07:57.771 --> 00:07:58.604
What that means is,

158
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:03.080
and this is up for debate because Joe Silva claimed that they had been test

159
00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:04.610
Dunn's.
What he was telling me,

160
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:09.611
and I believe him that showed that the correct way of rehydrating orally,

161
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:15.020
I'm actually led to better results over a 24 hour period.
I've heard that,
yeah,

162
00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:19.040
that the [inaudible] thing was good for short term recovery from severe

163
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:23.090
dehydration,
but to actually go from like a weight cutting weight to go back,

164
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.850
I don't know,
I didn't read any of the studies,

165
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.280
but I do know about the inherent dangers of severe weight cuts,
kidney failure.

166
00:08:31.281 --> 00:08:33.630
You know there's some couple of people that died over the last year,

167
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.090
a professional or a restaurant.
Every,
every few years a wrestler dies down.

168
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.110
A young amateur Muay Thai fighter died Australia.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The,
the,

169
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:45.560
the issue that people have trouble understanding.
Well first off,
I've,

170
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:46.701
to the ivy point,

171
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:50.630
I've heard coaches say it's just for their head day feel better once they like

172
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.800
they think they need the IV and it's like a placebo.
I've had coaches tell me,

173
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.810
it's pretty much a placebo.
You,
you can't do it that much.
One there.
Now,

174
00:08:57.811 --> 00:08:58.141
once again,

175
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:01.080
I haven't read the studies but I've had coaches told me that that's my provider

176
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:04.650
just needs it for his head.
It used to be like what we'd assume you had to have.

177
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.030
Like if a guy is going to cut a lot of weight,

178
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.330
it's got to have a guy ready with an,
I mean how many bags did you take?

179
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.920
That was the thing that everybody always brought immediately.
How many bags?

180
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.310
The two things that,
that people don't really know when people ask me,

181
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:17.100
cause I've been in this since about 2099 is when I first started.

182
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.290
2099 you're from the future and the future.

183
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.880
2099 2009 to 2000 comma 99.
Um,

184
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.030
guys didn't cut like they do now.
And when you look at old UFC is,

185
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.880
and you'll look at the size of these guys,
Tito's one,

186
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:32.610
a few guys who was now a legit to a five.

187
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.360
Frank shamrock is like my size.
Yeah.

188
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.130
For shamrock was very small for the incredible,
smart,
passionate.
We thought Pete,

189
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.960
when he fought Tito Ortiz and frank shamrock fought,

190
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:47.961
it was one of the very first displays of defense and and cardio and how critical

191
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:52.110
it was in victory.
He was lighter,

192
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:55.740
he was only like one 90 when they fought and he was able to pull the closed the

193
00:09:55.741 --> 00:10:00.180
one 98 Austin while we call it taking stuff out of his pockets.
Like,
like a joke,

194
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:01.014
like I'm fully clothed.

195
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.810
So guys cut more than they did in the early parts of the sport.

196
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.020
I mean they just cut a lot more.
And when people ask me,
well,

197
00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:08.820
what do you do about weight cutting?
How do we change it?

198
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.110
One of the things about fighting in general,
and this goes to with,
you know,

199
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.820
other aspects of the sport you're asking people who already take a huge risk

200
00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:21.540
finding is just a huge risk period to not take another huge risk.

201
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:26.100
Just the mentality of if I have to do this twin,
I'm going to do it.
It's,

202
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.470
you know,
you're saying all they need,
they can't take that risk.
Well,

203
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:31.080
they're already,
you're already have the personality of,

204
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.720
I don't care what I have to do,
I'm getting in that fight and I'm making it.

205
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.840
So it's,
it's,
it's a hard,
it's,
you know,
what rule can you make it?

206
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:38.581
It's hard to do.

207
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:42.690
You're talking about a group of people that are already used to taking a huge

208
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.010
dangerous physical risks to even get in there.
So adding on the weight cut,

209
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.670
they're going to take that gamble every time.
No,
I know.
It's crazy.
You,

210
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:51.900
if they can,
uh,

211
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:56.901
one fc though is instituting some interesting new rule changes and one FC is

212
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.640
doing hydration tests and they,

213
00:10:59.641 --> 00:11:01.950
they've done in high schools now for wrestling that ended up for him.

214
00:11:01.951 --> 00:11:06.270
They should,
they should.
And uh,
who,
God,
who,

215
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.220
I'm trying to remember who told me that this weekend,

216
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.410
but they're essentially saying they're going to be able to band weight cutting.

217
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.440
They're just going to be able to institute that no one's gonna be able to cut

218
00:11:13.441 --> 00:11:16.260
weight.
You're just,
if you,
if you pass the hydration test,

219
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.490
you're not gonna be able to cut weight.

220
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.670
So you have to pass this hydration tested every form at every turn.

221
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:25.340
You can't just get on the scale and you weigh 170 pounds.
Oh,
congratulations.
No,

222
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.260
no,
no,
no,
no.
You weigh 170 pounds,
but you're in danger.
Like look at your body,

223
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.770
but your hydration level,
are they,
are they testing?

224
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.300
Apparently they're doing it and card falling apart.
Of course not you,
not you.

225
00:11:36.301 --> 00:11:39.120
And then a half the car falls apart.
Yeah.
The wonder what they did.

226
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.160
So when would this,
so that's my question.
Well,

227
00:11:41.161 --> 00:11:44.320
they'd have to do it early and blow all the weight classes up.
Yeah.

228
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.240
That's what we're,
we were having this conversation shift.
Everybody won at least.

229
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.440
Or if you don't even shift them one,
you find out like what?
What?
Wait,

230
00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:53.710
are you really,
you know,

231
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:57.520
I mean you could be like a Luke Rockhold dude who's a giant one 80 fiver.
I mean,

232
00:11:57.521 --> 00:12:00.490
Luke easily looks like he could be a heavyweight.
He's walking around,

233
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.580
he's like two 20 or two 30 or something like that.
And then he gets to,
I'm,

234
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.710
maybe he's mad at me right now.
I don't really have lean muscle,

235
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.260
not,
I might be exaggerating,
but at the very least when he gets down from,

236
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.940
uh,
down to one 85,

237
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:19.690
he's probably coming from 200 plus pounds and a big tall two oh five.

238
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.440
But then there's other guys that just don't cut that much at all.
And,
but,

239
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:23.851
but what,

240
00:12:23.851 --> 00:12:28.510
what gets me is there's no hard and fast body type role.

241
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:31.240
Like I said,
Doug Summa is huge.
He makes it every time.

242
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.150
Do you ever talk to him about how he does it?
Uh,

243
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.080
he's told me little things cause he used to not do it well and he looked like

244
00:12:38.081 --> 00:12:42.040
death in the last few fights.
He's looked much better cause like,
yeah,
he just,

245
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.880
he tended to boot up to like two 10 to 15 and he's American top team,
right?
Yeah,

246
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:51.280
they have coconut creek though.
Atlanta somewhere.
Oh real.

247
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.510
It's somewhere down south where he says he might go there and as far or

248
00:12:53.511 --> 00:12:54.270
something,
but he's,

249
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.310
he's not at the main main facility most live there or are they all like a

250
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.660
integrated like Gracie Baha?
Yeah,
that kind of thing.
Yeah.
The same team.

251
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:05.350
So he goes around and get work,
but it's,
it's,
and then I have guys,
you know,

252
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.500
Fernando Gonzalez never makes weight and he looks like he's got something to

253
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:11.230
lose.
Like he's not the worst shredded,
biggest one 70 and it,

254
00:13:11.231 --> 00:13:14.890
he always has trouble with it.
So it's weird.
Certain guys,
you're like,
man,

255
00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:16.180
there's no way that guy could make it.
He always does.

256
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:17.500
And certain guys look like they should be.

257
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:19.810
I'll make it pretty easily and just don't,
it's,
it's strange.

258
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.690
So there's no easy rules what I'm saying.
But they're huge at one 35 huge.

259
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.760
And he made it.
He's a wrestler his whole life.
He makes it every time.

260
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:31.210
And he's a giant.
Yeah.
I mean like how much of it is discipline?

261
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.690
How much of is a really good game plan and a really good nutritionist like

262
00:13:34.691 --> 00:13:39.130
Cyborg or,
excuse me,
a number of Madoff made weight easily this time.
Yeah.

263
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:40.120
And you know,

264
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.600
Cyborg obviously had a hard time trying to one 40 but at one 45 she's been

265
00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:46.750
successful.
Like cutting the away.
Yeah.
But for normal amount off.

266
00:13:46.751 --> 00:13:51.550
He said some real fucking problems making 55 this time.
No problems look amazing.

267
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.870
Well,
one of the things,
you know,

268
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.260
once again going back to storytelling for us is when someone doesn't make it,

269
00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:00.340
they don't make weight.
Is it advantage the heavier guy or his advantage,

270
00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:02.770
the guy who if you don't make weight,

271
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.860
maybe something happened that last couple of weeks of camp that maybe it'll

272
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.210
injury kept you from losing the weight or is it advantage of the bigger guy is,

273
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.610
is it better to come in big or did the guy who make wait,

274
00:14:12.611 --> 00:14:15.280
was he a little more disciplined at the end and he has an advantage in the fight

275
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.660
you,
you don't know at the time?
Well,

276
00:14:16.661 --> 00:14:20.020
the problem with Nurburg Madoff obviously was the last fight before this

277
00:14:20.021 --> 00:14:22.330
previous spectacular fight with Barboza.

278
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.700
He didn't make the way because he had to go to the hospital.

279
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.140
So that's a different animal.
That's like you pushed it so far that they were,

280
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:31.120
they wanted to make sure that you stayed alive,

281
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.320
so they had to bring it to a hospital.

282
00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:34.810
So they obviously realize there's some changes that need to be made.

283
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:38.890
They made those changes and fucking hell on Friday or Saturday night rather

284
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.900
fucking hell.
Unbelievable.
That was,
it's really weird.
Sometimes when you,

285
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.380
in any sport,
I don't care what it is.
When you see somebody,

286
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.990
you know Jordan in his prime,
you just,
you just can't cover the guy.

287
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:54.000
It's almost like he's the one on the court.
Yeah,
no number.
Get mouth.

288
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.760
It was like he was the only one in the cage.
It was just,

289
00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:00.470
everything was inevitable.
Everything was inevitable.
Yeah.
It was inevitable.

290
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:04.310
The beatings were inevitable.
You know,
even if you hit them,
congratulations.

291
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.540
Now you're on your ass getting punched in the face over and over again.

292
00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:11.080
You can't get up.
You're getting mauled brake immediately and,

293
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:15.860
and it against an excellent fighter.
I still forget Barboza is amazing.

294
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:20.360
Amazing.
And he made him look like he just,
the look on his face when he got up,

295
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.560
when Barboza was like,
hey,
you were better than me.
I didn't know.

296
00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:28.250
It was almost like a,
yeah,
like a shrine.
I wasn't even mad.
It was just,

297
00:15:28.251 --> 00:15:31.640
when you see somebody that much better,
it's,
it's back to the drawing board.

298
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.750
So I was super impressed with Barboza being able to make it to the final bell.

299
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.020
I mean that was amazing just being able to do that.

300
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:42.950
That shows you what a dominant performance it was by a guy like Khabib.

301
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:48.140
But you also realize like what a world class fighter Barboza is that he did,

302
00:15:48.141 --> 00:15:51.920
keeps throwing a wheel kicks in the third round and even landed one of them.

303
00:15:51.921 --> 00:15:55.610
It just didn't have much on an engine.
But fuck man,

304
00:15:55.611 --> 00:16:00.611
he was still trying to win after a horrendous modeling for eight plus minutes.

305
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.690
You don't want,
I really look at fighters when I really,

306
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.710
when I really focus on them,
especially the face in between rounds,

307
00:16:06.711 --> 00:16:11.120
I look for that breaking moment of like,
I,
you know,
uh,
Vito Belfort,

308
00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:11.631
Randy couture,

309
00:16:11.631 --> 00:16:15.500
he's sitting on the ground just like sit on a stool and sat on the ground like

310
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:17.540
beat and I'm like,
this guy's beat.
It's,
it's,

311
00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:20.540
when you look at them in between rounds and you see that,
like,

312
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.080
what am I doing in here?
That's when you know,

313
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:28.310
you know the men from the boys mentally speaking and you know in,
in,

314
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:32.780
in belt where Patricia pitbull and when we fought,
when he fought Daniel Straus,

315
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.670
he's getting beat up for like four rounds every round.
He looked like Lemmy Adam.

316
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.140
There was,
there wasn't any one.

317
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.080
And then toward the end of the fourth round with a rear naked choke,

318
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.500
he just never quits.
And I always looked for that breaking moment,
man.

319
00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:47.150
That's when,
that's when you really,

320
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.780
that's what really separates the guys who are mentally 100% there on those ones.

321
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.750
Those ones,
I think Barboza got beaten,
but I don't think you've got broken.
No,

322
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:56.900
I don't think so.
If you think about the amount of time during that fight,

323
00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:59.150
he was actually getting his ass kicked.
When I said eight,

324
00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:00.710
a family mindset rounds.
I met minutes.

325
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:05.000
I think there was like eight minutes of prolonged top time and beating in that

326
00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:09.710
fight.
Yeah.
Plus,
and then there's all the backward movement trying to get away,

327
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.110
throwing those inside leg kicks and doing everything he can,

328
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.370
everything they can to create space.
But for eight fucking minutes,

329
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.320
he never gave up.
We was just,
or whatever it was,

330
00:17:18.321 --> 00:17:21.980
15 minutes could just getting the fuck beaten out of him.
He kept trying to win.

331
00:17:21.981 --> 00:17:26.210
He wasn't capable of doing it,
but he never broke a teddy atlas.
Said,

332
00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:27.140
fighters make an agreement,

333
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.290
I'll stop trying to win and you'll stop trying to hurt me.
Whoa.
Yeah,

334
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.170
and he never did that.
He never went,
let's just go away.

335
00:17:33.171 --> 00:17:36.620
Just like leave me alone and I'll back up and you can beat me.
He never did that.

336
00:17:36.621 --> 00:17:39.920
He kept her on the whole time,
which is incredible,
but just no answer.

337
00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:41.990
How many 10 eights were there on a scorecard like,
well,

338
00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:45.100
the thing is one and one that I attended every round,
it was at least one.

339
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.530
It was the old scoring to then Nevada has an adopted the rules,

340
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.860
so in the for people don't know the new rules make it easier to make

341
00:17:52.861 --> 00:17:55.740
distinctions between a ten nine round,
ten eight round ten seven round.

342
00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.590
Which I agree.
You know,
Nevada is not,
that's an old school.
Ten eight yeah.

343
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.270
There was some ridiculous scorecards that it seemed to indicate some of us that

344
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.900
even though the new rules are better and the states haven't adopted them,

345
00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:14.730
the judges have decided to adopt them and some sort of a weird non declared way

346
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.820
cause it does definitely seem there was a much larger disparity in the numbers

347
00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:22.500
and the scorecards.
Yeah but a Nigga man off just,
just Malden,

348
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:27.300
Malden,
I mean mauled him in a way that you go,
Oh God you're not even there.

349
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:32.870
He's just on such another level that the odds of you beating him drop so

350
00:18:34.501 --> 00:18:37.620
substantially after the first minute and a half after you get,

351
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.830
you saw the look on Barboza his face and he's like two minutes plus into the

352
00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:43.230
first round and he's trying to get up and you see the look in his face.

353
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.020
He's like fuck,
how am I going to deal with this?

354
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.740
Like this is so next level.
You know what's really funny,

355
00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:53.580
it's almost to me like a throwback kind of fighter in in a sense of,

356
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.940
if you remember back in the day guys that that didn't have a real solid

357
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.670
wrestling or Jiu Jitsu background when they felt that pressure that kind of
went,

358
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.030
oh my God,
this age didn't have any experience with it.
They were just like,

359
00:19:03.031 --> 00:19:04.800
holy crap,
like a truck rolling over you.

360
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.990
You almost will that look on his face like,

361
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.530
oh like I've never felt anything like this and life and for someone training it

362
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.570
proposes level but you know it's dreaming of high level.

363
00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:16.380
Guys are dream with all kinds of outstanding wrestlers in Jujitsu guys to have

364
00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:18.570
that look like this is some crazy pressure.

365
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.450
That's insane because no one has secret techniques anymore.

366
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.250
It's not going to just not divided skill wise.

367
00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:27.570
I mean you'll have great guys in every camp and the fact that you see on

368
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:29.660
someone's eye,
and I say this to fight as I go,

369
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.770
you don't want the first time you experienced something to be in the cage.

370
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.440
You want to experience this in training and then you can deal with it in the

371
00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:35.274
kitchen.

372
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.610
Barbosa had a look in his eye like I have never felt anything like this in my

373
00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:41.550
mind and that's incredible considering modern techniques.

374
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:46.290
Well it seems to me that everything right now is his next level in comparison to

375
00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:47.520
a year and a half,
two years ago.

376
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.610
Like dos Anjos beat Robbie Lawler recently and just a fucking Tour de force to

377
00:19:53.281 --> 00:19:55.650
force performance.
Watch that fight.
I was like,

378
00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:58.800
this is as good as Dosantos has ever looked,
if not better,

379
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.810
fucking amazing at one 70 but more importantly like the output,

380
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.840
the f,
the,
the,
the amount of shots that he landed,

381
00:20:06.841 --> 00:20:08.310
the amount of shots that he fired,

382
00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.780
the endurance that he's showing everybody is on this complete different

383
00:20:12.781 --> 00:20:14.130
performance level right now.

384
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.150
What I loved about that performance is one thing that generally doesn't change

385
00:20:18.151 --> 00:20:21.600
weight class as well.
When you move up it is power.
Meaning Robbie law,

386
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:24.390
if you remember at one seven he was not going to read out one 85 he was like so,

387
00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:27.180
so the shot that knocks somebody out at 70 you when you will need to strike

388
00:20:27.181 --> 00:20:29.210
force 25 isn't going to knock out Jakarta.

389
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.570
It's not going to knock out Bob Ballou.

390
00:20:30.571 --> 00:20:32.520
It's not going to knock out these big one any fibers.

391
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.820
So a lot of power punchers have trouble changing weight classes because the

392
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:37.200
powershot just doesn't go with them.

393
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:43.010
Dos Anjos looked like he knew that and when I got a volume guys I one 70 I'm not

394
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:47.650
going to knock anybody out with one shot at at 50 like I did it 55 I have to

395
00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:51.040
throw more at 70 I have to be more accurate at 70 you have to slice them up with

396
00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:51.820
those little ones.

397
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.310
So I like all the adjustments he made for the new weight class.

398
00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:56.710
He didn't try and fight like you did at 55 he's like,

399
00:20:56.711 --> 00:20:57.910
I got to throw more against these guys.

400
00:20:57.911 --> 00:21:01.690
I can't go one punch for one punch with Robbie Lawler is a huge one 70 so I

401
00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:04.850
liked the way his style modified with with the weight class change while lot

402
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.990
guys can do that.
I agree.
And I also think the use of leg kicks is critical.

403
00:21:07.991 --> 00:21:09.310
You've got to slow Robbie down.

404
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.630
Rob is a big heavy guy and he immediately started chopping that.

405
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.730
It is crazy to me also that that low calf Kik is becoming such a giant factor in

406
00:21:18.641 --> 00:21:22.120
MMA.
That kick is just dominant now.
Everybody's using it.

407
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.210
[inaudible] have to do after you knocked him out and couldn't walk on,

408
00:21:25.211 --> 00:21:29.110
he knocks him out and was like limping over to this corner going I you know one

409
00:21:29.111 --> 00:21:30.070
more and I'm done.

410
00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.790
That was one of the greatest comeback from behind knockouts ever.
He's,

411
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:37.350
he's eating all those leg kicks and Melvin is just coming out.

412
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.260
You can see that if folks see it cause it's,
it's awesome.

413
00:21:40.261 --> 00:21:41.770
And Melvin is just owning that leg.

414
00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.820
Got a little aggressive as as Melvin Manhoef does and got clipped,

415
00:21:45.821 --> 00:21:49.780
man got clipped with a haymaker Hail Mary makers,
Hail Mary man.

416
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.160
And then one on the way down to,
yeah,
when he was,
when he was out and then boom.

417
00:21:54.161 --> 00:21:58.360
And he goes and Shannon number that Tiki sitting there and lands with a shot.

418
00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.150
Yeah.
Yeah.
Robbie was a brutal,
brutal knockout artist.

419
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.940
I always wanted to see a rematch,
but he chained him and Nick Diaz,

420
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.100
I think everybody wants to see that.
Awesome.

421
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.870
How is it possible that that didn't take place?

422
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:12.120
It's where there's certain matches that,
that you wonder,
how did that not,

423
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:16.310
you know,
the,
the run Vandelay was on [inaudible] never,
never have,

424
00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.660
I mean there's certain ones you can,
man,
I can't believe that.
Find a wrap.
Again,

425
00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.850
that's certainly one.
I'm still could that could hypothetically,
I mean,

426
00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:25.120
we still sell like crazy.
I mean,
I wonder if Nick Diaz,
if he wanted to come back,

427
00:22:25.121 --> 00:22:26.980
would only want to come back for a title fight.

428
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.000
I'm wonder if he's like that kind of money fight guy where it's like,
yeah,

429
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:34.570
obviously he's got some money and obviously he's not beaten down anybody's door

430
00:22:34.571 --> 00:22:38.140
to fight.
No,
he's not.
You know,
he's doing whatever the fuck he wants to do.

431
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.630
But if you could get him back for a big money fight,

432
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.210
I wonder if it only be like a title fight that's increasing.

433
00:22:43.211 --> 00:22:46.030
What's happening these days.
I mean guys are like,
God,
if I'm not getting the GSP,

434
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.470
yeah,
it came back for a huge money fight and that's it.
You know it's funny.

435
00:22:50.471 --> 00:22:52.280
Dana White said something crazy like a,
yeah,

436
00:22:52.281 --> 00:22:54.490
I was just going to pack up his money and head back.

437
00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.400
Check three suitcases to hold all of it.
He did big money fights stuff.

438
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:05.530
One of the title and then retired.
Yes.
I mean look,
as far as like legacy,

439
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:08.550
if he wanted to end it right there,
that's a pretty nice cherry.
Yeah,

440
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.570
that's a nice one.
That's pretty nice.
Cherry with a finish.
Yeah.

441
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.670
That's pretty awesome.
Come back up.
Choke the champ asleep and say,
Nah,

442
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:20.530
I'm good now.
Do you think,
do you think he comes back for any other fighter?

443
00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.980
Michael Bisping was the perfect guy for him to come back and fight.

444
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:27.490
I think these perfect guy from there,
he comes back for Connor.
Yeah,

445
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.220
that's the fight,
but I don't think they want to do that.

446
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.300
I don't think stylistically it's,
it's,
I make,

447
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:38.140
it certainly happened with certainly sell,
but we know how GSP fights.
Hey,

448
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.980
he's a giant compared to Connor.
He's,
he has a wrestling heavy style.

449
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.730
I don't think it's a,
it's a great team.

450
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.610
I don't think it would be hard for Connor to look good in that fight is the,

451
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.990
I said it,
it'll be hard for him.
Even if he,

452
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.210
it'd be hard for kind of look good unless he,
he caught him coming in,

453
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:52.130
which no one's been able to really do against GSP.

454
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.440
They would have to do some sort of a catch weight.
Yeah.

455
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.780
Because their body composition would just be so much different.

456
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:59.300
It wouldn't work if they really did one 70 and you know,

457
00:23:59.301 --> 00:24:02.780
that was an issue that he had with Nate,
but Nate is a legit one 50 fiver.

458
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:06.200
He kept saying,
Hey,
you got to have some fucking natural boots.
They're like that.

459
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.480
Nate is a big long guy and he does get heavy in between foot.

460
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:14.330
But the reality is he fought successfully made wa wait one 55 on numerous

461
00:24:14.331 --> 00:24:18.800
occasions easily.
You know,
fought in the ultimate fighter at one 55.

462
00:24:18.801 --> 00:24:19.634
That's his weight.

463
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.210
And that was another one of those one when he came up from 45 55 I think he was

464
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:26.120
still in that one shot mode.
And if you watch that fight again,

465
00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.410
kind of hits some goes shit.
Yeah,

466
00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:32.150
he's still here because I'm at 55 and not only does the US have a great chin,

467
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.630
he's a big 50 fiver.
He's well hydrated.
And especially when they fought,

468
00:24:35.631 --> 00:24:38.990
the first one was one,
one 70.
He's hydrated,
you know,
he hasn't cut it all.

469
00:24:38.991 --> 00:24:43.400
He can take a shot.
And that one shot ability,
he had a 45.
Oh Shit.

470
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.730
It's not here anymore.
I think he was a little bit more prepared.
Didn't Nate?

471
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.830
Nate fought at least twice at 70 in the UFC before he fought Rory.
Rory.

472
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:56.470
And who else was the other,
uh,
who else?
He fighted 70.
He fought it.
He fought a,

473
00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.350
again,
it's seven to forgive we font.
Right now we're being tweeted at someone's,

474
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.820
so
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
totally.
I'm totally looking for that.

475
00:25:04.821 --> 00:25:07.670
I don't remember what it was,
but he had,

476
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.690
I want to say maybe dunk stun gun Kim.
That might've been,

477
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.030
it might've been that somebody is looking it up right now for us young.

478
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.950
Jamie's on the case is that is,
it

479
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.060
was the same way to listed on the thing.
I was like,
well,

480
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.090
put us up so I can take a look at it like we see,
okay.
What does it,

481
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:30.680
a Wiki kind of just go to the Wiki
MMA record.

482
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.870
No,
show it.
Oh look,
that's there we are.
Two eggs.

483
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:43.670
What do we got here?
Brian McDonald downtown.
So it was that,
that was right.

484
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.800
So he tried it for a little bit after he beat Marcus Davis.
He just,

485
00:25:46.801 --> 00:25:48.050
just having a hard time taking,
making the way,

486
00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.540
and then he came back to 55 and be tacking away.
Go me beat Donald Cerrone.

487
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.940
Beat Jim Miller.
Yeah,
that's Serone fight was,
uh,
that was,
I think his,

488
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.640
maybe his finest fight.
Well,
he took Serone a partner.

489
00:25:58.641 --> 00:26:02.180
He mentally thought fantastic.
Roni with the trash talking and he got,

490
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.970
he got in sorrow in his head and it became very emotional forum where Donald

491
00:26:04.971 --> 00:26:06.740
likes to be friends with the guys.
He fights.
Yeah.

492
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:10.950
Well that was the DSS is and he can happen.
Yeah.
Yeah.

493
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:15.710
He um,
he just,
he's a nice guy.
Donald just likes to fight.

494
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:19.400
He's a really nice but t to loop it back to our earlier discussion about about

495
00:26:19.401 --> 00:26:23.630
weight cutting.
There's a reason guys do it.
I mean,
Diaz is a great 50 fiver is,

496
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:28.190
uh,
so,
so 70 I,
you know,
a fantastic Bj Penn,
it's the,
the,

497
00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:29.024
to me,

498
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.240
the worst thing ever happened to Bj Penn was when he knocked out Matt Hughes and

499
00:26:32.241 --> 00:26:36.500
thought I can fight at 70.
He was one,
five and one at at 70.
Right.

500
00:26:36.501 --> 00:26:38.500
We choked him out once,
then he knocked him out.
Yeah.

501
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:42.200
I mean initially when he went to 170 pounds,
yeah.
It was the only,

502
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:46.410
the only fighter ever beat at one 70 was Matt Hughes and in the EOC.

503
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.870
So what that did is that I think you've thought one of the five,

504
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.810
I'm on the Rock and we've took on crazy.
But yeah,

505
00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.060
to Gracie's he fought the hotter ego too.

506
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:59.370
But once he had that idea that he could beat these guys at one 70 and you saw
it,

507
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:02.580
Diaz did to him.
I mean,
he just wasn't written.
Rory ate him alive.

508
00:27:02.581 --> 00:27:07.200
It's just a great 50 fiber isn't always a great 70 Robbie Lawler at 70 it's not

509
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:08.370
a great one.
Any fiber

510
00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.870
potentially hard to watch it.
Which you know,

511
00:27:12.871 --> 00:27:17.871
and then was it sort of accentuated back when Bj made his return at 45 and then

512
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:20.870
you go,
okay,
well this makes more sense.
Yeah.
Like you,

513
00:27:20.871 --> 00:27:23.970
you were at 55 when he fought Diego Sanchez,

514
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:26.820
who's one of the baddest 55 was a volunteer who was a monster.

515
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.820
But for whatever reason,
he just,
you know,
never quite that,

516
00:27:31.821 --> 00:27:35.940
that level was only attained a few times.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And he,

517
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:38.420
he's one of those guys were where,
I mean,

518
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:41.640
I was talking to Josh Thompson recently and we're backstage in New York and you

519
00:27:41.641 --> 00:27:45.060
know,
he's a training with frank shamrock and,
uh,
and uh,

520
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:48.270
Bj Penn and said they were sitting there with an exercise ball and they'd

521
00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:49.590
already been training for a while and they said,

522
00:27:49.591 --> 00:27:52.980
we're trying to stand on this exercise ball and we're trying to try and falling

523
00:27:52.981 --> 00:27:56.970
and falling.
And BJ walks in like an hour late for practice and it says,

524
00:27:56.971 --> 00:27:58.900
what are you guys doing?
And he said,
oh,
we're trying to stay on sexual as,

525
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.730
and Bj jumped on it and went,
oh,
okay.
And walked back into it.

526
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:07.470
They'd been trying for like an hour to stand on this thing.
And so,
you know,

527
00:28:07.471 --> 00:28:10.120
I've heard a million stories of,
of that Bj,
you know,

528
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.710
coming in late to practice smoking,
everybody leaving,
you know,
I never trained.

529
00:28:13.711 --> 00:28:17.000
We've got,
I don't know,
but,
but you have that sense.
He's one of those who quote,

530
00:28:17.001 --> 00:28:19.770
man,
if,
if I had,
if you had,
you know,

531
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.120
Bj Penn's ability,
which is off the chart,

532
00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:28.650
incredible with the longevity and work ethic of like a Matt Hughes,
I mean,

533
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.970
he might still be champion.

534
00:28:29.971 --> 00:28:32.610
It's unbelievable what the guy had really unbelievable.
But like you said,

535
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.300
it was in spurts and fits and then he left USC for a while because he didn't

536
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:38.640
like the money that they got rid of the 55 division and you know,

537
00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:42.420
these fits and starts man that you fucked Machida at heavy scene.

538
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.840
It was over two oh five and over to a fine,
it's a crazy,

539
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:50.800
but she was like two 10 or some credit fought Duane Ludwig over there.
Yup.

540
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.051
Yeah.
On a triangle.

541
00:28:52.051 --> 00:28:55.140
Choke him out and the rumble on the rock fights were fucking great.

542
00:28:55.141 --> 00:28:58.810
All the gummy fight is awesome.
It's cool.
I love that fight.
It was a great idea.

543
00:28:58.811 --> 00:29:02.040
And he's like,
fuck it.
I'll make my own promotion.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean that's ballsy.

544
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.820
And Hawaii used to be a really fertile ground for him.
I mean,

545
00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.970
I used to be Ben saveable.
Yeah,
man.
Super Brawl.

546
00:29:08.971 --> 00:29:13.780
Ramona [inaudible] were fucking great back in the day.

547
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.000
If he toward John Hasbro come home fee toward John Huss was over there.

548
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.950
John Lobur him May,
yeah.

549
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.850
May Have had a bunch of fights over there that'd been terminated may him and

550
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.980
that he can anyway member that you getting in your way got mayhem and a crazy

551
00:29:28.981 --> 00:29:32.220
Kimora and they haven't just kept rolling and rolling out of it and wouldn't tab

552
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.230
spanking him and hitting him.
Yeah,

553
00:29:34.231 --> 00:29:37.050
I remember that frank Trigg and Robbie Lawler back then.

554
00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:41.680
You remember in Hawaii Holy Schiller Lawler that's really beat him.
That's right.

555
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.270
That's right.
Sue may have,
Miller was a bad monster fucker.

556
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:51.230
Monster frustrating partners.
I started with teen punishment and like 2,900,

557
00:29:51.231 --> 00:29:55.570
2000 and mayhem was there and uh,
you know,

558
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.380
rolling with that guy was crazy.
Super Skillful.
Unbelievably skillful.

559
00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.700
Fucking crazy and great cho.
Flexible and everything.
Yeah.

560
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:04.781
Yeah.

561
00:30:04.781 --> 00:30:08.550
I mean I think is fine as performance skin soccer rabo that's what I think him

562
00:30:08.551 --> 00:30:08.891
is fine.

563
00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:13.891
His performance was like just technical clean and just went through them just

564
00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:18.530
chop,
chop,
Bang,
Bang,
smashed,
choke.
I think he was one of those guys.
Uh,

565
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:19.660
looking back on it,

566
00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:24.730
there's certain guys who I'm thinking about Josh Barnett a bit,

567
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.800
I think Shaolin a little bit.
Who had they,

568
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.510
he didn't settle down in a promotion right in his prime and really,

569
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.550
you know what I mean?
Cause he's a,
was bouncing around a little bit.
Josh Barnett,

570
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.340
he spent his prime kind of bouncing around a lot,

571
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:38.650
but at the time he made his UFC Ryan,
he wasn't,

572
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:40.840
it was late in his career because remember he fought GSP.

573
00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:43.240
It took a long break off and came back and just wasn't the same guy.

574
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.510
You know and and you wonder sometimes I think maybe there's prime vittores shall

575
00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:50.410
end,
might be the best 55 are in the world in his prime.
But he was in Shooto,

576
00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:53.500
he would move around lunch and pan and just was off the u s radar.

577
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:56.410
And then it was a Kava content too.
Right.
JC,

578
00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.350
that was a big issue with him back in the day.

579
00:30:59.351 --> 00:31:01.530
People were saying he was the best hundred 55 pounder alive.

580
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.740
Like a lot of the guys that trained with them,

581
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.120
by the time he came to the states it was just a little bit further past it and

582
00:31:06.121 --> 00:31:08.200
yeah,
there's been a few of those cases,
right?

583
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.470
Like Josh Thompson who were talking about at one point in time was the best

584
00:31:11.471 --> 00:31:15.460
lightweight in the world or one of them and then had some of his best fights

585
00:31:15.461 --> 00:31:18.910
with Gilbert who was also at the same time in the same bracket and they fought

586
00:31:18.911 --> 00:31:22.630
in Strikeforce while they were peaking.
Fantastic fights,

587
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.960
go back,
watch those.
They are awesome guys,
but,

588
00:31:25.961 --> 00:31:29.230
but what people don't understand who maybe are new to the sport,

589
00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.150
the ecosystem you could used to be different.

590
00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:33.580
You can make good money and fighting for icon sports in Hawaii,

591
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:38.440
there wasn't a lot of incentive to move around and guys moved around much

592
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.210
easier.
It was,
you know,

593
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.550
I fought here a couple of times and here a couple times they weren't as

594
00:31:42.551 --> 00:31:44.380
restrictive with talent as it is now,
where it's,
you know,

595
00:31:44.381 --> 00:31:46.510
belter fires don't move over and you'll see fries no more until they're done

596
00:31:46.511 --> 00:31:49.270
with their contracts.
Guys moved around a lot and yeah.

597
00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:53.560
And so somebody like Josh Barnett could move around a little bit more and make

598
00:31:53.561 --> 00:31:55.030
more money.
They wouldn't settling down somewhere,

599
00:31:55.031 --> 00:31:59.110
but it kept him off the radar of a lot of us.
France.
Well,
how about Eve Edwards?

600
00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.750
Eve Edwards is probably the best hundred 55 pound in the world.

601
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:04.420
And the UFC got rid of the division.
I,
you know,

602
00:32:04.421 --> 00:32:09.010
it's so remember that it's hard to explain that to people that they want to cut

603
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:12.460
the 55 division at the time.
Uh,
he had just knocked out Josh Thompson,

604
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:17.320
that head kick off the [inaudible] had one of my favorite of all time.
Oh Man.

605
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.000
And uh,
they got rid of three,
five pound division right after that knock.

606
00:32:21.001 --> 00:32:24.970
A write that right in that era.
And once again,
by the time he came back,

607
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.710
he fought in pride.
Beat machine Mo.
Yeah.
Beat machine over in pride.
Last two,

608
00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:33.780
you'll Kim Hansen.
Um,
by the time he came back it was either,

609
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:38.530
it was just two ladies at the end of the trial,
you know?
Yeah,
man,

610
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.090
he fought hard and Moscow

611
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.240
<v 0>and Bodog to remember they did got knocked out.
Yeah,
I remember that.
Yeah.</v>

612
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.950
Right here.
Cuts him spinning back fists.
Boom,
boom.

613
00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.330
Go through at the same time.
Blood Sports.
Yeah.

614
00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:53.450
That was when eve was at the top of the food chain.
Great Guy.

615
00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:56.210
Well your best stream with him a couple of times when I first started.

616
00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:01.310
I'm super skillful.
Super Nice Guy.
Yeah man.
Um,
so those guys were,
you know,

617
00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.250
cut loose.
They had yeah,
they had to go somewhere.
They had to find a,

618
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.170
a place for them and then strike force became the spot where you had the,

619
00:33:08.171 --> 00:33:11.430
the Gilbert,
Josh Thomson Wars.
You had a,

620
00:33:11.431 --> 00:33:14.780
Tim Kennedy had some great fights over there.
That's where he got his start.

621
00:33:14.781 --> 00:33:18.410
When he beat Josh Gould came from there.
Yep,
that's right.

622
00:33:18.411 --> 00:33:22.760
That's when clay beat it.
Beat Josh was a huge,
huge upset.
Yeah man.

623
00:33:22.761 --> 00:33:25.100
There were some good fights over in strike force and they really were like the

624
00:33:25.101 --> 00:33:27.110
tournament format and I was fun.
You know,

625
00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.170
the heavyweight division was awesome at a time when the UFC division was,

626
00:33:30.171 --> 00:33:32.780
was at a low point.
The heavyweight division.
Was that a low point?

627
00:33:32.781 --> 00:33:34.210
I thought Strikeforce with great.
Yeah.

628
00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:39.550
It's just hard for people to accept talent levels of folks that aren't in the

629
00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:45.080
big shows.
It's like it took Marlon Mariah's to come over and you know,

630
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.090
look the way he looked in his last fight,
you know,
when you see,

631
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:55.970
when you see like Justin Gate g come over from world series of fighting and see

632
00:33:55.971 --> 00:33:58.940
the,
the fucking bra he had with Michael Johnson.

633
00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:01.520
Then the crazy fight with Eddie Alvarez realize like,
oh,

634
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.000
this guy has been like this all along.
Yeah.
You know,

635
00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:08.270
and then when Mariah's knocks out aljamain sterling with that,
that will,

636
00:34:08.271 --> 00:34:09.650
he's trying to kick him,
but he hit him with the knee.

637
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.160
But I mean Kales on flatlines them and you realize like,
oh,

638
00:34:13.161 --> 00:34:17.230
this guy is fucking for real.
This is a guy that just beat Hanan Barao right.

639
00:34:17.231 --> 00:34:17.660
Yeah.

640
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:22.280
Algebra and just be 10 and Barao Mariah's starches him with a high kick and

641
00:34:22.281 --> 00:34:25.640
you're like,
whoa.
This guy was in the world series of fighting.

642
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.840
People didn't really look at that.
It's like he's top shelf talent.

643
00:34:29.841 --> 00:34:33.410
When Eddie came from elsewhere,
Yup.
He comes over,
he goes in and you could argue,

644
00:34:33.411 --> 00:34:36.320
you could argue that Eddie was in his physical prime bells was a little bit

645
00:34:36.321 --> 00:34:38.960
younger,
a little bit sharper.
He comes over to the UFC,
does the same thing,

646
00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.590
knocks people out,
one's a belt and suddenly he's on everybody's radar.
I said,

647
00:34:42.591 --> 00:34:45.950
well,
you know,
he was pretty memory loss of Donald first.
Yeah,
he did.
He did.

648
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:49.280
Donald duck expose the weaknesses to let kids.
Yeah.

649
00:34:49.281 --> 00:34:50.630
That was one of Donald's best fights.

650
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.350
When you think about what Eddy went through,
when you go cowboy Soroti,

651
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.580
that one's Gilbert Melendez was next for him though.
San Joe's.

652
00:34:57.581 --> 00:35:00.050
It was like Jesus Christ as a murderer's on.
Yup.

653
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:04.360
And The dos Anjos Kao is just crazy.
Eddie always is.

654
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:05.990
He's always going to have power.
Savage.

655
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:10.280
He's a fun fucking dude to watch and he gets dropped in like almost every fight.

656
00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:12.530
He's saying it was just like a thing,
like what does anything to get drop.
Boom.

657
00:35:12.531 --> 00:35:16.130
And he gets up.
He keeps finding,
it's almost like they'd wakes him up.
Well,

658
00:35:16.131 --> 00:35:19.070
he's just so ferocious guy too.
He's a great guy.

659
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.410
He's so ferocious that it's almost inevitable that he's going to get tagged.

660
00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:26.270
Yeah.
Because he's just so like thrown it all to the wind.
Let's see.

661
00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:29.840
Let's find out.
He's confident that he can get through it better than you can.

662
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.540
Just like everybody's going to get cracked.

663
00:35:32.541 --> 00:35:34.850
Like that's why the gauge you fight was so engaging.

664
00:35:34.851 --> 00:35:38.040
Like you knew this is what this fight was going to be.
And it

665
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.020
<v 1>was one of the rare fights that 100% lived up to the hype.
Yeah.</v>

666
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:43.680
It was exactly what we thought it was going to be.

667
00:35:43.681 --> 00:35:45.990
It was fucking madness from the beginning to the end.

668
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.100
And when you look at how many,

669
00:35:47.101 --> 00:35:49.590
some of you listen to how many champs from different organizations,

670
00:35:49.591 --> 00:35:52.830
he's beaten in his career and he's beaten them all.
Yeah.
He's beaten them all.

671
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:54.360
You know,
cause he was one of those guys.
Once again,

672
00:35:54.361 --> 00:35:58.170
going back to what were talking about where he moved around a lot in his prime

673
00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:02.130
and you went from Japan to Beltone was awful.
Lot of fans radars.
He was like,
uh,

674
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.700
like that.
The,
you know,
the,
the people that really follow him,

675
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:07.470
the man knew Eddie Alvarez,
but you're a casual fan.

676
00:36:07.471 --> 00:36:09.030
Didn't until he made his UFC trends.

677
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.960
Is he the only guy that ever won the title in both organizations?

678
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.230
They'll turn you off,
say yeah.
Uh,
yes.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
No one else has.
Yeah.

679
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.770
I mean,
that's pretty God.
Damn impressive.
That's incredible.

680
00:36:19.771 --> 00:36:22.890
I think the other guy was a chances Lima or Rory,

681
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.650
depending upon who wins that fight.
Yeah.

682
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.540
The winner of that fight is write down what they,
right there,

683
00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.820
right there with everybody.
I mean,
you can't deny it.

684
00:36:29.821 --> 00:36:34.740
Rory beat Tyron in a very dominant decision.
Completely.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

685
00:36:34.741 --> 00:36:35.640
and he's lost the guys.

686
00:36:35.641 --> 00:36:39.030
He lost the Lawler and of course Lawler got knocked out by tire and so he can't

687
00:36:39.031 --> 00:36:43.920
do MMA.
Math doesn't work,
but Tyrons the champ and Roy beat him like,
that's,

688
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:48.450
there's no eminent man.
He's there.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I think Tyron is better now.

689
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:51.960
I really do.
Yeah,
definitely.
100% and you know,

690
00:36:51.961 --> 00:36:53.550
maybe it'd be different if they fought again,

691
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.830
but it's just statistically interesting.

692
00:36:56.070 --> 00:37:00.060
He says the things when I talked to him when he came over to [inaudible],

693
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.370
I,
you know,
it's funny,

694
00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:05.580
we do fighter fighter meetings fighting or interviews where I sit them down and

695
00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:09.150
I talked to him about the upcoming fights and everything and I don't pay

696
00:37:09.151 --> 00:37:11.100
attention to what they say as much as how they say it.

697
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.840
And I have to say weren't Mcdonald when he came in,
I went,

698
00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:19.530
this guy wants to be champion.
He's not,
he's not coming over here going,

699
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.700
I'm going to get paid.
And that's what I mean.

700
00:37:20.701 --> 00:37:23.160
He really has a fire in him to be champion.

701
00:37:23.161 --> 00:37:25.850
He is 100% devoted to it and uh,

702
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:30.840
that puts them in rare air and Lima,
if you haven't seen that guy,
fine man,

703
00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.900
I,
he hits you,
you don't know where you are.
He is fun.

704
00:37:33.901 --> 00:37:37.200
He puts everything behind every punch and he can start to anybody in the

705
00:37:37.201 --> 00:37:39.240
division.
The question means,
can you handle the take down?

706
00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:42.240
His take down defense has been suspect in the past and we'll see if he can

707
00:37:42.241 --> 00:37:43.620
handle it and take down over.
Yeah,

708
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:46.380
because that's exactly what Rory used on Paul Dale and he just went right

709
00:37:46.381 --> 00:37:49.470
through Paul Daley.
Any cracked him for it?
That's what the is.

710
00:37:49.471 --> 00:37:52.740
He cracked him and it kind of made daily hesitating.
Then boom,

711
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:56.660
take down some missions.
Yeah,
you could see that he,
he wanted to let deal,

712
00:37:56.661 --> 00:37:58.260
he know this is a fight.
I'm going to,

713
00:37:58.261 --> 00:38:01.920
I'm going to be a danger on the feet standing and then guess what?
Oh look,

714
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:03.310
I'm on the ground.
I'm not afraid.

715
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.760
I'm the for you and now you're getting strangled.
Yeah.
Yeah.

716
00:38:05.761 --> 00:38:07.380
As long as he's not afraid of him standing up,

717
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:10.200
then there's no hesitancy in engaging and he wasn't a for,

718
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.990
I mean he's the one who drew,
I mean he's the one lens first.

719
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.510
He's top of the food chain in my opinion,
I think.

720
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.170
I think he's right up there with anybody at 170 pounds in the world.

721
00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:21.450
And I'd like to see him back in the UFC for selfish reasons.

722
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.100
Of course you don't understand.

723
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.770
And I want to see what the fuck is going to happen now.
I mean,

724
00:38:25.771 --> 00:38:28.720
the whole division,
it's a topsy turvy right now.
Yeah,

725
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:33.420
no one 55 and one 70 it's all craziness.
This is,
so,

726
00:38:33.421 --> 00:38:38.421
there's so much happening right now with RDA just dominating Robbie Lawler like

727
00:38:38.711 --> 00:38:41.140
that.
And people clamoring for a title fight for him.

728
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:45.700
And now Tyron had to get shoulder surgery.
So Tyron had a toward labor room,

729
00:38:45.701 --> 00:38:48.580
apparently tried to rehab it and eventually wound up getting surgery.

730
00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:52.240
So he's out for several months,
you know,
where he can't do shit.

731
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:55.990
A tough thing whenever he belt or the sea or wherever.

732
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.870
Whenever you have that backlog,
whenever you have a champion,

733
00:38:58.871 --> 00:39:00.850
can't defend the title or something like that.
Or He's out for a little bit.

734
00:39:00.851 --> 00:39:05.560
And the Puranas.
I mean they eat each other,
you know,
if there's no,
oh,

735
00:39:05.561 --> 00:39:06.190
we're gonna get the title.

736
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:10.060
You can go through your prime waiting for that guy to come back from surgery

737
00:39:10.061 --> 00:39:11.000
like a year.
I said like my,

738
00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:14.470
whatever it is in a division that's that stacked and these guys are killers.

739
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.400
You can go through your whole prime trying to climb up that mountain again.

740
00:39:18.401 --> 00:39:21.570
It is tough.
That's it.
It's generic boxing and MMA.
Right?

741
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:25.420
Because in boxing the your manager would make you keep that number one contender

742
00:39:25.421 --> 00:39:28.720
position.
Hundred percent.
Yeah,
they would.
They would wait on that one.

743
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.740
Let's wait on this one.
But we want to take a risk or you'd fight nobody's,
yeah,

744
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:37.330
you find some Joe Louis Bum of the month club that was thinking about boxing.

745
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:41.200
Yeah.
Guys would take warmup,
fights,
tune up fights.
Yeah.

746
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:44.560
And those would also be like highlight fights because you know,

747
00:39:44.561 --> 00:39:48.280
you tee off on some guy that was below him and everybody gets super excited

748
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:51.500
about this guy that Tyson's about to fight or whatever it was.
Yeah.
No,

749
00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.391
it's funny.
I was talking to Steve,

750
00:39:52.391 --> 00:39:54.130
I told you to talk to Steve Hardwick today actually.

751
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.860
We ended up chatting a little bit.
He does the boxing for showtime.

752
00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:57.970
He's the unofficial score.

753
00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:01.720
That guy used to be editor for ring magazine for like 30 years.

754
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:07.090
You can't stump him about boxing Adeline slide.
I that as some obscure stuff.

755
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.160
He is phenomenal.
Everything he knows.

756
00:40:09.161 --> 00:40:11.570
We were talking once about the heavyweight division and Oh,

757
00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:14.380
it's not really good right now,
and he looked at me.
He goes,
it usually isn't.

758
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.510
He said the the heavily division usually isn't the most stack division in
boxing.

759
00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.610
We remember the errors when it was because that really stands out to us,

760
00:40:21.611 --> 00:40:22.990
but generally it's not that good.

761
00:40:22.991 --> 00:40:26.610
Usually 47 is the marquee division with great fighters in it.
He's like,

762
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:29.700
the reason Tyson stands out so much is you talk about all,

763
00:40:29.701 --> 00:40:31.080
there was nobody who to fight in the 80s well,

764
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:34.500
they're usually what their whole decades where you aren't that good.
You know,

765
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:38.020
it happens all the time.
Tubs as a champ.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There was a lot of guys,

766
00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:43.750
Tony Tucker,
remember him?
Sure.
There was a lot of guys,
uh,
post,
uh,
Larry Holmes.

767
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:48.640
Yeah.
Just a massive amount of guys.
Yeah.
Trevor Berbick.
I mean,

768
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:52.470
sure guys are kind of lost to history at this point.
Yeah.
That's who Tyson beat.

769
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.340
Remember mark was a champ.
It fell,

770
00:40:54.341 --> 00:40:56.390
it fell down three times from one punch that was quite,

771
00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.310
remember Wilma mills lane was a referee.
He was 20,
right?
Yes.

772
00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:04.120
Sorry about that youngest heavyweight champion of all time.
Why I'm coughing.

773
00:41:04.121 --> 00:41:07.860
I'm not even sick,
but it's almost like I feel like I have a,

774
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:13.690
you know,
I eat pistachios.
You,
he'd get one of them little,
not the,
not the shell,

775
00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.870
but that little outside layer of the pistachio.
I almost feel like you're head.

776
00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.930
A little piece of that in the back of my throat could be,
you never know.

777
00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:24.530
Never know.
Can we just,
that Jenks of have another commentator across from me.

778
00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.520
You know,
you're trying to make you cough project more.
You know,
you're trying to,

779
00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:31.390
I don't think it's like a little battle,
Bro.
Thinking.
No,
no,
no.
We're,
we're good,

780
00:41:31.391 --> 00:41:32.560
bro.
We're good,
bro.
Come on.

781
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:38.880
I want to know what the fuck is going to happen with Connor.
Yeah,
that's,
I mean,

782
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.630
you and everybody else because Hubby,

783
00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:42.800
you and everybody else after this performance

784
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.960
Habibi set it up to a place where he's the most terrifying,

785
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:51.860
lightweight contender in the world.
And then you have Tony Ferguson,

786
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.400
who's a motherfucker.
He was the interim championship champion.

787
00:41:55.401 --> 00:41:58.520
And then you have Connor who,
who knows what's going to happen with him.

788
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.170
And I think the UFC is going to give him a little while.
I'm,

789
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:04.970
can we give them some time,
you know,
hey,
let the holidays pass.

790
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.700
See what the fuck happens.
And they're going to have to make some moves,

791
00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:12.410
but they want to do a Russia fight.
Yeah.
And if they want to do a Russia fight,

792
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:16.860
I know a guy,
I know,
I know the guy.

793
00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:19.480
Little sell some fucking tickets and Russia baby.
Yeah.

794
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.660
Tony Ferguson as can be,
but never got off in Russia.

795
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:29.090
What could be said on Twitter about this?
Connors?
What kind of says,
yeah,

796
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:32.470
I'll let you go.
Skin to skin your pets and only wearing it once.

797
00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.590
That's
truly,

798
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:41.591
truly get on your fucking knees and beg me otherwise I don't give a Bollix my

799
00:42:41.631 --> 00:42:45.950
whiskey is out this year.
And that's ditty bread.
No,

800
00:42:45.951 --> 00:42:47.340
but I think below that is the,

801
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:52.190
so he tweeted the bear thing and then it was I skin your pets and I wear them

802
00:42:52.191 --> 00:42:56.630
once.
Oh yeah.
That was pretty funny.
That's comparatively witty.

803
00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:01.190
Slaughter your pets and wear them as coats and only wore them once and I only

804
00:43:01.191 --> 00:43:05.780
wear them once,
but there it'd be a lot of,

805
00:43:05.781 --> 00:43:07.550
it's good trash talk.
I like it.

806
00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.340
Have you ever seen the documentary called a Bobby Fischer against the world?

807
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:12.350
No follow chest.
There was a,

808
00:43:12.351 --> 00:43:14.570
there's a document about Bobby Fischer called Bobby Fischer against wall and

809
00:43:14.571 --> 00:43:16.490
whether or not you're in the chess,
you should really,
really watch it.

810
00:43:16.491 --> 00:43:18.120
I'm into Bobby Fischer.
Yeah.
Okay.

811
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:22.070
It's called Bobby Fischer against the world and yeah,
he was.

812
00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.400
And uh,
anyway,
they interview one of his,

813
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.590
his friends as long friends,

814
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.400
lifelong friends named Dr. Anthony Satie.

815
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:36.050
And their last conversation before Bobby cut him off,
he said,

816
00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:38.150
Bobby,
if you don't play chess,

817
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.720
eventually they'll come a time where no one will ask you to play chess.

818
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:47.750
That's the situation is,
you know,
you can keep doing this and tweets,

819
00:43:47.751 --> 00:43:51.020
but the reason you're famous and the reason people you have what you have in

820
00:43:51.021 --> 00:43:55.820
front of you is because you fight.
And there comes a time when,
like I said,

821
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:59.450
the division with the sport in the division,
everybody,
it'll move past you now.

822
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.660
Economy have enough money.
He doesn't care about that.
But that,

823
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.880
that's always a risk.
You want who you know,
and you're an old school,

824
00:44:04.881 --> 00:44:08.540
ain't no sugar.
Ray Robinson tried to be a dancer,
entertainer and a kind of old,

825
00:44:08.541 --> 00:44:10.880
and they went,
yeah,
we want to see you fight.

826
00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:13.400
And that's all you're gonna get paid for it.
Now.

827
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.060
He may not have enough money that he doesn't care about that.
Certainly possible,

828
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:22.100
but there's no sport.
There's no division that won't move past you eventually.

829
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:26.980
And that would be a shame.
And he thinks he has enough money.
Yeah,
but he's,

830
00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:30.500
he's spending like Floyd Mayweather.
Yeah,

831
00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.100
I mean he's going off.

832
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:35.640
<v 0>If you go off like that after,
why are you going to run out of money?
Yeah.</v>

833
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.800
I mean it might be 20 years from now,

834
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:42.830
but you know to see him till 20 years and your window to make monies this big in

835
00:44:43.051 --> 00:44:47.490
professional sports.
Right?
You see I'm holding on my thing and make it.
Yeah.

836
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:49.040
I don't know if that's a,

837
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:52.590
I don't know if that's sustainable.

838
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.570
I don't know if he's got enough money to live the rest of his life,

839
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:57.540
but he certainly doesn't.
If he just spends like crazy,

840
00:44:57.541 --> 00:45:02.250
I mean he might just go through a phase and then he might decide to cherry pick

841
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.800
specific fights to make tremendous amounts of money.

842
00:45:04.801 --> 00:45:07.200
And then there was some talk about a pack.
Y'all fight in boxing.

843
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:11.470
Who knows what he's going to do.
But his only sustainable avenues.
MMA.
Yeah.

844
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:14.360
Meaning once again in boxing,
let's say he fights many pack Jaan.

845
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.890
Let's say he loses for argument's sake,
let's say he loses that fight.

846
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:21.390
People even get tired of spending 70 bucks on a pay per view to watch him take

847
00:45:21.391 --> 00:45:21.871
on a great guy.

848
00:45:21.871 --> 00:45:26.871
And fall shot and we'll fight Tony Ferguson and a unification fight and Kaos

849
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:31.250
Tony Ferguson then,
then fight Manny Pacquiao all day long.
Exactly.
It's,

850
00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:34.470
it's MMA that sustains him.
You don't get mad at me,
Tony.

851
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.560
It's just that for instance,
the flexibility for argument's sake,

852
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:40.440
I'm taking the devil's advocate position.
Tony.

853
00:45:40.441 --> 00:45:42.300
Tony got mad at me wearing the hat.
He's like,

854
00:45:42.301 --> 00:45:46.500
what are you changing your ted planet gear,
Bro?
What were you were,
um,

855
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:50.540
I don't know how to say it.
Kapooka oh,
that for,
for the,
I'll come on to gift.

856
00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:55.320
It's a gift to wear that and listen just because he's got a problem.
I love Tony,

857
00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:58.180
but I also love Khabib,
Khabib as a bad motherfucker to,

858
00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:01.650
to not to deny that it's ridiculous that ms to it.
So.
All right,
I've got to ask.

859
00:46:01.651 --> 00:46:03.940
Commentator comes here.
All right.
What's,
what's the,
what's the,

860
00:46:03.941 --> 00:46:07.350
the madness to fight has ever been at you?
For what man?
I don't know.

861
00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.390
Cause we all have these stories.
Not many of them.

862
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:10.880
Usually I get along with everybody,

863
00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:14.380
but if I get along with just about everybody too and if there was ever a rampage

864
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:16.210
was we're mad at once.
I remember the hand as was,

865
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.810
I was saying that he'd need to throw more leg kicks or something like that,

866
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:21.510
but it's just cause I want them to be successful and when he does he's,

867
00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.590
I just think that guys get a little too knock out heavy sometimes and I like to

868
00:46:25.591 --> 00:46:29.190
see people be more technical and mix it up in addiction man and you're never

869
00:46:29.191 --> 00:46:32.190
going to get away from the power that rampage had and has.

870
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.370
He's always going to have that power.

871
00:46:33.371 --> 00:46:36.090
But my thought was like what I would like to see as a person who is a fan,

872
00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.240
I'd like to see him mix it up more and become more technical.

873
00:46:39.241 --> 00:46:41.460
He's always going to have that ridiculous chin.

874
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.560
He's always going to have that unbelievable power.
Those,

875
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:47.170
those things are not going away.
He's the first guy ever grappled with rampage,

876
00:46:47.171 --> 00:46:51.360
rampage Jackson,
first guy ever grappled with really it had a legit studio.

877
00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:54.840
I grappled with him once.
We were doing something for some television show,

878
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:56.430
some inside the that's right,

879
00:46:56.431 --> 00:46:59.700
that inside the UFC thing that I used to do like way back in the day.

880
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:01.320
That was like a,

881
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:06.270
when spike first had the UFC we did some stuff and he was getting ready to fight

882
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:08.700
chuck and we did some stuff together.

883
00:47:08.701 --> 00:47:11.100
He like a lot of people didn't know who he was.
He came around,

884
00:47:11.101 --> 00:47:15.570
we drove around La in his a monster truck.
He had some crazy monster truck.

885
00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:17.090
It was like Jack Three feet of the year.

886
00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.750
If you wanted to provide you to know that it was no,
not that point.

887
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:20.251
What that point.

888
00:47:20.251 --> 00:47:24.750
Of course we ran into one of the [inaudible] before that I was with rampage.

889
00:47:24.751 --> 00:47:27.240
We ran into one of the Wu Tang clan,
you know,

890
00:47:27.241 --> 00:47:30.190
weird section of La on Hollywood boulevard.

891
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:33.610
<v 1>He's a loop test was coming out of a check cashing place.</v>

892
00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:38.620
I forget which guy it was.
We were having a good fucking time though.

893
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.690
That was before anybody knew who rampage was.

894
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:44.820
I misunderstood him cause he was going by the slug once again,
like 99,
2000.

895
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:48.610
I had finished it,
Ucla where I first got my taste,

896
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.950
Jujitsu was at Ucla and then I got,

897
00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.620
I graduated and I went to teen punishment and I get on the mat and Fabiana you

898
00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:57.770
was the coach there at the time finding out what the best arm bars in the day.

899
00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:02.400
Monday?
Yeah,
it was fine.
Especially Farside.

900
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.550
And so we,
um,

901
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:09.220
I got on the mat and I shake hands with this dude and I said,

902
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:13.390
hey,
my name's Jimmy.
And he goes,
I'm rampage.
And I thought I misunderstood him.

903
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:15.400
I was like,
uh,
he can't sit,
you know,

904
00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.830
I was like as a Randall or something and I just misunderstood him.

905
00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:22.700
And all I knew was I knew armbarring foot locker at the time and he was so big.

906
00:48:22.701 --> 00:48:25.810
I was like,
I'm just gonna put login.
And I went all straight,
full lux on them.

907
00:48:25.811 --> 00:48:27.000
And again,
I'm like,
Oh my God,
I'm gonna.

908
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:32.260
And then I got an arm bar on him and he lifted me up to the ceiling with one

909
00:48:32.261 --> 00:48:35.500
arm,
just eroded.
My ass just went,
boom,
drop it right on me.

910
00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:39.330
And Fabiano comes running over mad like,
oh,
you're not supposed to do that.

911
00:48:39.331 --> 00:48:43.090
And just start screaming at him and he walks off ramp.
He turns to me,
he goes,

912
00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:45.960
that'd be cool,
right?
That was like,
yeah,
we're fine,
man.
I'm a wrestler.
That's,

913
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:48.250
you know,
no big deal.
I've been slammed before and that was it.

914
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:52.000
That time it meant Quinten man back then.
The case like his second fight is for,

915
00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.320
I was there right after his first fight or before it's first side,

916
00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:56.560
like literally it was just getting started,

917
00:48:56.561 --> 00:48:59.680
like living in his car stuff and now he's come very,
very far.

918
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.341
He's one of those guys.

919
00:49:00.341 --> 00:49:03.790
I'm really glad [inaudible] half Harvey and he's been like one of his first.

920
00:49:03.791 --> 00:49:07.510
That was his,
I believe that was his first.
His first fight it king of the cage.

921
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:10.420
California was Marvin.
He,
I think he fought once in Tennessee or something.

922
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:14.560
But yes,
of all,
Marvin East me lost my decision.
Whew,
man.

923
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.690
And then you just started beating guys up.

924
00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:20.200
Starting Long History of the sport has now when you think about it,

925
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:23.290
it's interesting because it's all just sort of accumulated like the different

926
00:49:23.291 --> 00:49:27.580
styles and the different abilities.
Do you remember how tough,

927
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:31.430
especially in California in the early two thousands the local scene was a

928
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:36.190
motherfucker?
Yeah,
cause the EOC,
like MMA was big.
It was not big,

929
00:49:36.191 --> 00:49:38.770
but it was pop.
It was cool.
It was like it was popular,

930
00:49:38.771 --> 00:49:42.040
it was fun and there weren't many big shows.

931
00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:46.030
So guys had to fight on the local level for a while to get enough fights to get

932
00:49:46.031 --> 00:49:49.210
there.
And also,
once again,
the contracts weren't that restrictive.

933
00:49:49.211 --> 00:49:51.160
So in between UFC fights,

934
00:49:51.161 --> 00:49:53.590
because they didn't have that many guys could go down to king of the cage and

935
00:49:53.591 --> 00:49:57.290
make some money.
So you'd see some really talented guys.
The cage,

936
00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:02.440
the cage was always weird challenge Indian Boba casino man.

937
00:50:02.441 --> 00:50:05.080
That's where I fought at first.
I felt like for my fights up there,

938
00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.710
there was a bunch of casinos that would have it and it all had to be native

939
00:50:08.711 --> 00:50:11.090
American reservations have their own rules.
Yeah.

940
00:50:11.091 --> 00:50:13.210
It was illegal weighing in on a bathroom scale,

941
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.240
like literally like on the bathroom scale in the lobby of the hotel and Ted

942
00:50:16.241 --> 00:50:18.700
would look down and go,
yeah,
you're good.
You know,
whatever.

943
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:23.020
The doctors test was like,
can you find your nose?
Can you stand on one foot?

944
00:50:23.021 --> 00:50:25.780
Can you stand me up for it?
Okay,
get in there.
It was literally,
that was it.

945
00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:29.390
It's crazy.
It's wild west man.
Do you remember when the king of the cage,

946
00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:32.510
it got rainy and they decided to let everybody fled in one bra.

947
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:37.580
Wet and wild.
That was crazy.
Then words fall on that card against Jeremy One.

948
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:41.660
Did he really?
I believe so from a team.
Angie,
do you mix generation?
Remember him?

949
00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:44.840
Yeah,
I do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was a solid team.
Chris Brandon's camp man back then.

950
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.200
Solid dudes,
man.
Yeah.
There was a two Jeremy Williams,
right?

951
00:50:48.201 --> 00:50:52.760
It was the one on top who wound up getting locked up in the news.
Jeremy,

952
00:50:52.761 --> 00:50:57.620
the original one who took his own life.
Yeah,
it online.
Very sad story.

953
00:50:57.621 --> 00:51:00.170
He was a really interesting,
super talented too.

954
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.850
I find a grappling match against Jerry at no limits.
Remember?
No one is,
yeah,

955
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.610
yeah,
we're calling.
I'm going to be anyway,

956
00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:09.800
so I got a call from the guy who ran no limits and he called me and said,
hey,

957
00:51:09.801 --> 00:51:12.560
I have a grappling tournament come up.
Would you like to fight?

958
00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:15.710
Because I was done,
you know,
I was doing grappling terms of the time.
I said,
yeah,

959
00:51:15.711 --> 00:51:19.340
sure,
no problem man.
And because,
yeah,
I'm a super fighting.
It's Jeremy Williams.

960
00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:22.010
I don't want,
cause I had seen Jeremy Williams,
you know,

961
00:51:22.011 --> 00:51:23.480
he was locally in California.

962
00:51:23.481 --> 00:51:27.590
He was known and we got in this ring or whatever and we fought.
And um,

963
00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:31.190
I caught him and told,
and I,
and I,
and he tapped in and

964
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:38.330
I went back into the locker room and he's bawling,
like bawling,

965
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.630
bawling,
bawling,
bawling,
but like devastated.

966
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:45.970
And I remember thinking at the time,
that's like,

967
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:47.960
it wasn't in grappling when and got caught me and it happens.

968
00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.680
And like his whole team was around him like,
like,
like a funeral or something.

969
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:54.680
And I,
and I went up to,
and I was like,
man,
I've always been a huge fan,

970
00:51:54.681 --> 00:51:57.920
which is true.
I mean,
I,
I'm a local,
especially at that time.
He was like,

971
00:51:57.921 --> 00:52:01.070
here he was,
he was a level above most guys.
And I told him,

972
00:52:01.071 --> 00:52:03.680
and I'm a huge fan and it's just not a hundred fuck you.
And he said,
thank you.

973
00:52:03.681 --> 00:52:07.010
And he hugged me.
But I remember thinking at the time,
something's going on.

974
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.070
Like he just seemed so emotional,

975
00:52:10.071 --> 00:52:12.620
so devastating and what was going on his life at time.
And,
and uh,

976
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:15.530
when I went to Japan for five quest,
I read the deed.

977
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:19.550
He hadn't taken his own life.
And I that,
that was tough,
man.
I was tough.

978
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:24.530
Woof.
Oh yeah.
It's not all sunshine and rainbows and him on man.
Well,

979
00:52:24.531 --> 00:52:25.364
it certainly isn't.

980
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:28.220
<v 0>Well,
it isn't in any combat sport.
Right.
It's tough.</v>

981
00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:30.580
And it's hard to tell what is,
what's happening.

982
00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:33.970
Is it what leads you to it in the first place as you have this burning desire to

983
00:52:33.971 --> 00:52:38.140
get back at people and your emotions are in turmoil and obviously everybody's

984
00:52:38.141 --> 00:52:41.080
different.
Yeah,
man,
it's one of the things about Rory that's so unique,

985
00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:44.350
like people have this idea of him and then,
uh,

986
00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:47.020
he did my podcast and one of the things that people said like,
oh,

987
00:52:47.021 --> 00:52:50.500
he's fucking normal.
Like he's like a regular guy.
He just,

988
00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:53.860
when he's fighting he's really serious.
Yeah.
But when you talk,

989
00:52:53.861 --> 00:52:57.790
everybody thought he was like this complete like total silence psycho.

990
00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:01.900
But then he's doing the podcast,
he's joking around,
he's self deprecating.

991
00:53:01.901 --> 00:53:05.590
He's super honest about like what happened to when he trains too much.

992
00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.680
He breaks down,
he can't do it anymore.
And I always,

993
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:12.040
he's like scheduled his training differently.
We just fucking,
he's not like,

994
00:53:12.041 --> 00:53:15.820
I'm some superman.
I can't be stopped.
I'm never tired.
I'll fucking keep pushing.

995
00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:16.840
There was none of that.

996
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:20.290
<v 1>Yes.
People always ask me about jail.
Like,
what's that dude?
He's a,</v>

997
00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:23.500
he's a totally normal guy.
He's fun.
He's funny.

998
00:53:23.501 --> 00:53:26.690
He's engaging self deprecating too.
Yeah.
You know,

999
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:28.970
I talked to him after the Tito fight.
I was like,
yeah,

1000
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:30.150
he comes up to us and we're,
you know,

1001
00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:33.300
we were calling a fight after you'd already fought to then we're calling this

1002
00:53:33.301 --> 00:53:36.090
fight and I mean,
how are you doing?
He goes,
well,
I'm a competency shot.
Uh,

1003
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.640
beyond that,
I'm,
I'm great.
I'm done crying.

1004
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:41.610
I was in the bathroom just bawling and now I'm going to,
he's a funny dude.

1005
00:53:41.611 --> 00:53:43.790
He's a really a funny guy.
When he choked out Shogun,

1006
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:47.130
he said something to the effect of he goes,
uh,
he goes,

1007
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:51.240
if you think I'm going to sit here and listen to a middle aged comedians,

1008
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:54.360
tell me what to do.
I just choked out a world champion.

1009
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:57.960
Something along those lines.
You just wait for it.
You just,
whatever.

1010
00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:00.970
Like when I interview him and,
and by the way,
for,
for people in some way,

1011
00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:03.450
I don't know how it is for you.
Interviews are,

1012
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.320
if not the hardest part of our job,
the,

1013
00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:09.390
the x factors in interviews because everybody asks me,

1014
00:54:09.391 --> 00:54:11.340
and this is kind of like a behind the scenes thing,

1015
00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:15.150
we don't know whether or not we do an interview is a production call 100%.

1016
00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:16.020
We don't decide.

1017
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:18.690
I don't decide personally whether or not somebody gets an interview.

1018
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:20.680
When I was doing military,

1019
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:22.680
we have commercials so they have a commercial inventory.

1020
00:54:22.681 --> 00:54:26.490
We've got to get to him if fights and quickly we get interviews.
If they don't,

1021
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:28.830
we don't,
it doesn't matter who the fighter is and what they're doing,

1022
00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:33.270
but it's not my call.
Um,
they're geeked up on adrenaline.

1023
00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:37.590
They're like all over the place.
The producers in my ear going,
you know,

1024
00:54:37.591 --> 00:54:40.140
you have one or two questions.
How ever many I have,
how many do I have time for?

1025
00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:42.750
They can go off crazy.
Like you just don't know.

1026
00:54:42.751 --> 00:54:46.410
It's the most x factor part of our job because it's off the format.

1027
00:54:46.411 --> 00:54:50.280
You're up there holding the mic and they could say whatever that you have no

1028
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:52.710
idea what they're saying,
what they're doing,
trying to keep them in one place.

1029
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:54.270
People don't realize that people go,
oh,

1030
00:54:54.271 --> 00:54:56.910
you guys were always touching the fighter.
If they start moving,

1031
00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.760
all the cameras move guys,
and it ruins the shot.

1032
00:54:59.761 --> 00:55:02.160
We're trying to keep them in one place.
When I put my hand on a guy,

1033
00:55:02.161 --> 00:55:05.760
what I'm trying to do or Gal,
whatever,
I'm trying to keep them in one place.

1034
00:55:05.761 --> 00:55:09.450
So the two cameras get a shot of them,
kind of sent it to me.
If it works,

1035
00:55:09.451 --> 00:55:10.950
it really works.
But when they have adrenaline,

1036
00:55:10.951 --> 00:55:13.380
they'll start spinning around or they're trying to address the crowd and they

1037
00:55:13.381 --> 00:55:16.320
start turning around.
You're trying to keep them in one spot.
I had one guy,

1038
00:55:16.321 --> 00:55:20.610
one the weirdest tweets I've ever gotten was sometimes you'll catch me on camera

1039
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.660
pointing at the ground and what I'm saying is stand right here,

1040
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:28.440
come to me and Stan.
Right?
So that's where the camera shot is,
you know,

1041
00:55:28.441 --> 00:55:30.900
I'm not right.
And so at every now and then you'll catch me doing that.

1042
00:55:30.901 --> 00:55:33.180
And what I'm doing is you stand right here because my director,

1043
00:55:33.181 --> 00:55:35.100
you saw I was getting mad at me cause I would go to the fighter and would like

1044
00:55:35.101 --> 00:55:35.934
ruin the shot.

1045
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:41.060
He wants them to come to them so it's center this Weirdo tweet me cause it's so

1046
00:55:41.521 --> 00:55:44.010
racist.
The way you point to your shoes.

1047
00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:50.280
I swear to God he said like you point your shoes when it's a black fighter and

1048
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:53.230
the last card hadn't had any black troll.

1049
00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:58.290
It was [inaudible] I was crying laughing kid from fortunate of Dude it was hell.

1050
00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:03.120
But like how demeaning and you point to your shoes when you're like what am I
do?

1051
00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:04.980
Like explain to you how a two shot works.

1052
00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:07.720
It is hilarious where people get mad at me cause why didn't that fight or get an

1053
00:56:07.721 --> 00:56:10.410
interview and I'm like it,
it's literally a timing thing.
Yeah,

1054
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.180
you can't do with me.
You can't breed that stall.
You can't at all.

1055
00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.960
I'll read it and then that's about it.
I don't engage with anybody.

1056
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:17.340
I don't know if you got a better shit to do,

1057
00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:20.490
but you can't get upset at people that don't understand the format.
It's crazy.

1058
00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:23.920
You're upset.
You're like legitimately upset.
That's not,
I was doing that.

1059
00:56:23.921 --> 00:56:27.400
The fucking Jews.
Yeah,
they really get,
they really,
really lose it.
Oh Shit.

1060
00:56:27.401 --> 00:56:28.810
It's a small percentage.
You know,

1061
00:56:28.811 --> 00:56:31.600
there's a million people watching and you get one shitty tweet.

1062
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:33.220
You've really got to think about the number.
Yeah.

1063
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:36.520
Well the thing to me too is like when I,
when I left Beltone when it came out,

1064
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:41.170
whatever it was,
the 26th the response like kind of blew me away.
I mean,

1065
00:56:41.171 --> 00:56:43.960
I was hearing from people that I didn't even know they knew who I was.
Just,

1066
00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:47.500
you know,
everybody was just,
it was a huge deal.
I couldn't believe it,
you know,

1067
00:56:47.501 --> 00:56:50.260
I didn't expect all the support I got and I really appreciate anybody listening.

1068
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:53.050
I really,
really appreciate it.
And when something like that happens,

1069
00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:54.210
it's the first time I heard from you.

1070
00:56:54.211 --> 00:56:57.640
It was when I left bell for the first time when Bjorn was,
you know,

1071
00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.730
being born and I left and you wrote me and when man keep your head up,

1072
00:57:00.731 --> 00:57:03.640
it's going to be great.
And I was like,
Eh,
no,
you knew who I was.
You don't know.

1073
00:57:03.641 --> 00:57:04.840
You're kind of cut off.
You have no idea.

1074
00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:07.830
But the support you get when you really need,
it's really amazing and may fast.

1075
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:10.690
Well,
if you're a fan of the sport and you enjoy watching it,

1076
00:57:10.691 --> 00:57:14.950
you want a commentator who appreciates it and knows what he's talking about and

1077
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:19.390
is entertaining.
Like you take good paths.
You know,
when you describe things,

1078
00:57:19.391 --> 00:57:22.570
I like to thank you,
criticized referees.
If they make shitty calls,

1079
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.540
you do the right thing.
You know,
you speak up for the people that are watching.

1080
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:29.000
That's,
you know,
that's something that's so hard.
You have to do it.
Yeah,

1081
00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:31.370
let's do it.
Even if you love the referee,
even if you love the referee.

1082
00:57:31.371 --> 00:57:35.140
But a lot of things are like one time and uh,
I love this in big John,

1083
00:57:35.141 --> 00:57:36.970
if you're listening,
I would love to hear an explanation of this,

1084
00:57:36.971 --> 00:57:41.971
cause this is one of the funniest moments I've ever had commentating was it was

1085
00:57:42.551 --> 00:57:44.850
Marlon Sandro versus Frodo hospital.

1086
00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:49.810
I have at one 45 and Beltre and I forget who got a cup shot,

1087
00:57:49.811 --> 00:57:51.630
but somebody's got to cup shot,
boom,
kicked,

1088
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:55.000
kicked to the nuts and big John walks up to him and goes,

1089
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:59.350
[inaudible] was Mike so I could hear it.
He goes,
that wasn't a bad shot.

1090
00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:03.130
I'm only giving you two minutes.
Oh.
And I went,
I'm on air going,

1091
00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:08.920
I don't think he can do that.
It's either five minutes or he didn't get hit.

1092
00:58:08.921 --> 00:58:10.000
He asks you fighting.
There's no,

1093
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:12.990
but he went up to him that wasn't bad and we'll give you two minutes.
And I went.

1094
00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:15.700
So I'm on like I have to explain that to an audience and go,

1095
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.170
as far as I know he can't do that.
It's either five or it's nothing.

1096
00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:22.450
Would when a referee does something like that you,
you,
you,

1097
00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:26.920
I'm trying to explain to the audience what he might be thinking like,
ah,

1098
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:29.440
that didn't look bad to me,
but here's what he's thinking.

1099
00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:31.990
And then fighters and then a lot of people think you're defending the referee.

1100
00:58:31.991 --> 00:58:35.050
No,
I'm trying to think about what could possibly make him do that.

1101
00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:39.070
You have to ride that line and go,
this is what he's thinking.

1102
00:58:39.071 --> 00:58:43.840
I disagree about that,
but what I bring in arbitrary,

1103
00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.900
the good thing about the UFC is you bring in mark Ratner has progressed or goes

1104
00:58:46.901 --> 00:58:51.460
over the the actual law or the rules rather and how it's set up.

1105
00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:52.960
The one of the things,
it's interesting,

1106
00:58:52.961 --> 00:58:56.560
we did a show in Detroit and I believe it was in Detroit and Michigan,

1107
00:58:56.590 --> 00:59:01.450
they make use of the replay,
but when they use the replay,

1108
00:59:01.451 --> 00:59:05.380
the fight is over.
Wow.
They make use of the instant replay.

1109
00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:09.640
But if they do have to go to the instant replay,
the fight is over.
And for what?

1110
00:59:09.641 --> 00:59:12.390
For no contest.
Is it for anything only you get to know con,

1111
00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.380
but when would that even be useful?

1112
00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:19.980
If I was some sort of an injury or if someone claims that a shot was in an

1113
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.450
illegal area to declare a no contest.
Yeah,

1114
00:59:23.451 --> 00:59:25.400
that's the only way it could really work.
Well the owner,

1115
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:28.100
the only way they can go to once they go to a replay,

1116
00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:31.760
so if the referee makes us call and then they request some sort of going to the

1117
00:59:31.761 --> 00:59:33.050
instant replay,
the fight is over.

1118
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:37.820
There's no fighting after the instant replays played.
You don't,
it's,
it's weird.

1119
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:41.720
It's so funny when,
when when people ask me about,

1120
00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:46.340
you know why there's so many controversies in m and a in MMA,
I'm sorry,

1121
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:48.500
combat sports is the only major sport.

1122
00:59:48.501 --> 00:59:52.400
Boxing and MMA where the rules are kind of subjective.

1123
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:55.910
The scoring kind of subjective.
When a fight is over,
it's kind of subjective.

1124
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:59.960
There's just so much room for interpretation in every facet of our sport.

1125
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:02.300
You know,
when a fight,
when a referee stops,
if I had,

1126
01:00:02.301 --> 01:00:05.730
it's his judgment as to whether or not intelligently defending yourself as is

1127
01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.590
the case.
You know,
the scoring 10,
eight,
10,
nine,
that's completely,

1128
01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.140
they make criteria,
but it's in the end.

1129
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:16.820
Effective striking and effective grappling is subjective,
you know,
and so,

1130
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:21.000
and also the fouls,
when I was in Israel,
a guy took a Jeremiah Lapiano,

1131
01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:24.800
took a groin shot and then shot the back of head and referee took 0.2 different

1132
01:00:24.801 --> 01:00:26.540
infractions.
Lot of referees won't do that.

1133
01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:30.410
You have to have at least two of the same infraction.
The Ref took a point away.

1134
01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:34.580
He's allowed to do that.
Um,
so,
so much the sport is subjective.

1135
01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:37.700
That's why there are so many arguments about this sport is,
you know,

1136
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:39.710
so many subjective elements in it.

1137
01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:42.350
And that's why it's so important to have really good referees.

1138
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:45.620
It's hard to find them.
They don't get any praise and they only get,

1139
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:50.030
they get hate when they mess up.
Yeah.
Don't get praise and they do the job well.

1140
01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:53.630
It's uh,
it,
I mean,
what you said is perfect.
I think the,

1141
01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.740
the most locked solid is the rules.
That's the most locked,

1142
01:00:56.741 --> 01:01:00.520
solid scorings very subjective.
And we,

1143
01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:02.860
we're talking about the Khabib fight the,

1144
01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:07.190
even though there were using the old system,
I mean the scorecards were crazy.

1145
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:10.580
I mean it could be was way ahead of him.
I don't see if you can find it Jamie,

1146
01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:15.050
but um,
it could be was way,
way out in front.

1147
01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.640
That's something that I do not miss doing is scoring.
Scoring.
Yeah.
I don't,

1148
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:20.630
I don't think it's smart.

1149
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:24.660
I did not know they used to make you do that over at bell two.

1150
01:01:24.661 --> 01:01:25.494
I don't miss that at all.

1151
01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.760
I mean I'll mentally kind of score or fight as I'm going along,
but,

1152
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:32.240
but the thing,
and what's so funny is people's reactions to it.

1153
01:01:32.241 --> 01:01:34.190
Not that I mind doing it,
it's that people,
you know,

1154
01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.530
Steve Farr hood and like I said,
I just finished talking to news,

1155
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:39.090
does it for a strike force.
He's like,
Oh yeah,
it's,

1156
01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:42.350
you can't make a scorecard that,
that everyone agrees with that we'll do.

1157
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:45.080
People agree with that.
It seems we're on a 10 point must system.
You know,

1158
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:46.700
10 or less.

1159
01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:51.760
And we have 30 25 30 25 and 30 24 and four a three round fight.

1160
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.950
So clearly this is,
these are extraordinary scores.

1161
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:58.480
So this is a 30 24 is ten eight and every round ten eight and every round when

1162
01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:01.130
she said the other two were ten eight and last two rounds.
Yeah,

1163
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:05.720
that would be my guess.
I think it's right though.
I think 30 24 is right.

1164
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:10.750
100% it was a mauling what I used to look for before the rule change was a

1165
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.280
complete dominance.

1166
01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:15.950
It's gotta be one sided and there has to be moments where I go,

1167
01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:18.230
this should be stopped.
There has,

1168
01:02:18.231 --> 01:02:21.870
and there were a couple of moments in every round with in the cubby fight,

1169
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:25.500
we tend,
when I sought attitudes rounds,
Dominick Cruz and I after this,

1170
01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:29.670
after the fourth round or the second round,
rather,
we said,
do you think that it,

1171
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.510
you know,
this is a good argument for stoppage right here.

1172
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:36.420
The corner could be really within their best judgment to say,
hey,

1173
01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.990
this is enough.
The people I was with turns me and they said,

1174
01:02:39.991 --> 01:02:43.080
what do you tell your guy at this point?
I say,
show me something.

1175
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:46.710
If you don't show me something first minute of this fight tiles going in,

1176
01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.510
you got,
you know,
you've got gotta tell your guy,
look,

1177
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.740
you're getting handled here.

1178
01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.990
We've got to start thinking about your health and your future.

1179
01:02:51.991 --> 01:02:54.820
If I don't see something in the first minute,
and I'm,
I'm,
I'm calling this month.

1180
01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:54.990
Yeah.

1181
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:58.500
Could you imagine if Ed's and landed a flying knee three minutes into the third

1182
01:02:58.501 --> 01:03:02.580
round?
I mean,
if it did turn that fight around,

1183
01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:04.000
I mean it would have been one of the greatest comeback.

1184
01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:06.000
What she was capable of doing.
He's the kind of guy who could,

1185
01:03:06.001 --> 01:03:07.230
who could maybe throw that kind of thing.

1186
01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.350
It just didn't seem like it was going to work on,
could be.
He just,

1187
01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:14.310
he was mauling him to an extent where he was draining his energy to the point

1188
01:03:14.311 --> 01:03:17.550
where Edson,
we'd get up and he was trying to be mobile,

1189
01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:20.610
but you could see the wobble in his step.
He just wasn't steady.

1190
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:23.190
He wasn't able to uncork and he was just under a salt.

1191
01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.270
Also recently under assault,

1192
01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:29.271
there's a difference between a guy who can knock you out and a guy who's

1193
01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:34.520
naturally heavy handed everything you throw his heart Barbosa is a knockout guy,

1194
01:03:35.551 --> 01:03:39.960
but it's essentially his accuracy.
He's very,
very precise with what he throws.
Um,

1195
01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.220
he's not heavy handed enough to like necessarily club you with a shot and knock

1196
01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:45.300
you out.
He's not,
you know,

1197
01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:48.840
it's somewhere his kicks and they know what kind of guy you have in a sense,

1198
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:50.410
you know,
once again put you,

1199
01:03:50.411 --> 01:03:52.020
she'll pitbull and belt or that dude's just heavy handed.

1200
01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:55.280
He can hit you with anything.
It's gonna hurt you.
So if you're a guy,

1201
01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.110
that kind of guy,
and maybe he wins it last 30 seconds the last round.

1202
01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:02.400
But if you're a kicking guy who needs accuracy and timing and a guy is coming

1203
01:04:02.401 --> 01:04:05.950
forward like Kobi was coming forward,
what are your,

1204
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:07.770
you don't have a ton of options,
you know what I mean?

1205
01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:12.270
Know what kind of guy you have.
No.
Yeah,
you are in a lot of ways.
Well,

1206
01:04:12.271 --> 01:04:13.290
it was in a lot of ways it was,

1207
01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:16.200
it was a giant test for Khabib cause we wanted to see what he looked like

1208
01:04:16.201 --> 01:04:18.150
against one of the most elite strikers in the division.

1209
01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:22.470
But a lot of time often there will also was a big test for Barboza.
It's like,

1210
01:04:22.471 --> 01:04:25.080
cause you're going to have to use your hands here a lot and that's never been as

1211
01:04:25.081 --> 01:04:27.240
strong skin.
Strong suit has been as kicking though.

1212
01:04:27.241 --> 01:04:29.340
He knew how to negate that and move for the whole time.
Yeah.

1213
01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:33.720
And it fit or cro cop fade or step forward with the entire time knowing that cro

1214
01:04:33.721 --> 01:04:35.570
cop needs an outside game for the tour.
Yeah,

1215
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:39.600
just set the footwork traps and it's so difficult to move back constantly.

1216
01:04:39.601 --> 01:04:42.300
It's so much more exhausting to constantly moving back.

1217
01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.870
And you know Barboza was just getting chased cotton.

1218
01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:47.820
Imagine if that fight was in,
you know we have two cages.

1219
01:04:47.821 --> 01:04:50.400
We have the smaller cage to use for the ultimate fighter and then the bigger

1220
01:04:50.401 --> 01:04:54.330
cage,
the use for,
I kind of liked the idea of the smaller cage for everything.

1221
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:58.710
I kind of think that you can move around a certain amount,
that big ass cage,

1222
01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:00.420
like let's get some more seats in this bitch.

1223
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:06.390
Put the little cage in here and I mean the problem is I found in some tiny

1224
01:05:06.391 --> 01:05:09.630
cages,
oh stuff there's been some real little one says man,

1225
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:12.270
I used to have some of those local shows.

1226
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.890
Real little ones like smaller than this room.
Whenever I train.

1227
01:05:14.891 --> 01:05:18.310
It was always never more than like two steps backward.
So you hit the cage,

1228
01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:21.430
<v 0>you just,
you just,
you start hitting the fence,
you can get cornered.</v>

1229
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:24.110
So whenever we train,
it was two steps left to still try to la.

1230
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:29.200
That second day really limits a lot of,
you're striking a hundred percent yeah.

1231
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:35.440
It says,
have you ever thought about like a alternative venues?

1232
01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.260
Like what would be a good alternative venue for maybe we talked about on the

1233
01:05:38.261 --> 01:05:41.800
podcast with the fight companions all the time where I think like a football

1234
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:43.510
field or a basketball court,

1235
01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.810
I think like something will you fight in the center and you have plenty of room.

1236
01:05:46.811 --> 01:05:47.950
We never go outside of it.

1237
01:05:47.951 --> 01:05:50.530
And he Duke it out there like lion heart and shit like that.

1238
01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:55.410
Like an underground basement.
No Pool.
Remember they find a pool motherfuckers,

1239
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:57.230
well if you went to uh,
we,

1240
01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:01.420
we show science in the same arenas where they have basketball games,
right?
Yeah.

1241
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.000
We've got all these dudes running around on this area.

1242
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:07.540
But then when the fight takes place,
you know,
also we've got to put up a cage.

1243
01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:10.000
How about you just like keep that same size area,

1244
01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:12.490
the guy standing in the center and you know,

1245
01:06:12.491 --> 01:06:14.840
there's warning track where people are waiting on the outside edge.

1246
01:06:14.841 --> 01:06:15.820
Just tell him to go back in.

1247
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.230
But there's never a time we can press someone up against the cage,

1248
01:06:19.231 --> 01:06:22.480
tried to get a take down.
It just doesn't exist.
There's no cage like,

1249
01:06:22.481 --> 01:06:24.970
so you don't have that extra thing that's in there.

1250
01:06:24.971 --> 01:06:26.710
That's a factor because that is,

1251
01:06:26.711 --> 01:06:30.340
the cage is a factor of 100% a hundred percent a factor in your backward

1252
01:06:30.341 --> 01:06:32.530
movement.
It's a factor in your ability to get back up.

1253
01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.730
It's also a factor in some people's ability to hold you in place and to defend

1254
01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:39.970
against submissions.
Right.
The cage.
You can't roll into certain things.

1255
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:41.710
What if that wasn't there?

1256
01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:46.390
That would change a lot of what a wrestler can do inside the Octagon for sure.

1257
01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:48.550
It would either be awesome or absolutely terrible.

1258
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:52.480
There's not a lot of middle ground.
Yeah.
I think,

1259
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:54.430
do you remember when frank shamrock tried to do something like that?

1260
01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:58.990
He had a thing called shoot box.
Do you remember that?
Yeah,
I do.
I do.

1261
01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:04.090
He had let her saw it was like a shallow bowl and you would fight in the middle

1262
01:07:04.091 --> 01:07:07.040
of Yama.
Did that thing.
Yeah,

1263
01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:11.590
so did is Norris's world combat and leave and they have kickboxing and that kind

1264
01:07:11.591 --> 01:07:14.920
of a thing.
If they had like a little,
and Dan was fun.
Yup,
he did.

1265
01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:18.700
I think Wonderboy might've as well.
It's a piece.
Yeah.
I think he did crazy.

1266
01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:23.560
Raymond Daniels is fucking monster.
Who going to be slow?
John White,
Bro.

1267
01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:28.360
Dude.
Jefferson,
the old men in the sport of Oscar.
41 still smashing people,

1268
01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:32.110
dude.
Unbelievable.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Belt or kickboxing.

1269
01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:36.220
That's one thing that I really enjoyed that they did that they really focused on

1270
01:07:36.221 --> 01:07:40.870
worldclass kickboxing,
you know,
I mean guys like Joe Schilling,
uh,

1271
01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:42.970
Raymond Daniels,
uh,

1272
01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:48.030
they have like some of the best people from the kickboxing world that came over

1273
01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:52.280
were competing for them and they're making a big deal out of it and just put it

1274
01:07:52.281 --> 01:07:56.130
on exciting coker baby.
He really loves kickboxing.
No,
he does.
Yeah.

1275
01:07:56.740 --> 01:08:00.520
Yeah.
Well it didn't used to work for K one.
Yep.
It was this thing,
man.
Yeah.

1276
01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.870
That's where he started back in the day.

1277
01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:06.580
I think I got tickets for him from the Bellagio like way back in the day when

1278
01:08:06.581 --> 01:08:10.750
Peter Earth's fought.
Stefan Leco.
Oh Shit.
Old School.

1279
01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:15.380
Dutch lumberjack man.
Yeah,
man.
Brutal.
Yeah,
it awesome.

1280
01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:16.100
I'm a big

1281
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.060
<v 1>fan of kickboxing.</v>

1282
01:08:17.061 --> 01:08:21.050
I like the fact that Bella toward decided to engage with both of those things.

1283
01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:23.990
Um,
Kevin Ross,
a gas Tom Bolanos,

1284
01:08:23.991 --> 01:08:28.070
but I just wish they would have like a completely separate thing.

1285
01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:30.790
Like make it a bit like,
and they call it bell tour too,

1286
01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.850
and people get confused and bill tour.
That's kickbox like Bella tour kickboxing.

1287
01:08:34.851 --> 01:08:38.840
Yeah.
Well it did.
Is it,
obviously they piggyback off the MMA shows.

1288
01:08:38.841 --> 01:08:40.830
It's already exists so we,
we shoot them together.
Right.

1289
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:44.490
So they just changed the ring to a case to take.
They have it,

1290
01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:45.740
it lowers from the ceiling.

1291
01:08:45.741 --> 01:08:47.470
It's actually really cool if you've ever seen him before.
Yeah.

1292
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.220
So what happens is they start out,

1293
01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:52.130
well when they started with the writing of the ring set up and all they have to

1294
01:08:52.131 --> 01:08:54.200
do is change the,
the mat and they cheated,

1295
01:08:54.201 --> 01:08:56.300
they take out the ropes and then the ring,

1296
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:58.250
I mean the cage comes from the ceiling.

1297
01:08:58.550 --> 01:09:01.280
They have it suspended up there with the lights and it comes down and they play

1298
01:09:01.281 --> 01:09:05.390
2001 and they latch it in and then MMA stars do.
Man,
it's pretty cool.

1299
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:08.150
Some people have recorded,
I hope you find it on well,

1300
01:09:08.151 --> 01:09:12.230
you know what's interesting,
Bella tour,
whether intention intentionally or not,

1301
01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:17.120
they nailed the correct shape for a platform in which are ranks.
It's on.

1302
01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.540
Yeah,
because there Bernard Hopkins fight when he fought Joe Smith Jr and he got

1303
01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:23.330
knocked out and he went flying through the ropes and fell and hit his head.

1304
01:09:23.331 --> 01:09:27.230
I was like,
oh,
how was this not protect?
How do they not have that figure it out?

1305
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:27.591
Well,

1306
01:09:27.591 --> 01:09:31.580
the way to have figured it out would be to have more space on the outside of the

1307
01:09:31.581 --> 01:09:32.060
ring,

1308
01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:34.850
but the idea that you could just fall right through the ring and there's nothing

1309
01:09:34.851 --> 01:09:37.730
there to catch you.
All you would need is an extra four or five feet.

1310
01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:42.090
That's what we have.
Perfect.
It's perfect you guys.
They have figured it out.

1311
01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:45.190
They stopped doing that any more broadly.
I know.

1312
01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:50.960
I'll get you doing eventually they fucked up.
Who's going to take your spot?

1313
01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:55.490
I have no idea.
I really have no idea.
I've heard of it.
I mean,

1314
01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:59.170
I have a couple theories,
but I don't know.
No idea.

1315
01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.630
Now when it goes over to the paramount network,
yes.
When does that happen now?

1316
01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:05.690
Is it to the 18 look at this.
They lower from the ceiling

1317
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:11.850
and they use a round one.
Yeah.
We use around Kj so it sits right in.

1318
01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:15.860
I like round two.
No need to have sharp edges,
but the octagon,

1319
01:10:15.861 --> 01:10:20.300
it's like it is what it is.
It's a thing now it's a thing.
Yeah.
Rounds.

1320
01:10:20.301 --> 01:10:24.380
Pretty dope though.
Not Bad man.
Works pretty well.
Um,

1321
01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:28.610
I'm sorry,
what were you saying?
Who might,
who might replace me?
I don't know.
Yeah,

1322
01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:31.820
no,
I have no idea.
What have they ever taught about changing their name?

1323
01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:36.980
No other they did years ago.
Well,
years ago.
What were the options?

1324
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:38.000
I don't know.
I think,

1325
01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:41.150
I think at one point they were thinking about using the network name,

1326
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.660
so it'd be like spike MMA,
but I don't know how far that went or,

1327
01:10:44.661 --> 01:10:48.900
and how many options they had.
I don't know why not like Hbo Boxing Box.

1328
01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.640
Kind of like that spike him in me.
I think that's the way to go.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1329
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:56.870
The UFE well now it's not gonna work.
Well,
paramount network and MMA,

1330
01:10:56.871 --> 01:11:01.610
which doesn't roll off the tongue.
Exactly.
Spike MMA sounds good.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1331
01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.740
Paramount.
And they were considering that.
Well,
yeah,

1332
01:11:03.741 --> 01:11:07.580
the 18th I think they change over and then their first first belt are shown

1333
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:12.470
there was on the 20th two days after.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Spike TV.
MMA.

1334
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.270
Yeah.
Why paramount network paramount.
Come on.

1335
01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:21.900
You had spike for a long time.
But at the HBO boxing champion though,

1336
01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:26.400
Right.
You know when they up a belt.
That's true.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's true.
Yeah.

1337
01:11:26.401 --> 01:11:29.100
That actually is a very good point.
Like there should be some sort of a,

1338
01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:31.230
a sanctioning body.
Yeah.

1339
01:11:31.231 --> 01:11:35.070
I mean they tried that member whammo memorable Amador won the championship was

1340
01:11:35.071 --> 01:11:38.700
there was affliction and they tried to kind of make a belt,

1341
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:44.190
but it was called both the Ama,
the gene realize how that would sound.

1342
01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:45.510
What am I am on?

1343
01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:49.110
So what happened was they tried to make a belt that was independent of any

1344
01:11:49.111 --> 01:11:50.050
particular promotion.
Yeah.

1345
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:53.400
Meaning the women belt would move when that fight or went somewhere else and

1346
01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:55.980
yeah,
just the way him and may work.
That was never going to fly.

1347
01:11:56.710 --> 01:12:00.540
Just let people like,
well why not?
I mean it does that and boxing.
Why not?

1348
01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.730
And there's no good answer.
Well,

1349
01:12:02.731 --> 01:12:06.000
the answer is that the brands are much more protective.
What is this?

1350
01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:10.860
It's Donald Trump Wellville that is high layer.

1351
01:12:10.861 --> 01:12:14.870
He was there.
I was there now Sylvia versus fate or,
yeah,

1352
01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:19.820
that was the first when my belt,
right?
Yup.
Dude,
that's a whole Lynch Shinier.

1353
01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.570
You wanted beaten somebody.
I forget who's got that.
Well,

1354
01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:25.370
we belt know who's got that bitch.
Somebody has to,

1355
01:12:25.371 --> 01:12:30.090
you have to find out now like maybe we need to bring me on my back.
So whatever.

1356
01:12:30.091 --> 01:12:34.290
It became a of Emilia Akos Wema belt.
Anyway.
Yes.

1357
01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:39.510
I do not know this.
Things that you wonder like a fighters' union,

1358
01:12:39.511 --> 01:12:42.420
like maybe he's that kind of work,
you know,

1359
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:44.340
a sanctioning body outside of the UFC.

1360
01:12:44.341 --> 01:12:48.210
It seems like the momentum is so strong in the fact of the UFC being the

1361
01:12:48.211 --> 01:12:52.320
dominant organization.
It's like cue tips,
you know,
it's like that name.

1362
01:12:52.321 --> 01:12:55.860
Like cotton swab.
Yeah.
Oh,
but there's a cute tips like the NFL.

1363
01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:59.570
Can I have a facial tissue?
Uh,
what,
what Kleenex.
Come on bitch.
Well then,

1364
01:12:59.690 --> 01:13:01.590
all right,
so let me,
one of my pet peeves that I,

1365
01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:04.080
I'll explain right now that falls in line,

1366
01:13:04.081 --> 01:13:07.200
right with that I hate with a passion.

1367
01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:09.780
I hate explaining to people what I do for living.
Really.

1368
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:14.310
I fucking hate it when I was a belter.
Why?
Oh,
because you worked for bell tour?

1369
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:17.080
No,
because what happened was like I'm in a cab,
leaving it on the,

1370
01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:21.030
and they go and they go,
uh,
hey.
Uh,
so where are you coming?

1371
01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:25.200
When are you coming from?
Oh,
you know,
Miami.
What are you doing?
Work,

1372
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:27.000
what kind of work do you do?

1373
01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:32.520
I'm a commentator for mixed martial arts fights and you'd just get a blank
stare.

1374
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:35.160
They just have no idea what you were talking about.
And then you go,

1375
01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:39.360
you know where they put people in the cage and they fight and then they go,
oh,

1376
01:13:39.361 --> 01:13:41.910
you,
I see you worked with,
no,
no,
it's,
it's,

1377
01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.730
I got explained that MMA is a sport and belt.

1378
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.430
I've had this conversation 50 times.
It's just your average.

1379
01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:53.500
Once again,
if I say I need a cotton swab or I need to clean my ears with it.

1380
01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:55.620
What?
I need a cue tip.
Okay,
I got it.

1381
01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:00.270
Don't Trump's coming up with the XFL.
He's re bringing it,

1382
01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:04.790
bringing it rich.
The XFL.
Yup.
He used to have the XFL.
Yeah.

1383
01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:08.910
Now he's coming back with the XFL again.
They're going to call Donald Trump.

1384
01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.350
It was um,
Vince Mcmahon.
I'm kidding.

1385
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:13.390
<v 0>Just joking around,
but it wasn't,</v>

1386
01:14:13.391 --> 01:14:16.600
didn't John Donald Trump have something to do with the Xfl?
He did.
Right,

1387
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:17.530
but now Vince Mcmahon's,

1388
01:14:17.531 --> 01:14:22.531
Kennewick man Xfo XFL return dream gets closer as WWE head Vince Mcmahon files

1389
01:14:25.601 --> 01:14:29.860
to sell shares.
You ever had any dealings with Vince?
Vince Mcmahon?
No.

1390
01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:34.090
I'm a fan of that guy.
He's character funding.
Unbelievable.
Jack.
That's fuck.

1391
01:14:34.091 --> 01:14:38.470
At 72 it's on the deal.
He's on all of them.
Steroids,

1392
01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:41.200
70 years old,
just fucking jacked.

1393
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:44.700
One of the camera guys and bill towards is a guy named Bubba dean who worked for

1394
01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:49.060
name,
great name.
He worked for Vince for like 20 years.
He was Vince's guy.

1395
01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:52.740
This guy's stories.
You got to have come on,
son.

1396
01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:56.470
Got All his teeth knocked out by stone cold.
Steve Austin while doing a shoot.

1397
01:14:56.530 --> 01:15:00.430
Vince did know the camera guy.
Oh,
but he has these crazy stories of doing stuff.

1398
01:15:00.431 --> 01:15:01.700
When he got his teeth knocked down,

1399
01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:04.420
all that stuff and all these crazy Vince stories.
It's nuts.
Vince.

1400
01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:07.090
When Vince blew his quad out,

1401
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:12.300
he like jumped into the ring and slammed his muscle on the edge of the a ring

1402
01:15:12.581 --> 01:15:16.570
accidentally and just literally separated his fucking quad muscle from the bone

1403
01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:20.320
and just sat there on his ass and kept going.
Unbelievable.
I mean,

1404
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:25.210
just that alone man,
selling it like that.
I mean,
he couldn't even walk,
dude,

1405
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:26.860
and he's selling the whole thing.

1406
01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:30.370
We talked to people behind the scenes about WDN.
What goes into it?

1407
01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:35.720
It's really incredible.
I've got jack you,
Jesus Christ chase us.

1408
01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:39.650
He saw jack.
That's the most jack seven year old of all time.

1409
01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:45.040
Who is that fake Mark Coleman behind him.
That's it,
dude.
Get some.

1410
01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:48.100
The juice goes straight to Mexico.
That dude,
he's got,

1411
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:52.750
it wears a prosthetic phase and everything crosses that age at that age.

1412
01:15:52.751 --> 01:15:56.830
It's like anti aging.
It's legal.
Anti aging technology.
Oh,

1413
01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:01.030
let's be honest.
He's on more than that.
Oh yes.
I'm quite a bit,

1414
01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:05.370
that's not normal stuff.
He's going deep.
Fuck it.
You know like Stallone,

1415
01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:09.270
you know if you're going to do it,
go and at 70 it's like,
what do you know?

1416
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:12.130
Why not?
I was telling her he's stolen my canary in a coal mine.

1417
01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:15.910
That's killing dot.
Yeah.
Watching,
watching,
see you.
[inaudible] to Altify,

1418
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:17.440
how much to take and how much to hang up,
bro.

1419
01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:19.120
How do you feel going to get road rage?

1420
01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:23.441
Well,

1421
01:16:23.441 --> 01:16:28.441
one of the things that led lights not bro about rising and you know is that they

1422
01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.060
want,
they don't give that.
When you say I don't give a fuck,
they don't give it.

1423
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:36.370
I think horizon,
she had Gabby,
I can't believe she's 26 pounds overweight.

1424
01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.870
I think it was 27 or 26 27 please.
Japan P is cheese.

1425
01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:44.950
If I could beg of you anything,
don't let Gabby go see a beat up any more.

1426
01:16:44.951 --> 01:16:48.160
Grandmas.
It's literally,
they think it's funny.

1427
01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:51.370
They biggest shit time picks up grandma's.
You know what?
No,

1428
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:53.890
I'm sure this is something I've talked to people about a lot.

1429
01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.150
The old school fans was for it now that prides gone,
you know,

1430
01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.230
pride forever and probably never done a little pride.

1431
01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:03.700
Pride had some matches that made you go,
what the fuck is going on here?

1432
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:07.090
They love that shit.
Love for each was for the Japanese audience.

1433
01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:09.950
So they would have got weight classes,
were suggestions.

1434
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:14.210
They didn't test anybody.
Uh,
they would throw any,
you know,

1435
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:16.310
experience level men,
absolutely nothing.

1436
01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.090
And there was a member of the Euro Matsui of course.
Sure.
That guy,

1437
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:23.740
they loved watching that guy get beat up.
He fought everybody,
they matched,

1438
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:25.910
loved watching,
does your mess.

1439
01:17:25.911 --> 01:17:29.030
So He'd get his fucking face beaten and they loved him and was like,

1440
01:17:29.031 --> 01:17:32.570
I didn't like him.
They,
there's something in the car.
They love that shit.

1441
01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:36.500
And I'll tell people,
I'll go look.
You know,
pride had,
did have some great fights.

1442
01:17:36.501 --> 01:17:41.330
It also had some fights that were crazy,
ridiculous.
Unbelievable mismatches.

1443
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:44.610
Yeah.
The weight classes that mean their,

1444
01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:49.690
their appreciation for a fighter struggle was every if not yeah,

1445
01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:52.280
if not more important in the fight or being victorious.

1446
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:57.490
It's like the fighter being just being Valeant in the face of overwhelming odds

1447
01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:00.530
was almost more enjoyable to them.

1448
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.330
I like Bushido more cause they just didn't pull that in bushy though.

1449
01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.990
And they featured the lighter guys and I don't remember and Bushido any,

1450
01:18:07.991 --> 01:18:10.400
any fights.
I was like,
oh my God,
this things,
I think you're right.

1451
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:14.270
Now that I'm remembering who Shito a bit more.
It was great.
They were all great.

1452
01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.550
That was when Quadros and uh,

1453
01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:20.150
was it quadros and I'm quadrants or the commentators?

1454
01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:24.390
Well it was in a moral,
moral quadros or more.
Oh boss,
those are those,

1455
01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:29.420
you know why I too,
they only had one or two shots at it.
That one guy who was a,

1456
01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:33.920
uh,
he was like some sort of a radio,
a sports guy.

1457
01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:37.730
What the fuck is his name?
Mad Dog or something like that.
God dammit.

1458
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:40.970
He only did it once.
There was one guy for pride.
Yeah.

1459
01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:45.710
One guy who was the play by play guy with boss route and once he's fun,

1460
01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:48.860
it's like kind of silly guy but a little out of his element.

1461
01:18:49.670 --> 01:18:53.160
Little out of his element didn't,
didn't necessarily um,
took,

1462
01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:54.320
we were talking about earlier like

1463
01:18:55.820 --> 01:19:00.590
it's very difficult to find someone who's a play by play guy who is also a

1464
01:19:00.591 --> 01:19:03.860
martial artist and also like really,
really invested in the sport.

1465
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:07.750
Whereas a guy like you,
a color guy,
those guys,
there's,
it's,

1466
01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:12.820
there's more chance that you're going to have a technical understanding of the

1467
01:19:13.131 --> 01:19:15.980
sport and also be able to be entertaining about it.

1468
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:19.070
Whereas they just have to be entertaining about it and read the script.

1469
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:20.300
They don't necessarily,

1470
01:19:20.301 --> 01:19:23.960
it's so it's super hard to find a guy who's as knowledgeable as you,

1471
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:26.290
but that is also a play by play guy.
I always say,

1472
01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:31.340
I always said Brian Stann should do it because Brian Stann play by play.

1473
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:34.610
And he could do either or,
but it would be different because Brian,

1474
01:19:34.611 --> 01:19:36.650
Stan has in my opinion,

1475
01:19:36.651 --> 01:19:41.630
he has the voice and the personality and the delivery that like the strength in

1476
01:19:41.631 --> 01:19:46.340
his,
like the way he formed sentences in an in an entertaining but powerful way.

1477
01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:51.460
Like he could be a really good believable play by play guy who's also super

1478
01:19:52.281 --> 01:19:55.310
legit martial artists.
So He'd be like the only guy that's doing it that way.

1479
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:58.260
Well the problem,
the problem with having uh,
uh,

1480
01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:00.890
a play by play guy who's two nodule,

1481
01:20:00.891 --> 01:20:04.720
they start doing both of them sitting there and that's probably when the guy is

1482
01:20:04.730 --> 01:20:07.980
like a freak fan or thinks they know a lot about sports.
They start

1483
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.810
<v 1>doing it,
they start doing color as they're doing blood work.</v>

1484
01:20:09.850 --> 01:20:13.050
I think that is as long as it's,

1485
01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:16.560
as long as everybody is aware,
like no one,

1486
01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:19.800
not one person talks too much and everybody kind of lets everybody go get in,

1487
01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.330
you know,
and,
and you,

1488
01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.920
it's like one of the things that I like to do when we have a DC or when we have

1489
01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:27.840
Dominick Cruz or whoever sits next to me,

1490
01:20:27.841 --> 01:20:32.530
sometimes I like to ask them questions like I want to,
I want to go in,

1491
01:20:32.531 --> 01:20:35.910
I want to give them a position like,
do you,
what do you like to do here?

1492
01:20:35.911 --> 01:20:38.880
Like how do you approach this?
Like what's your thought process here?

1493
01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:40.590
Or like for DC,

1494
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:44.520
DC's and Dominic was amazing too this weekend about breaking down clinch work

1495
01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:48.930
and what someone's doing wrong or why this is a stagnant position for them.

1496
01:20:48.931 --> 01:20:49.764
And what,
you know,

1497
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:54.000
like I think if you had a guy who was a play by play guy,

1498
01:20:54.010 --> 01:20:57.300
just as long as he knows,
as long as everybody's cool with everybody,

1499
01:20:57.301 --> 01:20:59.670
like everybody's flow,
you know,
like that I think.

1500
01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:03.000
But that is one of the things that came in really well with me and Goldie

1501
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:08.120
because we'd worked together for so long since we knew how to slide things in.

1502
01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:11.080
We knew we knew when to talk and when you know,

1503
01:21:11.081 --> 01:21:13.920
and sometimes we just talked over each other like some shit was happening and

1504
01:21:13.921 --> 01:21:15.930
you know,
but that's okay too.
Yeah.
You know,

1505
01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.680
I've gone through four for the last year,
year and a half.

1506
01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:23.820
I did a few different guys back in the de identify,
Hey,
what the fuck?

1507
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:26.280
Cut that out of the show.
Yeah,
we can edit that.
Right.
Cool.

1508
01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.770
I worked with a few different guys back in the day,

1509
01:21:28.771 --> 01:21:33.720
but one of the guys that people forgot who was amazing was Bruce Beck.

1510
01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:37.830
Bruce Beck.
Yup.
Bach.
I worked with him in boxing.

1511
01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:42.010
That PBC.
He gave me really good advice for what you were talking about.

1512
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:44.340
It's difficult post fight interviews,
you know,

1513
01:21:44.341 --> 01:21:48.810
he's just gave me advice and having things to say and planning things out and

1514
01:21:48.811 --> 01:21:51.690
you know how to,
how to,
you know,
how to word things.

1515
01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.520
He knew I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.

1516
01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:56.610
Matt Mitrione when when they hired him to do belt or kickboxing,

1517
01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:57.301
we were in Turin,

1518
01:21:57.301 --> 01:22:01.500
Italy and Matt mature and I think he was a priest back actually at that time.

1519
01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.210
He hadn't filled out yet.

1520
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:08.310
So Matt Mitchell and he's there by himself has never done color commentary

1521
01:22:08.311 --> 01:22:12.000
before and all the kickboxing fighters are showing up.
I've already done MMA.

1522
01:22:12.090 --> 01:22:14.850
I wasn't doing kickboxing at the time.
I take Matt and I go,
okay,
cool.

1523
01:22:14.851 --> 01:22:15.511
I'll walk you through this.

1524
01:22:15.511 --> 01:22:18.950
So I stayed and helped him interview all the kickboxing fighters and he's

1525
01:22:18.951 --> 01:22:21.690
sitting there,
he's like,
need some advice?
You'd never done this before?

1526
01:22:21.691 --> 01:22:25.080
And I said,
the only device that game was,
don't say anything.

1527
01:22:25.081 --> 01:22:29.430
My mom knows if my mom's watching boxing and somebody was punched in the face

1528
01:22:29.431 --> 01:22:31.080
and in turn I'm going to go to that guy just got punched in the face.

1529
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.910
My mom would go,
yeah,
I know that I can.
I can see that.

1530
01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.190
My mom knows when someone's getting punched in the face.

1531
01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.430
My mom doesn't know how the foot works.
Set that right hand up.

1532
01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:42.210
That's your job is not.
That guy just got punched.
I'll look at them.
It is not,

1533
01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:44.520
it's not fucking radio.
They can see it.
Okay,

1534
01:22:44.521 --> 01:22:49.521
so your job as the expert is to the things that a layman or someone not

1535
01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:52.770
experiencing sport doesn't quite know like footwork and combinations and stuff

1536
01:22:52.771 --> 01:22:55.200
like that.
And I said stick to that.
I go,

1537
01:22:55.201 --> 01:22:59.550
just stick to filling in the gaps that your expertise will help fill in.

1538
01:22:59.610 --> 01:23:01.980
Don't say,
Oh,
you know,
you don't have to say everything in the world.

1539
01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:06.560
And when everybody talks,
everybody loses.
That's how you have to think about it.

1540
01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:09.130
He knows when to talk and I don't wanna talk.
We don't talk over each other.

1541
01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:14.020
Everybody loses it when we talk over each other the same time we both sound like

1542
01:23:14.021 --> 01:23:15.850
crap.
So just no one,
you know,

1543
01:23:15.851 --> 01:23:17.680
you'll get a feel for window layout and wanting to go in.

1544
01:23:17.890 --> 01:23:22.540
But my number one advice was don't say anything that someone on the street could

1545
01:23:22.541 --> 01:23:26.650
look at the TV and figured out it.
Buffalo wild wings can yell at the TV.

1546
01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.800
Why are you here?
We don't need an expert.
Anybody can say that.

1547
01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.990
What do you feel in it made him feel way better.
I said,
they look,

1548
01:23:32.991 --> 01:23:35.590
just fill in this stuff than your average person would know.

1549
01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:39.520
That's a very good game plan.
That's very wise.
Very versatile.
Yeah.

1550
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:42.920
Use this power for good.
Yeah.
That's what I was talking to something.

1551
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.910
Don't say what my mom did.
You get caught up in and there's a right hand.

1552
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:48.550
You don't have to call every,
they can see that now.

1553
01:23:48.551 --> 01:23:51.720
The hard part is the grappling people are,
a lot of people totally lost.

1554
01:23:51.721 --> 01:23:55.260
We have to call a lot with to fill in a lot more of that because sometimes you

1555
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:57.760
want to react to certain punches.
They hit landed too,

1556
01:23:57.761 --> 01:24:01.660
and you just gotta know when to,
when not to.
It's that develops man.

1557
01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:03.580
Get a feeling for that,
you know?
Yeah.

1558
01:24:03.581 --> 01:24:05.710
It's a weird thing that you're thinking of it.

1559
01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:07.660
At least I am when I'm doing it also is like,

1560
01:24:08.290 --> 01:24:11.320
it's a product like you're contributing to a product.
You're like,

1561
01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:16.120
you're adding to it with sound and with description and with the entertainment

1562
01:24:16.121 --> 01:24:18.200
value of the way you distribute your words.
You know,

1563
01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:22.700
good broadcaster knows they're not tuning in for us.
Yeah,

1564
01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:26.020
we can make it better.
We certainly can.
We certainly can't.

1565
01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:30.130
Well definitely we're there to get out of our own raw.
Exactly.
Fuck it up 100%.

1566
01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:33.820
We can also detract from broadcast and you gotta be careful then detracting is

1567
01:24:33.821 --> 01:24:37.510
the worst.
Yeah.
I mean I know,
I think probably both been guilty of that at some,

1568
01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:41.500
oh yeah.
In any moment is not free balling.
You know,

1569
01:24:41.501 --> 01:24:44.930
you're doing a live thing and you have,
I mean,
when,

1570
01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:49.060
when you're anticipating things happening and they're happening or something's

1571
01:24:49.061 --> 01:24:52.390
different than you thought it was going to happen and you're trying to put the

1572
01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:56.530
words to it correctly and in the moment of live on TV,

1573
01:24:57.310 --> 01:25:02.050
it doesn't always work out how to get myself up so bad.
Man,

1574
01:25:02.051 --> 01:25:06.760
when I make a mistake,
man,
I'm mad me to fucking until the next show.
Yeah.
But,

1575
01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.130
and then I'll look sometimes like nobody noticed it.

1576
01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:12.770
I'm the one that that's mad at myself.
But that's why you're really good.
Oh Man,

1577
01:25:12.771 --> 01:25:14.300
I get mad.
That's why you really think,

1578
01:25:14.410 --> 01:25:17.650
I mean anybody who is really good at anything,

1579
01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:22.380
you get that way because if fucking up on it just seems horrible,
you know?

1580
01:25:22.381 --> 01:25:24.730
It just really messes with your head.
Yeah.
Any,

1581
01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:29.650
I've just come to accept that weird feeling,
you know,
and use it and go,

1582
01:25:29.651 --> 01:25:30.041
all right,

1583
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:33.760
whatever that shit feeling is where I flubbed that word or forgot that guy's

1584
01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:37.480
name or whatever it is and I am conflated the two people,
whatever it is,

1585
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:40.420
get over it,
keep moving.
Just do your best.

1586
01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:45.460
And that feeling because of the fact that I can't just blow it off,

1587
01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:48.310
I can't just be like,
who gives a shit?
I don't have that in me.

1588
01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:50.830
That's why I try hard.

1589
01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:54.730
And that's why with every broadcast when I get through it and it's good,

1590
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:59.620
I'm like,
okay,
we did.
You know I still get that.
I still get that juice,

1591
01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:02.800
man.
I still,
every time,
and it's funny,

1592
01:26:02.801 --> 01:26:06.650
I'm for disappearing after a show.
I'm known for that,

1593
01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:11.170
for like the show's done and everybody goes,
well my AA,
I don't drink.
So I'm,

1594
01:26:11.171 --> 01:26:14.940
I'm out of that loop completely.
But what about your heroin use?
Uh,
you know,

1595
01:26:14.941 --> 01:26:17.540
all that,
that's a home thing.
I'm not going to bring it on a plane.

1596
01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:23.090
Come on rookie anyway,
so,
so anyway,
um,

1597
01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:27.500
I'm known for disappearing after a show because a show just takes a lot out of

1598
01:26:27.501 --> 01:26:30.880
me,
like everybody else out at the bar doing whatever.
And I go to my room and I,

1599
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:34.970
I just download it.
You don't fucking starving after shows or that.

1600
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:39.320
And the problem is that a lot of times it's,
you know,
when I'm out in,
in,
in

1601
01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:44.570
Vacaville or something or I'm out in like moving Kansas and you're at a smokey

1602
01:26:44.571 --> 01:26:47.420
casino and there's one place to eat and have a fight,
just let out.

1603
01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:52.370
And you're like,
oh my God.
You know,
it's like a real decision I have to make.

1604
01:26:52.371 --> 01:26:55.610
A lot of times it's MIT too hungry to sleep or am I too tired to eat?

1605
01:26:56.510 --> 01:27:01.250
Which one of those am I asleep?
I almost always use sleep.

1606
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:04.460
Almost always sleep.
But yeah,
I just disappear.
I just go to my Gotcha.

1607
01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:07.340
Cause it's hard.
It's just takes a lot of money.
I bring stuff with me anyway.

1608
01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:10.280
I always bring protein bars.
I bring canned oysters.

1609
01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:13.280
I bring different things that I could eat that I know are healthy.

1610
01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:17.690
I'll bring like a bunch of cans of canned oysters cause it's like they're soaked

1611
01:27:17.691 --> 01:27:22.610
in olive oil for healthy bang.
A few cans those out go to sleep and family time.

1612
01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:26.750
What's that?
What does your family oh go and [inaudible] mostly Italian.

1613
01:27:26.751 --> 01:27:31.280
A little bit of Irish.
All my friend is Greek.
My Mom's Greek restaurant,
German,

1614
01:27:31.281 --> 01:27:33.830
Irish olive oil is a big part of the olive oils.

1615
01:27:33.831 --> 01:27:38.180
The shit that is one of the best fucking things your body can take in olive oil

1616
01:27:38.181 --> 01:27:38.781
is fantastic.

1617
01:27:38.781 --> 01:27:41.690
And what a pain that Dick it is to make you think about all the stuff they had

1618
01:27:41.691 --> 01:27:45.300
to go through.
Like when you see an,
I had an olive tree in my yard and uh,

1619
01:27:45.301 --> 01:27:49.220
the olives fall down these nasty little fuck.
I was like,
this isn't an olive.

1620
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:53.640
And they're like,
oh yeah,
there's a whole process this.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1621
01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:56.760
Like I thought it all of came from a tree like at all.

1622
01:27:56.761 --> 01:27:59.750
But like you could just pick any one of those green ones.
No,

1623
01:27:59.870 --> 01:28:02.360
I grew up in San Joaquin Valley.
They had the whole thing set up there,
man,

1624
01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:05.510
until I was nine years old.
Yeah.
A lot of all of stuff.
Yeah.

1625
01:28:05.511 --> 01:28:07.760
A buddy of mine makes olive oil in his yard.

1626
01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:12.740
He's got a shit ton of olive trees in his yard and uh,
he,

1627
01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:17.860
he set this whole thing up with the hopes of eventually making his own olive oil

1628
01:28:18.651 --> 01:28:21.470
from his,
from his own yard.
Kind of good luck,
dude.

1629
01:28:21.471 --> 01:28:26.240
You can much easier to find the story,
but be part of the Diet growing up.

1630
01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:30.120
Mom cooks a lot,
man.
That's phenomenal for you,
man.
You know what's funny?
My,
my,

1631
01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:33.560
my mom had had cooked for the belt or crew before really come over to her house

1632
01:28:33.561 --> 01:28:37.430
and she cooked for the whole crew.
25 people.
God Damn my mom.

1633
01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:40.550
She's like a caterer.
She loves that Shit.
Wow.
She loves that Shit.
Anyway,

1634
01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:43.490
so literally,
you know,
I had my,
my,
my,

1635
01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:47.870
I left bell toward literally one of the people went,

1636
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:52.280
your mom,
your mom was still cook for us,
right.
Anytime.

1637
01:28:52.770 --> 01:28:55.960
Like we want mom and the divorce.
And I was like,
okay,
cool.
Mom,

1638
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:58.670
mom's okay with it.
Mom loves everything.
Belts are coming live with my mother.

1639
01:28:58.671 --> 01:28:59.870
So it was kinda funny.

1640
01:28:59.871 --> 01:29:03.030
She had them all over for dinner and I hope they were really,

1641
01:29:03.031 --> 01:29:04.560
really upset about my mom.

1642
01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.800
I hope Bella tour makes it and I say that with all Doosan 70 to 100% now that

1643
01:29:10.141 --> 01:29:14.060
we're both not hundred pallet tour.
Yeah.
Both of,
now I'll talk about this.
Yeah.

1644
01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.840
It's like,
I always heard this before,

1645
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:20.580
like maybe they are in competition with UFC,
the corporate entity,
but my,

1646
01:29:20.581 --> 01:29:23.520
in my opinion it's not,
it was never that they were in competition with me.

1647
01:29:23.521 --> 01:29:25.710
My thoughts are that they're valuable,

1648
01:29:25.711 --> 01:29:28.830
that it's important and that the more competition you have,
the better.

1649
01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:32.520
And then I also felt like having a guy like you out there who's doing
commentary,

1650
01:29:32.521 --> 01:29:35.430
who's kicking ass makes me better.
I know that you're really good at it.

1651
01:29:35.431 --> 01:29:37.530
I will listen to you.
Very sharp.

1652
01:29:37.770 --> 01:29:40.830
I listen to people and I'm sure you're the same way that they're uncomfortable

1653
01:29:40.831 --> 01:29:42.850
or clunky doing commentary.
It,
it's,
it's,

1654
01:29:42.851 --> 01:29:46.470
it makes for an awkward experience from me watching it,
we listened to it a lot.

1655
01:29:46.471 --> 01:29:49.230
I mean,
I really listened with that ear because that's our job.
You know,

1656
01:29:49.231 --> 01:29:51.750
you really listen with that ear and,
and you know,

1657
01:29:51.751 --> 01:29:54.000
you're probably overly critical.
We are at least when you're listening to,

1658
01:29:54.001 --> 01:29:57.810
but to our peers and,
and uh,
yeah,
I did the same thing.

1659
01:29:57.811 --> 01:29:59.770
I'm like bad commentary can really high and just kind of,

1660
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:02.640
if you get good at like a producer can hear things where you go,

1661
01:30:02.641 --> 01:30:05.630
I don't even hear that.
Sure.
Something's a little off and just bugs him.

1662
01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.450
Just clunky,
you know,

1663
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:11.250
especially for someone who's called and seen as many fights as you have.

1664
01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:13.170
Your idea of what's clunky is like you're,

1665
01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:15.960
the data chunking that you're doing is very different.

1666
01:30:15.961 --> 01:30:18.480
It's very much more high level than the average person.

1667
01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:21.990
There's just not a lot of people doing it.
Which tenure?
Yurman yeah.

1668
01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:27.390
No one time when I was doing art,
no,
I was doing and one before that.
Who Was it?

1669
01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:30.030
And I did affliction to those are both before,

1670
01:30:30.031 --> 01:30:32.430
but was Jason Chambers the first bell of the first year.

1671
01:30:32.431 --> 01:30:37.380
He was the belt organ when it was on Espn Deportes this and it was just a web

1672
01:30:37.381 --> 01:30:40.080
series in English associate could just see it on the website in English.

1673
01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:44.010
It was Anik and Jason Jammers.
Holy Shit.
That's crazy.

1674
01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:47.430
Jason and I have lived re weirdly parallel lives.
Yeah,

1675
01:30:47.431 --> 01:30:50.910
you guys both had that show.
We travel,
we fought each other.

1676
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:54.690
He was my last professional fight.
He was a guy built over before I was there.

1677
01:30:55.530 --> 01:30:58.680
It's crazy.
Yeah,
it's really weird.
It's really strange.
Yeah,
he was.

1678
01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:02.920
You were on what show was he was on fire.
He was on human robot.
Yeah.

1679
01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:07.650
So funny story.
When I first got the call about five west,
they,

1680
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:12.390
so to go back a little bit further,
I fought Jason in my last pro fight and,

1681
01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:16.980
and uh,
I remember Jimmy Walsh,
she was the promoter.
Well you just train me.
Yeah.

1682
01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.950
Used to be my personal trainer.
Yeah.
He's taught me about kettle bells.

1683
01:31:19.951 --> 01:31:24.630
That man crazy English crazy.
He's one of John jocks.
Black belts timey.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1684
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:28.590
Great grappling.
Grappling some twice.
Um,
anyway,

1685
01:31:28.591 --> 01:31:31.530
so I was going to fight Jason at his promotion called Pangea,

1686
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:35.340
and he told me all about the show he was going on.
He goes,
man,

1687
01:31:35.341 --> 01:31:37.440
if you beat this guy,
man,
he's going to be bad.
It'd be great for you.

1688
01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.630
And I was like,
and he could describe the,
showed me,

1689
01:31:39.631 --> 01:31:42.180
you travel around and you do different martial arts.
I was like,
man,

1690
01:31:42.181 --> 01:31:46.710
that's what's up.
That's a great idea.
And then I'd be Jason with the reverse.

1691
01:31:46.711 --> 01:31:50.310
He'll hook and you know,
how dangerous those are.
And Jason Really held out and,

1692
01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:53.760
and it,
it tore up pretty good.
And Anyway,

1693
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:57.750
a couple of days later I get a call,
uh,
from,

1694
01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.770
I forget who and they said,
and they said,
yeah,
this,

1695
01:31:59.830 --> 01:32:04.480
they're doing the show and the,
the,
you know,
give this producer in New York.

1696
01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:05.141
It was okay.

1697
01:32:05.141 --> 01:32:08.260
I called the producer and she described the show when she described the exact

1698
01:32:08.261 --> 01:32:12.550
same show.
And I went,
oh fuck,
I heard him.

1699
01:32:12.551 --> 01:32:16.690
And they're looking for a replacement.
And I felt,
I felt,

1700
01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:20.350
cause there's an unwritten rule in MMA that you can beat somebody up and do

1701
01:32:20.351 --> 01:32:22.990
whatever.
You don't take food out of somebody else's mouth.

1702
01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:25.690
You don't want to hurt somebody and they can't fight for a year.
It sucks.

1703
01:32:25.691 --> 01:32:28.300
You don't,
you know what I mean?
Like real fight.
But when it's over,
it's over.

1704
01:32:28.301 --> 01:32:32.170
You don't want to like injure somebody to where they can't make a living.

1705
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:33.640
That was also back all day.

1706
01:32:33.670 --> 01:32:37.360
We deal hooks were like sort of shunned in Jujitsu a little bit.

1707
01:32:38.210 --> 01:32:42.970
MMA fight.
I know,
but I mean there was a statement there,
her Cylus yeah.
Um,

1708
01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:44.200
but that's what I use and,
and,

1709
01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:47.890
and I thought I injured him and they were looking for a placement.
I just like,

1710
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:52.420
oh my God,
I took the guys deep impact Armageddon thing.
Yeah,
exactly.

1711
01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:56.050
100%.
And so then I found out that I realized they were on different shows.

1712
01:32:56.051 --> 01:32:59.290
And it was so funny because people have said since then that I was chosen

1713
01:32:59.291 --> 01:33:01.660
because it'd be Jason and they know that's their assumption,
which makes sense,

1714
01:33:01.661 --> 01:33:05.020
but they had no idea the producers of the show.

1715
01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:06.430
Once I got the GIG and we're talking to said,
yeah,

1716
01:33:06.431 --> 01:33:08.380
there's no show on history channel.
I went,
yeah,

1717
01:33:08.381 --> 01:33:11.320
I fought that guy and they looked at me and they went,
what the hell?
Yeah,

1718
01:33:11.321 --> 01:33:14.530
I find him like a month ago.
They literally,
I'm serious,

1719
01:33:14.531 --> 01:33:17.410
had no fucking clue and they had no idea.
It's just so weird.

1720
01:33:17.411 --> 01:33:21.100
They both came out exactly the same time.
They were a few months before me.

1721
01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:24.270
Been one of those shows since there hasn't been one before.
It's like,

1722
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:27.670
it's like what kind of weird shenanigans were going on,
but I was the route.

1723
01:33:27.671 --> 01:33:30.100
I didn't produce the thing so I don't know where it came from.
I have no idea.

1724
01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:34.240
I'm not blaming you.
It wasn't me.
It wasn't,
I didn't go,
Hey,
I can take this idea,

1725
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:38.200
but it's just weird to me that those shows become interesting and popular.

1726
01:33:38.201 --> 01:33:41.320
And then they stopped being,
it's like someone tries it out and they go,

1727
01:33:41.321 --> 01:33:41.710
this is it.

1728
01:33:41.710 --> 01:33:44.350
And the two companies are willing to invest it in two different channels are

1729
01:33:44.351 --> 01:33:46.100
showing it.
I remember this,
this is,

1730
01:33:46.101 --> 01:33:50.590
this is a way back when in one summary was the abyss deep space.

1731
01:33:50.710 --> 01:33:53.880
Nine and Leviathan were all these like underwater horror movies that came out

1732
01:33:53.890 --> 01:33:57.760
the same summer and then you haven't seen it.
It's just the,
I don't know why,

1733
01:33:57.810 --> 01:34:01.030
it's like we're seeing with the asteroid movies deep,
uh,
deep impact.

1734
01:34:01.031 --> 01:34:04.120
And I'm a good Armageddon.
Both of them came out exactly the same time.

1735
01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:06.320
So that was weird.
It was really strange.
Yes.

1736
01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:09.820
Fucking Hollywood's bizarre like that.
It is.
Find out like,
what did,

1737
01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:12.580
I almost don't want to know.
I don't know.

1738
01:34:12.610 --> 01:34:15.490
Want to know what kind of weird shenanigans were all three.

1739
01:34:15.491 --> 01:34:19.270
You fuck heads are coming up with underwater Paul.
What's going on?
Yeah,

1740
01:34:19.271 --> 01:34:20.350
I have no idea.

1741
01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.320
It's like they find out that someone's doing it so they get ahead on on.

1742
01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.440
They tried to release it first and there were two battle of the sexes movies,

1743
01:34:26.770 --> 01:34:30.460
Spa Will Ferrell was supposed to play Bobby Riggs and a battle of the sexes

1744
01:34:30.850 --> 01:34:33.790
tennis movie.
Then they found out I was doing the other ones.
Yeah,

1745
01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:37.930
and then they found out Steve Carell was doing one and they they it,
hello.

1746
01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:42.340
That match happened in like 19 in the 70s that was the middle Jean King,

1747
01:34:42.341 --> 01:34:45.100
Billie Jean King.
Wow.
Went to my high school,

1748
01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:48.970
strangely enough like,
yeah.
Anyway,
but,

1749
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.770
but 40 years later they make a movie at and two studios want to do at the same

1750
01:34:53.771 --> 01:34:58.220
time wear and both with Comedians,
which is really weird.
Oh,
Bobby Riggs.

1751
01:34:58.221 --> 01:35:02.420
Was that that guy like Steve Carell's so God damn good.

1752
01:35:02.421 --> 01:35:03.860
He just knocked these out of the park.

1753
01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:08.210
He was great playing that fucking creepy dupont guy to do Johnny dupont.
Yeah.

1754
01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:12.760
I remember when Dave Schultz got killed.
What a huge deal that was too,

1755
01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:16.040
but it was just what,
he was so creepy playing him in the movie.

1756
01:35:16.041 --> 01:35:18.010
It's like you bought it,
you bought that,

1757
01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:22.370
he's nailed the guy wrestling with these guys to them and shit and then just

1758
01:35:22.371 --> 01:35:27.020
like letting them do it.
Weird,
weird,
weird,
weird.

1759
01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.960
Have you seen the documentary about it but shows all of the real footage and

1760
01:35:29.961 --> 01:35:32.450
everything?
I've seen,
I've seen some of the real footage,

1761
01:35:32.451 --> 01:35:34.040
but I don't think I saw the documentary.

1762
01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:37.580
There's one 30 30 to one and then there's one on Netflix and I've seen both of

1763
01:35:37.581 --> 01:35:40.140
them.
One is like more focused on Mark Schultz,
the other ones,

1764
01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:44.210
the other story and man it's,
once again,
it's fucking creepy really out there.

1765
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:45.103
Yeah.

1766
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:48.650
Wrestlers just had no outlet to make money back then and this billionaire says,

1767
01:35:48.651 --> 01:35:51.340
I'll put you up and make this amazing team and they jumped on it.

1768
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:55.490
Isn't it kind of stunning that wrestling never had a real actual professional?

1769
01:35:55.491 --> 01:35:57.680
Not that there's anything wrong with pro wrestling,

1770
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:59.600
but pro wrestling obviously is a show.

1771
01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:03.530
There's never been like you think about like how many people love wrestling,

1772
01:36:03.531 --> 01:36:04.760
how many wrestling fans there are,

1773
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:07.640
how many people wrestle in high school and college like and how many people

1774
01:36:07.641 --> 01:36:10.100
would like to watch it in the Olympics.
It was always a big deal.

1775
01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:13.310
Like why didn't they ever figure out a way to make some sort of professional

1776
01:36:13.311 --> 01:36:15.920
venue out of it?
Remember they did have a real pro wrestling.

1777
01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:21.370
They tried that and and you,
you know,
it's funny,
I,

1778
01:36:21.670 --> 01:36:25.190
I used to teach IB teacher and what I did before I was five,
which teach,
uh,

1779
01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.680
the longest I ever taught was good.

1780
01:36:26.681 --> 01:36:29.360
I worked for Long Beach Unified School district.
I did a bunch of stuff for them.

1781
01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.700
So sometimes I would tell you sometimes I do this testing stuff.

1782
01:36:32.170 --> 01:36:35.510
The longest ever taught was seventh grade math.

1783
01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.950
If there is a hell that is where it is.
A seventh grade math Algebra.
I only,

1784
01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:45.410
I only taught that Wa my mom's a teacher and the girl,

1785
01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:50.530
the lady two rooms down from her got sick or had some kind of breakdown and mom

1786
01:36:50.991 --> 01:36:54.020
went,
can you please come in and teach for a year?
And I went,
okay,
cool.

1787
01:36:54.021 --> 01:36:55.510
Cause it made it easier on her.
I said,
all right fine.

1788
01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:00.350
So I ended up teaching degree and degree and certification yet and I had both of

1789
01:37:00.351 --> 01:37:01.420
those.
Um,

1790
01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:05.160
so you'd already planned on teaching or how did it as a possible side game?

1791
01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:06.530
Possible Psyche.
It was,

1792
01:37:06.531 --> 01:37:09.590
it was always what I was doing kind of while I was fighting.
Um,

1793
01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:14.390
but anyway,
uh,
I had a teacher tell me one time,
he said,

1794
01:37:15.650 --> 01:37:19.640
if there's a sign at the zoo that says please don't throw tangerines at the

1795
01:37:19.641 --> 01:37:21.440
elephants,
it may not make any sense to you.

1796
01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:24.450
All it means is one time somebody threw a tangerine and elephants,

1797
01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:29.390
something really bad happened.
And I thought about that a lot.
When,

1798
01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:32.270
when,
whenever you think about,
you know,

1799
01:37:32.490 --> 01:37:35.900
why is porous and caressing w there was a time when it was real and it was too

1800
01:37:35.901 --> 01:37:36.351
boring.

1801
01:37:36.351 --> 01:37:39.650
So they started scripting the endings to it and so it became pro wrestling,

1802
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:40.970
you know,
it was,

1803
01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:44.690
there were catch wrestling matches and they lasted three hours and it was,

1804
01:37:44.691 --> 01:37:48.080
you know,
I was like,
the old Gracie fights to ages lasted too long,
you know,

1805
01:37:48.081 --> 01:37:51.230
guys couldn't catch each other.
And so they started scripting and he's real.

1806
01:37:51.231 --> 01:37:54.200
Pro Wrestling was an effort to make it work and if it had made money,

1807
01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:57.150
it's still me around,
you know,
so it sucks.

1808
01:37:57.151 --> 01:38:01.050
And I wish rustlers even had more of an outlet that MMA and wrestling itself has

1809
01:38:01.051 --> 01:38:02.640
gotten bigger in terms of,

1810
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.600
I went to my old high school to watch a dual meet and back when I was there we

1811
01:38:06.601 --> 01:38:10.080
had like one varsity team,
like half a JV team.
They had varsity JV,

1812
01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:14.100
fresh off in a woman's team.
Wow.
A woman's team at full woman's team,

1813
01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:16.171
you know,
whatever.

1814
01:38:16.171 --> 01:38:19.860
I'm 14 weight classes right now and we couldn't get anywhere near that when I

1815
01:38:19.861 --> 01:38:21.840
was in school.
Like it just wasn't that popular.

1816
01:38:21.841 --> 01:38:26.490
Now MMA has made it huge like wrestling now.
I mean people really follow him.

1817
01:38:26.491 --> 01:38:29.340
You gotta be a real geek to follow college wrestling,
you know?

1818
01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:34.320
Well when you see the guy I met off smash Edson Barboza using essentially just

1819
01:38:34.321 --> 01:38:37.830
wrestling and vicious ground and pound.
You realize like,
okay,

1820
01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:40.470
like that is so fucking important to have.

1821
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:45.140
It is the cornerstone or it's rather the foundation of MMA.
Yeah.
If a guy like,

1822
01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:48.720
and I think that fight really highlighted it crushed,
it really,

1823
01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:52.410
really showed like they dominant super dominant wrestler over the dominant

1824
01:38:52.411 --> 01:38:55.410
striker.
If the dominant wrestler can get ahold of the dominant striker,

1825
01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:58.620
the last that's trackers clothes.

1826
01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:02.370
Like that's one of the things that was most impressive about Mirko was it when

1827
01:39:02.371 --> 01:39:04.530
Mirko started fighting for pride,

1828
01:39:04.710 --> 01:39:09.120
his take down defense got really good really quick.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1829
01:39:09.121 --> 01:39:13.320
He fought some fucking tough guys but figured out a way to keep the fight

1830
01:39:13.321 --> 01:39:15.810
standing a lot when I liked to him so much.

1831
01:39:15.811 --> 01:39:17.910
When you watch him is not only was the South Pole,

1832
01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:21.450
he was so good with the range of his foot work that he never,

1833
01:39:21.451 --> 01:39:23.310
he never lost his distance while throwing.

1834
01:39:23.311 --> 01:39:26.010
He was always really good at picking you apart from long range.

1835
01:39:26.011 --> 01:39:28.800
So you are shooting from outside,
you were shooting from way far back.

1836
01:39:28.801 --> 01:39:29.730
He could see it coming.

1837
01:39:29.731 --> 01:39:33.960
His footwork set up his take down defense so well and it was amazing.
Yeah,

1838
01:39:33.961 --> 01:39:35.850
he also was very powerful.

1839
01:39:35.851 --> 01:39:40.680
So his explosion was a big part of his fight style when he was a kickboxer.

1840
01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:45.920
So unlike maybe Peter Arts or a Nesto Houston who had more methodical,

1841
01:39:46.681 --> 01:39:48.770
technical style of striking cro,

1842
01:39:48.771 --> 01:39:53.190
cop would throw those one big shots all the time and that really works well in

1843
01:39:53.191 --> 01:39:55.860
MMA and he was able to use that explosion,

1844
01:39:55.861 --> 01:39:59.640
that fucking left high kick and the one of the body that he hit hit heath

1845
01:39:59.641 --> 01:40:02.070
herring with you.
Remember that shot collapsed him.

1846
01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:07.160
Well you see he hearings body just wrapped around cro cop's leg like whoa.

1847
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:11.700
Just realize the amount of power in that fucking kick and herrings taking it

1848
01:40:11.701 --> 01:40:14.800
right on the rib cage.
The worst.
Now the,

1849
01:40:15.230 --> 01:40:18.090
the thing to me is when you watch what I tell people,
I said,

1850
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.870
when you watch chuck Liddell's three fights against Randy,

1851
01:40:22.290 --> 01:40:26.040
the third one he gets Randy.
Randy is just shook by that power.

1852
01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:30.100
Just felt it before.
And that kind of,
you know,
bull in a China shop,

1853
01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.340
Greco sal to get inside.
It's not there.

1854
01:40:32.341 --> 01:40:34.950
He's just thinking about that power shot the whole time.

1855
01:40:35.370 --> 01:40:37.560
And that's what a power Stryker does against a wrestler.

1856
01:40:37.561 --> 01:40:40.150
He gives you that kind of barrier of to take me down.

1857
01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:43.080
You've got to get through here and here is fucking dangerous.

1858
01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:47.240
And I think cubby would,
he knew his long range is dangerous against [inaudible].

1859
01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:49.920
So if I keep moving forward,
like you putting pressure on him,

1860
01:40:50.150 --> 01:40:53.100
take away that spinning range,
he's not going to knock me out with his hands.

1861
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.980
And that's why he

1862
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.970
<v 0>was pushing forward so incredibly hard as he didn't worry about that second
wall.</v>

1863
01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:00.370
It really didn't concern him.
Yeah.

1864
01:41:00.371 --> 01:41:05.140
And Chuck would make you fight him because chuck was a very good wrestler

1865
01:41:05.141 --> 01:41:09.130
himself.
The thing that made chuck so unique is that chuck was a striker.

1866
01:41:09.210 --> 01:41:13.090
You know,
Hackleman train,
Kempo karate,
all that stuff in a lot of,

1867
01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.170
in a traditional sense,

1868
01:41:14.171 --> 01:41:17.770
but also have very good boxing skills and serious fucking power in his hands and

1869
01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:21.880
kicks.
But he also knew how to wrestle.
So good luck taking him down.

1870
01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:27.180
So now you're forced to stand up with this long powerful striker who has an iron

1871
01:41:27.281 --> 01:41:32.281
chin and just had this psychotic desire to move forward and land bombs.

1872
01:41:33.010 --> 01:41:36.340
He also had slow,
yeah,
I remember correctly.
Yeah.
He was a,

1873
01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:39.250
and that's where Hackman's place is still up there in San Luis Obispo.

1874
01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:43.690
He was something interesting because he was one of the very first wrestlers that

1875
01:41:43.691 --> 01:41:47.380
was a feared Stryker.
Yeah.
So he had the wrestling skills.
Great.

1876
01:41:47.381 --> 01:41:50.110
Take down defense.
Very good at getting back up off the ground when you hit him,

1877
01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:54.180
when he,
when he got down to the ground,
but also destroyer on his feet.
Yeah.

1878
01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:56.530
So that's the kind of guy that when you're going to need to test,

1879
01:41:56.531 --> 01:42:00.850
could beep to need a guy who can keep the fight standing,
who can test,

1880
01:42:00.851 --> 01:42:03.010
could be on the feet.
Some guy who's gonna be able to stuff.

1881
01:42:03.011 --> 01:42:07.420
Some of those take downs.
Those guys don't come around often.
Well now with him,

1882
01:42:07.630 --> 01:42:12.220
when you see what he did to Rda,
he ragdolled dos Anjos,
which is crazy.
I mean,

1883
01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:16.090
I do not know.
There's a timeline of dos Anjos dominance,
right?

1884
01:42:16.091 --> 01:42:18.340
And a strong seven.
Yeah,
yeah.

1885
01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:22.570
Sounds a strong 70 but this was a different time and still sound,
just training.

1886
01:42:22.571 --> 01:42:26.350
And I think dos Anjos made some giant leaps when he started doing strength and

1887
01:42:26.351 --> 01:42:29.630
conditioning with nick curse on,
he started doing it.

1888
01:42:29.670 --> 01:42:32.800
Just had way more output inside the cage.
And,

1889
01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:37.720
but the crazy thing was that dos Anjos is one of the best grapplers in the

1890
01:42:37.721 --> 01:42:41.680
division.
And you see what he was able to do with Neil magni leg kicks.

1891
01:42:41.681 --> 01:42:44.530
Neil magnet gets into the ground.
Smushes them,
you know,
I mean his,

1892
01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:47.110
his fucking ground game is really legit.

1893
01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:50.920
So to see him get ragdolled by Khabib,
you'd like,

1894
01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:57.070
how's he doing that to RDA?
You know,
it's nuts.
I had 55 yeah.

1895
01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:59.170
Yeah.
He's something special.

1896
01:42:59.171 --> 01:43:04.171
So it's like who is left at 55 especially now that dos Anjos has moved on

1897
01:43:05.081 --> 01:43:08.350
successfully to one 70 who the fuck has left that's going to be able to keep the

1898
01:43:08.351 --> 01:43:11.440
fight standing?
You know,
that's the tough part.

1899
01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:14.110
I don't think there are many answers.
I really don't know either.
Man.

1900
01:43:14.230 --> 01:43:16.840
I think you've got to put to put together the first who fight pretty quickly.

1901
01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:20.230
Not Coming.
I mean that's interviews my Tux.
It's a big fight.
That's,

1902
01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:23.500
that's the fight.
That's the fight.
The question is,
is going to be for the title,

1903
01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:27.880
is it going to be Ferguson and Connor get stripped and Ferguson and could be

1904
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:32.410
fight for the undisputed title because they'll just make Ferguson the undisputed

1905
01:43:32.411 --> 01:43:36.780
champion.
If Connor gets stripped,
which I don't think is a bad thing,
no click.

1906
01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:40.000
Connor is still fucking Conner of Conner comes back a year from now.
Huge.

1907
01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:41.770
He still college.
It doesn't matter.

1908
01:43:41.771 --> 01:43:44.080
He's still fighting probably for the title right away.

1909
01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:45.250
Everybody's going to want it.

1910
01:43:45.490 --> 01:43:49.060
Everybody's going to want the paper view money that comes with it.
Hop on board,

1911
01:43:49.690 --> 01:43:52.520
but Tony Versus Khabib is very

1912
01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:57.230
<v 1>interesting.
Yeah.
Very interesting.
You've done,
he was the guy.</v>

1913
01:43:57.231 --> 01:44:00.560
You have to get his respect now.
I don't have to give them a reason to backup.

1914
01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:04.340
Tony knows how to fight off his back.
Very good.
Yeah.
Very dangerous off his back.

1915
01:44:04.341 --> 01:44:06.620
Not just getting dangerous off his back and turns into submissions,

1916
01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:10.130
but very good defensively off his back.
You know,
he,
he's,

1917
01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:14.270
he's got really good composure.
Very good wrestlers.
Chokes are fucking nasty man.

1918
01:44:14.271 --> 01:44:18.320
He catches chokes from weird angles,
you know,
as good at sweeping you.
He's,

1919
01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:21.650
he's legit.
He's legit champion.
That's the fight.
Yup.

1920
01:44:21.710 --> 01:44:25.880
I mean that's the funny thing else is advancing me calling for it could be,
yeah.

1921
01:44:25.881 --> 01:44:28.730
It's just what do you do though?
Like what,
what do you do and how do you do it?

1922
01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:31.520
You do,
you strip Connor.
That's always the question.

1923
01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:33.920
Cause if Conner is like fuck it,
I want to fight.

1924
01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:36.830
Tony didn't do upland decides to,

1925
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:41.390
if he decides to come back and fight Tony and then the winter fights could be

1926
01:44:41.391 --> 01:44:43.940
even Russia,
the world explodes.
That'd be huge.

1927
01:44:43.941 --> 01:44:45.260
That'd be the biggest thing is fantastic.

1928
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:48.770
The winter fights Khabib in Russia for the undisputed title.

1929
01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:50.090
You have a copy in Russia?
No,

1930
01:44:50.091 --> 01:44:52.910
but could we just got to ride a bear out to the cage?
It's gangster man.

1931
01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:56.600
Put a cage or it's literally gay.
It's really,
it's,
it's a mobbed up place.

1932
01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:58.970
Does it?
I,
it's fun there.
Yeah,
it was,
how many times did you,
uh,

1933
01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:03.510
think for W for bell?
Two arm.
No,
when I was at them.
One they run out of,

1934
01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:08.430
that's right.
That's right.
Saint Petersburg.
And then I did,
did you enjoy?

1935
01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:12.410
Oh,
the man had a great time.
How's the food over there?
Food's good.

1936
01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:15.920
I don't like the way you said good.
Not The food's good defense,
but it's not,

1937
01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:18.810
it's not like you're not known for.
All right.
So I got to tell the story.
We're,

1938
01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:19.400
we're on,

1939
01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:23.060
we're on the ship in the Nivo river and it's owned by one of the guys who runs

1940
01:45:23.061 --> 01:45:26.780
and one and,
um,
yeah,

1941
01:45:26.781 --> 01:45:29.840
so we're on the ship and then even river and it's got a restaurant on it and

1942
01:45:29.841 --> 01:45:32.910
we're sitting there and Sean,
we like Mobe Roscoe broadcast partners,

1943
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:35.600
very persnickety about his food.
He's super thinking about a lot of stuff.

1944
01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:41.170
And we're sitting there with our boss and everything and the guy who runs this

1945
01:45:41.171 --> 01:45:44.210
ship of this big heavy and Saint Petersburg as affiliate with them,

1946
01:45:44.211 --> 01:45:49.040
one serves us this Borscht,
which is like,
you know,
uh,
beat students to basically,

1947
01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:53.420
and he goes,
man,
we're really proud of our boards.
It's a big deal here.
And Oh,

1948
01:45:53.421 --> 01:45:56.420
we hope you enjoy it.
It's,
it's a point of honor for us.

1949
01:45:56.510 --> 01:46:01.280
And he walks away and we lock looks at the boat and goes,
I'm not eating this,

1950
01:46:01.281 --> 01:46:05.030
I don't like it.
And our boss goes,
you will fucking eat it right now.

1951
01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:09.110
Like a seven year old,
like you will eat it.
And he's like,
no,
I'm not.

1952
01:46:09.111 --> 01:46:12.380
He like folded his arms like I'm not eating.
No Way.
No.
I ate so fast.

1953
01:46:12.381 --> 01:46:16.790
White people,
white people.
I eat so fast that I already ate it.

1954
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.890
I like bore.
So I just,
you just ate it.

1955
01:46:18.891 --> 01:46:22.160
And I set my thing and I'm a guy who was all proud of his borsch.

1956
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:26.900
Turns around is heading back to us and my boss looks at me and goes points to

1957
01:46:26.901 --> 01:46:31.760
Sean's boot and I grabbed it and I drank an entire bowl of that shit and threw

1958
01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:35.030
it down before the guy came back and he saw me.
Oh,
thank you so much.

1959
01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:40.510
Sean was just refusing to,
to touch it.
Persnickety is a nice word.
Oppression.

1960
01:46:40.511 --> 01:46:43.200
Even getting,
I like how you use that.
That's a great selective amount,

1961
01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:46.730
but it's a nice way like nobody can get mad.
Yeah.
It wasn't like he was like,

1962
01:46:46.731 --> 01:46:50.550
yeah,
he calls timeline then persnickety Vicky.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

1963
01:46:50.551 --> 01:46:54.430
They're a complaining bitch.
No,
see that.

1964
01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:58.860
I didn't think you would,
would not.
No,
you're getting,
I understand.
No,
I bet.

1965
01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:01.260
Even like Ali didn't.
I was like,
I'm fucking,
give it to me.

1966
01:47:01.530 --> 01:47:05.520
I know there's been some talk about doing it UFC in Russia and I think a lot of

1967
01:47:05.521 --> 01:47:10.521
it is probably based on the idea that could be at 25 and o is most likely

1968
01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:12.780
somewhere along the line I'm going to fight for the title.

1969
01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:14.820
I mean if everything continues to go well,

1970
01:47:14.821 --> 01:47:16.530
as long as there's no injuries or something.
Yeah,

1971
01:47:17.370 --> 01:47:20.460
especially now that he can make the weight like you made the way pretty easy.

1972
01:47:20.490 --> 01:47:23.090
Yeah.
It didn't look bad.
Not at all.
That would be huge.
Fight.

1973
01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:27.240
Fucking have enough rush and talent that you know.
Oh yeah.

1974
01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:31.730
Oh it was just from Dagestan alone.
You can fill the whole roster.
Yeah.

1975
01:47:31.890 --> 01:47:36.110
Dagestan versus the world.
He really could.
You almost cut what?

1976
01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:40.050
A fighter in belt or Shabbat Somalia and up getting shot like five times in

1977
01:47:40.051 --> 01:47:42.390
Dagestan.
He lived,
he lived,

1978
01:47:42.450 --> 01:47:45.480
but he went after some gangster with a gun or something in a club.

1979
01:47:45.481 --> 01:47:49.730
And it's crazy,
man.
It's a tough world.

1980
01:47:49.731 --> 01:47:51.440
Were so soft over here.
Sean,
we locked,

1981
01:47:51.441 --> 01:47:55.170
need to go camping over there for a little while.
Dude.
Like a,
you know,
the,

1982
01:47:55.171 --> 01:47:59.460
the wrestlers in Chechnya are amazing psyche of brothers,
the greatest ever.

1983
01:47:59.461 --> 01:48:00.630
Well fuck man.

1984
01:48:00.631 --> 01:48:04.470
If you grew up in Chechnya and it's like either be a standout wrestler or dead,

1985
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:08.130
I don't know,
pick up a gun and you know,
be a gangster.
They,
you know,

1986
01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:09.870
Dude's amazing.
Yeah.

1987
01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:14.900
It's interesting to see a guy from that really hard part of the world coming

1988
01:48:14.971 --> 01:48:18.750
over and just dominating in MMA.
You know,
with Khabib,
you,

1989
01:48:18.751 --> 01:48:22.710
you know that a lot of it is technique.
A lot of is being trained by his father.

1990
01:48:22.711 --> 01:48:25.500
A lot of it is iron sharpens iron and he's at Aka,

1991
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:28.650
he's wrestling with big giant guys that are really skillful all the time.

1992
01:48:28.651 --> 01:48:30.540
It's an amazing roster over there,

1993
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:34.680
but a lot of it is his fucking mental toughness that he must've picked up some

1994
01:48:34.681 --> 01:48:38.500
of that from being in Dagestan.
Yeah,
it just has to,
it's true.
I mean,

1995
01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:41.130
the Russian fighters that I have,
I dealt with,
I'm like,

1996
01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:44.910
you could know them and call a ton of fights with them and they'll still kind of

1997
01:48:44.911 --> 01:48:48.440
look at you like they want to fight you or something.
Like,
you know,
I know that,

1998
01:48:48.450 --> 01:48:50.580
hey,
how's it going?
And then they kind of like break character like,
hey,

1999
01:48:50.581 --> 01:48:51.414
how you doing it?

2000
01:48:51.850 --> 01:48:54.360
But there's always this wall you've got to get through almost every time.

2001
01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:58.050
You know,
one of the great fighters on that,
uh,
Korskoff guy,

2002
01:48:58.170 --> 01:49:00.660
that guy's a fucking ball monster.
That guy's a beast.

2003
01:49:00.661 --> 01:49:04.320
That was one of the most impressive Lima fights to let me put that guy to sleep.

2004
01:49:04.321 --> 01:49:07.710
I was like,
Whoa,
yeah,
that left hook.
But it was a lake kicks.
It set it up.

2005
01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:09.810
He was kicking the shit out of that leg.
And He,

2006
01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:12.720
I think of course golf when like I got to trade now I've got to get this guy out

2007
01:49:12.721 --> 01:49:14.970
of here and you know,
it's not going to work.
And of course,

2008
01:49:14.971 --> 01:49:18.340
cough in my opinion in a lot of ways was one of the first guys to validate bell

2009
01:49:18.341 --> 01:49:21.570
tours.
Hundred 70 pound division from the performance he put against Henderson.

2010
01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:25.260
Like he shut Henderson down a t to harm teed off on them and let them know like

2011
01:49:25.261 --> 01:49:27.110
this is,
I am a real welterweight.

2012
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:30.480
That when Numa made him look like maybe he's not,

2013
01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:34.230
maybe Lima's that's a real welterweight.
He's a lot bigger.
He looked bigger,

2014
01:49:34.710 --> 01:49:38.130
way bigger and then you know,
it's one of the things were that was a,
that was,

2015
01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:42.200
there was a big disparity between what people within the organization when

2016
01:49:42.210 --> 01:49:45.210
people out of the organization thought cause logical thought Henderson was going

2017
01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:46.920
to come in and clean house and have two belts.

2018
01:49:47.410 --> 01:49:51.130
But there's one jinx I that I have seen more than any other.

2019
01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:53.500
If you're listening fighters,
this is to,

2020
01:49:53.501 --> 01:49:57.870
you don't talk about two belts before you have one belt.
Ooh,

2021
01:49:57.890 --> 01:50:01.930
that is the chimps.
Have you never do it.
Am I wrong?
Brenda Vera with chain Vera.

2022
01:50:01.931 --> 01:50:06.070
I'm going to be two belt champion.
He didn't win one belt.
It's an innocent.

2023
01:50:06.071 --> 01:50:09.130
Talked about winning to bells and,
and when one belt,
you know,

2024
01:50:09.190 --> 01:50:12.850
talking about two belts before you've won one belt is a huge chunks.

2025
01:50:12.851 --> 01:50:14.490
Don't ever do that.
Well Ben never seen it be good.

2026
01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:18.730
I've seen a couple other times.
Never just never worked on when he left the UFC,

2027
01:50:18.731 --> 01:50:19.800
he was,
you know,

2028
01:50:19.810 --> 01:50:24.810
one of the best guys in the division and he got one of them three in this one 70

2029
01:50:25.331 --> 01:50:28.890
pound weight class was just not right for him.
With a big guy like Korskoff.
Yeah.

2030
01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:31.510
You know,
and it would have been more prominent if it was against Lima.

2031
01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:35.280
Did you see like they're weighing,
yeah,
I went to different,
so you know,

2032
01:50:35.530 --> 01:50:40.030
it's once these where we think about if a guy has trouble making 55 well he's a

2033
01:50:40.031 --> 01:50:43.880
70 no,
no,
no,
he's not.
There's this needs,
there's a huge difference,

2034
01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:48.100
like a big 50 fiber and a natural 70 they are not in the same class.

2035
01:50:48.101 --> 01:50:50.220
In course cough.
It looked like a giant compared to,
well,

2036
01:50:50.230 --> 01:50:54.380
the difference is Lima's just not going to fucking make 55 it's just not half.

2037
01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:57.960
Not In his DNA.
If you can make the weight,
yeah.
Make the way I make the way.
Yeah.

2038
01:50:58.450 --> 01:51:00.430
Yeah.
It's a boy.

2039
01:51:00.431 --> 01:51:03.810
It's one of the most unfortunate parts of the sport and I like to back the cut

2040
01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:06.750
isn't tough then you shouldn't be there almost.
You know?

2041
01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:09.670
Like if you could make it easily,
you know,
it's tough man.

2042
01:51:09.671 --> 01:51:12.010
As long as it doesn't drain you because everybody's different too.
Right.

2043
01:51:12.011 --> 01:51:13.720
And their response to dehydration.

2044
01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:17.080
But Andy Foster what he's done in California by instituting a bunch of new

2045
01:51:17.081 --> 01:51:20.860
weight classes.
I really hope that people follow suit.
I really do.

2046
01:51:20.861 --> 01:51:22.510
I really hope there's one every 10 pounds.

2047
01:51:22.511 --> 01:51:24.820
I just think giving people more options,
it's going to,

2048
01:51:25.210 --> 01:51:28.330
there's some fighters that are just on the cusp where it's just dangerous,

2049
01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:28.961
you know?

2050
01:51:28.961 --> 01:51:32.680
And then maybe if they fought like dos Anjos goes up to 70 that's a but that's

2051
01:51:32.681 --> 01:51:36.280
at 55 to 70 15 pound jump.
That's a lot of weight,
man.

2052
01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:39.910
50% more than if it was just 10 and I think 10 is the move.

2053
01:51:39.911 --> 01:51:42.790
I feel like 10 every 10 you're not watering it down too much.

2054
01:51:42.791 --> 01:51:43.930
You making it reasonable.

2055
01:51:44.050 --> 01:51:49.050
Just Bang everything down to fives (556) 057-0580 five probably 95 two oh five

2056
01:51:51.281 --> 01:51:55.660
to 25 heavyweight.
So we were having a discussion with this.
Once again,

2057
01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.840
boxing.
I was talking to Steve for hood and I said when they initially,

2058
01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:01.030
initially weren't that many week class in boxing,

2059
01:52:01.031 --> 01:52:03.040
it ended up adding a bunch of them.
I said when they initially out of those,

2060
01:52:03.041 --> 01:52:06.460
were they seen as secondary weight classes?
And he went,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2061
01:52:06.461 --> 01:52:11.461
For it took years until one 55 got any respect.

2062
01:52:11.711 --> 01:52:14.590
It was considered people who couldn't hang at welterweight.
Put a big moment.

2063
01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:17.830
How about cruiserweight?
Yeah.
Cruiserweight never got response.

2064
01:52:18.490 --> 01:52:21.890
Never gets her splint.
Holy field fought Dwight Muhammad cow.
We,

2065
01:52:21.891 --> 01:52:24.420
there was a first time anybody give a fuck about cruiserweight.
Yep.

2066
01:52:24.930 --> 01:52:29.100
And who else was cruiserweight like who the fuck else was there?
White Mama Cow.

2067
01:52:29.101 --> 01:52:33.250
We cruiser.
[inaudible] John Pascale was,

2068
01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:37.030
um,
who else?
Michael Moore.
Did he stop at cruiserweight?

2069
01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:39.540
I think he went from light.
Hippolite damn,
you ain't,
I think you did too.
He did.

2070
01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:42.850
He didn't stop it comes to it.
Um,
just been one of those weird weight classes.

2071
01:52:42.851 --> 01:52:47.540
Like why not?
You're in prior fucking monstrous fighter,
but he fought at 40.

2072
01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:50.150
Right.
And just other than the Alexis Arguayo fight,

2073
01:52:50.151 --> 01:52:53.990
there weren't many stars at 40.
You've got to go to 47 to get paid.

2074
01:52:54.110 --> 01:52:57.800
There's a reason,
you know,
every talks about all Floyd can knock anybody out for,

2075
01:52:57.830 --> 01:53:00.680
it's like a fucking 35 or he's really a lightweight.
If you've ever met him,

2076
01:53:00.681 --> 01:53:04.610
he's not a big right.
He had to go to 47 to get the big money fights.

2077
01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:05.953
That's why,

2078
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:10.140
you know Roberto Duran went from 35 to 47 cause he just couldn't make money at

2079
01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:13.040
35.
Yeah.
You guys get tired of making the way class,
but they also,

2080
01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:15.050
they realize like you got to chase the cat,

2081
01:53:15.051 --> 01:53:18.290
go where the money in a certain amount of time.
My Palm is Crawford moving up.

2082
01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:23.150
Yeah.
That's the problem is that it's very hard in MMA or any combat sport.

2083
01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:27.380
40 sevens,
Connie,
your limit below 47 went and had some great fighters.

2084
01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:30.470
It's hard to build interest below 47 or 45 in MMA.

2085
01:53:30.850 --> 01:53:35.240
Boxing has had the same problem.
So,
uh,
what happens,
people keep coming up.

2086
01:53:35.241 --> 01:53:36.650
So if you added a bunch of weight classes,

2087
01:53:36.890 --> 01:53:41.630
guys who wanted it one 60 for a while would be seen as all the guys who couldn't

2088
01:53:41.631 --> 01:53:44.420
make it at fit five seven.
Right.
So it would take awhile,

2089
01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:48.260
maybe a star in that division before it would become a legit division.

2090
01:53:48.261 --> 01:53:48.711
That'd be the prom.

2091
01:53:48.711 --> 01:53:51.830
There'd be a lag of a few years when you go all the one 80 pound champions.

2092
01:53:51.831 --> 01:53:52.664
Just the guy who couldn't,

2093
01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:57.820
couldn't do it at 17 it's almost like there's too many fighters now and too many

2094
01:53:58.431 --> 01:54:01.790
events.
It's almost like you couldn't have enough UFC events.

2095
01:54:01.791 --> 01:54:04.430
You would literally have to have UFC fights every week.
Yeah.

2096
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:07.730
Like maybe that would be the future model where they have fights every week on

2097
01:54:07.731 --> 01:54:10.790
television and then they have paper views like rarely,

2098
01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:12.830
like every four weeks or something like that.

2099
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:16.100
You would take a lot to fill up or six weeks,
four or five extra divisions.

2100
01:54:16.101 --> 01:54:19.040
That'd be tough.
You know,
it's hard to fill up the you have,

2101
01:54:19.050 --> 01:54:22.430
depending on how you look at it.
Yeah,
it would be,
but I mean,
man,
I don't know.

2102
01:54:23.450 --> 01:54:26.180
I mean,
I never get tired of watching fights.
If they had fights on every week,

2103
01:54:26.181 --> 01:54:29.900
I wouldn't be complaining.
It's just a wonder whether or not it's sustainable.

2104
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:32.360
And I'm wondering what the hard part,
that's the hard part.

2105
01:54:32.361 --> 01:54:34.310
That's always been the hard part.
Um,

2106
01:54:34.311 --> 01:54:38.400
so I went to see something that is Novitsky is on tomorrow.
Right?
Um,

2107
01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:41.180
Jeff Dubitsky from uh,
you,
uh,

2108
01:54:41.210 --> 01:54:44.570
formerly of Usada now working for the UFC took me to the UFC performance

2109
01:54:44.571 --> 01:54:47.540
institute this week.
Holy fucking Shit,
man.

2110
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:50.590
<v 0>That place is insane.
I don't know how much money they spend on that,</v>

2111
01:54:50.591 --> 01:54:55.590
but it's just like,
this is like some science lab for,

2112
01:54:55.630 --> 01:54:56.980
for training fighters.
I mean,

2113
01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:00.430
everything you could imagine they have in this giant ass bill heard every

2114
01:55:00.431 --> 01:55:03.240
fighter on the roster can go there anytime they want.
They have,
they,

2115
01:55:03.250 --> 01:55:06.520
they feed them,
they take care of them in the cafe.
They make them healthy food.

2116
01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.320
They have all these different things that monitor your body composition,

2117
01:55:11.321 --> 01:55:15.010
your hydration levels,
all these different modalities for healing and recovery,

2118
01:55:15.190 --> 01:55:19.000
everything.
You fucking name it,
they have it.
It was super impressive.

2119
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:20.230
Super impressive.

2120
01:55:20.530 --> 01:55:24.380
They have all these video systems that are around the octagon constantly.

2121
01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:27.340
Their monitoring sparring from like a bunch of different angles.

2122
01:55:27.341 --> 01:55:30.070
They can get three d video of it.
They can rotate it.

2123
01:55:30.071 --> 01:55:32.920
Well they watch you spar from any angle.

2124
01:55:32.921 --> 01:55:35.470
Your coaches could point out little weird things that you might be doing that

2125
01:55:35.471 --> 01:55:37.300
you're not aware of but pointed out.

2126
01:55:37.301 --> 01:55:40.720
They always have the angle they get every single angle.
It's amazing.

2127
01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:44.550
<v 1>They have a thing there that like punch registers,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

2128
01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:47.850
Like the video game except a much more scientific.
Yeah,
there's little trivia.

2129
01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:52.851
You know I was told is the number one pound for pound punch her presence and

2130
01:55:52.921 --> 01:55:55.920
Ghana by by weight class?
No,
by weight class.
By weight class.

2131
01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:00.570
Like who's the number one for pound?
Just engaging.
That's what I was told.
Damp.

2132
01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:03.240
Yeah.
That's impressive.
Forrest Griffin told man,

2133
01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:07.470
I wonder how many people have punched it though.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
This is,

2134
01:56:07.471 --> 01:56:09.780
this is what I was told by by Forrest Griffin.
Well,

2135
01:56:09.781 --> 01:56:12.630
he certainly pushed as hard as fuck.
There's no doubt about it badly.

2136
01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:16.250
I mean in Gando,
just hard.

2137
01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:21.260
Anybody period blew it out of the water by some insane amount of thousands of

2138
01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:25.530
pounds a square inch.
They said he,
he's like drunk.
Whenever he hits,

2139
01:56:25.531 --> 01:56:28.860
he destroys bro.
He's,
they said he's like getting hit by an escort,

2140
01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:31.800
like a Ford escort.
That's what it's like.
Yeah.

2141
01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:35.010
I thought of a totally different escort for a second.
Yeah,
there it is.

2142
01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:36.150
They got a video of it,

2143
01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:40.890
of him hitting this thing that's a Dunkin French boom.

2144
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:47.470
So they have them do this thing and they had this,
this limit before our,

2145
01:56:47.490 --> 01:56:50.790
or this record before that.
I actually I think was set by Tyrone Spong.

2146
01:56:51.570 --> 01:56:55.110
No surprise there.
He's an interesting fucking character,

2147
01:56:55.111 --> 01:56:59.130
Frances and gone and you want to talk about a guy that is literally right out of

2148
01:56:59.131 --> 01:57:03.050
an author's pen.
Really,
if you're going to have a guy who,
you know,

2149
01:57:03.060 --> 01:57:05.790
like robbery Howard,
when he used to write the Coney on books,

2150
01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:09.870
like he used to work in a sand mine.

2151
01:57:10.050 --> 01:57:14.910
He used to dig sand when he was a young man.
Like you watch fucking hard work.

2152
01:57:14.911 --> 01:57:19.020
It is digging in the sand every day and carrying it away and just getting

2153
01:57:19.021 --> 01:57:20.850
stronger and stronger.

2154
01:57:20.850 --> 01:57:24.090
It's literally like Quinn Conan was trashing the weekend mill.
Yeah.

2155
01:57:24.570 --> 01:57:28.320
And then he was homeless five years ago.
Moves to Paris,

2156
01:57:28.410 --> 01:57:33.090
wants to try boxing.
Someone sees him in a gym and goes,
Hey,
you should be an MMA.

2157
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:35.490
And he's like,
okay.
So he goes into MMA,

2158
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:41.580
goes to the UFC in two years he's fighting for the title and he's a big favorite

2159
01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:44.430
over the champion who is,
if the champion wins,

2160
01:57:44.670 --> 01:57:47.700
breaks the longest running title fight streak,

2161
01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:50.940
a winning title fights in the heavyweight division,
which is only two.

2162
01:57:50.970 --> 01:57:54.960
It's a great story.
It's amazing story story.
Five years ago,
homeless.

2163
01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:58.740
That's nuts.
Yeah.
It's like,
you know Henry Armstrong,
I'm a great,

2164
01:57:58.741 --> 01:58:02.400
it was working on a railroad newspaper article about a guy winning a fight and

2165
01:58:02.401 --> 01:58:03.810
said fuck this railroad shit.

2166
01:58:04.290 --> 01:58:07.020
And went and started boxing one of the greatest of all time.
Yeah.

2167
01:58:07.021 --> 01:58:09.600
Or when Jack Johnson first became the heavyweight champion.

2168
01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:13.230
I mean everybody kind of knew,
you know,
he saw Jack Johnson like,
oh my God,

2169
01:58:13.231 --> 01:58:18.120
these guys are fucked.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's all downhill from here.
Yeah.

2170
01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:22.320
Yeah.
Him versus steep bays.
Very,
very interesting.
And I'm just,

2171
01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:26.220
I want to see if Steve Bay can figure out a way to avoid the big shots.

2172
01:58:26.221 --> 01:58:29.640
Close the distance,
get ahold of him and if he can take him to the ground.

2173
01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:32.630
Here's my advice for anybody calling that fight.
You went quid.

2174
01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:35.190
I would look at everything but power in terms of what,

2175
01:58:35.191 --> 01:58:37.170
who's got the better footwear?
Who's moving ahead a little bit more.

2176
01:58:37.171 --> 01:58:41.160
It was gonna more defense.
Cause man,
that's going to be,
I think tell the story.

2177
01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:43.960
One avoids getting hit and um,
cause they're both,

2178
01:58:43.961 --> 01:58:45.550
they can both knock you the fuck out.
Do.

2179
01:58:45.551 --> 01:58:47.950
They both can't to knock you the fuck out,
but

2180
01:58:49.810 --> 01:58:52.720
Francis doesn't in a weirder way.
He does it in,

2181
01:58:52.721 --> 01:58:56.110
they're like super human way where you're like,
we see the angle of his punches.

2182
01:58:56.111 --> 01:58:58.730
It's like he's trying to rip your soul out of your body,
man.

2183
01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:03.900
The left Hook uppercut combination punched that Shovel Hook was just one of the

2184
01:59:04.061 --> 01:59:06.070
most terrifying things I've ever seen anybody get hit with.

2185
01:59:06.071 --> 01:59:10.050
And all my years of calling sports look like a Pez dispenser had all the photos

2186
01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:11.380
so crazy.
It's almost like,

2187
01:59:11.530 --> 01:59:14.750
like a really bad action movie where the guy who's like the,

2188
01:59:14.751 --> 01:59:17.800
the guy was rising through the ranks and just blast to everybody in the orbit.

2189
01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:22.330
You,
you'll go to sleep,
even talks like those people.
It's crazy.
Yeah.

2190
01:59:22.810 --> 01:59:25.870
Every now and then you get a story like that.
It seems like it's like Adam,

2191
01:59:25.871 --> 01:59:29.650
like Justin wren now that then your story is just ridiculous.
No,
he's amazing.

2192
01:59:29.651 --> 01:59:31.270
You know,
the,
um,

2193
01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:35.500
the other thing that about a in Ghana was the way he trashed talks is hilarious.

2194
01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:40.600
Like a steep,
a said a,
he's not intimidated by any man.
And,
uh,

2195
01:59:40.630 --> 01:59:43.430
Francisco's don't lies deeper.
Don't lie.

2196
01:59:44.170 --> 01:59:49.170
Like he's so calm with it and it's so fucking terrifying.

2197
01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:51.580
He was doing a press conference with Allister.

2198
01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:54.960
It was like a Thursday before Saturday is fight.

2199
01:59:55.720 --> 02:00:00.640
They're facing off wearing their suits and a Francisco's Saturday night to go to

2200
02:00:00.641 --> 02:00:04.600
sleep Saturday night you're asleep.
And

2201
02:00:08.530 --> 02:00:13.000
that tries talking bothers me.
He's so confident about it too.
And he was right.

2202
02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:15.700
But like Roy is like that.
Like,
yeah,

2203
02:00:15.701 --> 02:00:19.810
we'll take the bell and I will take your health.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2204
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:21.760
And I'm holding the mic like,
Ooh,
Ooh,K

2205
02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:26.610
I want to hurt him so bad that he goes to the hospital,

2206
02:00:26.650 --> 02:00:29.560
never wants to fight me again.
And you go,

2207
02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:31.820
Oh gee,

2208
02:00:33.010 --> 02:00:37.840
that's shit either.
You know,
sometimes people talk shit and you know,

2209
02:00:37.841 --> 02:00:40.980
they're just trying to put up a bluff.
Yeah.
Like there's,
there's some,

2210
02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:45.460
even great fighters have said some shit that night.
I believed at the time,

2211
02:00:45.670 --> 02:00:48.490
like when Bj was saying to George,
Saint Pierre,
George,

2212
02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:51.970
we're going to fight to the death and I'm serious.
George,

2213
02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:55.720
I'm going to try to kill you.
Remember that?
Yeah,
I remember it well.
Yeah.
That,

2214
02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:56.740
but it didn't work out.

2215
02:00:56.741 --> 02:00:59.860
That did not work out that way at all to not work out that way.

2216
02:00:59.890 --> 02:01:02.140
He might've believed that when he was saying it.
But man,

2217
02:01:02.141 --> 02:01:04.030
when you're in that dark,
dark moment,

2218
02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:09.400
big ass French Canadian dropping knuckle,
different world man.
Yeah.

2219
02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:11.480
That was another one where you're like,
there's a big gear.

2220
02:01:11.481 --> 02:01:16.481
Have seen a big 55 are in a real 70 dude cause he put it on him that night.

2221
02:01:17.410 --> 02:01:22.410
Well he was so fucking strong and George was in his prime back then and he also

2222
02:01:23.231 --> 02:01:28.070
was a really good guy and he was very motivated by Bj's talking shit to him and

2223
02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:31.340
really pissed him off because he's a nice guy,
you know.

2224
02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:34.660
I mean the best way to fight a guy like George is like be respectful.

2225
02:01:34.661 --> 02:01:37.310
If he's going to kick your ass gonna kick your ass anyway.
Yeah,
it's not a thing.

2226
02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:39.560
You can give him extra ass whooping motivation.

2227
02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:42.770
I think he had a little extra ass woke and motivation for Bisping though.

2228
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:46.460
I really do.
Bisbing talks so much to him that when he got his back,
he's like,

2229
02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:51.500
you're going to put it on a man.
Put It on him,
put it on him,

2230
02:01:51.501 --> 02:01:54.560
standing up too much.
Just starting to wear down to just when I thought,
man,

2231
02:01:54.561 --> 02:01:56.930
maybe the tide storm,
because you don't Bisbing.
His whole thing is,

2232
02:01:56.931 --> 02:01:59.660
he's not a particularly hard puncher is wrestling.
You see great.
It's,

2233
02:01:59.661 --> 02:02:03.410
he wears you the fuck down.
Well that's big one 80 fiver.
No,

2234
02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:05.000
it's just he wears you the fuck down.

2235
02:02:05.150 --> 02:02:09.220
He's also particularly effective off of his back was,
I was impressed with that.

2236
02:02:09.230 --> 02:02:11.300
George up with those elbows off his back.

2237
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:13.910
That made it a real problem because George is having a hard time seeing him and

2238
02:02:13.911 --> 02:02:17.450
that blood was everywhere.
Yeah.
You know what a good fight.
It's,

2239
02:02:17.451 --> 02:02:21.170
I kinda liked the story of George just retires.
It doesn't bother me.
Yeah.

2240
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:25.280
I like it.
I like it.
He bucked it,
he bucked there.
Everybody had doubted them.

2241
02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:29.720
Came back one one by finishes like,
yeah,
take it easy.
Now I'm out.

2242
02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:33.120
Say it now.
Now I'm seriously no,
really this time.
A minute.
Yeah.

2243
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:38.950
Or it comes back in a year and one 55 and then what's but Whitaker,

2244
02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:43.220
Whitaker Rockhold for the title.
Yeah man,
that I liked that a lot.

2245
02:02:43.250 --> 02:02:47.180
I liked that five lot.
That's a dangerous ass fight for both guys.

2246
02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:49.430
Do you ever train with chuck today?
No Dude,

2247
02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:50.960
he was one of the first guys when I was a blue belt.

2248
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:54.350
He came by and he was getting ready for Pan Ams and this is back when he was

2249
02:02:54.351 --> 02:02:57.800
like,
when he beat hoser at worlds,
broke his arm and still one like,
yeah,

2250
02:02:57.801 --> 02:03:01.040
that was insane.
Yeah,
that wasn't the same.
Would not tab,

2251
02:03:01.041 --> 02:03:03.650
wouldn't tat and wrote it out.
They change the rules after that.

2252
02:03:03.651 --> 02:03:05.000
You know that really?
Yeah,

2253
02:03:05.090 --> 02:03:08.360
because Jack Harry literally stuck is for people who are listening and don't

2254
02:03:08.361 --> 02:03:08.661
know about it.

2255
02:03:08.661 --> 02:03:13.400
He holds her Gracie broke Jackie Ray's arm and the the absolute division in the

2256
02:03:13.401 --> 02:03:17.510
world's 2005 2006 2004 around there,

2257
02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:21.920
mid 2000 and it snapped it good.
But Jocko,
he gets out like so.

2258
02:03:21.921 --> 02:03:24.110
He breaks it but he steps over the head and gets out.

2259
02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:27.380
Jack Arrays stands up and hold your look to the referee and goes,

2260
02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:30.950
I broke his arm and Jocko aid takes his broken arm,

2261
02:03:31.190 --> 02:03:35.120
stuffs it in his belt and wins the match because he was already ahead.

2262
02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:36.560
He just kinda like,
yeah,
you know,

2263
02:03:36.561 --> 02:03:39.830
stalled out for like two minutes and one the fucking match against the greatest

2264
02:03:39.831 --> 02:03:41.450
of all time with a broken arm.

2265
02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:44.780
So I trained with him and at that point he was like in beast mode.

2266
02:03:44.781 --> 02:03:47.240
It was unbelievable.
It's like being in a washing machine.

2267
02:03:47.241 --> 02:03:50.300
He's the only way I can describe it because once he grabs you,
it's like you're,

2268
02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:51.830
you just flings you and like your head,

2269
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:56.180
you'll see your feet flying at the ceiling.
It's crazy now.
There it is,
man.
Yeah,

2270
02:03:56.181 --> 02:03:59.720
I remember this man.
I remember it.
He just snapped that fucking arm,

2271
02:03:59.810 --> 02:04:04.190
pulls it out and it is,
look at his left arm.
It is just,
just jacked.

2272
02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:07.970
Done man.
And he went out of bounds,
right?

2273
02:04:08.230 --> 02:04:10.820
And then he gets up and hold her at some point I think right there.

2274
02:04:10.821 --> 02:04:13.940
Tells a referee I his arm broken.
That's it.

2275
02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:19.310
And [inaudible] stuffs his broken arm in his,
in his belt and she's fine,

2276
02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:24.500
which is Beasley on,
he did a seminar at,
at uh,
at our place and a,

2277
02:04:24.501 --> 02:04:28.430
at the end he fought everybody in the room.
They're like 60 people there.
Wow.

2278
02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:32.180
And he fought everybody to everybody out.
Yeah.
In his prime,

2279
02:04:32.210 --> 02:04:35.810
in particularly in phenomenology who was unbelievably good.
And in MMA,

2280
02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:36.720
probably one of her district,

2281
02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:41.360
just two ever did he really beat holder beat for doom.
Wow.
He beat everybody.

2282
02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:44.910
Be Ted today.
He's one of my favorites.
I saw him live in Abu Dhabi too.

2283
02:04:44.911 --> 02:04:48.660
And like 2003.
Yup.
He lost two.

2284
02:04:48.661 --> 02:04:51.510
He lost to Salo in that year,
but he made the finals.

2285
02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:57.320
He beat high and Gracie and then he'd be Ricardo Almeida and then he lost to

2286
02:04:57.721 --> 02:05:00.600
Salo.
I remember that high and Gracie fight.
That was amazing.

2287
02:05:00.601 --> 02:05:03.530
And he was all online.
It was amazing too.
Yeah.
It was all over high.

2288
02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:07.260
Sallows and other guy that people forget about.
I love that guy.
Oh my God.

2289
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:09.660
Love Him.
Him and his brother John Jay,
that,
that,

2290
02:05:09.870 --> 02:05:14.850
that fucking smash style style.
That's where I'm from.

2291
02:05:14.851 --> 02:05:17.520
That's kind of like my,
you know,
I'm a Carlson guy and you know,

2292
02:05:17.521 --> 02:05:19.770
my instructors has got him,
Hey,
do yoga.
And he's always telling me,
he goes,

2293
02:05:19.771 --> 02:05:22.950
Jimmy Always,
oh,
this is the old people metaphors.
These like Jimmy,
he's like,

2294
02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:27.570
he was in Mario,
your God's Jim,
you'll finish is over for you.
Like,
don't like,

2295
02:05:27.630 --> 02:05:31.350
so he's always like,
Jamie,
I don't go as mount you,
Jimmy,
you fucking,

2296
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:35.130
you fucking dumb man.
He Carlo border,
they'll take it back,

2297
02:05:35.410 --> 02:05:36.630
pull Hajime you'll finish.

2298
02:05:36.930 --> 02:05:41.520
That's another guy that I was asleep on his Laborio laboriel from,

2299
02:05:41.521 --> 02:05:44.770
from,
from what I have heard.
And you know,

2300
02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:48.450
obviously this is even before my time competitively,

2301
02:05:48.451 --> 02:05:51.960
he was the guy in the 90s,
like people who were around in that era,

2302
02:05:52.010 --> 02:05:55.380
like who was the guy?
And they're like,
hi,
Carla Lauria was the guy who was,

2303
02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:57.540
he was,
he took a world is the first year it happened.

2304
02:05:57.660 --> 02:06:01.500
It's interesting that these guys are still around still coaching MMA fighters,

2305
02:06:01.501 --> 02:06:04.160
you know,
still in the mix of the sport.
They have to be.
Yeah.

2306
02:06:04.780 --> 02:06:07.400
When you look at dayday pin an Eris,
uh,

2307
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:12.180
her laborio both from the same team or both Carlson guys.

2308
02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:13.830
Listen guys,

2309
02:06:15.230 --> 02:06:18.420
we're a little boost to Montay hosts by Hato that you think about.

2310
02:06:18.421 --> 02:06:20.640
That was the first greasy team that had a real MMA team.

2311
02:06:20.641 --> 02:06:25.641
So those guys spread out and created so many teams tour a huge fee tour.

2312
02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:29.370
Yeah.
So what happens now with Timmy Smith?

2313
02:06:29.371 --> 02:06:32.940
Jimmy Smith's sits back until Jimmy Smith can make some sort of,
uh,

2314
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:35.190
an announcement.
Yes.
That is what Jimmy Smith,

2315
02:06:35.191 --> 02:06:38.310
Jimmy Smith's got some pieces in motion though.
I have pieces in motion.

2316
02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:40.890
Maybe not.
Maybe we're just bullshitting you folks.
Could be.

2317
02:06:40.930 --> 02:06:44.370
Maybe because I'm working in Java juice next week,

2318
02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:49.310
but if fucked up Melatonin telling you you fucked up straight from Joe Rogan's

2319
02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:53.070
mouth made a mistake.
Well,
um,
you'll know more often my brain.
I know,
dude,

2320
02:06:53.071 --> 02:06:56.010
anytime you're in La Guy,
we've,
I'm an la guy.
It took me 20 minutes.

2321
02:06:56.020 --> 02:07:00.070
Just a ton of fights to talk about would definitely,
um,

2322
02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:03.090
I wish we could say more things folks,
but a,

2323
02:07:03.091 --> 02:07:05.610
you're going to figure it out anyway.
Jimmy Smith,

2324
02:07:05.611 --> 02:07:09.310
MMA on Twitter and on Instagram.
And,
uh,

2325
02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:13.110
I hope we worked together,
my friend.
Always a pleasure,
my brother.

2326
02:07:13.111 --> 02:07:15.330
Thank you very much,
very much.
And uh,

2327
02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:20.400
we'll be back tomorrow with the Golden Snitch,
Jeff Novitsky and,
uh,
and more.
Bye.
