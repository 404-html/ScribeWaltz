00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.140
[inaudible] recording.

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.620
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the flashlight.

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.940
If you go to Joe rogan.net,

4
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.060
click on the link for the fleshlight and enter in the code named Rogan.

5
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:12.990
You will get 15% off the number one sex toy for men.

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.140
Cue the obligatory music,
Brian.
Of course.

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.170
I just can't stop thinking of that flashlight though,
right?

8
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:20.780
If I can throw good experience,

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.920
the music's totally unnecessary,
but but necessary at the same time.

10
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.800
Anthony Bordain is with us.
Ladies and gentlemen,

11
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.190
thank you very much for coming by,
man.
This is cool as fuck.
Oh No,

12
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.340
I'm happy to be here.
I was.
I would look forward to this.
Me Too,
man.

13
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:45.190
If somebody had told me that my favorite show of you came up to me like 10 years

14
00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:46.024
ago,

15
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.480
I said in 10 years your favorite show is going to be about a dude who eats in

16
00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:52.570
different places.
I would have told you to go fuck yourself.
How does head,

17
00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:54.490
that's the most retarded show I've ever heard in my life.

18
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.650
If you told me 10 years ago that I'd be on television,

19
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.150
I would have said the same thing.
Yeah.

20
00:00:58.151 --> 00:00:59.980
That's one of the cool things about you men.
You're,

21
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.910
I wouldn't say you're reluctant,
but we're almost like an accidental celebrity.

22
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.810
Like you just got your book kitchen confidential,

23
00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:12.600
just fucking took off and then all of a sudden you're this famous guy like

24
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:15.100
getting my Choate.
Yeah.
It was like an overnight thing for sure.
One minute.

25
00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:17.860
I'm standing next to the deep fryer in the next,
uh,
you know what?

26
00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:21.220
I'm selling books and,
and you don't want an RTV.
I mean,
literally,

27
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.640
I think it was 44 years old.
Wow.
That's fucking wild.

28
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.650
I was not looking at anything.

29
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.190
I had no higher ambition than it keep cooking where I was cooking really.

30
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:35.080
And maybe hopefully have the,
you know,
I wanted some kind of minor,

31
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.360
I wanted to earn my advanced back on the book.

32
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.220
That was my highest hope and it all turned out real good.
That's fucking nuts.

33
00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:43.450
What a crazy story.

34
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.950
It's very interesting because it's very rare that someone gets to live a full

35
00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:50.230
and intense anonymous life.

36
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.500
And then all of a sudden be thrust into the public consciousness.

37
00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:56.560
But actually it's interesting,
you know,
it happened late at night.

38
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.610
I guess I've been in the restaurant business for a long time.
I think I,
my,

39
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:01.871
you know,

40
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:05.710
the level of bullshit that I can sort of live with in my life on a day to day

41
00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:09.730
basis,
uh,
um,
is pretty minimal now.

42
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.230
So I was just,
I,
I,
you know,
I,
I came at the television and everything else,

43
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.400
always with the attitude that hey,

44
00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.530
I could be packed next to the deep fryer tomorrow,

45
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.970
so I'm just not taking it that seriously.
It's amazing though.
I mean it's,

46
00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:25.180
it's reality television in your case actually worked.

47
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.700
It's like there's people that become famous and you go,

48
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.810
what the fuck is going on?

49
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.270
I don't even know what Kim Kardashians voice sounds like.

50
00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:32.740
I literally don't know what it sounds like.

51
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.020
I don't think I've ever heard her talk once,
but it's,
it's terrible here.

52
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.730
I know she is,
but she,
it's become like,
she's become a show.
She's become a thing,

53
00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:42.880
an item or a program,
the Kim Kardashians program.

54
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.900
But in your case it actually worked.
Like they actually have.

55
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.530
Yeah Dude.
It in a lot of ways though.
I think there's,

56
00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:52.660
there's some similarities unfortunately.
I mean both,

57
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.660
both shows mine and the Kardashians are really,
you know,

58
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.150
my show is about me and Mo and,
and having and

59
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.240
<v 2>uh,
and,
and taking advantage of the situation and it in that way I probably got</v>

60
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:07.660
something good common or dashes.
Yeah,
you say that,

61
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.020
but you're sort of almost a self deprecating thing.

62
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:14.680
Like you're discounting all the different things in the way you're pointing out

63
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.900
all these different things in these places you visit.

64
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:18.400
Cause that's what makes the show unique.

65
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.430
It's not just that you are in these exotic places eating these crazy fish in

66
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:27.580
Brazil.
It's,
it's,
you know,
you somehow or another,

67
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.260
they let us show on the air where they didn't fuck with it and they let the one

68
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:36.000
voice come through it.
I've been really,
really lucky.
It's,
it's,

69
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.810
we've been a freakish anomaly first on food network for two years and for going

70
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:44.320
on eight years now.
I'm a no reservations on travel.
Um,

71
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.470
it's been an amazing run because at every point,

72
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.800
both networks for whatever period of time I was,

73
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.480
I've been with w w w with them,
they've let me do whatever I want.

74
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.880
Um,
they've let us make the show the way we want to make it.
Uh,

75
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.650
do really fucked up things all the time.
I mean,
it's just the,

76
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.400
there are some episodes are like completely self indulgent and fun to make and

77
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.920
clearly we're having more fun making them then then audiences might have

78
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.310
watching them.
But what shows,

79
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:14.350
like which would show would you think he did a whole show?
W I mean,

80
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.240
one of the shows I'm proud of stuff is the Rome episode.

81
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.180
We're just sitting around all the shooters,
the,
you know,
the camera people.

82
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.240
That was a great episode count.
Here's how it all started.

83
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:23.980
The camera people and assistant producers,

84
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:28.090
me hanging around in some terrible hotel lounge,
probably in Singapore,

85
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.160
Kuala Lumpur or someplace like that.

86
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:33.820
And we're getting really fucked up on cocktails and you know,

87
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:37.720
just talking shit the way people do.
And I think one of the camera guy said,
man,

88
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:40.720
we are so fucking good.
We are so good at what we do though.

89
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.150
I'll bet we could make food porn in black and white.

90
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.420
And we all looked at each other and didn't,
you know,
yeah,
dude,

91
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:51.220
well let's just do it.
Well,
they let us make that show and we got away with it.

92
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:54.070
And I'm really,
and we,
I think we did really well.
It's a really pretty show,
but,

93
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.320
but if you,
generally speaking,

94
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.680
I don't know of many other people on television and lucky enough to be able to

95
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:01.500
go to their,
their network and say,
look,

96
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.380
we're going to do an entire hour of food related television in black and white

97
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.030
and,
uh,
it'll be,
uh,

98
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.450
an homage to Italian directors that none of our audience are few of our audience

99
00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:15.850
have seen.
Um,
I wouldn't,
they'll be subtitles who gets a label.

100
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.490
So we're having fun.
And I think if anything makes the show special,
it's that,
um,

101
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.230
it's really first and foremost about me and the crew enjoying what we're doing

102
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.530
both creatively and just having a good time.
And,
uh,

103
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.950
and that's really all we're looking at it.
It comes through.

104
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.470
That's why it's so fun to watch.
It's,

105
00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:37.780
it's so obvious that you guys are having a good time.
When we fail a lot.

106
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:38.080
I mean there,

107
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.140
there are shows where I'm really miserable and all this terrible humiliating

108
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:44.780
stuff happens to me.
I don't set out to do that for,
you know,

109
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.580
viewer entertainment.
That's genuinely me having a batter,
you know,

110
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.960
sexually humiliating time.

111
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.860
Like the one time when you were in Brazil and you had a horrible back pain

112
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.990
through the jungle.
Yeah.
Audiences love seeing me in a injured,

113
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.700
basically that's comedy gold.

114
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.240
So some of the shows that have been most fucked up in a bit just been failures

115
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:08.480
in every,
you know,
where everything went wrong from,
from beginning to end.

116
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.510
I had a miserable time.
It was just one,
you know,
a long week of,
of,

117
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.030
of bribery,
extortion and bullshit.
Sometimes,

118
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.030
you know,
after you go back to New York in the edit,

119
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.000
it put it all together that that ends up being a really funny show.

120
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:26.780
We did Romania show that made me like I'm public enemy number one in Romania.

121
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.970
It was,
it was a national scandal.
Uh,
but it's a very funny show.

122
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.640
Why was it a national scandal?
It just uh,
presented Romania in a,
in a,

123
00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:40.190
in a comical like that.
They did not appreciate,
you know,

124
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:43.160
cause we had a really terrible time there.
You know,
everybody was,

125
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.520
we try to shoot stuff naturally,
you know,
we don't,

126
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.520
we don't like things to be set up for us.
And so one of the first rules of the,

127
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:51.410
of the of the show is wherever we go,

128
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.530
we don't want to see native dancers and indigenous garb,
you know,

129
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:57.710
some dog and pony show.
We want,
we want to sort of run and gun.

130
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.430
We were foiled in every possible way.
And Romania,

131
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:05.330
I mean the government and the tourist people just sort of stepped in and we were

132
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:07.490
supposed to shoot with a humble butcher and his family,

133
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.040
somebody arrived at the humble butchers house beforehand,

134
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:12.200
said your house is not pretty enough for America television.

135
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:16.550
We're moving into a like a more attractive looking farm.
And by the way,
your,

136
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.821
you know,

137
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:20.540
your kids are going to dress up in indigenous garb and dance or pretend they're

138
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:24.980
happy.
So it was this whole eerie,
creepy theatrical.
Oh Wow.
You know,

139
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:26.300
from beginning to end,
you know,

140
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.400
that's gotta be the biggest trip is that you're going to places that they're

141
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.040
fucking dangerous man.
Like you would the Kurdistan,
I mean,
you go,

142
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.480
you go to the jungles of Brazil.
I mean,
you go deep,
man.
That's a,

143
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.940
that's going to be a weird fucking way to live.
Um,
you know,
I'm just like,

144
00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:46.380
I'm having this late in life childhood.
Uh,

145
00:07:46.381 --> 00:07:49.850
I've gotten to go to all the places that I dreamed about and read about.

146
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:51.050
You know,
I,
you know,
I love Greg,

147
00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:55.040
grew up reading books about pirates and explorers and so of course,

148
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.300
given the opportunity,
that's pretty much what I'm doing on the show.
Wow.

149
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:02.210
What a crazy change of life at 44 years of age.

150
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.910
How much did you travel before then?
Almost nothing.
I mean,

151
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:09.470
I'd been to France a couple of summers as a kid.
Uh,
I'd been to the Caribbean.

152
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.460
That was about it.
I mean,
I,
I,
if,

153
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.380
if always sure of anything at age 44 standing in the kitchen,

154
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.810
it was that I'd never see,
you know,
Saigon or,

155
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.760
or Hong Kong much less,
you know,
I probably had no expectation I'd ever see Rome.

156
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.110
So I'm just,
again,
I'm just kind of living that out and,

157
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.730
and as long as me and the crew,

158
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.220
as long as we're having as much fun as we are,

159
00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:38.390
at least finding ways to make like more and more fucked up television,

160
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.220
as long as we can do that.

161
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.223
<v 3>Is the crew,</v>

162
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.680
is there any similarities with the career as being like actual kitchen,

163
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.680
like the gang of the case,

164
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.400
<v 2>like a band,
a band?</v>

165
00:08:48.401 --> 00:08:51.270
It's tour together for really long time and sometimes you,

166
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.620
we rotate out personnel,
but there's a core group and you know,

167
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:57.480
maybe the bass player go away for a while,

168
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:00.570
but he'll be back and whoever fills in for him to somebody else that we've

169
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:03.240
worked with for years,
uh,
around the world.
So,
you know,

170
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:06.940
we all like each other and,
and,
uh,
and everybody's really,
really good at,

171
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.780
at what they do.
And you know,
that's fun spelling,
you know,

172
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:12.840
traveling with Pete with camera guys who were really good at their job.

173
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.420
That's a really a,
that's a satisfying thing.
Gets it.
Gets very intimate.

174
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.580
Yeah.
Traveling on the road to get there.
What does it,

175
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.450
what's the number of people you traveled with?
Uh,
with two camera people.

176
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:28.530
A producer who also carries a camera and I had been an assistant so that say

177
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.550
like forums,
those people.

178
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.270
So we got five and we pick up like local drivers and stuff on the ground

179
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:37.160
wherever we go.
Wow.
Now how do you coordinate with like a place like Brazil when,

180
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.000
you know,
do you have to get a translator?

181
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.300
Suddenly there's this entire profession of people,

182
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.360
a very strange mix of other professions who've come together and basically the

183
00:09:48.551 --> 00:09:52.410
called fixers.
You know,
you want to shoot,
you want to make a movie in Moscow,

184
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:55.980
you need a fix or somebody who knows who to what permits you need,

185
00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:01.140
how to arrange them,
you know,
as drivers knows who to bride,
that sort of thing.

186
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.070
Um,
there's one of those everywhere.
Everywhere on earth,

187
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:08.190
there's somebody who is available to fix for you.
And if not,

188
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:12.700
we reach out to like bloggers and,
um,
particularly food bloggers in,

189
00:10:12.701 --> 00:10:15.660
in whatever,
because somebody is blogging about food,

190
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.470
whatever city you're talking about in the world.
Chefs,
people who I,
I,
uh,

191
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.490
you know,
the chefs mafia is pretty extensive.
You if you,

192
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:26.670
if you know you're going to someplace and I dunno a Southeast Asia,

193
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.480
chances are,
you know,
a chef in New York who knows somebody out there.

194
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:33.960
So there's that.
You know,
you already have friends when you arrive.

195
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.710
That's got to be nice.
That's got to be nice.
But God,

196
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:41.860
that's gotta be a crazy way to live,
man.
You know?
How often are you on plans?
Um,

197
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.180
I'm traveling about 240 days a year.
Um,

198
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.810
either someplace else or in transit.

199
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:54.400
<v 3>Shit.
Have you had the frightening,
scary travel,
a airplane,
a ride yet?</v>

200
00:10:54.401 --> 00:10:57.010
Like with the lightning storm and that,
I like turbulence.

201
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.330
I know this is life fucked up,

202
00:10:58.331 --> 00:11:01.060
but I liked her ability to take your belt off and choke yourself while it's

203
00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:04.300
happening.
At this point in my life.
It breaks up the day,

204
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.100
<v 2>you know,
really,
you know,
and like lay in there,</v>

205
00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:09.830
especially after a couple of glasses of whiskey or something,
you know,

206
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.920
you hit turbulence and you see everybody else in the cabinet freaking out.

207
00:11:12.921 --> 00:11:17.070
You kind of,
it's,
it's more entertaining than the inflight movie.
Uh,

208
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:18.980
and it does break up the,

209
00:11:18.981 --> 00:11:23.820
the sort of soul sucking a monotony of,
of,

210
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:25.430
of too long and it in a plane

211
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.110
<v 3>and it's the best iPhone video too.</v>

212
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.390
You said always have your iPhone video of ready to go for things like that when

213
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.170
that people freak out on the plane.
Right.
I've been doing it lately.

214
00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:35.390
I never thought of it before in there recently.
Every time I,

215
00:11:35.391 --> 00:11:37.880
something crazy is happening on planes and just watching it,

216
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.990
I've been filming it and I'm going to look good and not really,

217
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.440
it's really hard to Jesus suit.

218
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.220
So it was the two formula and then you post this stuff.
No,
no,
no.

219
00:11:46.221 --> 00:11:48.150
I just collected,
I don't know.
What am I doing with it?
Really

220
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.630
make a five plane passenger and make a 10 best terrified points.

221
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.670
<v 2>I don't think we should put that energy out there.
Fellow.
Yeah.</v>

222
00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.680
<v 3>Placed their faces with cats.
Tango and it looks like cats or man.</v>

223
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.960
Well if you are not a person of interest to law enforcement will be.

224
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.790
I always film on the plane because then whenever I go on the road with Joe,

225
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.280
I kind of do the same thing.
That kind of what you can do.

226
00:12:13.281 --> 00:12:14.540
You have a camera crew or a gang,

227
00:12:14.541 --> 00:12:17.540
but I pretty much do it for Joe and like so when we're on the road somewhere

228
00:12:17.541 --> 00:12:19.670
like Houston or something like that,
I'm always having cameras.

229
00:12:19.671 --> 00:12:22.820
I'm always filming from even when he doesn't know I'm filming like in the back

230
00:12:22.821 --> 00:12:27.320
of a car or in the back of a plane or,
or when we're at a comedy club.
But it's,

231
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.060
it's weird collecting footage.

232
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.030
It's now become addicted to collecting crazy footage.

233
00:12:32.031 --> 00:12:34.610
Like I feel like I can't just go out and have a good time.
I'm always like,

234
00:12:34.611 --> 00:12:36.320
I got to film this,
I got to film this.

235
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.790
I think I would have some kind of condition.

236
00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:40.910
And you get rid of the condition as the Internet.
You know?

237
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.580
<v 4>The endless resource of infor entertainment that that is the Internet.
I mean,</v>

238
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.560
I got a real problem.
I can't even go to sleep at night.

239
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:51.340
I sit in front of the box just clicking buttons.
I just can't stop clicking,

240
00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:53.950
which is like one more documentary.
One more article,

241
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.910
one more Wata fucking hyper Nova.
It's going to kill everything.
Holy Shit.

242
00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.950
You know,
one after the other.
It's like,

243
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.400
<v 3>what were those sounds?</v>

244
00:13:01.401 --> 00:13:05.000
Have you seen those youtube videos of these weird sounds and different cities?

245
00:13:05.001 --> 00:13:08.540
I can wrong.
It's probably horse shit if it's on the news.

246
00:13:08.541 --> 00:13:12.120
If it's on the age of new science on major news sites.
Really?
Yeah.
I'll find it.

247
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.680
I'll try to show you later.
Okay.
Hold on.
So earth is groaning.

248
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.090
What is the scariest place you've

249
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.360
<v 2>been to so far?
Oh Wow.
I don't know.
Scary.</v>

250
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.490
I don't know.
I mean,
in any country where there's,

251
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:30.790
there's really no infrastructure or no trustworthy infrastructure,
I mean,
um,

252
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.700
do you worry ever that,
you know,
you become like a target?
Um,

253
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.660
there have been times when we've on the show,
uh,

254
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.750
when we shot in Beirut in the war in 2000,
we got caught up in the conflict.

255
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.820
There was a heightened level of paranoia about that sort of thing then,
but,
but,

256
00:13:46.821 --> 00:13:50.090
uh,
you know,
it was ridiculous in the end.
What happened there?

257
00:13:50.091 --> 00:13:53.090
You got caught up in,
well,
we were there shooting a,
you know,

258
00:13:53.091 --> 00:13:57.220
a happy bay route show,
you're going to open no reservations and uh,

259
00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.930
went back to my hotel,
a bait,
you know,

260
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.810
basically there was a border incident with Israel.
Uh,

261
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.940
some Hezbollah had kidnapped him,

262
00:14:04.941 --> 00:14:09.910
Israeli soldiers and basically we got caught up in a war.
I mean,

263
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.810
woke up or went home a,

264
00:14:11.811 --> 00:14:14.210
when are you going to look out the window and there's the airport,
you know,

265
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.180
bursting into flames,
that rockets and stuff coming in and we realize,
you know,

266
00:14:17.181 --> 00:14:19.580
we're not,
we're not,
we're not getting out anytime soon.

267
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.660
So there was,
of course on the part of the,
you know,
people who,
uh,

268
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.150
security and security guys who got involved with trying to get us out of the

269
00:14:29.151 --> 00:14:32.300
country.
Yeah.
We had to think about all of that sort of,
you know,

270
00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.760
possible targets sort of stuff.
Again,
it's uh,

271
00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:40.100
it's silly and I don't think any of us took it.
Took it,
took it seriously ever.

272
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.960
I mean,
who,
who would target,
you know,
host of it.

273
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.310
Shit.
Little travel show.
Yeah.

274
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.530
I think some people in some parts of the world and be really desperate.
But um,

275
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.660
so that was the worst situation that you were ever in.

276
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.980
The barrier was a satisfied,
I think the scariest are probably places.
Uh,

277
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:02.840
Liberia,
uh,
you find yourself where people are desperately poor

278
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.350
and hungry.
Uh,
and,
and there's no law and order at all.

279
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.790
Uh,
you know,
a little situation in a market could turn into a,

280
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.500
a really ugly situation.
Uh,
you know,

281
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.330
those are probably the most realistic threats we've ever,
ever faced.
It just,

282
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.670
you know,
you know,

283
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:26.660
large groups of hungry people behave like hungry people do.

284
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.860
And a,
so there've been some dodgy moments there,
but that's about it.

285
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:36.080
There's a great online documentary show,
a call,
the vice guide to travel.

286
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.690
Have you ever heard of these guys?
Terrific.
Did you ever see the episode on Srb,

287
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.130
Liberia episode?
He was,
it was a little lurid,
but,

288
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.870
but it wasn't false.
It was,
it was a true picture of,

289
00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:52.460
uh,
you know,
we told the truth about,
about,
uh,
I mean in Liberia for sure.

290
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.490
That's a great way to describe it.
I mean,
they obviously went after the juice,

291
00:15:55.491 --> 00:15:59.630
but I mean,
well,
if you're looking for juice,
you see,
you'll find it.
I mean,

292
00:15:59.631 --> 00:16:02.790
the general,
they think they were with general buck naked.
Yeah.
Yeah.

293
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.710
I thought what?
You don't know who he is.
He's a guy who shoot,

294
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.200
goes into a battle naked except for his boots,
except for his boots.

295
00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:12.530
And he had an egg is killed the enemy's babies.

296
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.950
And he drinks their blood because he thinks it makes him a mortal.

297
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:21.410
And he's admitted to this.
I mean,
this guy is like music.
It's crazy.
So,
so,
yeah.

298
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.370
And now he's a preacher.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought he was in the government,
actually.

299
00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:28.270
It was a preacher.
Now I believe he's a preacher.
Yeah.
Yeah,
Bro.

300
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.050
It's a very surreal,
uh,
it's,
it's,
uh,
that,

301
00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:36.230
that in many ways the history of that country,
uh,
resembles,

302
00:16:36.231 --> 00:16:40.790
have really bad acid trip.
You know,
Manson ask,
it's a,

303
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.390
they were American slaves that were brought back to Africa.
What was that,

304
00:16:44.391 --> 00:16:48.710
what it was?
Yeah,
but long story short,
uh,

305
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.920
Liberia was,
I'm going to say founded,
but it was,
it,

306
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:56.990
the nation was created by freed slaves,
part of a back to Africa movement.

307
00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.860
Um,
and they arrive,

308
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.630
people essentially who'd been taken from all over Africa,
uh,

309
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.630
you know,
were,
were returned to Liberia,

310
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.510
a country that none of them really had roots in.

311
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.920
And they became sort of an aristocracy and base their country entirely on the

312
00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:20.540
American model in a very red,
white,
and blue.
So it was in many ways,

313
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:24.290
it's this little America and Africa.
And then things went really,
really bad.

314
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.210
Whoa.
Africa fucking freaks me out.

315
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.450
We're going in a few weeks,
we're going to Mozambique next.

316
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.370
Are you ever going to go to the Congo?
We try every year.

317
00:17:37.371 --> 00:17:41.780
It's like this fantasy for years.
I want to,
I want to do the whole Joseph Conrad,

318
00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:45.170
you know,
a heart of darkness thing.
I'm obsessed with going up the Congo river,

319
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.270
but every time we take a serious look at doing it,

320
00:17:48.271 --> 00:17:51.840
we schedule it every but every year we get the same security reports.

321
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:56.840
Like no way,
you know?
Yeah.
It's a very,
very volatile place.
You know,

322
00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.290
that's where they found that giant chimpanzee.
Do you know about that thing?
Uh,

323
00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.750
no.
No.
This is what I want to go.
There's a champ in the Congo.
I mean,

324
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:07.350
I would never go if you had a force field.
Yeah.
If I had a force field.

325
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.620
Is it champion the Congo called a a Bondo ape.

326
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.430
It's a new champ that they've discovered that nest on the ground like a gorilla.

327
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.480
They Walk Upright.
There are over six feet tall.
They're like 400 pounds.

328
00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:21.690
I don't want to see this van.
[inaudible] kidding me to try for me.

329
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:25.680
I just remember the locals call them lion killers.
Don't doubt it.

330
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.920
Two different types of chimps.
There's tree beaters,
the regular champs,

331
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.310
and then there's these grey lion killers.
There are real chimp.

332
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:37.050
You imagine a six foot tall gray Jaguar eating chimpanzee.

333
00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:40.620
They've caught them eating jaguars and there's a real champ that photos of this

334
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:43.860
fucking thing.
They haven't been able to capture an ally,
but they have photos of,

335
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:48.570
uh,
some guy shot shot a giant one near an airport up there.
I want one.
Could it,

336
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:50.850
could I have one working for me?
Like,
I think that's a giant killer.

337
00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:53.970
Chimp in a diaper,
you know,
going out to nightclubs with them.

338
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.940
Like that lady in Connecticut.
But that's what I'm thinking about it.

339
00:18:56.941 --> 00:18:59.220
That's why I monkeys,
especially chimps,

340
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.240
there was no love 3 million in the monkeys because that,
that story,

341
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:06.990
this giant craze,
like Valium,
he just kicked Valium or something.

342
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.250
There's the monkey and it'd be the champion then like nod somebodies face off,

343
00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:15.180
right?
Yeah.
Oh,
it's like,
just as well,
that's a pretty horrifying story.
Well,

344
00:19:15.181 --> 00:19:19.020
they can just decide to do that at any time too.
I mean,
yeah,
they don't,

345
00:19:19.021 --> 00:19:22.770
but they could just decide to just fuck you up anytime they want and they can,

346
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:27.360
and it's not even like bad in their culture.
Right.
The culture of Champs,

347
00:19:27.361 --> 00:19:29.950
you're supposed to be fucking each other up.
They do it all day.
Right?

348
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.720
They don't understand our world,
our world of not fucking people up all the time.

349
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.800
They try to keep it together.
I don't want,
I don't want any pet that first vcs,

350
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.580
Abby,
you know,
I do.
Speaking of pets,

351
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.380
if you ever come across any crazy animals or any weird threats like in,

352
00:19:45.381 --> 00:19:48.330
in any places,
like when you go to Brazil and you're in the jungle,

353
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.450
I mean jaguars are like a real threat out there,
right?

354
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.550
The closest a threat for the animal kingdom we've had,
if we were in,
uh,

355
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.980
Ghana I think,
and we,

356
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.020
the idea was we're going to go all the way out in the middle of the nowhere,

357
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.740
this tiny little look I get gain Parker camp and,

358
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.900
and the whole idea was we'd have to get up super early and drive like four hours

359
00:20:09.901 --> 00:20:13.130
and bouncing land rovers in the hope that maybe if we're lucky we're going to

360
00:20:13.131 --> 00:20:16.270
see a herd of elephants and get to shoot.
So we,
we,

361
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.800
we wake up really early in the morning and the camp is infested with,

362
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.680
with elephants,
if it can be infested with elephants.
We were,

363
00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:25.770
they were just everywhere wandering around right outside.

364
00:20:25.771 --> 00:20:29.220
So of course we did what,
what any shooter would do.

365
00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.460
You run outside and you'd start to shooting the hell out of these fucking

366
00:20:32.461 --> 00:20:36.720
elephants.
It's a good shot.
Wow.
So we're doing this and we're like,
dude,
okay,

367
00:20:36.721 --> 00:20:40.560
let's get a good shot you and use you closed it on it that way and I'll close it

368
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:45.240
on it that way we'll,
and we'll basically heard the elephant towards the camera,

369
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.400
right.
At which point the game warden wakes up,
you know,

370
00:20:48.401 --> 00:20:52.270
shows up are guidances step away from the elephant,
you know,

371
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:55.800
like walk slowly backwards.
We've done everything wrong.
We,

372
00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.190
these were young male elephants are there.
They are the fastest moving creatures,

373
00:21:00.191 --> 00:21:03.070
I think in the wild once they get going.
Oh.
And uh,

374
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:07.750
they hate bright like bright shirts,
which of course we were wearing.

375
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.610
Uh,
they don't,
they're spooked by people holding implements.
A,

376
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.480
which of course that's what we were doing.

377
00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.800
And they particularly don't like being herded by people.
One,
you know,

378
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:22.090
thousands their weight or likely likely to charge at any point.

379
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:25.810
So apparently that was,
we'd come close to doing something fatally stupid.

380
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.190
How will you guys so bold,
stupid is the word.
Were you drunk?

381
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.330
You guys were sober.

382
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.690
<v 3>We never seen that elephant bashing the guy video that's on the Internet.</v>

383
00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.770
<v 2>That's an important point.
What are you drunk?
Are you so well,</v>

384
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.120
I mean we're certainly drunk and stoned a lot on the show,

385
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.140
but I think now we woke up and,

386
00:21:45.141 --> 00:21:48.220
and we were stone sober first thing in the morning.
Wow.
I mean,

387
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:52.350
what a cra camera people are really suicidal.
I mean,

388
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.940
one of our guys,

389
00:21:53.941 --> 00:21:57.720
both of them actually when we were shooting and Curtis down there hanging out

390
00:21:57.721 --> 00:22:00.660
the hatches of these,
uh,
you know,
Russian cargo,

391
00:22:00.661 --> 00:22:04.350
helicopters hatch open,
they're all the way out.

392
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.200
You get in these cross drafts and humps from,
you know,

393
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.090
updrafts where suddenly you're at zero grab,
you know,
so you're,
you know,

394
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.090
it's just,
they do crazy shit for a,
for a good shot.

395
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.160
They really don't have a lot of sense.

396
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.520
And it's nothing freaks me out more than those planes with the holes in the bag,

397
00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:25.530
those cargo jets and every sports and Egor movie.
Yeah man,

398
00:22:25.531 --> 00:22:30.470
we've been in everything if it flies or,
or,
or moves on water or we've,

399
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.750
we've,
we've been there.
Wow.

400
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.710
And so over 10 years,
how many different countries have you visited?

401
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.290
I think it's over a hundred.
Wow.
A lot.
A lot.

402
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.760
<v 3>So your passport has more than one.
Like my height,
my nest,
Canada,</v>

403
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:50.250
<v 2>I'm on my,
I'm in my third passport in it in 10 years.
I think it just,</v>

404
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.150
why they can't even put in any more pages.
And then you got to get a new one.

405
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:59.880
It seems like you should have a shorter line for security.
I'm really,

406
00:22:59.881 --> 00:23:02.850
I'm really good at you already.
I go into this,
um,
you know,

407
00:23:02.851 --> 00:23:06.990
they talk about how it look.
Cops,
we'll talk about how they can identify,
uh,

408
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:10.710
an ex con very easily because when they're rousted they relaxed,
they go limp.

409
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.250
They don't get,
they don't,
they will fight back there.

410
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.880
They're trained to sort of deal with,
with that kind of relationship.
Oh,

411
00:23:17.881 --> 00:23:22.230
that's interesting.
Yeah.
I completely forgot my point here.
That's all right.

412
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.760
That's interesting enough.
That's a,

413
00:23:23.761 --> 00:23:26.490
that's a funny point that someone would be used to someone,

414
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:31.040
someone frisking them.
So I go into that same sort of relaxed.
I'm such,

415
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.680
I'm a professional traveler.
I just sort of relaxed,

416
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.460
go limp and try to blow this out as I go through this really enraging process.

417
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:42.060
My friend Tony Visa stamp comic from Boston,
he said this to me once,

418
00:23:42.061 --> 00:23:46.000
he was traveling from Boston to New York on a regular basis,

419
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.940
like good three hour drive if you're lucky.
And I said,
I'm like,

420
00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:53.760
how are you doing that?
He goes,
I just go zen when I'm in the car and just goes,

421
00:23:53.761 --> 00:23:55.160
then this is what I'm doing right now.

422
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:58.490
I don't let it upset airports in particular cause it's futile.
You know,

423
00:23:58.491 --> 00:24:02.810
there's no,
there's shit goes wrong.
You will end up sleeping on the floor.

424
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.330
Uh,
it,

425
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.880
it don't matter how crazy in reserve you get about the situation and you're

426
00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:09.740
still going to end up sleeping on the floor.

427
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.930
Is that what wiggle transit is about?

428
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.860
What is this in transit thing that you're doing?
Well,
I mean,
just you'll learn,

429
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:20.340
uh,
you learn to adapt.
You're doing it like a new show.
Oh yeah.
The,

430
00:24:20.341 --> 00:24:24.430
it's called a layover.
Layover.
Oh,
I thought it was in transit for some reason.

431
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.500
That's my,
my,
my head.

432
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.010
So what does that show is that it's sort of experiences.

433
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.190
No reservations has always been about sort of me having a good time or trying to

434
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:36.380
have a good time.
And this one's a more,

435
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.540
we're trying to actually be a little useful,

436
00:24:38.541 --> 00:24:42.350
like provide some information and experiences that you,
you could do,

437
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.270
whereas no reservations,

438
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.410
that's always been a second secondary consideration.
We just,

439
00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:52.810
we do a lot of shit on their reservations that you just can't do their,
uh,

440
00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.260
you know,
they're out of rate,
out of reach of,
of anybody's expectations,
I think.

441
00:24:57.261 --> 00:24:58.160
Any reasonable ones.

442
00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:01.580
So this was more about if you're stuck in a place where you find yourself at a

443
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:06.530
place for like 24 or 46,
48 hours,
um,
it's just,
you know,

444
00:25:06.531 --> 00:25:11.100
good shit to do.
So you filming it,
piggybacking it on no reservations.

445
00:25:11.101 --> 00:25:16.100
So we,
we took a break and a no reservations and went out and shot a whole hell.

446
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:19.340
A lot of these all in a really short period of time.
I,
it was,

447
00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.840
it was actually brutal.
So,

448
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:27.090
so you're doing two series at the same time then that we broke from another no

449
00:25:27.091 --> 00:25:31.320
reservations,
uh,
bank,
10 episodes of a,
of a lady.
I mean,

450
00:25:31.321 --> 00:25:34.340
you're going like one to another boom to boom.
Yeah.
That's insane.

451
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:37.190
That's an insane amount of work.
Yeah.
But I mean,

452
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:43.220
what am I going to do?
It's,
it's a good,
yeah,
take it while it's good.

453
00:25:43.221 --> 00:25:46.820
I mean it's,
this is not a,
this is not a Gig that you can say,
you know,

454
00:25:46.821 --> 00:25:48.410
I just going to take a couple of years off,

455
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:53.270
go go to an Ashram and find myself that,
but I'll be back

456
00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.170
know,
and now I have the best job in the world.

457
00:26:00.171 --> 00:26:03.120
I'd be crazy to,
to,
to dot milk it for everything I can.

458
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.510
<v 3>Are you still writing at all?</v>

459
00:26:04.511 --> 00:26:06.880
Because I know that you're the one book kitchen confidential.

460
00:26:06.881 --> 00:26:09.310
It's like the Bible and most kitchens and most,

461
00:26:09.311 --> 00:26:12.700
most chefs I know all have that book.
Like every time I go to their house,

462
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:17.230
I see that book.
Uh,
did you continue to write on the side?
You know,

463
00:26:17.231 --> 00:26:18.090
why you're on planes or,

464
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.550
<v 2>Yup.
And I'll take some time off to write.
Uh,
but yeah,</v>

465
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:25.490
every couple of years of the book just did a comic book.

466
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.750
There'll be out next year,
a comic book for a Vertigo.
Yeah.

467
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:33.850
It's an ultra violent,
a sort of version of,

468
00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:37.730
I don't know what you'd call it,
futuro.
Satirical.

469
00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:40.500
A slaughter fest in a,
in a,
in a sort of a,

470
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.890
a near future where,
where it's all about food.

471
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.840
People kill each other over ingredients and ideology.
Really?

472
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.710
Yeah.
It's really illustrate it.
The art is going to be amazing.

473
00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:57.711
So did you write it or you like cowrote with I co wrote it with a friend of

474
00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:02.320
mine,
a really great writer named Joel rose.
And it's,
uh,

475
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.750
we're kind of describing like Yojimbo or fistful of dollars,
but uh,

476
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:12.620
but all that chefs,
that's awesome.
That's awesome.
Now who is illustrating it?

477
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.050
A guy named,
uh,
linkedin,
fos and he's terrific,
terrific artists.

478
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.950
How does one come up with the idea to start their own comic book?
Uh,
well we,

479
00:27:20.951 --> 00:27:25.170
we just,
you know,
we sold this concept and,
and uh,

480
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.120
they were interested and they said,
well,
make it happen.

481
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.360
I'm doing it because it's fun.
It's awesome.
You know,
I just,

482
00:27:30.361 --> 00:27:35.100
it's again,
it goes back to the little boy thing.
Yeah.
If you can,

483
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.860
if you could do a comic book,
you know what little boy wouldn't.

484
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.430
<v 0>Yeah,
no shit.
I used to,
I love comics.
I love comics still.</v>

485
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:47.540
I had a dream the other day that I went to a comic book store and then I started

486
00:27:47.611 --> 00:27:50.460
getting into collecting comic books and I brought it home and my wife was like,

487
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:53.280
really?
You're going to,
you're just starting to buy con,

488
00:27:53.281 --> 00:27:54.690
I think I'm gonna buy conflicts again.

489
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.350
<v 3>Did you ever have to tell you just to commit collection growing up at one point?</v>

490
00:27:58.351 --> 00:27:59.720
Cause I did and I know Dan

491
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.280
<v 0>well for trucks actually late,
late in life,
you know,</v>

492
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.930
so I knew I was the sensible kid who kept my collection.

493
00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.650
So I had a very good comic book collection.
But uh,
you know,

494
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:15.850
cocaine is a powerful drug.
I've managed to avoid that one.
Yeah.

495
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:17.490
The one I'm at it,
when I was a kid,

496
00:28:17.491 --> 00:28:22.491
I had a friend whose cousin was selling it for like over a course of one school

497
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:26.460
year.
He completely changed.
He lost about 15,
20 pounds.

498
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:30.180
His face got sunken in and him and his girlfriend would just hide in their attic

499
00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:34.050
apartment,
do coke and watch TV.
And I was like,
okay,

500
00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:38.790
whatever the fuck that is the blackout room,
you know,
the foil,

501
00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:42.930
you know,
over the windows.
And they got creepy.
It's just very strange.

502
00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:44.290
It was like,
they're like,
they're infected.

503
00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.000
That's like they got bit by a vampire or something,
you know,
break.

504
00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.350
He was breaking bad.
Does that really well.
Uh,
on that show,
they,

505
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:54.630
every time they go to like get a meth head,
uh,
apartments,
the set decoration,

506
00:28:54.631 --> 00:28:57.690
they really got that right.
You know,
that shows fucking great.
Yeah.

507
00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:01.420
<v 3>It's so fun.
Decorating this sets like,
I like Doritos.
I met these people.</v>

508
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.390
Like Doritos is throwing,
I mean,
staining sheets.

509
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.890
<v 0>Has anybody ever given you shit for shooting animals on the show?</v>

510
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:14.490
<v 2>Um,
I mean,
I did.
Peter do not love me,</v>

511
00:29:14.491 --> 00:29:18.850
I'm sure.
Uh,
I mean we do get mail from Vegetarians.
Um,

512
00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:23.250
you know,
I shot a pig the couple of weeks ago on the show.
Yeah,
great episode.

513
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:28.080
Thank you.
Um,
and you know,
of course people,
people who eat pork,

514
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.600
we're saying,
you know,
there was no need for that.
That was,
you know,

515
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:33.480
completely offensive and ridiculous that you would do that.

516
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.320
What someone actually said.
I guess you did it for ratings.
Well,
you know,

517
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.150
is there a huge demographic out there?
You know,

518
00:29:39.151 --> 00:29:42.100
I need to see more pigs shot in the brain.
I need to see

519
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.680
<v 0>more.
I want to see some more animal cruelty.
No,
it was,
we,</v>

520
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:49.030
we did it because it's part of a process that,
that uh,
uh,
celebratory process,

521
00:29:49.031 --> 00:29:49.601
that tradition.

522
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:54.490
And I was offered the honor of doing the deed and I thought it would be

523
00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:56.730
hypocritical to not,
you know,
um,

524
00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.040
I'm responsible for the death of the pain because we're making a TV show about
a,

525
00:30:00.041 --> 00:30:02.080
about a party where we kill a pig and eat it.

526
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.500
So either somebody else is going to do it or I'm going to do it.
And I just said,

527
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:06.760
you know,
fuck it.
I'll do it.

528
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:09.310
You get sick a lot with all the different foods you eat.

529
00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:14.320
Have you ever found any food allergies that you didn't know you had?
That's a,

530
00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:16.190
that's such an important point,
man.
It's,

531
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.270
it's a weird thing that people have where they think that somehow or another,

532
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:23.560
if you don't kill the animal,
that you're not responsible for its death.
Yes.

533
00:30:23.561 --> 00:30:25.450
You know that you're not somehow or another,

534
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.900
but you just because you don't get your hands dirty and getting the meat at the

535
00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:32.470
supermarket,
you're not responsible.
It's a son fucking thing.
Yeah.
I mean,

536
00:30:32.471 --> 00:30:34.570
I don't make a point of going out there.
I don't want,
you know,

537
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.510
we need some more footage of me looking manly,
you know,
she would,
you know,

538
00:30:37.511 --> 00:30:41.440
bring it down a deer.
Um,
it wasn't like we draw,

539
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.560
we try to avoid that.
But on the other hand,
if you're having a,

540
00:30:44.561 --> 00:30:48.130
we've had a lot of animals slaughtered for our meal,
uh,

541
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.250
around the world because that's what they do in a lot of cultures.
You know,

542
00:30:51.251 --> 00:30:56.170
when you were a guest,
it's going to kill the lamb.
Yeah.
So eventually,

543
00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.970
uh,
you know,
every once in a while I will actually have to kill it out on myself.

544
00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.130
I don't know.
I just,
you know,
I'm not a hunter.

545
00:31:03.131 --> 00:31:05.850
I wouldn't ever hunt for sport for instance.
But,
you know,

546
00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:10.760
I do eat meat and I do eat this stuff and um,
you know,
um,

547
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.810
if I'm going to be cool with other people shooting an animal,
I mean,

548
00:31:13.811 --> 00:31:14.890
I may as well do it myself.

549
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.430
I just a the one of the first episodes that I ever saw of your show you,

550
00:31:18.431 --> 00:31:22.150
it's shot a deer in England.
I was terror.
That was,

551
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.990
I was absolutely terrified.
I really like,
my worst fear was,
oh,

552
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.940
I'm going to hit this thing in the stomach or something and you know,
long,

553
00:31:30.941 --> 00:31:35.080
painful,
horrible.
I would have totally freaked out.
Right.
So yeah,
I was,

554
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.040
I felt very,
uh,
was that the first time you ever shot?

555
00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:41.560
So it was the first time I shot anything that big and it was one of the first

556
00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:42.610
episodes that I saw.

557
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.070
It's one of the things that got me hooked on the show cause I was like,

558
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:49.390
well this is real.
Like you just shot this fucking thing.
And this guy rubbed a,

559
00:31:49.391 --> 00:31:52.600
a blood cross about was Marco Pierre White who was one of my,

560
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:55.390
was one of my heroes.
Like back when I was cooking,

561
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.940
we'd all stand around in the kitchen and look at a markup,

562
00:31:57.941 --> 00:32:00.730
your whites books in know that is the rock star.

563
00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:02.590
They know that's the guy we all want to be like.

564
00:32:02.591 --> 00:32:06.870
And so suddenly it's 10 years later and mark has taken me out hunting and,

565
00:32:06.871 --> 00:32:10.710
and you know,
I didn't want to fuck it up.
You know,
he's letting his rifle,

566
00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.110
here's my heroes.
This Anthony,
that beautiful one there.

567
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:18.040
He had the head actually mounted for me and uh,
uh,

568
00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:22.210
had the animal certified.
That's a silver medal.
Anthony,
he was very proud of me.

569
00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.790
Did you get any rifle lessons or anything before that?

570
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.690
Did you know how to aim a boy scout camp?
You know,

571
00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:33.100
it's really,
I just,
I shoot a lot on the show because there's a lot of,

572
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:39.590
not just guilt,
it's fun.
I mean when you travel a lot,
who does it standing there,

573
00:32:39.591 --> 00:32:39.980
pop it

574
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.830
<v 2>off endless rounds of ammunition at a target or something like that.</v>

575
00:32:42.831 --> 00:32:47.660
So we do a lot of target shooting.
Um,
local firearms is something of a,

576
00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:52.700
of a,
of a continuing,
a recurring theme on the show to alcohol.

577
00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:56.650
I mean there's a bar in,
in,
in Cambodia that's really famous that,

578
00:32:56.651 --> 00:32:59.900
that you could basically go to and just get fucked up.

579
00:32:59.901 --> 00:33:03.200
They give you liquor for free,
you pay for ammunition by the round.

580
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.900
I mean that's come on in what society would that not be fine?

581
00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.720
Getting really fucked up and shooting targets while drunk with like 50 caliber

582
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:13.670
machine guns.
Jesus Christ,

583
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.370
parts of the world,
man.
God Damn

584
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:24.020
<v 0>is bone marrow.
I still your favorite.
Have you found it?</v>

585
00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.410
You like it a lot?

586
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.140
I read somewhere that bone marrow and bread is your favorite meal.

587
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:30.960
<v 2>Yeah,
I would like that.
Most of bone marrow.</v>

588
00:33:30.961 --> 00:33:33.710
So to try it sometime it's just smooth.
A little toast.

589
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.630
<v 0>I've had bone marrow.
I like it.
It's good stuff.</v>

590
00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:40.200
Remember we had that shit in Portland?
Yeah.
As long as you eat fatty though,

591
00:33:40.201 --> 00:33:45.180
right?
Yes.
Mostly fat.
Something.
I Dunno,
I'm in.
It's,
it's very,

592
00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:49.740
I don't know.
It's delicious.
Melts in your mouth.
Cause I,
yeah,
we,

593
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.910
we don't travel nearly as much as you do.
You get in trouble?
I do,
I do,

594
00:33:53.911 --> 00:33:57.780
but it's mostly just cities,
city and I mean occasionally I go to the country,

595
00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.910
you know,
I do shows in England and we do,

596
00:33:59.911 --> 00:34:04.910
UFC is in England and we always tried to find fogo every city chow.

597
00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.640
What is it like having a wife who is a crazy UFC nut?

598
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.020
I've seen some UFC nuts do.

599
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:15.730
But your wife is over the deep end man.
Jeez.
She trained,

600
00:34:15.731 --> 00:34:18.590
she does Jujitsu and she does Moyie Thai too.

601
00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.360
<v 2>She does weight tie in the mornings and uh,
uh,</v>

602
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.810
grappling and Jujitsu with political Jujitsu at night.

603
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:31.460
That's a Gracie,
Gracie.
Yeah.
At a,
at his studio.
And she,

604
00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:36.280
it makes her happy and she's really,
really into it.
And um,
you know,

605
00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:41.110
I sort of live in fear.
Actually my greatest fear is that she's just wait,

606
00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:44.770
do you know some overenthusiastic fan?
You know,
some,

607
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:49.090
some drunk chick with hair extensions is going to step in between the two of us.

608
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:49.571
You know what,

609
00:34:49.571 --> 00:34:53.920
we're having a drink and my wife's going to choke her out or some shit.
You know,

610
00:34:53.921 --> 00:34:55.510
I'm,
I'm really worried about that.

611
00:34:55.511 --> 00:34:58.330
She's going to hurt somebody one of these days.
Do you think she wants to,

612
00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.820
she's spoiling,
isn't she?
I'm,
we're,
we're very,

613
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.780
we're very proud at the board day in household that,
uh,
my wife,
uh,

614
00:35:06.781 --> 00:35:09.460
of a couple of months ago choked out her trainer.

615
00:35:09.461 --> 00:35:12.070
He blacked out before he could tap out.
Really?

616
00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.600
So she's just fucking nuts for this stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.

617
00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:22.180
It's all about the grappling,
which,
which it,
you know,
it makes it tough though,

618
00:35:22.181 --> 00:35:23.790
cause we'll go out to dinner like a,

619
00:35:23.791 --> 00:35:27.010
a really nice French restaurant and she'll wear like a low cut gown.

620
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:32.310
And of course she's got like blue and yellow fingerprints all over giant blue,

621
00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.940
which is all very proud of everyone in the restaurants looking at me like you

622
00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:44.341
<v 0>yeah.</v>

623
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:49.020
You'd tried dating a kickboxer black eyes and shit walking around bloody noses.

624
00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:53.250
But,
but she,
she,
she loves watching the sport,

625
00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:56.760
but I think a way more she likes taking partner.
Wow.

626
00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:00.390
Well now how long has she been doing this?
But uh,
about four years now.

627
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:05.280
So you just got hooked four years ago and just dove right in when she does think

628
00:36:05.281 --> 00:36:08.690
she tends to do them in a serious way.
She's very enthusiastic woman.
Yeah,

629
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:10.350
it was fun.
It was fun watching.

630
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:15.500
I really love watching people who really enjoy the sport and really appreciate

631
00:36:15.811 --> 00:36:18.690
and understand it.
And then you get to see that,
you know,

632
00:36:18.691 --> 00:36:22.020
like your wife is one of those fucking people that throws her arms.

633
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.200
<v 5>Oh,
tell her</v>

634
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.030
<v 0>no.
She's like,
she's a serious UFC fans.
I mean,
I'm,</v>

635
00:36:28.031 --> 00:36:31.780
I'm getting into it entirely because,
because she's in a witness,
you know,

636
00:36:31.781 --> 00:36:36.460
it was a lot of fun.
I was in a boxing fan for sure,
but,

637
00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:40.990
but the,
you know,
this was all new to me,
so I basically,

638
00:36:40.991 --> 00:36:43.790
I have to ask her,
hey,
this guy any good?
Oh yeah.

639
00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.470
Once you figure out who's good and who's,
who's interesting and you know,

640
00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:50.470
you watch a few good fights and you understand the rivalries man,

641
00:36:50.471 --> 00:36:54.430
then that is an escapable.
It's just too exciting.
I love the,

642
00:36:54.431 --> 00:36:59.080
I love the Anderson Silva fight recently.
Yeah.
Don't call me.
Yeah.

643
00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:03.360
The whole,
when he put his hands down,
that whole [inaudible] thing was the,

644
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:05.950
I thought the fight was over there and he just totally got in the other guy's

645
00:37:05.951 --> 00:37:08.560
head.
He was such as contemptuous thing to do.

646
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.770
<v 4>Well,
he gets his timing.
What happens with Anderson is Anderson,</v>

647
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:16.620
he's like calculating you.
He's figuring out,

648
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:20.460
he stepping inside the danger zone and outside and trying to figure out what

649
00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:22.590
your instincts are,
what your reflexes are.

650
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.060
And then he realizes that after like 1520 seconds,
you're going to slow down.

651
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.300
And you know,
like 45 seconds of the first round guys start to slow down,

652
00:37:30.301 --> 00:37:32.280
two minutes,
three minutes in,
and they really start to slow down.

653
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.500
And that's when Anderson starts to pile it on.

654
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.610
He's like calculating your abilities and then he can just get right in front of

655
00:37:38.611 --> 00:37:41.190
you and put his hands down and there's nothing you can do about it.

656
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:43.950
It's gotta be the most horrifying feeling in the world,

657
00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.490
to be locked in a cage with a magician.
You know,

658
00:37:47.491 --> 00:37:49.650
a dude who can hit you and you can't hit him.

659
00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:53.280
And he's very confident and he's locking in on you and you know he's got you

660
00:37:53.281 --> 00:37:56.400
timed and figure it out and then it just starts popping off on you.

661
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:59.390
That was a really impressive Fido.
He's an amazing athlete,
man.
He's,

662
00:37:59.391 --> 00:38:03.480
he goes down in my book is one of the all time great athletes.
You know,
like the,

663
00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:07.350
the Muhammad Ali's and sugar sugar ray Leonard's and all the Roberto Duran is

664
00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:11.610
all the greats of the past.
I think Anderson Silva goes right in with him,

665
00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.260
you know,
obviously different sport,
but did the same thing that,
that,

666
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:19.560
that super athlete,
that guy that can do things that other people just can't do.

667
00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:23.340
<v 0>I'm a,
I'm a,
I was a,
you know,
Ali was a personal hero.
You know,
for me,
I just,
uh,</v>

668
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:27.180
as a,
as a,
as a fighter,
as a personality,
as a,
as a,

669
00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:30.810
as a leader,
uh,
I just

670
00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:34.680
really looked up to him.
It's still look up to them.

671
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.630
It's very unfortunate what happened to him.
You know what I mean?

672
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:42.670
You want to talk about a guy who was this incredible speaker who was so fast and

673
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.580
so fluent,
so sharp,

674
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.790
and the we can talk and the way you could break things down and the way he means

675
00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.990
his ethics.
He stood up for this fucking Vietnam War and he said,
you know what,

676
00:38:52.991 --> 00:38:57.050
man,
not,
no Vietnamese ever did nothing to me.
I'm not going over there.
Uh,

677
00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:02.060
you know,
I,
I put them up there with like Jefferson and a in Lincoln and,

678
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:07.060
you know,
I just see him as a really a great,
one of the greatest,

679
00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:11.510
uh,
in most heroic American icons.
I mean,
certainly.
Sure.
Well,

680
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.400
especially around the world.
Respected and looked up to,
uh,

681
00:39:15.401 --> 00:39:19.330
have you seen the film a when we were kings?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just amazing.

682
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.660
I cried like a baby at the end of that film every time.
It's amazing film.

683
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:27.250
Then that's the film where hunter s Thompson was hired to go run and he was so

684
00:39:27.251 --> 00:39:30.070
upset because he was an Ali fan.
He knew Ali was going to get killed,

685
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.550
that he just just took drugs and floated around the pool.

686
00:39:33.551 --> 00:39:38.070
The Nixon mask on and miss the whole fight just get dropped.
Or Thompson a,

687
00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:43.060
another personal hero,
but a mine,
I think I sat or a story then,

688
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:47.430
you know,
I'll,
I mean,
people say all these happy now really,

689
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:51.550
so I don't,
you know,
I don't think that Thomson clearly was,
was a happy man.

690
00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:56.260
Thompson was in a long pain too.
You know,
he had a hip replacements and that,
uh,

691
00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:58.270
that's brutally painful for some people.

692
00:39:58.271 --> 00:40:01.330
He had like a lot of physical ailments and on top of that,

693
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:04.870
his body was just so beaten down from the daily Busan.
I mean,

694
00:40:04.871 --> 00:40:08.440
he just pounded daily,
you know,
obviously,
I mean,

695
00:40:08.441 --> 00:40:11.450
I think anybody who reads my stuff,
you know,
I was,
you know,

696
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.480
I am shamelessly,
uh,

697
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.660
student dove or an enthusiast of a hundred times in his early work.
I really,

698
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.410
when that stuff came out in rolling stone,
I remember,
you know,

699
00:40:23.411 --> 00:40:28.150
running to the story to get fear and loathing in Las Vegas serialized,
uh,

700
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:32.710
life changing.
Yeah.
You know,
but I,
I don't,
that's a guy who,

701
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:37.120
who sort of peaked early and I think he had a very hard time for the rest of his

702
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:41.990
career after,
I think probably FEMA loading on the campaign trail.
I think he was,

703
00:40:41.991 --> 00:40:45.370
the guy was clearly struggling with writing for the rest of his life.
Well,

704
00:40:45.371 --> 00:40:50.020
I think you,
you just can't do that to your health and not struggle creatively.

705
00:40:50.021 --> 00:40:54.160
You can't do that.
You can't just poison yourself to cope.
That's for sure.

706
00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.500
You can't do cocaine right now.

707
00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:01.210
Maybe two sentences and then will happen.
You'll either keep writing,

708
00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.020
it'll be utter and complete shit or you'll find some way to not write it off.

709
00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.480
Embarrassingly,
I wasn't,

710
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:12.040
I didn't know much about hunter s Thompson until I was in Seattle once I was

711
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:16.210
staying in a hotel room and I had a layover and uh,
I just,

712
00:41:16.211 --> 00:41:18.400
nothing to do just flipping through the paper view movies,

713
00:41:18.401 --> 00:41:22.420
Gonzo life and work life and times of hunters Thompson,
I think it's called.
Yeah,

714
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.750
I watched a documentary on Holy Shit,
you know,

715
00:41:25.751 --> 00:41:29.920
when they show how eat fucking when Ed Muskie was running for president and you

716
00:41:29.921 --> 00:41:33.500
started writing fake stories about the guy being on Ibogaine and bringing it

717
00:41:33.501 --> 00:41:38.210
into exotic
and he made up names for new drugs that,

718
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.900
you know,
a dude was on something called wallet,
some new shoes,

719
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.680
some new form of stuff actually found its way into the straight media,

720
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.910
defend them.
So you gave some homeless guy who's press credentials,

721
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:54.950
I think his White House credential,
really without some ethics stuff.

722
00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:59.900
But I think,
uh,
he did some,
you get it if you,
if you read some of this stuff,

723
00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.710
uh,
in some of the lines and,
uh,
fear and loathing in Las Vegas.

724
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:07.910
It was a very romantic,
sentimental side.

725
00:42:07.911 --> 00:42:11.940
He wrote some beautiful sentences about how his hopes were smashed forever by

726
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.010
what he saw happening politically in this country.
Well,
Nixon,
it,
and just,

727
00:42:17.011 --> 00:42:21.140
you know,
really fucked with Connor Thompson's head.
What was great about his,

728
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:25.930
his rantings and drug induced,
you know,
his,
his,
just his,

729
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.860
his vision of the world was that he had been through a utopia period in San

730
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.850
Francisco in the late sixties.

731
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.440
So he had this idea of this LSD culture where he knew this was possible.

732
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.180
He knew it could be beautiful.

733
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:41.840
And then when the hopes were dashed and all the water was thrown on the fire,

734
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:46.810
then he became this,
you know,
wild fucking renegade.
That line about the,

735
00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:51.680
it's right here.
This is where the wave broke and then it all rolled back.

736
00:42:51.681 --> 00:42:55.190
I think he's talking about the desert near Vegas.
Um,

737
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:59.210
which was one of the very,
you know,
this was like a failed romantic,

738
00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:03.860
a failed Hippie,
you know,
who's,
who's seen everything go ugly real quick.

739
00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:07.430
Yeah.
And I'd love the way he described the,

740
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:11.630
so many people that were in the psychedelic movement there was calling them

741
00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:16.180
mental cripples if he's describing it,
that these,
you know,

742
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:19.910
basically these people are just locked into this crew of losers and they're

743
00:43:19.911 --> 00:43:21.230
dragging them around with them.

744
00:43:21.231 --> 00:43:24.620
And he stepped to the side and he was watching the whole thing crashing against

745
00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:27.740
the rocks.
Such an,
a fascinating writer.
That guy was,

746
00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:32.600
and it was so fascinating that he had this idealistic period when he was younger

747
00:43:32.601 --> 00:43:36.020
and it had the hopes dashed.
So it was almost like,
you know,

748
00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.030
I think it's where the anger came from them,
which was also so,
you know,

749
00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.530
what was so funny about the Thompson Yeah.

750
00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.340
That he describes a bad acid trip once,
I think in,
in uh,

751
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:50.180
in fear and loathing in Las Vegas where he describes a really bad acid trip as

752
00:43:50.181 --> 00:43:51.030
being one where you've looked at,

753
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.770
I need a leg and see your dead grandmother crawling up your leg with a knife in

754
00:43:54.771 --> 00:43:59.420
her teeth.
That is a beautiful image.

755
00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.490
Yeah,
he's one of those dudes.
I really wish I had a chance to meet,
you know,

756
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.020
once you find out about them later in life,
I'm like,
wow.

757
00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:11.870
He was a great letter writer to use.
The letters are available.

758
00:44:11.871 --> 00:44:13.760
I think that books are called the proud highway.

759
00:44:13.761 --> 00:44:18.170
And his correspondence with the people is really hilarious and really,

760
00:44:18.171 --> 00:44:21.200
really fun.
It's a brilliant dude.
Watch that for folks listening.

761
00:44:21.201 --> 00:44:24.250
Watch that documentary though.
Danzo yeah,
whatever it is great.

762
00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:25.880
And works of something.

763
00:44:25.881 --> 00:44:27.770
I don't know if it's the life and times or whatever it is,

764
00:44:27.771 --> 00:44:31.190
but just Gonzo look for it.
It's fucking incredible.

765
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:36.860
So no one has really ever given you a hard time about killing animals.
Um,

766
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:41.640
what about from all the shit you say about Vegans,
vegans?

767
00:44:41.641 --> 00:44:45.750
I find that very defensive because I've joked about vegans a few times on the

768
00:44:45.751 --> 00:44:50.190
podcast and I've gotten a bunch of hate mail hate tweets.
Yeah.
Um,

769
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:54.750
there's there,
there's a hardcore of vegans who are in,
who were,

770
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.690
they're not going to like me anyway,
you know,
whether I shoot animals,

771
00:44:57.691 --> 00:45:00.600
that's the fact that I'm eating meat at all and talking about it as if it's

772
00:45:00.601 --> 00:45:04.080
something that we should all do.
I'm already there.
They're blood enemy,

773
00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:08.400
so I'm not ever really get any problems with them.
It Vegetarians,

774
00:45:08.401 --> 00:45:10.170
I have a surprising number of vegetarian fans,

775
00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:12.900
which is something I really don't understand.
I'm grateful for it.

776
00:45:12.901 --> 00:45:15.330
But apparently there are vegetarians with a sense of humor.

777
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:19.590
Total vegans tend to not have a sense of humor.
Um,
but no,
they haven't really,

778
00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:24.360
I haven't had any problems.
This a usual angry stuff,
but not a lot of it.

779
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:28.980
I always wished that somehow or another science and figured out a way to record

780
00:45:28.981 --> 00:45:33.840
the screams of lettuce now that they've found that led us,
they,
they can't move,

781
00:45:33.841 --> 00:45:37.380
but they,
yeah,
they scream like squashing kittens,
you know,

782
00:45:37.381 --> 00:45:40.340
it's just not a microbial level.
We can't really pick it up,
right.

783
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.510
Cause poor lettuce is suffering every time you eat it.

784
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:47.040
And then see what these self righteous fox think Zuck be or walking in the whole

785
00:45:47.041 --> 00:45:50.550
foods and you're like wearing the scarlet letter if you're just in the whole

786
00:45:50.551 --> 00:45:53.100
foods at the wrong time and there's just vegans everywhere.

787
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:57.420
I knew down when you're walking down
you don't think it's that bad.

788
00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:02.250
It's not that bad.
It like that.
That would be friends that are vegans.

789
00:46:02.251 --> 00:46:06.600
I have a few silly friends.
I got Jamie Kilstein,
he's a Vegan,

790
00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:11.070
he's a great guy.
I love that dude.
He's silly though.
And yeah,
have you ever been,

791
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:14.490
should help them if we can.
He used to eat meat and you know,

792
00:46:14.491 --> 00:46:18.210
and now he's like super lefty.
He's like,
he's got this a radio show,

793
00:46:18.211 --> 00:46:22.380
citizen radio,
you know,
and they're real,
real,
super lefty.

794
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:26.880
He just got to Cook Bacon around them
somewhere in the distance.
Right.

795
00:46:26.881 --> 00:46:28.680
It's got to smell anything.

796
00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:33.540
Be smelling like be around wild pigs.
You know,
if you're so happy about pegs,

797
00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:35.400
if you wouldn't be,
if you saw a feral pigs,

798
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:39.780
the pigs that you see have no relationship to the pigs that we would have if

799
00:46:39.781 --> 00:46:41.730
they were,
when we talked about this in the last podcast,

800
00:46:41.731 --> 00:46:44.640
that they've transformed,
you know,
wild pigs.

801
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.980
If you set a domestic pig loose within three weeks,
their body starts to change.

802
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:53.850
They grew,
their tusks grow long,
their snout grows along,
their hair gets shaggy,

803
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:57.480
and they become more delicious.
Really do that while big as good.

804
00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:01.440
Is Wild pig better than domestic pig?
Kind of.
It depends what you're looking for.

805
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:05.160
You know,
it's a game ear.
I've had board before.
That's fucking delicious.

806
00:47:05.161 --> 00:47:08.720
That's amazing.
Yeah.
Some of the,
the,
the game needs,

807
00:47:08.721 --> 00:47:13.640
so like the most delicious meats,
like elk,
elk is fantastic.
You're around elk?
No,

808
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:18.840
never.
Oh,
elk is delicious.
Yeah.
Elk Liver as delicious.

809
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:25.080
Elk Liver.
Yeah.
What does that,
it's like a calves liver,
but with its own sort of

810
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:30.100
elkey flavor.
Well,
whoever figured out how to do Fogg wa,

811
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:33.240
<v 6>that guy is a bad motherfucker.
And what it's going to be illegal out here,</v>

812
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:37.810
I think in 2012 flats a laws,
laws kick it in.
It will be,

813
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:42.670
I believe,
illegal to sell in the state of California.
Oh my God.

814
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.700
Here's a,

815
00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:46.690
there's a restaurant called Brandywine and woodland hills and it's like one of

816
00:47:46.691 --> 00:47:50.740
their specialties and it's fucking fantastic.
It's so good.

817
00:47:50.741 --> 00:47:54.520
And I know it sucks to be a duck,
but it sucks to be a duck no matter what,

818
00:47:54.521 --> 00:47:58.990
when they have a giant liver and not,
yeah,
it'd be on that issue.

819
00:47:58.991 --> 00:48:02.700
People can really tend to get cranky,
especially out here.
I mean,
uh,

820
00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:04.520
some of the animal activists,
you know what I mean?

821
00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:08.050
Absolutely terrorized chef friends of mine up in San Francisco.
Really,

822
00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:12.460
there was a group up there who terrorized a chef friend first,
you know,

823
00:48:12.461 --> 00:48:15.880
threatening phone calls.
Uh,
they broke into his business,

824
00:48:15.881 --> 00:48:20.350
a trashed the whole business,
plugged up the toilets,
you know,
acid on the walls.

825
00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.450
But the nicest thing they did,

826
00:48:22.451 --> 00:48:27.451
I thought was they slipped into his backyard while he was away and videotaped

827
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:31.330
his wife and infant child together from the rear window,
you know,
from the,

828
00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:34.210
from the backyard.
And they sent him the tape.
Holy Shit.

829
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:39.300
I'm basically saying to stop serving or selling or in any way dealing with Foie

830
00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:43.870
Gras,
you know,
after this,
I just feel compelled,

831
00:48:43.871 --> 00:48:47.820
even if out of spite to eat foie gras for the rest of my life,
you know,
yeah.

832
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:48.783
I will eat it stands.

833
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:52.090
There are some cons out there that just waiting for an argument they're waiting

834
00:48:52.091 --> 00:48:56.500
to pick aside to beyond whatever team it is and fucking fight that to the death.

835
00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:00.490
Yeah.
I think they smartly saw four garage and easy when,
you know,

836
00:49:00.491 --> 00:49:05.150
it's not like this is any more outrageous or painful or bad or procedure,
uh,
in,

837
00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:07.870
in any way than any other animal we eat.
I mean,

838
00:49:07.871 --> 00:49:09.660
the way chickens are raised in this country is,

839
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:13.990
is truly shocking or domestic hogs from some of the major,
uh,

840
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.790
the major houses.
You know,
these are really sort of grotesque mass market.

841
00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:23.590
Uh,
you know,
a very unhealthy way to create food,

842
00:49:23.591 --> 00:49:24.424
let's put it that way.

843
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:28.190
So there are bigger and more deserving targets and flog raw.
But I think the,

844
00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:30.780
the animal rights guys,
uh,
uh,

845
00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:34.120
saw it as something that they could win that would be a high profile.

846
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:40.120
It looks bad.
Um,
and we should say what it looks like.

847
00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:45.130
You know,
it's,
it is,
uh,
basically when they feed the geese who generally,

848
00:49:45.131 --> 00:49:48.370
if it's any kind of any sort of a quality operation,

849
00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.280
the geese or the ducks come over to the feeder.

850
00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:52.960
But basically you tilt the things head back,

851
00:49:52.961 --> 00:49:57.280
you put a long funnel down its throat and put a couple of handfuls of ground

852
00:49:57.281 --> 00:49:59.040
corn in which they readily eat.

853
00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.040
It just looks like they're having food jammed in and them.
And if you,

854
00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.140
if you play footage of,
you know,

855
00:50:05.141 --> 00:50:08.710
some place in eastern Europe that is mass producing this stuff very cruelly,

856
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:13.600
there's some really terrifying footage that that makes for a very lurid picture

857
00:50:13.601 --> 00:50:16.190
of the process.
Add to that,
that French,

858
00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:20.070
if you know it's got a French name and only a bunch of uh,
you know,

859
00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:22.900
wealthy high end restaurants serve it,

860
00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:27.830
it was an easy victory for them.
It's their ultimate goal know,
but basically

861
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.770
<v 0>bolstered by their,
their victory with four gras here.</v>

862
00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:35.510
They will then be able to raise money towards the next victory,

863
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:39.590
which you know,
ultimately leads to their aim,
which is to give chickens the vote

864
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.411
is in fog.

865
00:50:42.411 --> 00:50:45.770
Why can't you get it organically where you don't force feed them isn't there?

866
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:49.040
So they say so they,
I mean they will,
they will,

867
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:52.760
they will if just let left on their own devices during a certain season.

868
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:57.790
You eat themselves into a bloated liver fattening situation for sure.

869
00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:01.700
But that's the own way to get good fog wise to do that.

870
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:04.120
That sort of force feeding cause otherwise the liver is just not,

871
00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.020
you're not grabbing this any,

872
00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.360
anyone I know in this country who sells for ground,

873
00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:12.710
their restaurant buys from one or two or three outfits,

874
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:17.810
all of which I could tell you or not people brutally grabbing animals and

875
00:51:17.811 --> 00:51:21.760
jamming this tube down her throat and that get us some cartoon cat and me and

876
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:23.540
one of those old Warner brothers cartoons,
you know,

877
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:27.260
jam and mouthful after mouthful,
as the belly expands,

878
00:51:27.261 --> 00:51:29.150
it's like two handfuls a day.

879
00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:33.860
It takes two like two seconds and uh,
it's not that bad.

880
00:51:33.861 --> 00:51:38.270
And the animals otherly otherwise live really cool,
comfortable.

881
00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.740
Luxury is lives for,
for,
you know,
in the,

882
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:44.250
in the world of poultry,
uh,

883
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:49.430
they're the aristocrats so it's really just a couple of quick glass a day and

884
00:51:49.431 --> 00:51:50.600
that's it.
Yeah.

885
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:55.280
Then like every other animal we kill lemon harvest their stuff and in this case

886
00:51:55.670 --> 00:52:00.640
their stuff has a delicious,
delicious,
smooth,
creamy,
very tasty liver.

887
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:02.360
I can't wait to try it.
You've never had it.

888
00:52:02.361 --> 00:52:04.150
Now you've got to go to this mega to Dan,
right.

889
00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:08.150
Eat twice as much that I would normally go to this brand new wine place.

890
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:12.290
So those are the people you'd have to,
you know,
does the people who get angriest,

891
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:15.620
I think there's some people that love animals more than,
than loved people.

892
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:20.300
Those people are creepy.
That does those fucking team,
animal people,

893
00:52:20.301 --> 00:52:23.600
those people that want to rescue animals from this.
There's certain people,

894
00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:28.601
their agenda is ultimately to have no animals under people like in yards,

895
00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:33.620
no animals contained,
none.
You don't own animals.
Animals have their own rights.

896
00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:34.573
And that's,

897
00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:40.160
it's such a first world form of lunacy as well.
They believe it's evolution.

898
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.360
They believe that,
you know,

899
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:46.361
we need to move past our monkey passed and we moved to a need to move past our

900
00:52:46.641 --> 00:52:49.520
carnivorous ways and embrace the ways of the plant.

901
00:52:49.521 --> 00:52:52.010
It's healthier and it's natural.

902
00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:55.040
Annuity has to get hurt and we don't have to have horrific domestic,

903
00:52:55.041 --> 00:52:58.610
but that's who likes to see animals hurt.
I mean,
we could all agree on that.

904
00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:01.520
That's true.
But you know,
if you don't shoot him,
they don't live forever.
Right?

905
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:05.750
I mean it's just getting silly.
There's a cycle of life.
It's a real simple,

906
00:53:05.751 --> 00:53:09.880
that's shit's good for you.
Stakes or when you work out,
if you work out,

907
00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.660
nothing feels better than a steak.

908
00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:15.170
And you slice into that thing and you start chewing it in the blood in your

909
00:53:15.171 --> 00:53:18.830
mouth.
Like,
Oh yeah,
that's,
you know,
this is what you needed.

910
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:23.390
This is what you're looking for.
I feel that urge often,
but you know,
it's really,

911
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:26.070
maybe every couple of months I'll get that suddenly,
you know,

912
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:30.540
I'd really like a salad
maybe every two months.

913
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:33.450
Or are you actually,
if you're in like the Czech Republic,

914
00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.600
anywhere in Eastern Europe,
basically,
uh,
for,
for more than two weeks,

915
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:39.900
really starting to think,
whoa.
Or Argentina or a gray.

916
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.590
You don't see a green vegetable for like weeks.
Why you see anything?

917
00:53:43.591 --> 00:53:47.310
It's says like pork,
pork,
more pork starch and beer.

918
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:51.930
Do you start blocking up?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Brock Lesnar,
uh,

919
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:53.910
our UFC,
a former UFC champion,

920
00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:58.920
he had to get 12 inches of his colon removed because all he ate was meat.

921
00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:03.180
Really?
Yay.
It was one of those crazy dudes who like,
wouldn't eat salads.

922
00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:06.090
He's a fucking caveman,
you know,
he's this giant gorilla.

923
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.460
He's like literally like a real viking.

924
00:54:08.461 --> 00:54:11.610
His fucking head is this big giant wrestler dude.

925
00:54:11.611 --> 00:54:15.570
He's a savage and he just ain't me.
That's all he wanted to eat in.
Want Broccoli.

926
00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:16.950
Fuck you with your Broccoli.

927
00:54:16.951 --> 00:54:20.010
He's just eating steaks and just dropping people in their heads.

928
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:21.930
Well apparently when you do that you,

929
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:26.070
if you have just too much protein it can cause something in your stomach called

930
00:54:26.071 --> 00:54:28.440
diverticulitis.
And that's what happened with him.

931
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:33.110
And ultimately getting it from curriculars,
cucumbers to this,
the seeds,
you know,

932
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.880
anything that that has semi digestible particles.

933
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:38.850
Like I think I get the seeds and cucumbers for instance,

934
00:54:38.851 --> 00:54:41.830
they see he's in cucumbers can give you diverticulitis.
Yeah,
they,

935
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:46.170
cause they sort of took off into the side there and it start to irritate this

936
00:54:46.171 --> 00:54:49.350
fat.
It's fascinating.
Turn went whoa.
Conversation.

937
00:54:49.351 --> 00:54:52.890
We're going to move our way on to ulcers in the and then,
oh,

938
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.850
this deal at working of my favorite words,

939
00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:00.360
the only reason I'm bringing up is that,
uh,
you know,
all he did was eat meat.

940
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:04.320
And I always wonder like,
that can't be good.
You know,
how do these people,
man,

941
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:08.360
civil,
look,
Jesus,
he's,
he was pissed off before now.

942
00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:13.320
Now he's lost 11 inches of colon.
12 of 12.
Yeah.
He's really pissed off.

943
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:16.610
Yeah,
no shit.
Yeah,
because you have to eat.
I mean like,

944
00:55:16.611 --> 00:55:19.260
and how do these cultures do it?
How do they get away with just eating meat?

945
00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:24.720
Broccoli?
There's no,
it's to say I think certain cultures clearly over time,

946
00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.930
um,
develop their systems around the food.
You'd be,

947
00:55:27.931 --> 00:55:32.250
you see this in the north of Canada with the,
uh,
uh,
people up there.

948
00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:36.000
They eat seal and seal fat.
They need it.
They're there.

949
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.940
And their bodies have changed because of this diet to,
to,

950
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:42.210
to adopt to this incredible coal.
I mean,

951
00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:48.690
it's the notion that people could ever be vegetarian in a place like that where

952
00:55:48.691 --> 00:55:53.220
there's not a growing thing for a thousand miles and it's like 20 below zero.

953
00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:53.731
You know,

954
00:55:53.731 --> 00:55:58.680
these people live because they shoot seals and eat their blubber and you could

955
00:55:58.681 --> 00:56:00.090
see it in their bodies.
They're,
you know,

956
00:56:00.091 --> 00:56:03.630
they're able to withstand temperatures that would kill us in hours.

957
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:08.430
Jesus Christ,
they also have some weird thing with their fingers.

958
00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:11.880
Don't get numb to have a incredible circulation in their fingers.

959
00:56:11.881 --> 00:56:14.910
They can take extreme cold that we wouldn't be able to take.

960
00:56:14.911 --> 00:56:18.900
It's like one of the things that they point to a adaptation.
It's one of the,

961
00:56:18.901 --> 00:56:23.470
like the key points of adaptations have been observed over.
It's,

962
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:24.100
it's pretty amazing.

963
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.130
<v 6>It's pretty amazing,
you know,
especially when you're,
when you feeling it.
I mean,</v>

964
00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:31.080
you know,
when,
when you feel cold like that for the first time,
you,
you,

965
00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:34.170
what's the coldest you've ever been?
That was,
that was,
what is it?

966
00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.300
What is the number?
I don't even know.
I know that if,
you know,

967
00:56:37.301 --> 00:56:41.270
stepping outside for a minute in order to have a cigarette,
uh,

968
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.850
you know,
you have to completely suit up.
It just cold.

969
00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:48.880
So penetrating that you really got to just a couple of minutes before you start

970
00:56:48.881 --> 00:56:49.750
getting hypothermic.

971
00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:56.070
I know a dude who knows a dude who lives in Alaska and the guys ACU maker makes

972
00:56:56.351 --> 00:56:59.140
pool cues lives the way the fuck up north.

973
00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:04.650
He took a bucket of hot water and threw it off his back porch and it was frozen

974
00:57:06.041 --> 00:57:10.690
before it hit the ground.
Wrap your head around that shit.

975
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:13.570
It didn't seem possible.
It is possible apparently.

976
00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:16.270
Apparently it's like 40 50 below zero.
That's what happens.

977
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:20.680
I remember a up there and we were all in our latest sort of,

978
00:57:20.681 --> 00:57:23.230
you know Everest Ready,
you know down park is,

979
00:57:23.231 --> 00:57:26.650
you know they laughed their asses off at us when,
when we got off,

980
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.120
when we got off the plane when we said,
you know,

981
00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:32.080
are we dressed well enough to go out in the canoes and they just laughed their

982
00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:33.610
asses off.
Had a slip,

983
00:57:33.611 --> 00:57:38.611
a big like Caribou smock over yourself on top of the down jackets to you know,

984
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:40.103
to,
to operate.

985
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:45.630
Fuck or all our camera's locked up like froze up and locked up within seconds of

986
00:57:46.481 --> 00:57:49.150
each other after,
I don't know,
it must have been,
maybe we shot for an hour,

987
00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.170
an hour and a half.
You know,
machinery can't handle it.

988
00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:55.320
Was that the most humbling,
uh,

989
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:57.730
feeling of nature that you've ever had while shooting the show?

990
00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.990
I'm seeing a whole family,
you know,
basically shoot a seal,

991
00:58:01.991 --> 00:58:04.870
drag it onto their kitchen floor and a tarpaulin and then everybody in the

992
00:58:04.871 --> 00:58:07.750
family,
you know,
mom,
dad,
grandma,
you know,
junior,

993
00:58:07.751 --> 00:58:10.160
they all whip out dies and start tearing this thing apart.

994
00:58:10.161 --> 00:58:11.970
And he started eating little pieces of it too.

995
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:15.700
They use the whole thing each other and it looks like it looks like night of the

996
00:58:15.701 --> 00:58:16.421
living dead.

997
00:58:16.421 --> 00:58:20.710
But it is in fact when the most sort of genuinely heartwarming times that had on

998
00:58:20.711 --> 00:58:24.600
the show.
I mean,
they're,
they're survivalists.

999
00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:29.450
They mean they're incredibly happy when they're doing this.
Um,
and,
and,

1000
00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:32.860
and juxtaposing those,
you know,
those pictures in your mind,

1001
00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.650
what are clearly a close and happy family,
uh,

1002
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:41.530
having a good time with all of this blood that's kind of takes some getting used

1003
00:58:41.531 --> 00:58:45.080
to it.
But I think when you travel a lot,
you get used to,
uh,

1004
00:58:45.790 --> 00:58:48.790
the notion that people are different,
you know,

1005
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:52.990
live in very different circumstances and people adapt to those circumstances.

1006
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:56.730
And that's just the way it is for them.
Totally.
And I think it's,
uh,

1007
00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:03.640
you know,
because because we're interested principally and food on the show,

1008
00:59:03.641 --> 00:59:08.320
I think people everywhere I've been particularly nice to us and let us see a

1009
00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:13.630
particularly,
um,
I dunno,
a side of their personalities,

1010
00:59:13.631 --> 00:59:14.650
aside of their cultures that are,

1011
00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:19.060
I think a lot of other hard journalists don't get to see people's defenses are

1012
00:59:19.061 --> 00:59:20.320
down.
You know,
they don't,
they don't,

1013
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:25.070
they're less likely to put up a front or be someone other than who they really

1014
00:59:25.071 --> 00:59:28.640
are.
You know,
over the table.
You know,
right away a break bread with somebody,

1015
00:59:28.641 --> 00:59:31.880
you drink the local drink,
whatever it is you eat,
whatever's offered.

1016
00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:33.200
You try to be a good guest.

1017
00:59:33.201 --> 00:59:36.570
I think you're going to connect with people over food in a way that you could.

1018
00:59:36.571 --> 00:59:40.580
And if you're just some guy with a microphone and a camera,
people,

1019
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.680
cameras and things,
you know,
changes a situation.

1020
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.580
Uh,

1021
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:51.230
but the fact that w w a I travel largely on my stomach,

1022
00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:55.520
I think is me.
Uh,
uh,
you know,
like I said,
an advantage.

1023
00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:01.430
What a fucking crazy when I lived in.
That's fascinating.

1024
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:08.210
We even did you was a Brazil the last USC.
I didn't go to that one.
Yeah,

1025
01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.370
that was filming fear factor.
So I stayed home.

1026
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:14.840
I couldn't afford to take the four days off.
It's good food down there in Brazil.

1027
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.950
Rio,
I've been to South Palo.
I went to a real to Haas Korea and South Paulo.

1028
01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.070
Pretty bad ass.
Yeah.
Like photo or chow,

1029
01:00:22.071 --> 01:00:26.180
but they had a lot more organs in Brazil to eat a lot of chicken hearts and

1030
01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:30.800
things along those lines.
Chicken livers.
The big meal is fish water.

1031
01:00:30.801 --> 01:00:33.110
The whole country does it.
It was water.
It's,

1032
01:00:33.111 --> 01:00:38.111
it's basically a big stew of who's in stouts and black beans and it's really

1033
01:00:38.721 --> 01:00:42.830
delicious.
And it's,
it came originally from slave food.
It was the,

1034
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:46.630
the scraps from the table of the wealthy Portuguese that,
uh,

1035
01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:51.680
their slaves would collect and try to make into something edible or even

1036
01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:55.800
delicious.
And over time they created this dish that,
that uh,
you know,

1037
01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:59.930
it was the food of the very poor at one point.
Now it's like the national dish.

1038
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.340
Everybody in Brazil at one point or another Saturday invite the family over and

1039
01:01:04.341 --> 01:01:08.450
you sit around eating this huge,
huge amounts of fetch water and getting really,

1040
01:01:08.451 --> 01:01:10.350
really,
really fucked up on Kinshasa.

1041
01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:15.230
W the episode that you had in Brazil was really wild when you were at that fish

1042
01:01:15.231 --> 01:01:20.060
market and as he's fucking alien fish that they're all eating that is lucky at

1043
01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:22.430
their mean you're,
you know,
that's freshwater fishing or that you're in water,

1044
01:01:22.431 --> 01:01:26.990
the depth of a rice patty,
you know,
I mean three feet of water and you'll,

1045
01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:31.220
you're driving around and you're looking at basically rice patty deep water to

1046
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:35.960
left DC,
a 500 pound freshwater fish,
you know,
breaking the surface.

1047
01:01:35.961 --> 01:01:37.700
It's wild.

1048
01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:41.540
I mean there are all of these fishing and creatures and uh,
and,

1049
01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.810
and fruits and vegetables down there that never make it out of that area.

1050
01:01:44.811 --> 01:01:49.340
So it's really a
ingredient wise,
it's really another planet.

1051
01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:52.460
Yeah,
I would imagine.
So.
I really,
I,
like I said,

1052
01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:55.520
I didn't get to eat much interesting food.
I was there.

1053
01:01:55.521 --> 01:01:58.880
I was there for the World Jujitsu championships in 2003 so I was only there for

1054
01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.490
a couple of days,
but uh,

1055
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.920
we did go to the supermarket and get these fucking alien looking fruits.

1056
01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:05.630
Like I had never even seen him before.

1057
01:02:05.631 --> 01:02:07.970
Never heard of him and no idea what the fuck it was.

1058
01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.540
I just picked up a bunch of different ones that weird seeds in them and strange

1059
01:02:11.541 --> 01:02:15.890
flavors and it's a great country,
great food,
great culture.

1060
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.220
It's a wild country.
People are,
people are really nice.

1061
01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:23.260
<v 4>They're the country that figured out fighting.
They figured it out.</v>

1062
01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:26.510
There was a lot of confusion as to how to fight correctly.
It's,

1063
01:02:26.511 --> 01:02:29.590
the Brazilians were really one of the first to really figure it out.

1064
01:02:29.591 --> 01:02:31.630
They put the first big piece to the puzzle.

1065
01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.530
Jujitsu put the first big piece where everybody was like,
Whoa,
okay,
this,
this,

1066
01:02:35.531 --> 01:02:37.480
you got to know this because if you don't know this,

1067
01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:39.430
they're going to grab you and they're going to break your shit.

1068
01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.540
It's really sample.
So the,

1069
01:02:40.541 --> 01:02:44.860
the Brazilian guys just revamp the whole system and then wrestlers came along

1070
01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:46.550
and kickboxers and then people realize he,

1071
01:02:46.551 --> 01:02:49.180
you have to have really a full arsenal of techniques.

1072
01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:52.840
But if you don't have a full arsenal of techniques,
if you just had one,

1073
01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:54.940
two is probably one of the best ones to have.

1074
01:02:54.941 --> 01:02:58.180
And the Brazilians were the ones who figured that out.
Now when it came to,

1075
01:02:58.181 --> 01:02:59.770
if you didn't know back in the day,

1076
01:02:59.771 --> 01:03:02.650
nobody knew everything cause it never was anything like the ultimate fighting

1077
01:03:02.651 --> 01:03:05.740
championship.
So there's never an opportunity to see what was better than,
no,

1078
01:03:05.741 --> 01:03:09.040
it was just speculative.
Is it better to be a boxer as a better to be a wrestler?

1079
01:03:09.041 --> 01:03:11.230
Who the fuck knows it just nobody really knew.

1080
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:14.980
But the Brazilians came along and they figured out that if you only know one

1081
01:03:14.981 --> 01:03:19.060
thing,
he should know how to choke people.
Cause fights usually scramble the,

1082
01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:20.620
you know,
you're in a bar,
you fall,

1083
01:03:20.621 --> 01:03:23.380
you're on the ground that you should know how to strangle the guy once you go to

1084
01:03:23.381 --> 01:03:27.050
the ground.
That's a wild culture to figure that out,
man.
You know,

1085
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:31.060
<v 6>I love it.
It's,
it's,
it's,
you know,
reos.
Awesome.</v>

1086
01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:35.060
I like El Salvador Bahia and the in the north,
uh,

1087
01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:38.860
that's sort of the African heartland of Brazil and it's where the food is sorta

1088
01:03:38.861 --> 01:03:43.520
s spiciest and richest and most interesting.
You know,
it,

1089
01:03:43.521 --> 01:03:47.080
it just,
there's no culture like it on earth.

1090
01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:51.310
Aside from the fighting.
It is.
I don't know how anyone could actually,

1091
01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:54.330
I don't understand how money works or wants to work,
you know,

1092
01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:58.680
when you get used to that,
just hearing that music,
you know,

1093
01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.230
being in a country that beautiful food,
that good,

1094
01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.290
everybody in their country looks like,
uh,
you know,

1095
01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:09.550
attractive or not everybody in Brazil seems to look like they either just got

1096
01:04:09.551 --> 01:04:12.460
laid and they're coming from getting laid or they're on their way to getting

1097
01:04:12.461 --> 01:04:13.294
laid.

1098
01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:19.320
It's going to the beach in Brazil.

1099
01:04:19.321 --> 01:04:23.690
This is amazing because you see people of every size,
every hue,

1100
01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.900
um,
you just kind of,
the beach,

1101
01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.840
the beach culture is,
it's,
it's so awesome.
And there's no,

1102
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:32.920
I don't think there's any country where,
uh,

1103
01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:36.510
people love seem to like music and dance as,
as ferociously.

1104
01:04:36.511 --> 01:04:40.980
It's really tough to not dance in Brazil because everybody seems to,

1105
01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:46.230
wow.
So is that your favorite country?
Not there.
No,
but,
but uh,

1106
01:04:46.231 --> 01:04:48.820
it is,
it is one of my favorite countries.
There's something really,

1107
01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:53.740
really awesome about Brazil.
What's your
favorite?
I don't know.

1108
01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.330
Spain.
Spain's really awesome.

1109
01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.960
You know that Spain was where you were at that restaurant,
was it El Bulli?

1110
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:03.840
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah,
but just about anywhere in Spain is this is,

1111
01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:06.840
this is going to be a special place with great food and it's going to be

1112
01:05:06.841 --> 01:05:10.470
beautiful.
Um,
Vietnam I love,
you know,

1113
01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.790
I think that Vietnam resembles all of the places I dreamed about,
you know,

1114
01:05:14.791 --> 01:05:18.070
and I was a little boy.
Really.
The exotic,

1115
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.680
the exotic east,
well,
you know,
there is that,

1116
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:25.300
that the decaying French aspect,
uh,

1117
01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.750
the indigenous Vietnamese,
that,

1118
01:05:27.751 --> 01:05:32.320
that whole part of the world looks to me particularly beautiful.

1119
01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:35.610
And uh,
they,
they like food in a way that,

1120
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:40.140
that I find very sympathetic.
They're passionate about it.

1121
01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:41.723
<v 7>Uh,</v>

1122
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:47.120
<v 6>so Vietnam,
this dot,
that's going to be a sentimental favorite as well.
Wow.</v>

1123
01:05:47.121 --> 01:05:50.420
So Vietnam?
No,
numero uno.
Huh.
Wow.

1124
01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.440
But you could do worse than you know,
to,
you know,

1125
01:05:54.441 --> 01:05:58.190
to Keel over after we're really good meal to eat or die with a big hunk of pork

1126
01:05:58.191 --> 01:06:00.650
in your mouth in Spain would not be a bad way to go out.

1127
01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:06.440
Anybody that doesn't appreciate the idea of cooking as an art form should watch

1128
01:06:06.441 --> 01:06:10.910
that show on El Bulli.
Is that,
how am I saying?
Oh boy.
Yeah.
Oh boy.
Yay Dad.

1129
01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.400
That guy.
Wow.
What a fucking wizard.

1130
01:06:13.401 --> 01:06:18.401
That guy is so really intensely creative chef that had this small restaurant in

1131
01:06:19.131 --> 01:06:22.300
Spain as well.
I mean it was,
it was basically,

1132
01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:26.030
it was considered the best restaurant in the world for,
for a long time.

1133
01:06:26.031 --> 01:06:30.680
It's certainly he was a guy way out in front of everybody else.
Uh,
yeah,

1134
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:34.130
that was some good food porn.
We did.
And I think that was a show.
And really,

1135
01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:36.100
you know,

1136
01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.230
every once in a while we get an opportunity to do a show that might actually

1137
01:06:39.231 --> 01:06:42.640
mean something in a few years.
And,
and uh,
we,
we shots,

1138
01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:47.600
I think we shot some history with that show because the restaurant closed the

1139
01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.530
same night.
I think that we aired the show or,
or close to it.
And uh,

1140
01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:55.390
you know,
that is,
that was,
that's a true artist and uh,

1141
01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:59.230
it was a limited period of time and that era is over and we managed to get it
on,

1142
01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:02.510
on,
on tape.
So that's something I'm really proud of it.

1143
01:07:02.511 --> 01:07:06.290
I was confused as to what he was doing afterwards.
He was talking about you.

1144
01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:10.310
So he's going to start a foundation pulled together.
It's a think tank.

1145
01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.300
Essentially.

1146
01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:14.960
He's a creative space where people from all over the world can talk to each

1147
01:07:14.961 --> 01:07:17.030
other or meet,
come up with new ideas.

1148
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:18.560
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1149
01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:22.580
<v 6>Hmm.
Trippy.
Very trippy.
Because,
you know,
I,
I have to be honest,</v>

1150
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.300
until I watched your show,
I never thought of food as an art form.

1151
01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:29.370
I always thought of food as a,
you know,
well,
there,

1152
01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:31.080
I think your instincts are right.
Uh,

1153
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:35.690
I think there are maybe two or three people in the world who I would say,

1154
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.410
you know,

1155
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:40.820
who are shifts maybe two or three chefs in the world who you could honestly say

1156
01:07:40.821 --> 01:07:45.440
they're artists as opposed to really talented craftsmen.
I mean,
artists,
you know,

1157
01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:49.520
somebody who's creating something completely different than anybody else.

1158
01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:53.030
It doesn't have to absolutely be completely different because it's almost just

1159
01:07:53.031 --> 01:07:57.080
doing it really well and with attention to detail and like that.

1160
01:07:57.081 --> 01:08:00.400
That is art.
It does come through when you have a,
a big,

1161
01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:03.020
there's a difference between the people who designed the great cathedrals of

1162
01:08:03.021 --> 01:08:07.160
Europe and the people who built them.
People have built them or some of the,

1163
01:08:07.161 --> 01:08:09.610
probably the,
some of the greatest craftsman,
you know,

1164
01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:12.290
in the history of the world.
Uh,
but they were just doctor,

1165
01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:16.160
we're working within an established hierarchy.
They

1166
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.690
<v 0>were about doing the same thing again and again and again.
Exactly the same.</v>

1167
01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:25.850
Um,
I just don't think there are that many people who,
if the bent for me,

1168
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:28.940
the benchmark has Ferran Adria at Elbulli and this was a guy who was like

1169
01:08:28.941 --> 01:08:31.850
Charlie Parker or Jimi Hendrix.
You know,

1170
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:37.130
nobody had ever made sounds out of a guitar before.
Like Jimi Hendrix,
you know,

1171
01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:39.470
no one had ever made sounds out of a horn.

1172
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.050
Like Charlie Parker were unique to history.

1173
01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:46.430
There aren't a lot of people who will ever be that good or that different.
Um,

1174
01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:47.400
Ferran Adria is,

1175
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:52.400
is like those guys that's so that's the high watermark for you.

1176
01:08:52.401 --> 01:08:56.600
So there's only a few guys like that that just really are paving a path and

1177
01:08:56.601 --> 01:09:00.940
doing their own.
What do we,
what do we do now?
Closed his restaurant was,

1178
01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.790
it was true traumatizing for,
I think for a lot of pieces.

1179
01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:07.790
He looked at the Michael Jordan of chefs sees the peak of the hill.
Right?

1180
01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:12.830
He's the Bruce Lee of chefs,
the Bruce Lee and Michael Jordan together.

1181
01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:16.370
Wow.
Yeah.
With a little bit of Dalai Lama.
Who else has left?

1182
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:19.680
How many guys are left true artists?
I don't know.

1183
01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.040
I wouldn't even like to think about it.
I know there's somebody out.

1184
01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:25.820
This is a small handfuls that I've probably,
you know,

1185
01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:30.520
it's probably someone who's food I've eaten and I had just stumped too stupid to

1186
01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:34.280
have recognized that it was historic and great.
Well,
even the craftsman,

1187
01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:36.590
even if you just recreate and classic dishes,

1188
01:09:36.591 --> 01:09:40.430
I don't give a fuck when someone's really good at it.
It comes through as an art.

1189
01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.130
I see what you're saying.
And they might not be the innovators,

1190
01:09:43.131 --> 01:09:45.400
they might not be at the head of the,
you know,
there,

1191
01:09:45.401 --> 01:09:48.340
there are a lot of really great innovative chefs out there,
but art,
you know,

1192
01:09:48.341 --> 01:09:52.310
and I said,
I'll see you Saturday,
you know,
high standard for the Costco here,

1193
01:09:52.311 --> 01:09:56.810
right?
Yeah.
Well I'm a fucking comedian when we call comedy art,
you know,

1194
01:09:56.811 --> 01:10:00.320
some people would call this the art of podcasting.
It gets ridiculous.
I will,

1195
01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:03.770
I will,
I will go to my grave without having created any art.

1196
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:06.290
I'm pretty damn sure.
Oh Wow.

1197
01:10:06.291 --> 01:10:08.960
You think that that's funny cause I think your book is all right man.

1198
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:10.490
I don't think that's hard.
You start,

1199
01:10:10.491 --> 01:10:12.440
if you start talking about yourself like that,
you know,

1200
01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:15.430
then you start talking about yourself in the third person and after that there's

1201
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.130
really often nothing left to do.
But you get arrested.
Like,
you know,

1202
01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.570
having beaten the transsexual hooker to death,
you know,

1203
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:23.510
it's beautiful that you think like that.
That's why you're you man.

1204
01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.240
It's a beautiful way to think that is the road to madness.
And,
and,
uh,

1205
01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.660
incarceration can,

1206
01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:32.900
talking about yourself as an artist stepping back and you know,
as an artist,

1207
01:10:32.901 --> 01:10:35.930
I feel as an artist,
you know,

1208
01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:40.520
ever since I've been writing books as an artist,
yeah.
That's,
it's,
it's,

1209
01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:42.530
I don't really see,
I don't see what I do.

1210
01:10:42.531 --> 01:10:47.531
Anything that I do is essentially that much different than standing on a,

1211
01:10:47.601 --> 01:10:52.100
on a,
on a line and one of one chef or cook among many,
you know,
making food.

1212
01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:52.930
You know,

1213
01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:57.560
you're presumably your building something or making something as best you can.

1214
01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:01.400
You're showing up at work on time,
doing the best job you can and you're,

1215
01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:06.440
hopefully you're having fun doing it.
Um,
you know,
and so,

1216
01:11:06.441 --> 01:11:08.190
so there aren't that different.
I don't see one.

1217
01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:10.990
It started telling stories on television or talking about yourself,
a television.

1218
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.230
I see it as being essentially any different,
certainly no better than,
you know,

1219
01:11:15.231 --> 01:11:18.750
I'm actually working for a living.
Right.
I see what you're saying.

1220
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:23.640
That you are one of those guys that you know,
you could just be,

1221
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.560
anyone could know you as that guy that you work with or the grace personalities.

1222
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.250
Funny likes to talk shit about things.
Kind of an interesting guy.
You know,

1223
01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:35.860
he could be a TV star,
somebody just put a camera on them,
please.

1224
01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:39.420
Guy Needs his own reality show,
you know?
I mean,
how many,

1225
01:11:39.421 --> 01:11:42.290
how many people do you know like that?
I've,
I've known thousands of mine.

1226
01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:44.520
My friend Johnny being I used to,

1227
01:11:44.970 --> 01:11:48.000
my best friend was a professional pool hustlers,
halfway homeless.

1228
01:11:48.001 --> 01:11:51.270
I was sleeping on my couch on people's couches and he's a genius.

1229
01:11:51.271 --> 01:11:53.490
He could throw math problems out of him.
He would recreate them.

1230
01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:58.350
The guy like that would make a great reality show.
I think the,
if,

1231
01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.010
if television has taught us anything,
it's that,
you know,

1232
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:05.020
complete mediocrity is enough to have,
uh,
you know,

1233
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:08.810
you're on a reality show and you know,
it's,

1234
01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:12.060
it's all about your willingness to play ball.
You know,

1235
01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:14.040
you look at this kid's on Jersey shore,
you know,

1236
01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:17.020
does this situation like drive a Bentley to work,
you know,

1237
01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.370
and then he's got to sleep on a cot with a bunch of other boneheads who he
hates,

1238
01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:25.770
you know,
you know what I mean?
Is that really how the show works?

1239
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:30.760
They all hang out together
during shooting season.

1240
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:33.250
The rest,
you know,
I mean,
no,
the rest of it,

1241
01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.640
he's not taking a moped home at this point.

1242
01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:39.210
The way I look at him as like good for him,
you know,

1243
01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.080
what else would they be doing?
I see this as a,
as a,
as a Greek tragedy actually.

1244
01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:47.020
You know,
it really,
I mean,
you know,
the,

1245
01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.690
the whole dynamic has showed that they're trying hard.
They,
they,

1246
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:53.490
they buy now they know that they know the charitable rules of television.

1247
01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:57.090
You know,
it's not about looking good.
They got that early on,
you know,

1248
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:59.430
but now it's just,
they know how to play ball.

1249
01:12:59.431 --> 01:13:01.700
I got a good thing and they got a good gig and,
uh,
and,

1250
01:13:01.701 --> 01:13:04.380
and they're milking it for as long as they can,

1251
01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.810
but look at the real housewives chain,
you know,
it's like,

1252
01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:10.920
does anyone go on the real housewives thinking that they're going to look good?

1253
01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:16.050
It's not what the show's about.
It's about making people sitting on couches with,

1254
01:13:16.051 --> 01:13:18.840
uh,
you know,
you know,
bag of chips saying,
man,

1255
01:13:18.841 --> 01:13:21.270
those people are even way more fucked up than me.

1256
01:13:21.271 --> 01:13:25.320
And what have they done to their faces?
I mean,
who buys that?
Look up those lips.

1257
01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:28.260
Why Cumin has lifts like that.
And that's the chicken.

1258
01:13:28.261 --> 01:13:30.000
Her husband just committed suicide.

1259
01:13:30.001 --> 01:13:32.380
And then as business partner committed suicide too.

1260
01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:38.340
So everyone's saying it's all about showing up for work every day,

1261
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:41.310
knowing that your job is to,
you know,
I need everyone.

1262
01:13:41.311 --> 01:13:44.700
Watches will feel better about themselves,
you know,
and be snickering at me.

1263
01:13:44.701 --> 01:13:45.240
And it was mad.

1264
01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:49.680
My cartoonish behavior is fascinating that the trend of reality television took

1265
01:13:49.681 --> 01:13:53.520
off.
But this idea of just following housewives are following guys driving on

1266
01:13:53.521 --> 01:13:54.700
slippery roads.
Yeah.

1267
01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:59.130
Ice Road truckers is a show about driving on a slippery road.
How silly is that?

1268
01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:02.230
You know,
there's auction shows and all these,
you know,

1269
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:04.680
I don't know if it's the worst thing that ever happened in history or the,

1270
01:14:04.681 --> 01:14:08.460
or the best.
You know,
I,
I,
it's weird,
you know,

1271
01:14:08.461 --> 01:14:11.880
I don't think it's worst or the best,
but it's definitely weird.
Like,
so,
I mean,

1272
01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:13.750
I do watch some of those shows.
Like Jersey shore,

1273
01:14:13.751 --> 01:14:17.530
I can watch only about 10 minutes of it before it just by Bible starts to

1274
01:14:17.531 --> 01:14:20.530
explode.
You know,
it's just too much.
It's just too,

1275
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.690
too horrifying and yet fascinating,
you know?

1276
01:14:23.691 --> 01:14:25.620
So I'm good for 10 minutes of figure.

1277
01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:30.220
This is the greatest show that ever existed a after,
which I just,
I can't,

1278
01:14:30.221 --> 01:14:33.070
it's too painful.
I mean,
while that's pretty watered down,
you know,

1279
01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:36.280
as far as like the,
the,
the low level behavior of this country.

1280
01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:39.610
Have you seen the wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia now,

1281
01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.550
Johnny Knoxville documentary?
He got to see it.
It's awesome.

1282
01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:47.260
So few of these shows have really any,
any relationship to reality at all.

1283
01:14:47.261 --> 01:14:50.520
I've created this alternate reality where we'll people are behaving like,

1284
01:14:50.521 --> 01:14:54.190
you know,
soap,
the soap opera freaks that they're expected to behave like,
and,

1285
01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:59.080
and so your complicity in this whole terrible process of,
you know,

1286
01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:04.510
public self humiliation.
Uh,
that's kind of fascinating.
Well,
not only that,

1287
01:15:04.511 --> 01:15:08.710
that they also have to,
they do these fake tasks like things happen.
Oh No,

1288
01:15:08.711 --> 01:15:12.130
we got to get down to DMV.
I'm going to lose my license.
Sure you are.

1289
01:15:12.131 --> 01:15:14.020
What the fuck are you talking about?
Like this is like,

1290
01:15:14.021 --> 01:15:17.800
they orchestrate fake drama on fake things about,
I'm waiting for the day,

1291
01:15:17.801 --> 01:15:20.770
you know that,
you know,
I get the phone call from an agency and you know,

1292
01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.730
we really think celebrity rehab is a good career move right now.

1293
01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:26.850
You know that says something about it.

1294
01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:31.510
What point does this scene strategically like a good career move?

1295
01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:35.470
You know,
Celebrity Rehab?
Yeah,
you gotta be pretty fucked up.

1296
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:39.460
Especially if you're Eric Roberts and you're just,
it's just weed that would,

1297
01:15:39.461 --> 01:15:42.550
that guy was the weirdest one because he got on celebrity rehab cause he said he

1298
01:15:42.551 --> 01:15:46.660
was having a problem with weed and then everybody else has shaken like a leaf

1299
01:15:46.661 --> 01:15:49.180
thrown up and says he's having coffee,

1300
01:15:49.181 --> 01:15:51.370
reading the papers and say this is nothing wrong with them.

1301
01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.950
You don't need to be here man.
Yeah,
but he knows the drill though.

1302
01:15:53.951 --> 01:15:56.540
He's got to have at least one freak out during the season.
Right?

1303
01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:00.820
Is that what it is?
Don't.
Those are generally the rules of,
you know,
get a bonus.

1304
01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:04.360
You're,
you're,
he's just thinking Cha Ching,
Cha Ching,
wells Fargo.

1305
01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:08.050
That's one of the most disturbing shows.
Celebrity Rehab.
Very,
very,

1306
01:16:08.051 --> 01:16:10.870
very disturbing.
Hard to watch.
Wouldn't you be depressed though?

1307
01:16:10.871 --> 01:16:15.220
Like if your agent calls you up and said,
listen,
Joe got a great offer,

1308
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:18.380
celebrity rehab,
you're like,
wow,
what does it say about me?
I would,

1309
01:16:18.381 --> 01:16:21.130
I would like go in the bathroom and stare in the mirror for really long time

1310
01:16:21.131 --> 01:16:26.080
saying,
what have I done?
What have I done?

1311
01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.760
That's why it's good to have friends back home where you're like freaking out

1312
01:16:29.761 --> 01:16:32.590
too much.
Oh my God,
I'm drinking too much.
But you do,
uh,

1313
01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.690
week we've got wasted last night.
Blacked out Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday.
Oh God.

1314
01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:40.120
Right.
In their mind,
I'm fine.
Art Market Research has shown us that,
you know,

1315
01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:43.930
audiences really want more footage of you vomiting.
Yeah.
Well,

1316
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:45.350
speaking of vomiting,
man,
do you,

1317
01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:49.120
you had that one episode where you took Iowasca yeah,
it was,
it was that legit.

1318
01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:54.250
Yeah.
I didn't,
you know,
I've taken a lot of LSD or early on in my life,

1319
01:16:54.251 --> 01:16:58.960
so by the time I took Iowasca for the first time,
um,
so I was like kind of,

1320
01:16:59.050 --> 01:16:59.621
it was,
for me,

1321
01:16:59.621 --> 01:17:02.110
it was kind of like ecstasy in the sense that I'm sitting around waiting to get

1322
01:17:02.111 --> 01:17:06.820
off.
It didn't work.
It did,
but it was a big deal.
You know,
Lsd,

1323
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:10.280
now that's a drug,
you know,
things like that was my,
that was my,

1324
01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.570
<v 4>that was my experience.</v>

1325
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:14.840
I think you got some low level shit and sometimes they do that.

1326
01:17:14.841 --> 01:17:18.470
I've always heard that from the Iowa scarecrows that they watered down the stuff

1327
01:17:18.471 --> 01:17:19.640
they give to the gringos.

1328
01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:21.950
They don't want anybody going crazy running through the woods,

1329
01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:25.490
seeing dragons flying fucking serpents and Ufo shows and shit.

1330
01:17:25.491 --> 01:17:29.510
But everybody that I know that's taken it,
it's taken legit doses,

1331
01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:33.530
has had crazy psychedelic Vishy.
I mean,
I went in to the experience,
you know,

1332
01:17:33.531 --> 01:17:37.400
it's just cottage cottage.
It's a shack up on stilts as I recall,

1333
01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:40.880
out in the middle of the jungle and Amazon were like four hours,

1334
01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:43.100
six hours by boat from any place

1335
01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.880
<v 6>like resembling a place with a hospital.
Um,</v>

1336
01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:49.720
no lights.
Um,

1337
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:53.470
so I went into the experience with the expectation that it would be like the

1338
01:17:53.471 --> 01:17:56.300
book,
why would be crawling around naked in the jungle,
you know,

1339
01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.130
shitting and puking for six hours before I discovered my spirit animal.

1340
01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:05.740
<v 3>So this is what I thought it was going into.
Um,
honestly,
I mean,
you know,</v>

1341
01:18:05.741 --> 01:18:07.870
I got off the seriously.
Uh,
but,

1342
01:18:07.871 --> 01:18:12.871
but it wasn't like acid [inaudible] a week dose.

1343
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:17.900
Yeah.
I mean I gather,
you know,
I didn't shit myself,
so it was win,
win.
Know

1344
01:18:20.170 --> 01:18:24.220
how deep are you in the ass and like many heads or were you a one or two or did

1345
01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:26.530
you like w because I used to hang out with guys would be like,

1346
01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.250
I took 11 hits and I'm like,
no,
I was done with these guys.
You'd sit around like,

1347
01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:33.850
you know,
take it too much.
I mean,
they know when it's enough,
right?

1348
01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:37.720
You make your mushrooms in a result into Arizona first or do you do anything

1349
01:18:37.721 --> 01:18:42.160
fancy?
Oh,
back in the day we did a marinade.
The mushrooms in honey,

1350
01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:44.230
I think we met already did them at honey overnight

1351
01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:48.860
<v 6>or longer and then wouldn't mix it in what big pot of hot tea and the whole</v>

1352
01:18:48.861 --> 01:18:49.694
kitchen would be

1353
01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:54.380
<v 3>drinking this tea
and honey.
That's how I make it a tea.</v>

1354
01:18:54.381 --> 01:18:57.440
That's my new thing.
I'm not suggesting you do that.
We did it.

1355
01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:59.690
That's what they use to use to preserve

1356
01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:03.240
<v 4>mushrooms back in the daddy.
Yeah.
They used to preserve them and honey,</v>

1357
01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.140
they would a dry mop and preserving them in honey and they believe that that's

1358
01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:07.741
one of,

1359
01:19:07.741 --> 01:19:11.490
that's one of the ways that people started getting into alcohol because honey

1360
01:19:11.491 --> 01:19:14.340
can ferment and become mead and that,
you know,

1361
01:19:14.341 --> 01:19:16.500
that eventually like this is like one,

1362
01:19:16.501 --> 01:19:20.580
a Terence Mckenna's theories that people went from being an intoxicant oriented

1363
01:19:20.581 --> 01:19:24.190
like with psychedelic mushrooms to alcohol oriented and that somehow another

1364
01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:28.740
fuck society up.
And at one time we got along way better.
He has this,
uh,

1365
01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:30.010
I got a great hit,
right?

1366
01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:34.220
<v 6>History.
Actually it,
I was,
I was reading about coffee lately.
You know,</v>

1367
01:19:34.221 --> 01:19:37.190
that when they first the first coffee houses in England,
uh,

1368
01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.510
we're quickly declared illegal by the,
by the government.

1369
01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:46.550
They saw these as hotbeds of sedition and they closed them down.
Why?

1370
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:48.740
Because up until that point in history,

1371
01:19:48.741 --> 01:19:53.741
most Europeans and most people in England would wake up in the morning and drink

1372
01:19:54.351 --> 01:19:57.890
mead.
That's all they drank all day long.
It was basically,
you know,
crude beer,

1373
01:19:57.950 --> 01:20:01.790
homemade beer.
Um,
so up until this point in history,

1374
01:20:01.791 --> 01:20:03.860
when people started drinking coffee in these coffee houses,

1375
01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:08.820
everybody in Europe could be counted on to be fucked up all day long.

1376
01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:13.230
<v 0>So nobody's said coffee houses with the first place in Europe where people would</v>

1377
01:20:13.231 --> 01:20:17.190
sit around in a state of sobriety and,
and it's 10 people tend to do that.

1378
01:20:17.191 --> 01:20:19.650
You know,
when you're sober,
you noticed shit.
And they were like,
Hey,

1379
01:20:19.651 --> 01:20:22.950
have you noticed her governments?
Like really fucking us.
So

1380
01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:26.190
the government was right,
of course,

1381
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:29.820
because of these was the first time that people were actually drinking a

1382
01:20:29.821 --> 01:20:32.460
beverage and hanging out and in with their wits about them.

1383
01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:35.700
And that was seen as a really dangerous thing.
Food for thought.

1384
01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:38.520
That's fascinating.
Well,

1385
01:20:38.521 --> 01:20:41.220
that's exactly what's going on with marijuana in this country.

1386
01:20:41.221 --> 01:20:43.580
They're trying to keep that away from people.
The good,

1387
01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:46.710
good percentage of it is they're worried about people waking up.

1388
01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:49.290
They're worried about,
well,
if I was like,
you know,

1389
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.180
if I was president and wanted to be like reelected for a visit,

1390
01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:54.120
if it was a really bad precedent or,
or,

1391
01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:59.100
or I'd want people to smoke marijuana,
uh,
you know,

1392
01:20:59.190 --> 01:21:03.020
basically who spoke,
who spoke weed or generally we're talking,

1393
01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:08.460
yeah.
Everybody in California.
Everybody.
Yeah.
But people who,
you mean back home,

1394
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:12.720
every correlation between smoking and voting,
frequency of voting.

1395
01:21:12.721 --> 01:21:15.540
That's what I'm wondering.
Do people like,

1396
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:19.130
is there a huge I flake factor?
Oh,
for sure.
You know,

1397
01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:23.090
it's like some comedian was talking about this,
I don't know who did it.

1398
01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:27.740
It was the whole,
the whole bit of,
uh,
uh,
why,

1399
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:28.800
why it's ever been,

1400
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:33.600
we will never be voted in as legal because all the most fervent supporters will

1401
01:21:33.601 --> 01:21:37.740
forget to show up.
Yeah,
right.
I don't know who said it,
but it was really funny.

1402
01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:42.990
Yeah,
that is true.
A good percentage.
Well,
you know,
my,
my take on the,

1403
01:21:42.991 --> 01:21:45.120
the,
the amount of potheads that are useless.

1404
01:21:45.121 --> 01:21:47.820
It's just like my take on the amount of regular people that are useless.

1405
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:50.790
There's a certain percentage,
whether it's 20 or 30,

1406
01:21:50.791 --> 01:21:54.720
or if you're pessimistic up to 50% of people that are just fucking useless.

1407
01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.810
And it doesn't matter if you give him marijuana,

1408
01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.860
it doesn't matter if you get them drunk,
they're just,

1409
01:21:58.910 --> 01:22:02.790
they're just low watt brains to change the law,

1410
01:22:02.791 --> 01:22:05.460
you'd need 100% turnout.
That's going to be tough.

1411
01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:08.490
But I've had some people that I know that have,
uh,

1412
01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:12.630
gotten to pot like late in life and it's completely changed the way they look at

1413
01:22:12.631 --> 01:22:15.810
things like for the better,
you know,
it helps them only be like,
look,
you haven't,

1414
01:22:15.811 --> 01:22:19.490
Smith didn't start smoking weed until three years ago.
You look at me,

1415
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:22.410
I got to get to get a lot of public figures out there who would probably have

1416
01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.980
benefited from early use of psychedelics.
And unquestionably,
I mean,

1417
01:22:25.981 --> 01:22:28.770
Steve Jobs always talks about that,
that,
you know,
one of the,
uh,

1418
01:22:28.771 --> 01:22:32.640
the most powerful experiences and his life was tripping on acid.

1419
01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:36.480
I think some would respond well.
I think John Mccain would,
would,
would,
would be,

1420
01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:38.350
uh,
different in,

1421
01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:41.520
in more interesting person if he'd done acid at some point in his life.
Oh,

1422
01:22:41.521 --> 01:22:45.410
for sure.
For sure.
And it wouldn't be so scared he would have a weekend.
Now,

1423
01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:46.510
others I'd be worried about.

1424
01:22:46.570 --> 01:22:50.820
I would be very worried about giving Michele Bachmann ass some squeaky Fromme

1425
01:22:50.821 --> 01:22:54.390
shit right there would be worried about giving her husband acid,
oh,

1426
01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.970
Massad and Viagra and then run.

1427
01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:01.110
But I would like to do acid with Bill Clinton.
Did you know,

1428
01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:04.020
you know who Michelle Bachmann as you know what we're talking about?

1429
01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:07.050
And they said,
I'd be shocking the way Bill Clinton hadn't done it.
Oh No,

1430
01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:10.380
he must've done it yesterday.
He's still there.
Yeah.
That was all that nonsense.

1431
01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:15.520
He didn't inhale.
It was back in the day.
But you,
you know,
after his,

1432
01:23:15.521 --> 01:23:17.470
I did not have sex with that woman.
All that.

1433
01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:20.650
I did not inhale really lost a lot of weight.
Yeah.

1434
01:23:20.651 --> 01:23:23.750
I'll never forgive him for that actually.
Just,
you know,
I don't care,
you know,

1435
01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:26.620
everything that he was accused of feel like I'm pretty okay with.

1436
01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:30.730
Treat me like an idiot though.
Yeah.
I really found on forgivable,
you know,

1437
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.500
I really found that despicable and could never really never forget I did not

1438
01:23:35.501 --> 01:23:40.360
have sex.
You know,
tragically Steph says,

1439
01:23:40.361 --> 01:23:40.700
what,

1440
01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:45.700
what I understand a sexual relations is what I understand the term to be

1441
01:23:46.050 --> 01:23:49.600
uncommon for me.
It's unforgivable.
Yeah.
It's uh,

1442
01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:53.020
I also wished that he had stepped up and said it's not a for your fucking

1443
01:23:53.021 --> 01:23:57.880
business and wish he had said this is a ridiculous private manner and you're

1444
01:23:57.881 --> 01:24:00.000
trying to make it a big story.
It's really amazing.
Like,

1445
01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:03.570
like it seems like Marty you are and the higher you are in the,

1446
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:05.450
in the public eye,
the more powerful you are,

1447
01:24:05.451 --> 01:24:09.200
the more likely you are to behave like the stupidest person to ever be on like

1448
01:24:09.201 --> 01:24:10.034
law and order.

1449
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:18.950
It's like 20 year old girls do not say in your previous deposition that you did

1450
01:24:19.951 --> 01:24:24.410
not have said yet
readily available to.
These are two.

1451
01:24:24.411 --> 01:24:25.640
You're arresting officers,
you know,

1452
01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:29.320
where he's just so they believe that some alternate reality exists.

1453
01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.670
You know what's,
uh,
what's the inquiring and got their hooks in you.

1454
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:34.880
It's time to let it hang out.
You know what?

1455
01:24:34.881 --> 01:24:38.960
I think certain people become delusional when they hit a certain level of

1456
01:24:38.961 --> 01:24:42.160
notoriety like the president of the United States.
I mean,

1457
01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:46.880
that level must be so intoxicating and when you're already kind of crazy,

1458
01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:50.930
which most people who are,
who run PR to become present in the first place,

1459
01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:53.000
you've gotta be at least a little bit fucking crazy.

1460
01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.270
Then all of a sudden you're there and the whole world is paying attention to

1461
01:24:56.271 --> 01:24:56.640
every month,
man.

1462
01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:00.020
You just feel like you could just stick your dick in someone's mouth.
It's like,

1463
01:25:00.021 --> 01:25:03.730
what's the big deal?
I'd be digging in there.
I was,

1464
01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:07.610
I was thinking my first order and then my first bit first thing in office,

1465
01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.630
you know,
on the president.
It's by degree.
I would,

1466
01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.080
it would make sure that it was an in and out burger in New York City.

1467
01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:16.300
We would need a change.
Many chains.
I mean many outlets of in and out.

1468
01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.650
You're that much of a fan of in and out Burger.
Yeah,
I would,
uh,

1469
01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:23.180
how would you use the power of the government to make sure that happens?

1470
01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:26.170
You love them that much.
It's,
it's,
it's,
I'm,

1471
01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:28.580
I'm bitter that we don't have them in New York.
Really?

1472
01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:32.750
You ever have five guys burgers?
Yeah,
I think we do five guys.

1473
01:25:32.751 --> 01:25:34.820
Burgers is pretty far from good.
Do you?
I'm a sentimental guy,

1474
01:25:34.821 --> 01:25:38.910
but this really exotic to me.
I mean,
I know there's better burgers out there,
but,

1475
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:43.820
but it's something I like about it.
You just get hooked on certain tastes.

1476
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:46.170
Yeah,
I kind of liked it.
Their,
their,
their,

1477
01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:51.500
their business model just goes against a sentence,
you know,
against the grain.

1478
01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:53.630
Yeah.
It's a good business model.
It's kind of interesting.

1479
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:58.100
We always try to shoot there and they never let us shoot in there.
Uh,
we've,

1480
01:25:58.101 --> 01:26:01.940
we've had,
uh,
we've had difficulties.
Really.
Yeah.
But we,
we got a shot.

1481
01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:06.770
What about the chick filet guy?
You ever tried to shoot at his place?
He's a guy.

1482
01:26:06.771 --> 01:26:09.710
He's a guy that doesn't open on Sunday because that's the Lord's Day.

1483
01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:13.700
Dark chick fil A's are closed on Sunday.
So that was the Lord's Day.

1484
01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:17.760
Am I kind of voting by by what?
By eating their chicken,
you know?
Anyway,

1485
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:21.680
absolutely.
Right.
Yeah.
And it doesn't really matter.
Yeah.

1486
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:22.820
It doesn't really matter.

1487
01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.910
I don't know if they'd be just a really evil corporation,
you know?

1488
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:28.480
You know that they're like,
you know,
they're,

1489
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:31.700
all of their products are made by you during prison children somewhere,
right?

1490
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:36.560
Yes.
That matters.
Yeah.
But the chick fil a guy who believes in the baby Jesus,

1491
01:26:36.561 --> 01:26:38.830
you know,
he doesn't want to work on Sunday.
Who gives a shit?
Yeah.

1492
01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:42.440
I think they ended upward or guys or there was a religious component to the,

1493
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:45.080
to the company at some point or the underlying philosophy.

1494
01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.260
But the point is they've apparently created this look really pretty cool

1495
01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:49.790
business model for,
for fast food.

1496
01:26:49.791 --> 01:26:53.650
And it's an issue that I think about a lot because I had some,

1497
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:57.740
I don't know which economists.
Somebody said,
somebody smarter than me,
you know,

1498
01:26:57.750 --> 01:27:01.640
another 15 years,
we're going to be a country.
Everybody in the country,

1499
01:27:01.641 --> 01:27:03.860
we'll all be selling cheeseburgers to each other.

1500
01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.750
That that will be what Americans do.
You know,

1501
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:09.530
we don't make anything anymore really.
You know,

1502
01:27:09.531 --> 01:27:14.000
manufacturing is dropped to nothing.
We're,
we're into making,
you know,

1503
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:17.690
transformers seven and uh,
and uh,

1504
01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:21.860
you know,
selling each other burgers before the economy even collapse.

1505
01:27:21.861 --> 01:27:24.770
Putin was quoted as saying,
I don't understand the American economy.

1506
01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:29.690
It seems that all they do is sell houses to each other.
It was right about that.

1507
01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:33.950
He's right about that.
You know,
I mean,
it's truthfully that,
I mean,
what are,

1508
01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:37.520
what is our,
I think what our best export,
you know,

1509
01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:41.980
or now,
honestly,
now it's culture.
It's,
it's,
it,
it is,

1510
01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:45.970
is pretty close.
Second,
I think,
you know,

1511
01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:50.750
music for TV and comedies,
it's is a,

1512
01:27:50.751 --> 01:27:54.650
it is our most powerful weapon and our most powerful,

1513
01:27:54.710 --> 01:27:57.470
I think it's what we do best,
you know,
for better or worse.
I mean,

1514
01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:02.420
I agree 100% especially,
you know,
television and films.
I mean,
you know,

1515
01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:04.220
is it a po post other countries ever,

1516
01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.200
every now and then another country and make a good movie.

1517
01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.550
But goddamn there's a giant chunk of on the come from this fucking wacky place.

1518
01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:15.620
Yeah.
Do you ever go someplace where you go,
Ooh,

1519
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:19.370
being from America might be kind of touchy here.
Um,

1520
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:22.400
there have been places where I thought that was going to happen.
We're in fact,

1521
01:28:22.401 --> 01:28:24.940
we were treated really,
really,
really,
really well.
Like where,
where'd you worry?

1522
01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:29.480
Well,
everywhere in Arab world,
the hospitality has been unbelievable.

1523
01:28:29.481 --> 01:28:32.590
Saudi Arabia,
I was apprehensive.
You know,
they,

1524
01:28:32.591 --> 01:28:36.140
they take a lot of Saudis take uh,
a very,

1525
01:28:36.141 --> 01:28:39.660
have a very different view of the world than I do for sure.
Um,

1526
01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.610
but no,
I think everywhere I've been,
uh,
again,

1527
01:28:43.611 --> 01:28:47.330
it's kind of about the people who've been incredibly hospitable in places that I

1528
01:28:47.331 --> 01:28:51.770
didn't expect a upfront they would have any particular love for Americans.

1529
01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.640
Vietnamese were incredible from the first time I went there.
Um,
you know,

1530
01:28:56.650 --> 01:28:58.370
a lot of bad history there.
Are you going to ask?

1531
01:28:58.371 --> 01:29:01.130
At one point I turned to somebody I was with,
I said,
aren't you guys pissed?

1532
01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:02.180
You know

1533
01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:05.100
<v 6>what,
why don't you cranky about anything?
And they're like,
you know,</v>

1534
01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:08.490
don't flatter yourself to,
you know,
life's hard out here.
You know,

1535
01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:11.760
don't even consider yourself special since you,
we fought the Chinese,

1536
01:29:11.761 --> 01:29:16.470
the Cambodia,
the Chinese again before you there was the French,
the Japanese,

1537
01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.730
uh,
the Chinese.
We've been at war for 600 years.
You know,

1538
01:29:20.731 --> 01:29:22.830
you were only around for x.

1539
01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:25.770
So they take a really professional kind of long view.

1540
01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.580
Basically.
What if we stopped fighting this week?

1541
01:29:29.581 --> 01:29:31.770
Next week you're welcome at my house.
We'll hang out,
we'll talk.

1542
01:29:31.771 --> 01:29:35.930
Shop will get fucked up.
Tell some gels.
Wow.

1543
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:38.510
Generally speaking,
what I mean,
so that,

1544
01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:42.480
that's a place where people have been really hospitable,
that I didn't expect it.

1545
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:46.810
Uh,
well,
a lot of places,
you know,

1546
01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:51.450
should we shut off the villas in,
in Rio and basically,
you know,

1547
01:29:51.451 --> 01:29:56.340
very poor,
very crime ridden areas of,
uh,
of,

1548
01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:00.480
uh,
Rio and,
uh,
when,
uh,
Cyrus place,

1549
01:30:00.481 --> 01:30:03.020
you have to sort of hook up with the local crime guy.
You know,

1550
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:07.800
whoever the mayor of the block,
the Ma,
no,
no,
no.
This is our fixer.

1551
01:30:07.801 --> 01:30:10.050
We'll contact you want to shoot in this area.

1552
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:15.590
You're going to need somebody local godfather or the head of the crew or whoever

1553
01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:22.140
controls that area in the real world.
We have to contact them and say,
listen,

1554
01:30:22.141 --> 01:30:25.740
we're going to make a point of coming at you,
showing you respect,

1555
01:30:26.610 --> 01:30:31.020
offering you a few dollars because it's never about the money.
You know,

1556
01:30:31.021 --> 01:30:34.740
and you will get to wander around and shoot your whole area of your city without

1557
01:30:34.741 --> 01:30:38.250
fear of being shot or stabbed or robbed.
And um,

1558
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:39.960
and we do that again and again and again.

1559
01:30:39.961 --> 01:30:43.740
We just show the respect of acknowledging for better or worse,

1560
01:30:43.741 --> 01:30:45.900
you are the boss of this neighborhood.
We're going to show you,

1561
01:30:45.901 --> 01:30:49.500
respect the front of your neighbors and you will keep us from Kevin shot while

1562
01:30:49.501 --> 01:30:54.410
we're shooting in the neighborhood.
Again,
it's just about,
it's not,

1563
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:58.080
you know,
we're not paying people.
It's people are proud of their food.

1564
01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.920
Chances are that proud of their neighborhood,
they're proud of their friends.

1565
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:07.950
If somebody expresses interest in telling their story or sh or showing the world

1566
01:31:07.951 --> 01:31:12.060
what they do,
particularly if there's food involved in local beverage,

1567
01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:14.520
chances are you're going to have a good time.

1568
01:31:14.521 --> 01:31:15.870
You're going to be treated well in this world.

1569
01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:19.530
<v 0>One of the most kind of heartwarming,</v>

1570
01:31:19.531 --> 01:31:24.531
really cool homie moments was when you were in Naples and that guy took you into

1571
01:31:24.541 --> 01:31:27.200
his house for Sunday dinner and a sort of a last minute thing.

1572
01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:28.270
It was totally minute

1573
01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:33.040
<v 6>our,
our,
our,
our fixer had had hooked us up with a family.</v>

1574
01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:33.490
You know,

1575
01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:37.060
I know a friend of a friend and that fell through at the last minute and you

1576
01:31:37.061 --> 01:31:37.900
know,
literally

1577
01:31:38.690 --> 01:31:41.190
<v 0>the car of my drivers is not a good,
just come over to my mother's house.</v>

1578
01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:44.970
My mother will cook for you.
Sure.
She'll be on TV.
I'll tell her tomorrow.

1579
01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:48.760
It was perfect.
It was made when you walk in.

1580
01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:51.360
I knew this woman is like made for television.

1581
01:31:51.361 --> 01:31:54.540
She was just so completely real and awesome and tough.

1582
01:31:54.690 --> 01:31:58.410
She's like chain smoking while she's cooking,
stirring the sauce.

1583
01:31:58.850 --> 01:32:00.050
She had this way of target,

1584
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:02.740
<v 5>Eh,</v>

1585
01:32:03.730 --> 01:32:05.090
<v 0>she's talking about her side.</v>

1586
01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:10.330
Oh man,
there was,
yeah,
you couldn't,

1587
01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:12.250
you couldn't put that in an Adam Sandler movie.

1588
01:32:12.251 --> 01:32:14.620
People would think you were too over the top.
It's really great.

1589
01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.760
It's really great when you get lucky when you,

1590
01:32:16.761 --> 01:32:18.880
when you're shooting and something really amazing happens.

1591
01:32:18.881 --> 01:32:23.320
You meet and the food looked fucking Jama where that meat was boiling in that

1592
01:32:23.321 --> 01:32:25.730
sauce.
Oh,
oh.

1593
01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:28.330
It was bubbling that he knew it was on for hours.

1594
01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.490
It was just going to just melt in your mouth.

1595
01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:34.630
That show was one of those where it just totally did not suck.

1596
01:32:34.631 --> 01:32:39.160
Making that show and we all,
everybody on the crew games like five pounds.

1597
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:41.590
I gained five pounds watching your fucking shows.

1598
01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:44.260
I eat at night when everybody's asleep.
That's when I watch your show.

1599
01:32:44.261 --> 01:32:47.560
I cook something and then I'll sit in front of your show and eat way more than I

1600
01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:51.150
should.
What I do generally is fine.
If I know I'm shooting in Rome or Naples,

1601
01:32:51.151 --> 01:32:54.910
anywhere in Italy or eastern Europe,
you know,
with dumpling land,
you know,

1602
01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:59.770
I'll make sure that the next show is in someplace really empowered land.

1603
01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:04.570
Right.
Or,
or,
or with a really,
like maybe Vietnam,
some places are pretty light,
uh,

1604
01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:08.830
cuisine.
You know,
where you found it out.
Yeah.
I,

1605
01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:13.360
we learned our lesson.
We,
I think we did Brittany and Provence in a row,

1606
01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:14.201
you know,

1607
01:33:14.201 --> 01:33:19.201
so the whole crew were all together for like 18 days in France of on a,

1608
01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:23.620
on a food show.
So,
you know,
ordering just like lots of stuff.

1609
01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:28.240
Everyone in the crew game,
eight,
10 pounds,
you know,
that people in France with,

1610
01:33:28.241 --> 01:33:31.210
they're incredibly rich.
Diets are thin.

1611
01:33:31.770 --> 01:33:36.490
They bought their way fitter than Americans.
They move,
they move around a lot.

1612
01:33:36.491 --> 01:33:38.170
Yeah.
They're always pedaling around and shit.

1613
01:33:38.171 --> 01:33:41.690
Walking around doing all this crazy,
cooky European shit.

1614
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:45.730
Look around and shed is Drylok they're active.

1615
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:50.530
They're not a sedentary society.
Uh,
that I will see them and you know,
anaphase,

1616
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:53.550
it'll look how they,
the same with the Italians.
They'll eat,

1617
01:33:53.650 --> 01:33:55.180
they don't eat breakfast.
Really.

1618
01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:59.110
Maybe they'll have a tiny nibble of a muffin or requests on a couple of
shooters.

1619
01:33:59.111 --> 01:34:01.910
A coffee get really jacked up on coffee.
They get through,
you know,

1620
01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.800
maybe they'll take a nip nipper something maybe around one o'clock in the

1621
01:34:05.801 --> 01:34:06.221
afternoon.

1622
01:34:06.221 --> 01:34:10.270
They knock off for a couple of hours and eat a huge motherfucking meal and a lot

1623
01:34:10.271 --> 01:34:14.440
of wine.
Then they go back to work and they work till like seven or eight or nine

1624
01:34:14.441 --> 01:34:18.700
sometimes.
Then they have maybe a light supper.
You know,
generally speaking,

1625
01:34:18.701 --> 01:34:22.010
we're talking to average,
um,
then a very light supper.
You know,

1626
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:24.730
they're not sitting down and doing it all again.

1627
01:34:24.731 --> 01:34:27.460
It's all about either lunch or dinner,
you know,

1628
01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:29.560
so they're really eating only one big meal a day.

1629
01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:33.970
A friend of mine went to the land on eating deep fried fuckin macaroni,

1630
01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:38.320
macaroni and cheese,
or,
you know,

1631
01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:44.020
cheeseburgers between the doughnuts or they don't do that.

1632
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:46.870
A buddy of mine went to the Lamborghini factory.
He,
uh,
you know,

1633
01:34:46.871 --> 01:34:48.820
my friend Bud who owns that show rides.

1634
01:34:49.090 --> 01:34:52.000
They filmed the construction of a Lamborghini and he came back.

1635
01:34:52.001 --> 01:34:54.820
The first thing he said is,
does fucking people know how to live?
He goes,

1636
01:34:54.821 --> 01:34:58.880
let me tell you something.
First of all,
they go to work about 10,
10,
30.

1637
01:34:58.910 --> 01:35:02.480
No one's there at like 7:00 AM they get in,
they were for a little bit.

1638
01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:05.120
Then they eat a spectacular lunch.

1639
01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:08.900
Well they have chefs come in and make them the most incredible pasta and then

1640
01:35:08.901 --> 01:35:13.010
they sleep for a couple of hours and they come back in and they work for a

1641
01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:13.940
couple more hours and then they're done.

1642
01:35:13.941 --> 01:35:17.240
No one's working like 12 hours days at the Lamborghini factory.

1643
01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:21.020
They're just artists making these incredible here.
Why can't we,

1644
01:35:21.021 --> 01:35:26.021
is it possible to sustain 300 million people and have that sort of a work ethic

1645
01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:30.920
goes God,
Dan has to be a way better place,
you know,
for a regular job.

1646
01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:33.020
I mean if you're working on your own shit,

1647
01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:34.520
you should be able to do whatever you want.

1648
01:35:34.521 --> 01:35:38.150
I expect something I ask all the time,
you know,
my wife says,
you know,
and,

1649
01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:41.800
and I spent a lot of time there and I look around at,
you know,

1650
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:46.130
guys in their twenties and thirties and how do,
how do you live?

1651
01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:49.850
But constantly asking myself,
how do you live this way?
Who's giving you money?

1652
01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:53.300
Nobody seems to really,
people do work hard in Italy,

1653
01:35:53.301 --> 01:35:55.650
but you just tend to not see it.
Um,

1654
01:35:57.090 --> 01:35:59.360
beat motherfucking lunch every day and I mean,

1655
01:35:59.361 --> 01:36:01.700
we'd be a little gelato at four o'clock in the afternoon.

1656
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:04.100
You getting your weeks of vacation a year,

1657
01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.920
you don't win in France and in Italy too,
you know,

1658
01:36:06.921 --> 01:36:09.810
you get sick in the middle of the night,
you pick up a phone call,

1659
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:14.390
a doctorate in like 15 minutes later.
So some young intern arrives on a,
on a,

1660
01:36:14.391 --> 01:36:15.490
on a motor scooter,

1661
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:18.980
shoots you up with whatever drugs you need to feel better at your house.

1662
01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:23.390
It's like,
like free or close to free.
They don't even take tips.

1663
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:27.830
It's fucking nuts.
Wow.
They come to your house,
they will come to your house,

1664
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:31.550
all doctor bag and can you imagine this?
You know,
and they come quit.

1665
01:36:31.730 --> 01:36:34.310
That's what happens when you have a small culture.

1666
01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:36.980
When you have a culture of too many millions of people,

1667
01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:39.630
you have the diffusion of responsibility thing.
You'd,

1668
01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:42.020
the numbers are too big and there's no way he could rock that.

1669
01:36:42.170 --> 01:36:46.070
I don't have a rock.
I don't know.
Listen,
I still the,
I don't know how they do it,

1670
01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.650
but they do.
Their priorities are very,
very different.

1671
01:36:48.651 --> 01:36:51.740
But I'll tell you a quality of life does not suck.
Does not suck.

1672
01:36:51.741 --> 01:36:55.180
And how many people live there total?
I Dunno.

1673
01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:59.770
It's not that many.
Right?
I don't know.
Uh,
Oh,

1674
01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:04.340
you're asking me population of France or Italy?
Is it like a couple million each?

1675
01:37:04.341 --> 01:37:08.240
What does it have?
No idea.
It's not like a major American city.
Right?

1676
01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:11.810
I just think this rock countries in Europe with fewer people than,

1677
01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:15.380
than New York City,
that's for sure.
For sure.
I mean,

1678
01:37:15.381 --> 01:37:17.360
New York City's the most amazing city on the planet,

1679
01:37:17.361 --> 01:37:21.890
but I just think that anytime you jammed that many people in one spot,

1680
01:37:21.891 --> 01:37:26.570
you're asking for,
you're asking for some unnatural reactions.
You know,

1681
01:37:26.630 --> 01:37:31.460
I dunno.
I'm,
I'm fascinated by how well New York works.
It's incredibly efficient.

1682
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:34.970
I mean by and large,
just watching taxis.

1683
01:37:34.971 --> 01:37:37.430
Like one of the things I love doing in New York is driving,

1684
01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:39.950
everyone else hates to drive to New York.
I love driving in New York.

1685
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:45.310
I love how traffic these cars should be smacking up against each other,

1686
01:37:45.591 --> 01:37:48.290
particularly the way the taxis drive and they're bombing up,
you know,

1687
01:37:48.291 --> 01:37:50.330
bombing up an avenue,
looking to hit the lights,

1688
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:55.810
changing lanes without even touching the directionals.
There's something,
um,

1689
01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:56.580
mystically

1690
01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.650
<v 6>cooperative about the way it all works.</v>

1691
01:37:58.651 --> 01:38:02.450
There's an ebb and flow to New York City traffic that when you get up,
it's in,

1692
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:07.380
you know,
into that wave.
It's like birds and the dusk skies and those big waves.

1693
01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:09.930
When birds flying those big waves,
they don't hit each other.

1694
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:13.380
Coming from an ag downtown,
when you hit every light that's,

1695
01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:16.890
I've been hit by a cab,
so I used to drive a New York cab,

1696
01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:19.760
sent me twice and they bolted both times.
Those Fox I've been hit by,

1697
01:38:19.770 --> 01:38:23.850
I've been hit by cab.
I'd be in a cab and been t boned twice.
Oh,

1698
01:38:24.150 --> 01:38:28.590
in in like three days.
God Damn.
Twice in three days.

1699
01:38:28.591 --> 01:38:32.070
You're having never been involved in anything like that?
Twice in three days.

1700
01:38:32.071 --> 01:38:36.010
A few years back.
Wow.
Was it both on the same side or do double size in it yet?

1701
01:38:39.370 --> 01:38:42.090
I just got out,
jumped into one of the cab,
you know,
he's one of those things.

1702
01:38:42.091 --> 01:38:46.480
That one was her shit.
So it was a light t bone.
Well it was a,
we,

1703
01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.110
nobody was driving away,
you know,

1704
01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:51.470
she wasn't actually one guy did drive away but you don't want to rims with spa.

1705
01:38:51.471 --> 01:38:55.770
It was a stolen car and there were clearly it appeared to be a stolen car cause

1706
01:38:55.771 --> 01:38:59.460
the guy got out of there awful quick on,
on rims.
Uh,

1707
01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:03.330
New York City is just such a fascinating experiment to stack people on top of

1708
01:39:03.331 --> 01:39:06.290
each other all in this one place and have all you know,

1709
01:39:06.330 --> 01:39:11.130
pretty much anything you need right there.
Do you own a restaurant?

1710
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:14.130
No.
No,
no.
I was a chef at a restaurant for many years.

1711
01:39:14.131 --> 01:39:15.720
I'm still involved with them and uh,

1712
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:20.760
I dunno it when is the last time you were in the weeds chalk?
11 years.
11 years,

1713
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:25.980
yeah.
It's been a,
let me see here.
The weeds.
Did you just give him shop talk?
Yes,

1714
01:39:27.630 --> 01:39:30.170
it's been 11 years since I've been on the line regularly since,

1715
01:39:30.171 --> 01:39:33.300
since I've had a show up.
And actually work a station every day.
Yeah.

1716
01:39:33.301 --> 01:39:37.020
It was a fun show.
When you did go back to your,
your,

1717
01:39:37.021 --> 01:39:41.310
your New York City restaurant,
how do you see that lay out and yeah,

1718
01:39:41.311 --> 01:39:45.180
what are you going to get time you come to a terms from very quickly with your

1719
01:39:45.181 --> 01:39:49.410
own mortality and a leader?
Limitations.
Uh,
you know,

1720
01:39:49.411 --> 01:39:52.680
I tried to work by all double shift.
I did work my old double shifts,
um,

1721
01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:56.150
and I made it but you know,

1722
01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:01.110
I think it was 54 53 when I went back and did that shelf and uh,

1723
01:40:01.230 --> 01:40:04.210
I'd been away for almost 10 years.
Um,

1724
01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:07.020
it is like a riding a bicycle and that you,

1725
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:11.850
you could still do it,
but your brain,
when you were a chef,

1726
01:40:12.570 --> 01:40:16.830
I think your brain starts to turn to mush in your late thirties.

1727
01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:22.150
You become less smart,
less fast,
less able to do,
you know,

1728
01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:25.950
12,
13 things at the same time because that way it starts to fry.

1729
01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:29.550
That is a big part of what being a chef is not just about the artistry of

1730
01:40:29.551 --> 01:40:32.440
preparing the food,
but of juggling all these different,
mostly to demean them.

1731
01:40:32.970 --> 01:40:37.320
80% of it.
I've even the great artists,
the great chefs,
um,

1732
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:40.500
they're great chefs because they're able to choose people,

1733
01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:46.460
make personal and professional relationships with those people such that they

1734
01:40:46.471 --> 01:40:48.660
can execute their vision,

1735
01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:51.990
their artistic vision again and again and again.

1736
01:40:52.290 --> 01:40:54.340
Exactly the same every single day.

1737
01:40:54.341 --> 01:40:58.970
Rain or shine and working in high tension close quarter's everybody's and you're

1738
01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:03.430
talking about a liter,
a chef.
The chef is,
is a,
is a cook who leads and,
and uh,

1739
01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:06.290
a great chef is one who is both a,

1740
01:41:07.150 --> 01:41:10.780
someone who's really creative and has a,
for lack of a better word,

1741
01:41:10.781 --> 01:41:14.020
artistic style or vision or something to say,

1742
01:41:14.530 --> 01:41:18.970
but the ability to inspire a loyalty and good performance in others,

1743
01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:24.340
uh,
is key.
Absolutely.
You know,
could be the best,
best cook in the world.

1744
01:41:24.341 --> 01:41:27.370
If you can inspire others to execute that,
you ain't worth shit.

1745
01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:29.340
<v 4>I never got this from any other show before.</v>

1746
01:41:29.341 --> 01:41:32.800
I watch your show before I watch your show.
I got,
oh,
that guy cooks good food.

1747
01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:36.480
I really did.
I mean,
I just,
I don't Kmart minimalized.
I don't,

1748
01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:39.750
I don't have enough room in my brain for everything.
You know,

1749
01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:40.930
I can't focus on everything.

1750
01:41:40.931 --> 01:41:44.500
So I'd see certain things and I learn as little as I need to know.
Oh,

1751
01:41:44.501 --> 01:41:48.010
I like this kind of food.
Oh,
that tastes good.
Oh,
that guy's a good cook.
Awesome.

1752
01:41:48.011 --> 01:41:48.844
Eating his food.

1753
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.530
I never thought about it in terms of the complexity or the,

1754
01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:54.970
the effort that goes into it.

1755
01:41:54.971 --> 01:41:56.770
And I really never thought about it that much until your show.

1756
01:41:56.771 --> 01:41:59.500
That's why it was so fascinating to me.
It's hard.
It's hard on you

1757
01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:03.170
<v 6>glamorous work,
you know.
So by the time the shaft becomes the chef that,
you know,</v>

1758
01:42:03.171 --> 01:42:04.520
by the time you know their name,

1759
01:42:04.590 --> 01:42:06.560
chances are they're not working the line anymore,

1760
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:11.450
but that they spent most of their adult lives,
uh,

1761
01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:16.010
standing there doing something that is very similar in many ways to work in a

1762
01:42:16.011 --> 01:42:18.200
production line,
in a,
in an auto factory.
You know,

1763
01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:20.750
you putting the nuts of the balls in the same places,

1764
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:22.880
presumably every time and just as well.

1765
01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:27.870
<v 4>And then one guy pops out like a Wolfgang Puck or,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the,</v>

1766
01:42:27.871 --> 01:42:30.840
the Emeril dude that his own fucking Sitcom.

1767
01:42:31.050 --> 01:42:33.830
<v 6>Well,
they,
you know,
guys like Emerald didn't pop out actually.
I mean,</v>

1768
01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:38.640
that's a guy who worked his ass off for a really long time,
uh,
in restaurants,

1769
01:42:38.670 --> 01:42:42.560
became well known,
was offered a show,
was a particularly good at,

1770
01:42:42.561 --> 01:42:45.840
and he had one show after another fail in the network,
stuck with him,

1771
01:42:45.841 --> 01:42:50.790
and he's moved.
More importantly,
he's stuck with it.
And He created a very,

1772
01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:55.170
he became a very improbable,
you know,
superstar.
Uh,
you know,

1773
01:42:56.190 --> 01:42:59.460
if you look at those early shows,
it's just,
you know,
he does everything.

1774
01:42:59.490 --> 01:43:04.170
So many things wrong as far as what you expect of a classic,

1775
01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:07.680
you know,
TV friendly guy.
You know,
he's got a thick accent.

1776
01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:11.790
He's kind of a little awkward up there.
That was really charming and he really,

1777
01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:16.470
audiences like that.
But,
but you know,
he worked his ass off getting there.

1778
01:43:16.471 --> 01:43:20.640
He didn't just say he wasn't like me an overnight success guy.
You know,
he,

1779
01:43:20.670 --> 01:43:22.290
he was drilling away for years.

1780
01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:23.311
<v 4>But what I'm,</v>

1781
01:43:23.311 --> 01:43:25.890
what I meant by it is it all of a sudden he's forced into the public

1782
01:43:25.891 --> 01:43:28.860
consciousness that he's launched.
Like emeralds.
I,
there's a,

1783
01:43:28.861 --> 01:43:31.380
there's a few guys is like the Wolfgang Puck's.
There's,

1784
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:33.060
if you're not paying attention,

1785
01:43:33.090 --> 01:43:35.280
these are the guys that you hear about if you're not paying attention.

1786
01:43:35.370 --> 01:43:36.750
<v 6>Well,
cause they're,
you know,</v>

1787
01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:39.870
they're both guys who've been around a long time and done really important

1788
01:43:39.871 --> 01:43:43.210
things both off TV and on TV.
Um,

1789
01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:46.380
<v 4>it's interesting that he's,
they'd love him for his personality.</v>

1790
01:43:46.530 --> 01:43:49.950
So like your personality is so good.
We're going to ask you to fake it now.

1791
01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:52.190
It has to be in a sitcom

1792
01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:54.560
<v 6>for all,
for a long time.
You know,
chefs,</v>

1793
01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:57.290
a lot of chefs got into the business because they were awkward.

1794
01:43:57.291 --> 01:43:59.510
They felt awkward,
they were shit.

1795
01:43:59.630 --> 01:44:04.580
Words are generally didn't feel comfortable in a straight business environment.

1796
01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:07.850
Uh,
the chancellor of the kind of running away from something,

1797
01:44:07.851 --> 01:44:12.050
they sent something about themselves that,
that,
that said,
all,

1798
01:44:12.130 --> 01:44:16.250
all of the things that tell you subconsciously bad communicator,
you know,

1799
01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:19.190
shouldn't be out there talking to regular people on a regular basis trying to do

1800
01:44:19.191 --> 01:44:21.890
normal business.
Those are the things that drove people to cook.

1801
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:24.770
And yet suddenly they find themselves,
you know,

1802
01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:29.660
with media coaches and people trying to train them to be themselves on camera.

1803
01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:34.460
And it's a huge industry.
And,
and uh,
a strange,
strange one.

1804
01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:38.920
Yeah.
You,
I,
I read a quote once where he said that,
uh,
the,
the,

1805
01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:43.970
the guys that got into becoming chefs where the second smartest sons,

1806
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:47.030
well,
traditionally in European culture,
you know,

1807
01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:49.460
if the family could only afford to send one kid to college,

1808
01:44:49.461 --> 01:44:50.750
they pick the smartest son.

1809
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:53.510
And they invest what little money they had and that enterprise,

1810
01:44:53.511 --> 01:44:58.400
the other one would join the family business or go go to hotel school to be,

1811
01:44:58.401 --> 01:45:03.020
to learn.
You'd literally to be an apprentice to some craft,
you know,
some trade.

1812
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:04.970
And for a lot of people that was hotel school.

1813
01:45:04.971 --> 01:45:08.300
So all a lot of the great chess that came out of that,
that kind of situation.

1814
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:10.940
Certainly when I started cooking,
it was the,

1815
01:45:11.130 --> 01:45:13.580
the misfits who ended up in the restaurant business,
you know,

1816
01:45:13.581 --> 01:45:16.940
life hacking exactly.
Turned out the way they had expected.
Or maybe there's a,

1817
01:45:17.150 --> 01:45:20.980
a quick,
you know,
a temporary,
you know,
you could,
you know,

1818
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:23.150
there's always a job for you if,
if,
if you,

1819
01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.480
you're presented a reasonably intelligent,

1820
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:30.200
there's always a job for you on the floor of a restaurant as a waiter.

1821
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:35.570
And I'm in that though,
right?
You take joy in being one of the misfits.
Oh,

1822
01:45:35.571 --> 01:45:38.390
let me just,
why I got an a business.
It was running away with the circus.

1823
01:45:38.391 --> 01:45:41.420
It was fellow misfits and refugees who,

1824
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:46.190
who really just couldn't hack it anywhere else ended up in this,

1825
01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:48.590
this enterprise.
Um,
see,

1826
01:45:48.591 --> 01:45:52.100
that was the first time I'd ever seen it or heard it described like that.

1827
01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:53.720
It was listening to you talk about it.

1828
01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:57.890
I had never thought of working in a kitchen to be like that.
Yeah,

1829
01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:02.720
well it was a lot of fun.
I mean it was a,
it was a lot of fun.
I think

1830
01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:07.280
how many people have worked in restaurants at one point or another in life?

1831
01:46:07.281 --> 01:46:09.240
It is an education.
It's one of the things I love one of the,

1832
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:11.930
there's so many things to love about it that special about it.

1833
01:46:11.931 --> 01:46:13.790
You see people again and again.

1834
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:17.240
I used to see these guys that come out of like the mountains of Afghanistan,

1835
01:46:17.241 --> 01:46:21.860
like,
or the tribal areas of Pakistan,
you know,
really,
um,

1836
01:46:22.450 --> 01:46:24.720
you know,
conservative background.
Uh,

1837
01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:27.860
never been any city until they came to New York.

1838
01:46:28.130 --> 01:46:31.640
They're working in a restaurant as busboys four weeks later.

1839
01:46:31.641 --> 01:46:34.850
It's not motherfucker [inaudible] son of a bitch,
you know,
rat best.

1840
01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:39.320
And then they basically,
you've immediately adopted sort of the,

1841
01:46:39.321 --> 01:46:44.060
the worst of New York culture is a,
a speech,
but they're also,

1842
01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:49.860
you get so smart about,
about human behavior.
When you're a or a waiter,

1843
01:46:49.861 --> 01:46:52.920
you see so much of it.
It's like being a bartender.

1844
01:46:52.921 --> 01:46:57.690
You learn way more about human nature,
then you really want to learn,
you know,

1845
01:46:57.930 --> 01:47:02.570
uh,
you didn't sign up to be a psychiatrist,
but in the aura,
an enabler,
a doctor.

1846
01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:04.410
But in the end,
that's kind of what you become when,

1847
01:47:04.411 --> 01:47:05.850
if you're a bartender with regulators.

1848
01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:10.740
So I think people in the restaurant business get this really unique view of the

1849
01:47:10.741 --> 01:47:13.820
world perspective on the rest of the world.
Yeah.

1850
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:16.170
It is a unique position to be a bartender,

1851
01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:19.590
to be the sober person serving everyone drinks while they're all just falling

1852
01:47:19.591 --> 01:47:21.830
apart and talking to you gets to some,

1853
01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:25.680
it gets to some of confused why it gets to some people.

1854
01:47:25.681 --> 01:47:28.680
I knew a bartender who,
uh,
I'd be drinking with them.

1855
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:33.330
I do my shift drink with him after I worked the lunch service and this guy was

1856
01:47:33.331 --> 01:47:35.820
telling me,
you don't have to 10,
12 years in the business.

1857
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:38.020
I don't know if I could do this much longer now.

1858
01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:42.600
I just don't know if I could do it.
And I said,
why?
He says,
watch this.

1859
01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:46.440
He takes the big glasses and I guess he presses them in the sponge,

1860
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:51.390
rinse them with,
with uh,
with kosher salt and puts them under the bar.

1861
01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:56.500
It's old lady comes in and sits down.
I like a salty dog,
you know,
he,

1862
01:47:56.580 --> 01:48:00.720
he pours his salty dog,
she drinks it,
she orders another,

1863
01:48:00.721 --> 01:48:05.250
he has a second glass for,
uh,
she drinks it.
Then she gets into this,
okay.
That,

1864
01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:08.460
that's enough for me.
Gets up,
makes it halfway to the door,

1865
01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:11.100
looks at the ground.

1866
01:48:11.250 --> 01:48:15.240
Second thoughts goes back to the bar orders of third point is he'd had the three

1867
01:48:15.241 --> 01:48:19.800
glasses ready.
He knew this is a,
this one is an alcoholic.
Okay.

1868
01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:24.900
I am helping her on her way to her ultimate destruction.
And I just,

1869
01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:29.310
I can't hack it,
you know,
but I have too many customers like this,
you know?
Well,

1870
01:48:29.311 --> 01:48:31.770
ultimately if you're in the bar every night,
you know,

1871
01:48:31.771 --> 01:48:35.630
and bars are great once a week bars,
a great once a month if you can,
you know,

1872
01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:38.250
once a month,
if you stay healthy and you're feeling good,

1873
01:48:38.251 --> 01:48:41.430
your immune system's up.
You've been eating vitamins and eating well,

1874
01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.940
you just get fucked up with still had,
c'mon,
everything's good.

1875
01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:47.250
But you're doing that every night.
I would,
you know,

1876
01:48:47.251 --> 01:48:49.190
it will cure you of the nightclubs real fast.

1877
01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:52.050
This working in a nightclub and I worked at a nightclub and that was,

1878
01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:54.210
I will never,
you know,
never again.

1879
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:56.640
You know any place where it's like the background.

1880
01:48:56.940 --> 01:49:01.710
I'm already out the other door.
Yeah,
yeah,
I did.
Uh,
some,
uh,

1881
01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:06.360
security work at a concert center in Massachusetts.
Great Woods.

1882
01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:09.510
You've got to see people at like Neil young concerts.

1883
01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:14.520
People fucked up in the crowd that I would never want to be a part of anything

1884
01:49:14.521 --> 01:49:16.830
like that ever.
I knew that I had like 19.
I'm like,

1885
01:49:16.831 --> 01:49:18.900
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
Cause place I worked with,

1886
01:49:18.930 --> 01:49:22.350
they were sued like two,
three times a week,
you know,
which you,
I guess you,

1887
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:25.080
you are when you're in the nightclub business because there's always some

1888
01:49:25.090 --> 01:49:30.030
boneheads who come in,
you know,
pick a fight,
uh,
bounces,
throw them out already.

1889
01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:32.310
There's a lawsuit.
It doesn't mean it's a credible one,

1890
01:49:32.311 --> 01:49:36.030
but people are going to be suing you,
your,
your,
your,
uh,

1891
01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:39.600
your competition are going to be suing you.
Uh,

1892
01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:42.750
the fire department is going to be harassed.
It's,
I've just brutal,

1893
01:49:42.810 --> 01:49:46.950
it's amazing that people can sell alcohol at all.
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

1894
01:49:46.951 --> 01:49:47.784
You know,
that

1895
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:52.390
<v 0>people can afford to have bars begin afford to sell alcohol at all because you</v>

1896
01:49:52.391 --> 01:49:55.600
would think that people getting drunk and cost so many fucking problems and they

1897
01:49:55.601 --> 01:49:58.930
can be sued for just,
it was,
it was an education,

1898
01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:03.160
I think it was two years at this very busy New York nightclub and just the stuff

1899
01:50:03.161 --> 01:50:04.470
that people would leave in the,
in the,

1900
01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:07.120
in the bathrooms are try to flush down the toilet.

1901
01:50:07.121 --> 01:50:09.880
We have the night cleanup guy would always come by the kitchen with his

1902
01:50:09.881 --> 01:50:12.360
discoveries of the night.
You know,

1903
01:50:12.490 --> 01:50:15.520
it was a fucking artificial limb.

1904
01:50:18.570 --> 01:50:23.170
Oh my God.
It was,
the women's rooms were actually always worse,
way worse.

1905
01:50:23.171 --> 01:50:27.180
You know,
people were like just doing,
I mean,
it's just incredible,
you know,

1906
01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:28.210
horrifying.
You know,

1907
01:50:28.211 --> 01:50:32.500
museum tells a story of human behavior that you just don't want to know it's

1908
01:50:32.501 --> 01:50:37.230
fucking alcohol man,
and wind him up and set them loose.
I had a buddy who was a,

1909
01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:40.540
did his residency in Miami and he said on Friday and Saturday nights,

1910
01:50:40.541 --> 01:50:43.050
people would come in with light bulbs up their assets.

1911
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:46.460
It's just impossible things,
you know,

1912
01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:49.480
just mostly shoved up their asses,
bullet holes,

1913
01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:52.390
people just getting just Barb and off.

1914
01:50:52.510 --> 01:50:55.630
It really truly is amazing that you can sell alcohol and you can't sell weed

1915
01:50:55.880 --> 01:51:00.220
weed.
So what a,
what a beautiful thing they've done.
It makes no sense at all.

1916
01:51:00.690 --> 01:51:03.510
Unless we make it,
we grow such good wheat in this country.
It would be a huge,

1917
01:51:03.511 --> 01:51:06.370
a major export.
I mean,
who does,
who grows better weed and us?
Nobody.

1918
01:51:06.371 --> 01:51:09.080
There's no better botanist in the southern California assholes.

1919
01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:11.470
These guys assholes and I saying with all love,

1920
01:51:12.490 --> 01:51:14.890
what they've done done now is incredible.
Look at this shit.

1921
01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:20.260
This is a marijuana electric cigarette.
Perfect for plane,

1922
01:51:20.261 --> 01:51:22.420
bathroom.
You get smoke this on a plane.
Wow.

1923
01:51:22.421 --> 01:51:24.760
It's one of those electronic cigarettes and has gotten,
we'd there,

1924
01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:28.180
they're fucking scientists.
Wow.
They're taking it to the next slot.

1925
01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:30.610
But science is great but it's amazing.

1926
01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:32.920
But unfortunately they're still getting arrested for it.

1927
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:34.090
There's still people that are getting,

1928
01:51:34.630 --> 01:51:38.020
apparently Obama said that he was only going to go after people who violate both

1929
01:51:38.021 --> 01:51:41.740
federal and state law,
but I don't know if that's been,

1930
01:51:42.370 --> 01:51:45.040
I think it's probably pretty easy to violate state law too.
Yeah.

1931
01:51:45.041 --> 01:51:47.250
I mean I think we should,
we should,
if we're going to do it,

1932
01:51:47.251 --> 01:51:50.310
if we're going to allow people to smoke weed that we should be making money off

1933
01:51:50.311 --> 01:51:52.730
it as it as an issue.
Yeah.

1934
01:51:53.530 --> 01:51:56.470
Selling serious wait to like Europe and,
and uh,

1935
01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:00.970
do you ever go to Mexico?
Uh,
yeah.
I love Mexico.

1936
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.020
Do you ever go to like border towns?
I've been meaning like what do you,

1937
01:52:05.021 --> 01:52:08.830
what do you like to sit and just did a show?
We just did a show there.
Yeah.

1938
01:52:08.831 --> 01:52:13.450
I mean it's crazy.
You know what we would consider apocalyptic violence.

1939
01:52:13.690 --> 01:52:16.260
I mean,
I think where people have been killed in Mexico during the drug wars,

1940
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:20.990
then,
then,
you know,
I think both Gulf wars and Afghanistan,
I mean,

1941
01:52:20.991 --> 01:52:23.840
there's some spectacular number of people as far as water down there in,

1942
01:52:23.890 --> 01:52:28.690
in the American troops.
Huge numbers.
Um,
what,

1943
01:52:28.691 --> 01:52:32.680
you know,
I have not a clue what to do.
Uh,
you know,

1944
01:52:32.681 --> 01:52:37.580
it doesn't help that we're selling them guns.
Uh,
but,
but there is no doubt that,

1945
01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:42.400
that,
uh,
people that they would get them from somewhere.
Um,
I've never had,

1946
01:52:42.401 --> 01:52:45.580
I've never seen it the many times I've been in Mexico.
You know.

1947
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:50.070
<v 6>What's your favorite place in Mexico?
Oh,
I love Pueblo.
I love you.</v>

1948
01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:55.070
You've never seen a drug violence at all.
I have not seen up close,

1949
01:52:55.410 --> 01:52:58.310
uh,
drug violence.
I have been in really drug,

1950
01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:02.660
I'd been in like super druggy neighborhoods in favelas,
in Brazil and elsewhere.

1951
01:53:02.661 --> 01:53:06.290
But I was with the local dealer because that's what I'm saying.
I mean,

1952
01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:07.940
does that work in Mexico?

1953
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:12.590
Could you do something which should be safely go to a cocktail of cartel

1954
01:53:12.591 --> 01:53:16.920
neighborhood with a cartel guy?
Man,

1955
01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:20.630
the level of violence is so spectacular there.
I wouldn't want to be complicit.

1956
01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:23.120
You know what I mean?
If you're,
you're currently,

1957
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:28.040
you know Jonathan People's heads off by the,
by the dozens,
you know,
it's another,

1958
01:53:28.041 --> 01:53:29.630
you know,
it's one thing.

1959
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:33.540
Have you ever been around someone like that in another country in it?

1960
01:53:33.630 --> 01:53:38.390
For many people I have met people and done scenes of my show with people who

1961
01:53:38.391 --> 01:53:42.410
have done very,
very bad things in their lives.
No question about it.
Um,

1962
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:48.260
they were not currently at the time of the show other than,
you know,

1963
01:53:48.261 --> 01:53:50.870
there was some low level guys for sure who clearly were drug dealers.

1964
01:53:50.871 --> 01:53:51.800
They said as much,
they said,

1965
01:53:51.801 --> 01:53:55.220
could you please shoot just this side of the street cause this side is my drug

1966
01:53:55.221 --> 01:54:00.050
operation.
Will you make you make a,
you make concessions,

1967
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:02.040
compromises,
you know,
morally and,

1968
01:54:02.041 --> 01:54:05.540
and otherwise when you take advantage of a situation like that,

1969
01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:09.530
the only way you're gonna shoot the neighborhood is that to have a local drug

1970
01:54:09.531 --> 01:54:13.760
dealer holding your hand.
That's what you do.
Or where you choose not to.

1971
01:54:13.770 --> 01:54:17.570
Depending.
And in Mexico,
the level of violence is so spectacular.

1972
01:54:17.571 --> 01:54:21.470
And they see presumably the major dealers out there are killing large numbers of

1973
01:54:21.471 --> 01:54:25.880
people in on a regular and ongoing basis.
I would feel bad.

1974
01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:28.250
That's not an arrangement.
I'd end arena.

1975
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:31.820
And would you have to go into some sort of a sense,

1976
01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:34.250
a similar arrangement if you were ever to go to the Congo?

1977
01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:39.680
What'd you have to [inaudible]?
Good,
good question.
But who,
who's the rebel?

1978
01:54:39.681 --> 01:54:41.460
And also there's,
there's uh,
it's,
uh,

1979
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:44.430
what does that even there are a lot of them saying the rebels were there a lot

1980
01:54:44.431 --> 01:54:48.200
of,
well,
there are,
there are various malicious,
yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.

1981
01:54:48.201 --> 01:54:50.050
You got to ask yourself that all the time.
But in,

1982
01:54:50.051 --> 01:54:53.600
in the same way when really when people are trying to be really nice to you in

1983
01:54:53.601 --> 01:54:58.040
countries where you're not free to speak your mind,
Cuba would be an example.

1984
01:54:58.470 --> 01:55:02.540
Uh,
you know,
China,
uh,

1985
01:55:02.541 --> 01:55:05.390
up near the Tibetan border,
you know,
when you have to,

1986
01:55:05.391 --> 01:55:08.300
you have to understand when you're talking to people on camera who let you into

1987
01:55:08.301 --> 01:55:11.820
their homes and they fed you and they've got,
you know,
they've,
they've,

1988
01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:12.980
and they've been maybe

1989
01:55:14.690 --> 01:55:17.380
a little more frank with you on a personal level than,

1990
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.850
than they are probably supposed to as government functionaries.
Um,

1991
01:55:22.610 --> 01:55:24.770
when they're good to you and everything they said was going to happen,

1992
01:55:24.771 --> 01:55:27.050
happen the way it was supposed to and they,
they didn't,

1993
01:55:27.110 --> 01:55:30.740
they weren't too clumsy and they didn't try to hand fist you basically,

1994
01:55:30.741 --> 01:55:34.370
if we get to go back to New York,
they have to stay there.

1995
01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:39.520
So if I go back and start criticizing as severely as I might,

1996
01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:42.500
it's something I always have to weigh.

1997
01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:44.940
The people who were good to me in these countries,

1998
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:46.710
they're going to be at a very bad place.

1999
01:55:46.711 --> 01:55:49.800
If I go back to New York and make this really make the show all about China,

2000
01:55:49.801 --> 01:55:52.080
Tibet,
I may have my opinions on it,

2001
01:55:52.081 --> 01:55:55.500
but for the sake of the people I leave behind,
I'm not shooting my mouth off.

2002
01:55:55.501 --> 01:55:58.050
I could say what I want about China anytime I want and you have,

2003
01:55:58.051 --> 01:56:01.470
I suffer no consequences.
Anyone who was ever nice to us,

2004
01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:03.840
we'll be suspect.

2005
01:56:03.870 --> 01:56:06.930
If I were to start really going off on a tangent on the issue,

2006
01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:09.950
on the show that these people helped me make,
same in Cuba.
You,

2007
01:56:10.590 --> 01:56:14.760
you do make certain compromises because people are as straight with you as they

2008
01:56:14.761 --> 01:56:17.940
can be.
Um,
they do the best by you.

2009
01:56:18.050 --> 01:56:21.060
They're people who are nice and the senses of humor is trying to do the best

2010
01:56:21.061 --> 01:56:24.960
they can,
whether you agree with their system or,
or despise it.
Um,

2011
01:56:24.961 --> 01:56:28.170
at the end of the day,
you got to ask yourself,
do I really want to put,
you know,

2012
01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:31.170
it might make more entertaining or truthful television,

2013
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:35.610
but they're going to be in a fucking cell for the crime of being nice to me are

2014
01:56:35.611 --> 01:56:38.940
being honest with me.
That's something we gotta ask ourselves all the time.
Well,

2015
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:42.090
I know you couldn't put that in the shell like this show on Cuba,

2016
01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:45.570
but is there anything that you could,
is there anything you can talk about?
Well,

2017
01:56:45.571 --> 01:56:48.090
I could have gone on and on and on about,
you know,

2018
01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:52.490
the history of the regime and what they've done.
Right,
right.
Many of them,

2019
01:56:52.530 --> 01:56:56.880
incredibly unpleasant to say the least.
Um,
I didn't make the show about that.

2020
01:56:56.881 --> 01:56:57.750
I kept at a very,

2021
01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:01.920
I tried very hard to keep the focus on does it look pretty,

2022
01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:06.730
is it worth looking at?
Is the food good?
Are The people nice?
Wow.

2023
01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:08.640
They were,
um,

2024
01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:13.500
really tried to avoid any politics at all.
But what was amazing,

2025
01:57:13.501 --> 01:57:17.700
what's political is always political when you sit down eat because the fact that

2026
01:57:17.701 --> 01:57:20.280
they're not eating much beyond rice and beans,

2027
01:57:20.490 --> 01:57:23.010
that is already a political statement,
you know,

2028
01:57:23.011 --> 01:57:26.760
that says a lot more about a culture then they may want you to see it's

2029
01:57:26.761 --> 01:57:29.430
dangerous information,
but,
but there it is.

2030
01:57:30.090 --> 01:57:33.330
So were they allowed to complain about that at all?

2031
01:57:33.331 --> 01:57:35.190
Do they cautious about doing that?
Did.

2032
01:57:35.191 --> 01:57:38.230
They made sure that they didn't say anything.
They go,
they let us,

2033
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:41.280
they let us shoot pretty much anything.
Anything we asked to shoot,

2034
01:57:41.281 --> 01:57:44.430
they let us shoot.
I,
I think they trust,
they clearly trusted us.

2035
01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:48.610
They saw us show other parts of the world in a relatively nonjudgmental way and,

2036
01:57:48.620 --> 01:57:53.020
and the foolishly,
or not
shrewdly or foolishly,

2037
01:57:53.021 --> 01:57:54.160
there will be differences of opinion.

2038
01:57:54.161 --> 01:57:57.610
I'm sure for whatever reason they trusted us to come and they pretty much let us

2039
01:57:57.611 --> 01:58:02.140
wander around shooting what kind of claims they tried.
Of course they,
you know,

2040
01:58:02.141 --> 01:58:03.310
there was definitely

2041
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:08.180
concern over who we'd be talking to and what they might say.

2042
01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:11.440
<v 1>Uh,
but you know,</v>

2043
01:58:12.690 --> 01:58:14.790
<v 6>you know,
everybody has to be careful about what they say.</v>

2044
01:58:15.250 --> 01:58:18.760
Everybody changes their behavior when they talk to you to a certain extent.

2045
01:58:18.761 --> 01:58:22.180
You don't bring up certain subjects because they're going to worry.

2046
01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:26.200
Does the government have any say?
Do they,
do they pull you aside and they say,

2047
01:58:26.201 --> 01:58:28.920
what is it?
How are you going to show range all of this through,

2048
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:30.460
through the government.
I mean,
nothing happens.

2049
01:58:30.461 --> 01:58:33.250
You don't go wandering around Cuba with a television crew without the government

2050
01:58:33.251 --> 01:58:35.470
become involved,
whether you know it or not,

2051
01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:39.070
but like did you get involved in any of the questions that they asked about the

2052
01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:42.310
cause you're,
you obviously have a creative influence.

2053
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:46.510
<v 2>They don't.
They don't.
We're not making any show ever where they,</v>

2054
01:58:46.511 --> 01:58:51.511
the nation or the local police or any other person has final cut or approval

2055
01:58:53.891 --> 01:58:55.690
over what we're showing now.

2056
01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:58.330
You obviously have approval over what we're allowed to shoot,

2057
01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:02.320
but how we edit that back in New York and what we say,
you know,

2058
01:59:02.321 --> 01:59:06.400
you're on your own.
It's too late.
Done.
You've signed a release that I ever,
ever,

2059
01:59:06.401 --> 01:59:09.580
ever going to happen.
Did they express any concern about any of that?

2060
01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:12.850
It seems like you mean they weren't very techy.
They were very,

2061
01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:15.820
I think their very being very shrewd about tourism.

2062
01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:18.820
They understand what it is that people want to see in Cuba,

2063
01:59:19.210 --> 01:59:22.310
which is the old Cuba of,
of a godfather to,

2064
01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:25.720
that's what we want to see and it's still there and have been really smart about

2065
01:59:25.721 --> 01:59:29.770
not fucking that up.
So these aren't as stupid,
unsophisticated people.

2066
01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:31.420
You're a commie functionaries.
Okay.

2067
01:59:31.421 --> 01:59:34.960
There they understand that they have a problem.
They,
if they,

2068
01:59:34.961 --> 01:59:38.350
I think everybody understands that the regime is,
you know,

2069
01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:41.200
things are going to change.
I think people,

2070
01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:43.750
everybody is kind of holding their breath in the country waiting to see what

2071
01:59:43.751 --> 01:59:44.501
happens next.

2072
01:59:44.501 --> 01:59:47.290
And I think what happens next and it's like completely in blindingly obvious to

2073
01:59:47.291 --> 01:59:51.130
everyone.
I mean,
Castro dies,
they open everything up pretty,
pretty damn quick.

2074
01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:54.450
Yeah.
And then everything gets better.
Way Better for the Cuban people sorta,

2075
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:58.630
sorta if we can.
Yes.
I assume,
you know,
lose certain things though.

2076
01:59:58.631 --> 02:00:01.020
You're going to lose those guys arguing.
You know,
it's easy for me.

2077
02:00:01.250 --> 02:00:05.910
I really don't want to see a brand new holiday inn on the waterfront of,
of,
uh,

2078
02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:09.090
the Malecon and Havana because it's one of those beautiful stretches of,

2079
02:00:09.190 --> 02:00:13.420
of anywhere,
anywhere.
Um,
but that's easy for me to say.
I'm not Cuban.

2080
02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:18.340
I didn't lose my home.
Uh,
you know,
I,
I have to say,

2081
02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:24.820
I,
I had no moral problems going to Cuba,
let's put it that way.
Um,

2082
02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:26.281
but I've,

2083
02:00:26.281 --> 02:00:30.880
I've since met a lot of Miami Cubans who take a very different view of going to

2084
02:00:30.881 --> 02:00:33.580
Cuba.
Um,
and it has been pointed out to me.

2085
02:00:33.581 --> 02:00:35.910
One guy came up to me and we were shooting at his restaurant.

2086
02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:40.060
It was just a complete coincidence after the,
our Cuba showed air.

2087
02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:45.130
This guy was pissed.
Uh,
it had clearly been a big issue at his house.

2088
02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:50.020
Um,
he was really struggling to contain his anger and be courteous,

2089
02:00:50.021 --> 02:00:53.170
which he was incredibly courteous.
And when he said,

2090
02:00:53.330 --> 02:00:55.150
I just need you to look at this picture.

2091
02:00:55.151 --> 02:00:57.950
And he takes me back and she has a picture of his dad who ran a,

2092
02:00:58.210 --> 02:01:02.880
basically he sold fish.
So I'd always thought that,
you know,

2093
02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:06.500
people who lost their homes and ran off to Miami,
you know,
we're all,
you know,

2094
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:09.670
the rich and the know the bastards basically,
you know,

2095
02:01:09.671 --> 02:01:12.280
this was what this man was telling me is that my father was an ordinary

2096
02:01:12.281 --> 02:01:15.370
businessman.
You know,
who'd worked hard in a selling fish,

2097
02:01:15.371 --> 02:01:19.970
catching fish and selling fish,
and they took his business and,

2098
02:01:19.971 --> 02:01:24.550
and did his livelihood.
That's something,
you know,

2099
02:01:24.551 --> 02:01:26.770
it was a very hard show to balance.
Let's put a taller,

2100
02:01:29.810 --> 02:01:34.510
I'd imagine it's gotta be so strange to just hop from one culture to the next

2101
02:01:34.570 --> 02:01:39.500
one unique insight into this totally different environment.

2102
02:01:39.710 --> 02:01:42.620
And then another one just as extremely different.

2103
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:45.110
We're really hoping to shoot and Libya in January,

2104
02:01:45.170 --> 02:01:49.910
we'd hoped to talk to me about this at the UFC.
We want it so bad.

2105
02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:53.810
I mean,
ideally we would have been there when they got good coffee,
you know.
Um,

2106
02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:58.940
but I,
I have friends there who've been in and out,
uh,
people we've worked with,

2107
02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:03.560
uh,
some of the,
some of the dicier places.
We worked with,

2108
02:02:03.561 --> 02:02:05.830
some very interesting security guys.
And,
uh,

2109
02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:10.580
some of them have been working in Libya lately and we were getting sort of

2110
02:02:10.810 --> 02:02:13.520
dispatches of what life's like there.
And these guys were,

2111
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:16.040
these are hardened professionals who've been around.

2112
02:02:16.250 --> 02:02:19.670
They've been in a lot of wars,
they've seen a lot of conflicts.
Um,

2113
02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:21.780
in many ways you would,
you,

2114
02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:25.970
you would probably call the mercenaries in an earlier day.
Uh,

2115
02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:30.950
but they were really sentimental about Libya.
They were like,
dude,
it's awesome.

2116
02:02:30.951 --> 02:02:32.560
What's happening here?
You should come.
You know,

2117
02:02:32.561 --> 02:02:35.180
it's like all these young people from all over the world,
you know,

2118
02:02:35.181 --> 02:02:38.060
of Libyan back or they'll come in here and like welding machine guns on their,

2119
02:02:38.090 --> 02:02:41.120
on their pickup trucks and there's this really magical thing.
You know,

2120
02:02:41.121 --> 02:02:45.710
I'm actually thinking of pitching in.
Well apparently,

2121
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:51.410
you know,
it's nice to see the bad guys actually Lucas,
right?
It is.

2122
02:02:51.590 --> 02:02:55.590
If it's that clear,
you know?
Yeah.
I mean that's,

2123
02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:58.940
I think that's exactly what I'm getting at where not a lot of people would look

2124
02:02:58.941 --> 02:03:00.980
at Gadhafi and say,
well that's that.

2125
02:03:01.370 --> 02:03:05.120
I would be unhappy to see his head being kicked across the public square.

2126
02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:09.980
I wouldn't be at happy seeing that.
You know what,
I don't think.
Yeah.
Get,
get off.

2127
02:03:09.981 --> 02:03:13.070
He is about as big a piece of shit in the world of,
you know,

2128
02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:17.840
rulers as you can get.
He's a,
he's a nice villain.
He wears a good black hat.
It's,

2129
02:03:17.841 --> 02:03:21.410
it's a,
it's a feel good for everybody and they're doing it.
The basically that,

2130
02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:24.940
I mean there,
there's NATO support,
but they're basically doing it for himself.

2131
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:26.630
And that guy,
General Wesley Clark,

2132
02:03:26.660 --> 02:03:28.310
remember that guy ran for president a while back.

2133
02:03:28.730 --> 02:03:33.730
He predicted all of this in 2007 on one miles CNN or one of those fucking shows

2134
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:38.750
or he got on and he talked about the,
the United States,

2135
02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:43.340
his agenda as far as acquiring,
you know,
um,
natural resources all over the world.

2136
02:03:43.341 --> 02:03:47.990
And Libya was right in the pile.
Libya,
Iraq,
Afghanistan,
Pakistan.

2137
02:03:48.170 --> 02:03:53.170
It was all these different countries where any describe it all in 2007 and

2138
02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:56.930
slowly but surely all these things again and implemented.
I think it,

2139
02:03:56.990 --> 02:04:01.990
I think what we're seeing in Egypt and Libya and Syria and Tunisia,

2140
02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:05.630
I think actually what we're seeing is something we didn't pretend.

2141
02:04:05.740 --> 02:04:09.050
It didn't predict we,
we didn't make it happen.
It's happening.

2142
02:04:09.051 --> 02:04:11.240
It's in many ways frightening to us.
I mean,
I,

2143
02:04:11.241 --> 02:04:14.600
I think the fact that all these governments are topic is not necessarily good

2144
02:04:14.601 --> 02:04:17.900
for our American business interests.
I happen to think it's a really good thing.

2145
02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:19.340
I'm happy to see it.

2146
02:04:19.341 --> 02:04:22.250
Like I don't really care what kind of site guys take over Egypt.

2147
02:04:22.251 --> 02:04:26.060
Just the fact that,
you know,
even a bad guys ended up running Egypt again.

2148
02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:27.950
The fact that they could,

2149
02:04:28.070 --> 02:04:32.220
it was possible to get and they get topple those particular bad bastards who'd

2150
02:04:32.230 --> 02:04:33.170
been around forever.

2151
02:04:33.171 --> 02:04:36.620
It was unthinkable a year ago to your average Egyptian that their government,

2152
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:39.930
that things would ever change ever in their lifetime or their children's

2153
02:04:39.931 --> 02:04:43.350
lifetime.
And it was an unthinkable at these dynasties would ever fall.

2154
02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:45.180
So it's really kind of awesome.

2155
02:04:45.330 --> 02:04:48.300
Just the fact that it sends a message that it can happen.
You know,

2156
02:04:48.301 --> 02:04:51.320
I think as good one,
I don't think it falls into the,
you know,

2157
02:04:51.380 --> 02:04:54.450
when I'm waiting for that big payday from a rock that was opposed to,
you know,

2158
02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:58.080
how are we supposed to be pumping the oil straight into American coffers?
Right.

2159
02:04:58.081 --> 02:05:00.710
But now that ain't gonna happen.
I think a,

2160
02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:03.960
it depends on who you're paying attention to or who you want to believe and it

2161
02:05:03.961 --> 02:05:05.610
comes to that world.
But you know,

2162
02:05:05.611 --> 02:05:08.760
there's a lot of people that believe that we've hit some sort of a peak oil

2163
02:05:08.761 --> 02:05:12.270
stage and what they're trying to do is just control all the areas where,

2164
02:05:12.330 --> 02:05:16.160
which will be absolutely necessary when oil gets to the point where we're going

2165
02:05:16.161 --> 02:05:18.060
to have to start rationing things,

2166
02:05:18.570 --> 02:05:23.160
we do in a really bad job then because the Chinese are basically snapping at all

2167
02:05:23.161 --> 02:05:25.650
up.
It'd be every,
everywhere you go in Africa now it's like,

2168
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:28.620
oh look at that nice new bridge.
We have the Chinese bought and paid for it.

2169
02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:32.610
Everywhere you go.
Like this is amazing.
Every major infrastructure,

2170
02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:37.640
a development that you see in places like Liberia,
um,

2171
02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:39.930
other African countries you've been to,
it's like,
oh,

2172
02:05:39.931 --> 02:05:42.790
there's those really thoughtful Chinese were here a,

2173
02:05:42.791 --> 02:05:46.920
I'm full Chinese and they bought all our oil,
at least 50% of the world's oil,

2174
02:05:46.921 --> 02:05:49.970
I think in like another,
maybe it's 10 years soon.

2175
02:05:50.730 --> 02:05:54.130
China alone will need,
when I first went to China,

2176
02:05:54.131 --> 02:05:56.130
it was like everybody was on bicycles and there's cars.

2177
02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:00.690
Second time I went it's like 50 50 now it's just cars,
cars,
cars.
As far as,

2178
02:06:00.691 --> 02:06:03.510
and how much time is this been?
10 years.
Wow.

2179
02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:08.110
It's so just accelerating in China.
It is,
you know,
what do they sound?

2180
02:06:08.130 --> 02:06:12.840
The Simpsons welcome future masters.
So future your overlord.
So we welcome you.

2181
02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:16.860
So is it,
what,
is it just the way they've,
uh,

2182
02:06:16.861 --> 02:06:20.640
they handle business is different in China now because they were much more

2183
02:06:20.641 --> 02:06:24.160
strict as far as commerce and things,
right?
They had much more rules,

2184
02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:29.130
communism on their necks.
No,
but I mean,
in a lot of ways it was like,

2185
02:06:29.190 --> 02:06:33.480
wait a minute,
you want to make China,
uh,
a competitive free market.
It's like,

2186
02:06:33.481 --> 02:06:34.950
are you out of your minds?
They'll kill us.

2187
02:06:35.250 --> 02:06:39.240
Then the really dangerous because there's a lot of them.
They work really hard.

2188
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:44.130
They,
they,
they've been put the,
the,
they're willing to work to get things.

2189
02:06:44.610 --> 02:06:49.310
Uh,
that's already an advantage over,
you know,
uh,
you know,

2190
02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:53.580
we're entitled,
we feel entitled.
We've times have been good for us.
So,
you know,

2191
02:06:53.581 --> 02:06:55.420
I grew up of a generation where we were all,

2192
02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:57.690
we were taught that it automatically,
you know,

2193
02:06:58.440 --> 02:06:59.970
our lives would be better than our parents.

2194
02:07:00.850 --> 02:07:05.610
I took that as religious dictum that was straight from God,
you know.
Okay.

2195
02:07:05.611 --> 02:07:08.490
I was disappointed somewhat,
but I basically,

2196
02:07:08.491 --> 02:07:10.650
I'm lazier than most of the people I,

2197
02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:15.920
I was raised to be lazier and I am lazier then the great majority of people you

2198
02:07:16.291 --> 02:07:20.430
see in China and India.
Um,
for instance,
who,

2199
02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:23.580
you know,
see though,
you know,
it's no accident,

2200
02:07:23.581 --> 02:07:26.860
you see these people take a double majors,
you know,
um,

2201
02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:30.020
the parents were rice farmers,
you know,
and,
and,

2202
02:07:30.070 --> 02:07:34.830
and the kids are now in university,
ferociously competitive.

2203
02:07:35.530 --> 02:07:39.430
Um,
you know,
that's what,
that's what it's about.

2204
02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:42.370
The desire for a,
for a different life.
We,

2205
02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:47.980
we got that life already.
So it's gonna be hard to,
to dangerous competitors.

2206
02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:53.660
Well,
it's,
there were already our landlord,
so it's really,
you know,
what in the,

2207
02:07:53.661 --> 02:07:56.450
in the,
in the world of the future,
you know,
Inter,

2208
02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:58.330
the more we intermarried with the Chinese,

2209
02:07:58.331 --> 02:08:00.070
the more attractive our kids are going to be

2210
02:08:02.610 --> 02:08:06.670
and we're definitely gonna be eating better.
Right.
So how bad can it be?
Well,

2211
02:08:06.671 --> 02:08:08.390
it could be,
we'll give you one of those factory where,

2212
02:08:08.391 --> 02:08:13.391
cause it con comm that hits that suicide in that drunk and leap off the top of

2213
02:08:13.691 --> 02:08:14.411
the building.
You know,

2214
02:08:14.411 --> 02:08:16.990
they have those nets all around the building and keep people from killing

2215
02:08:16.991 --> 02:08:20.080
themselves.
It could get rough.
You've been in China?
No,

2216
02:08:20.081 --> 02:08:21.730
never been in a year to China.

2217
02:08:21.850 --> 02:08:25.960
Certain major chain hotels like Hilton Inn in New York.
It's like not the,

2218
02:08:26.290 --> 02:08:30.280
to my mind,
it's not the greatest hotel ever.
Okay.
You go to a Hilton in Shanghai,

2219
02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:33.520
it is fucking Luxe.
Okay.
Any,

2220
02:08:33.550 --> 02:08:38.320
any chain hotel in Shanghai or Beijing,
uh,

2221
02:08:38.321 --> 02:08:39.460
western chain hotel,

2222
02:08:39.670 --> 02:08:44.530
the level of excellence and technical superiority required or expected there is

2223
02:08:44.531 --> 02:08:49.030
so higher than in New York.
They just at that level,
the sort of people who,
who,

2224
02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:52.780
who would stay at one of these hotels in Shanghai are a lot richer and more

2225
02:08:52.781 --> 02:08:54.790
demanding than their equivalent in New York.

2226
02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:59.230
So lot of luxury and development that you see in places like China where you

2227
02:08:59.231 --> 02:09:01.420
know,
Jesus,
you know,
this is a dysfunctional government.

2228
02:09:01.421 --> 02:09:05.080
You would think it's fucking the communist for fuck's sake.
You know,

2229
02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:08.020
how come they got this great rail system?
You know,

2230
02:09:08.050 --> 02:09:10.600
how come there are hotels are nicer than ours.

2231
02:09:10.630 --> 02:09:13.330
How come Internet coverage is better?
How am I going to get us,
you know,

2232
02:09:13.450 --> 02:09:16.550
five bars on my cell phone,
anywhere in China and you know,

2233
02:09:16.610 --> 02:09:21.530
the deepest darkest valleys ass end of nowhere.
You know,
you,

2234
02:09:21.650 --> 02:09:24.520
you,
you start to get this terrible.
I know I'm an,
I'm an American,

2235
02:09:24.521 --> 02:09:27.610
I'm a New Yorker.
We're the greatest country in the world.
I believe this.

2236
02:09:27.611 --> 02:09:30.010
Absolutely positively.
But you know,

2237
02:09:30.011 --> 02:09:32.320
at the end of the day it's like I just start thinking to myself,

2238
02:09:32.830 --> 02:09:36.940
if you know that,
you know,
the New York subway system,
you know,
to say that,

2239
02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:39.350
you know that in New York City subway system,

2240
02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:43.080
certainly not the best in the world,
it's idiotic to pretended it is.
You know,

2241
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:47.470
well,
we held the crown somewhere 2030 whatever years ago it was,

2242
02:09:47.471 --> 02:09:51.490
whatever it was,
where we were,
the shining light of civilization.

2243
02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:55.900
It was in 1970 whatever year it was.
But we still have like the,
the,
the great,

2244
02:09:56.380 --> 02:09:59.260
the great weapons.
We are the most powerful nation on earth.

2245
02:09:59.261 --> 02:10:04.210
And I think largely based on,
on really the,
the danger of our culture.
You know,

2246
02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:06.250
people when introduced to rock and roll,

2247
02:10:06.251 --> 02:10:10.590
we'll eventually topple their governments.
I think it hasn't worked here but,

2248
02:10:10.591 --> 02:10:14.450
but abroad,
wait til Rick Perry gets an office.
You,
I think our,

2249
02:10:14.490 --> 02:10:18.280
our great cultural,
uh,
export has been,
you know,

2250
02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:21.880
a rock and roll rap music.
Uh,
clearly,
um,

2251
02:10:21.970 --> 02:10:26.410
it makes people want to do whatever it is they see.
They see,

2252
02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:30.130
they kind of want in one form or another.
They kind of want some form of that.

2253
02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:34.280
So in your experience and all of these under the countries and when you see all

2254
02:10:34.281 --> 02:10:38.420
these different,
um,
you know,
regimes getting toppled,

2255
02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:41.030
you don't think there's any American influence in these things happening?

2256
02:10:41.050 --> 02:10:45.020
I think we're that good.
Really.
You don't want to see,
I've,
I've actually,

2257
02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:48.890
I'm a CIA nerd.
I'm one of those like,
like I'm not a Gamer,

2258
02:10:48.891 --> 02:10:52.250
but I'm a guy who about 25 years ago,

2259
02:10:53.870 --> 02:10:55.660
started reading up on the Kennedy assassination,

2260
02:10:55.670 --> 02:10:58.400
gotten kept completely obsessed with that.
And then it just,

2261
02:10:58.401 --> 02:10:59.211
I'm one of these guys,

2262
02:10:59.211 --> 02:11:01.940
I read footnotes and a footnote leads me to another book to another book.

2263
02:11:01.941 --> 02:11:05.120
You know,
I disappeared down the rat hole for 10 years reading everything.

2264
02:11:05.121 --> 02:11:09.740
So I'm really,
did you ever invest evidence?
Uh,
yeah.
Um,

2265
02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:14.240
you know,
my,
my feeling is we're just,
if history has taught us anything,

2266
02:11:14.241 --> 02:11:16.970
and if you read all of the documents from all of the controversial periods of

2267
02:11:16.971 --> 02:11:21.940
CIA operations,
we just don't seem to be very good at these things.
And,

2268
02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:25.210
and everybody rats and writes a book about it immediately afterwards.

2269
02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:26.960
So if it went well,

2270
02:11:26.961 --> 02:11:30.020
you can be sure you'd be reading about or would have been lead to a magazine by

2271
02:11:30.021 --> 02:11:33.650
now.
You know,
it's,
I just,
I don't think that's so sad.

2272
02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:36.530
I don't think we're that good.
Uh,
and I,

2273
02:11:36.531 --> 02:11:41.180
I certainly don't think we have much of an appetite for controlling the

2274
02:11:41.181 --> 02:11:43.860
university.
I think we're,
we're,
we're doing it.
We seem to be,

2275
02:11:43.861 --> 02:11:46.460
we work very working very hard to hold the down.

2276
02:11:47.140 --> 02:11:47.973
<v 7>MMM.</v>

2277
02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:53.690
<v 2>So you think this speculation about the CIA being involved,</v>

2278
02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:57.020
like they're probably just very,
very peripherally involved.

2279
02:11:57.021 --> 02:12:01.100
And there's just shit happening no matter what their major CIA operations going

2280
02:12:01.101 --> 02:12:03.020
on right now without it,
without doubt.

2281
02:12:03.021 --> 02:12:06.440
But I think this notion that there's an office somewhere where the whole fate of

2282
02:12:06.441 --> 02:12:09.010
the world is sort of decided what countries are good,

2283
02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:11.240
it would fade over the next 10 years.
Uh,

2284
02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:13.940
we're just not that good and we're not definitely not that secure.

2285
02:12:13.941 --> 02:12:16.240
There's always three people know about something.

2286
02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:18.330
It's a greatest argument about the Kennedy's,
you know,

2287
02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:20.630
the nine 11 conspiracy theory,
idiots,

2288
02:12:21.410 --> 02:12:25.780
the Kennedy assassination,
uh,
looney tunes.
Um,

2289
02:12:26.090 --> 02:12:29.450
if basically in this country of three more than three people know about a thing,

2290
02:12:29.451 --> 02:12:31.400
one of them is going to be on the stand crying about it.

2291
02:12:31.401 --> 02:12:35.030
The other guy is going to be writing a book about it and maybe two guys will

2292
02:12:35.031 --> 02:12:38.120
keep their mouth shut.
I think today,

2293
02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:41.150
I don't think during the time of the Kennedy assassination,

2294
02:12:41.151 --> 02:12:46.130
it would have been that difficult to hide things.
I think,
uh,
things were less,

2295
02:12:46.131 --> 02:12:49.180
much less transparent back then were today you have a history.

2296
02:12:49.190 --> 02:12:50.320
That's what's great about history.
You know,

2297
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:54.380
eventually if you're willing to wait around somebody [inaudible] to my view,

2298
02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:57.400
if you're willing to wait around or every boring grim detail will,

2299
02:12:57.420 --> 02:13:02.030
will eventually come out.
And,
and if you,
as in the Kennedy said,
so someone,

2300
02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:03.770
I don't know who said it,

2301
02:13:03.771 --> 02:13:08.660
they described the mafia theory as the halfway house for failed conspiracy

2302
02:13:08.661 --> 02:13:13.040
theorist.
It's like after you've decided to CIA didn't do it,
I did it.
It's like,

2303
02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:15.140
yeah,
okay,
well look,
it was the mafia.
You know,

2304
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:18.230
and there's of course there's all this great evidence to support that theory,

2305
02:13:18.370 --> 02:13:22.470
but ultimately I'm of the Oswald got a lucky shot really flaring up.

2306
02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:26.210
I read best evidence and that's one of the reasons why I first started believing

2307
02:13:26.211 --> 02:13:29.270
that there was some sort of a conspiracy thing.
That was one of the,

2308
02:13:29.271 --> 02:13:32.040
one of the first things that I saw that made me really reconsider.

2309
02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:35.670
<v 4>But later in life,
the thing that really got me was the Northwoods document.</v>

2310
02:13:36.090 --> 02:13:36.901
If you never heard of that,

2311
02:13:36.901 --> 02:13:41.901
it's something that they drafted in the 1960 [inaudible] or 1960 where a 61 or

2312
02:13:43.081 --> 02:13:46.800
62 where Kennedy actually vetoed it.
And all the joint chiefs of Staff,

2313
02:13:46.830 --> 02:13:51.060
the Joint Chiefs of staff signed it.
And then we're going to have fake American,

2314
02:13:51.090 --> 02:13:54.360
uh,
terror attacks.
We're going to get a,
a plane.

2315
02:13:54.361 --> 02:13:58.080
They going to have a drone plane exploded and say a bunch of people died and

2316
02:13:58.081 --> 02:14:01.380
they were going to attack Guantanamo Bay and they were going to arm Cuban

2317
02:14:01.381 --> 02:14:03.120
friendlies to attack Guantanamo Bay.

2318
02:14:03.630 --> 02:14:08.220
<v 2>We wanted to go to,
this was this,
was this a Cuban missile crisis era?</v>

2319
02:14:09.530 --> 02:14:12.660
There were,
there were so many complete.
So this is what it,
to me,

2320
02:14:12.661 --> 02:14:15.840
what's interesting about Kennedy's assassination conspiracy.
It's,

2321
02:14:17.770 --> 02:14:21.630
there was so much it wacky shit going on around that time.

2322
02:14:21.631 --> 02:14:26.580
So much of it embarrassing.
Um,
criminal scary,

2323
02:14:26.610 --> 02:14:31.530
funny,
really silly going on at that time that in fact,

2324
02:14:31.531 --> 02:14:35.070
the least interesting thing about the entire,
you know,

2325
02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:38.660
big picture of the Kennedy assassination is the actual assassination itself

2326
02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:42.210
because what everybody else was up to at the time and covering up was just like

2327
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:43.111
right out of a movie.

2328
02:14:43.111 --> 02:14:47.250
And the CIA get his meeting with Johnny Roselli and all these like mafia guys

2329
02:14:47.251 --> 02:14:52.140
that whack out Castro,
uh,
you know,
uh,
there,

2330
02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:55.980
there was just so much other embarrassing shit going on that in many ways those

2331
02:14:55.981 --> 02:15:00.270
stories and where they lead or a lot more entertaining and complex and,
and fun.

2332
02:15:00.660 --> 02:15:03.690
Then then a story of a guy,
you know,
shooting the president.

2333
02:15:03.930 --> 02:15:06.510
So if you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,

2334
02:15:06.511 --> 02:15:09.630
what do you do about when you see the Oliver Stone movie?

2335
02:15:09.631 --> 02:15:11.670
Does that drive you fucking crazy?
It would have,
I would,

2336
02:15:11.671 --> 02:15:15.450
would've liked to fill in a lot better if they just stuck with the historical

2337
02:15:15.451 --> 02:15:19.710
record and he invented scenes and characters,
you know,
which I thought was as a,

2338
02:15:19.890 --> 02:15:23.860
as a,
as a Kennedy assassination plot and character does exist.

2339
02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:27.690
And there were just certain things we're just do mention that the garrison jury

2340
02:15:27.691 --> 02:15:31.080
was out for like 30 seconds.
He's mentioned the,

2341
02:15:31.081 --> 02:15:35.730
Jim Garrison is a man of many interesting local,

2342
02:15:36.590 --> 02:15:41.540
uh,
a man with an interesting paths,
let's put it that way.
Not,

2343
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:46.950
uh,
did not,
uh,
not,
uh,
a reputation that was debatable.

2344
02:15:46.951 --> 02:15:51.330
Let's put it that way.
Um,
which is never good.
The case was bad.

2345
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:55.980
I mean he put a lot of very interesting stuff together and there was an,

2346
02:15:55.981 --> 02:15:59.580
all of it was like fascinating and a lot of ways,
a lot of it was,

2347
02:15:59.620 --> 02:16:03.170
it was almost more interesting than the,
than that.
There wasn't,

2348
02:16:03.171 --> 02:16:04.590
I don't believe in the octopus theory.

2349
02:16:04.950 --> 02:16:06.420
I think you've had a lot of really interesting,

2350
02:16:06.421 --> 02:16:10.020
very spooky characters who've been doing a lot of really sinister,
uh,

2351
02:16:10.021 --> 02:16:11.400
an interesting shit for a long time.

2352
02:16:11.401 --> 02:16:14.340
Whether or not they were actually involved in the Kennedy assassination is

2353
02:16:14.341 --> 02:16:17.340
almost moot because they were up to some really other wacky stuff.

2354
02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:20.790
Did the magic bullet theory bother you at all?
I think if you talk,

2355
02:16:20.791 --> 02:16:25.050
and I have talked to people who served in combat for a long time,

2356
02:16:25.051 --> 02:16:29.090
the story of the buddy who gets around through the front of his helmet,

2357
02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:33.910
it travels around subcutaneously around the skull and it enters out the back

2358
02:16:33.911 --> 02:16:35.700
without hurting the guy.
Uh,

2359
02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:40.510
is it everybody's got shit happens,
shit happens.

2360
02:16:40.511 --> 02:16:43.720
I am.
I am willing to believe that magic bullet theory,

2361
02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:46.930
I would be willing to believe it except for the fact that they came up with it

2362
02:16:46.931 --> 02:16:49.510
because the guy got hit with a ricochet under the bridge.

2363
02:16:49.570 --> 02:16:52.600
And so they had to attribute everything to three shots.
And I was like,
ah,

2364
02:16:52.601 --> 02:16:55.630
that she just seems like fucking shifty.
Like I don't what what they're called.

2365
02:16:55.631 --> 02:16:59.560
But when you've eliminated all the other suspects,
uh,
you know,

2366
02:16:59.561 --> 02:17:02.740
you were left with the likely truth,
I think.
And I,

2367
02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:05.740
to my satisfaction and I've kind of eliminated the other suspects.

2368
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:07.720
Woody Harrelson,
his dad didn't have any part of it.

2369
02:17:08.610 --> 02:17:11.650
Wasn't he like rumored to be one of the shooters?
You know,

2370
02:17:11.850 --> 02:17:15.720
wasn't that part of it's of course Howard Hunt was supposed to,
you know,

2371
02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:20.200
everybody's there.
You know,
it's like Mcdonald's is there.
Why is that so sexy?

2372
02:17:22.310 --> 02:17:27.190
Badly foot.
Loch ness,
monster,
Ua foes,
Kennedy the whole deal.

2373
02:17:27.610 --> 02:17:32.200
It's way more fun to think that Lee Harvey Oswald was a Pantsuit,
but remember,

2374
02:17:32.201 --> 02:17:33.780
he was a really interesting guy.
If you,

2375
02:17:33.970 --> 02:17:37.800
I think the book that got it close got it most right.
Uh,

2376
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:42.090
was a work of fiction.
The Libra by Don Delillo or it,
it's really gets inside,
uh,

2377
02:17:42.180 --> 02:17:45.160
uh,
Oswald's head.
I mean,
Oswald was a guy who,

2378
02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:50.520
who his favorite show is a teenager was I led three lives about an undercover

2379
02:17:51.191 --> 02:17:53.620
FBI agent.
He was an intelligent,

2380
02:17:53.621 --> 02:17:57.610
he was a spy junkie in today's world.
He would have been a Gamer,
you know,

2381
02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:03.430
can win any game he wanted to be.
He,
he,
he was a guy who kind of wanted to,
to be,

2382
02:18:03.490 --> 02:18:06.880
uh,
to do big things and,
and he tried very hard.

2383
02:18:06.881 --> 02:18:10.630
He wanted to be super secret KGB agent.
He wanted to be super secret,
you know,

2384
02:18:10.780 --> 02:18:14.170
wanting to be a marine.
He probably volunteered to the FBI a couple of times.

2385
02:18:14.171 --> 02:18:17.240
He was just a guy who wanted to do something big.
Um,

2386
02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:19.300
so I don't have a problem buying it.

2387
02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:23.620
So you had no problem with the allegations of them fixing autopsy photos?

2388
02:18:23.621 --> 02:18:26.650
I have problems with all of it cause I was up lost in it for 10 years.

2389
02:18:26.651 --> 02:18:30.920
But the Kennedy family had very good reason to ask for,
you know,

2390
02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:32.073
the brain.

2391
02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:36.790
I mean he had Addison's disease and the implications of of Addison's disease,
uh,

2392
02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:40.750
towards the,
the Kennedy history were not favorable.
You know,
apparently,

2393
02:18:40.751 --> 02:18:45.040
I don't know but apparently it has been said that he had multiple bouts of

2394
02:18:45.041 --> 02:18:47.110
syphilis.
This is,
you know,
you don't want,

2395
02:18:47.590 --> 02:18:51.430
the family didn't want to press and people they want this part of the record.

2396
02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:56.420
There was a lot of syphilis.
Holla at your boy.
He took it,

2397
02:18:56.950 --> 02:19:00.550
it was worth it.
Amphetamines in large doses at that early,

2398
02:19:00.551 --> 02:19:03.370
it is pointed out who knows what.
He's really a,
he had a doctor,

2399
02:19:03.371 --> 02:19:05.890
Max Jacobson I believe,
I believe was the name.

2400
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:08.980
He did have a doctor who would shoot him with the vitamin.

2401
02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:13.780
I think B12 and amphetamine according to one of the B mixed with speed.

2402
02:19:13.781 --> 02:19:17.070
That's how that dude was not uncommon at certain levels.
It was very,
you know,

2403
02:19:17.090 --> 02:19:21.460
a society thing to do back then.
It's a five hour energy drink.
That's what it is.

2404
02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:23.920
The 12 and a lot of people didn't even know there was,

2405
02:19:23.921 --> 02:19:24.910
who was the original doctor.

2406
02:19:24.911 --> 02:19:28.130
He was known as Dr Feelgood and that's where the name came from.
Dr I believe

2407
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:31.640
<v 0>it was doctor Max Jacobson night.
I don't know.
Legendary.
Wow.</v>

2408
02:19:31.670 --> 02:19:36.170
Sort of doctor to the stars back in them Warhol and Kennedy's disease.

2409
02:19:36.171 --> 02:19:39.040
What did it have?
It was at a motor skill thing.
What is it that I don't,

2410
02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:43.820
but apparently there were,
uh,
there are in the symptoms,

2411
02:19:43.850 --> 02:19:47.710
the possible symptoms.
I think there can be emotional,
uh,

2412
02:19:48.270 --> 02:19:50.960
an emotional content to the disease.

2413
02:19:50.961 --> 02:19:54.860
So theoretically it could have affected his judgment.
It was,
it was unflattering.

2414
02:19:55.700 --> 02:20:00.140
I believe he was in a lot of,
this was a guide,
a lot of pain to supposedly,
right.

2415
02:20:00.141 --> 02:20:03.420
Yeah.
But back then you just didn't want to talk about these things.
And uh,

2416
02:20:03.430 --> 02:20:05.020
I think a lot of people,
uh,

2417
02:20:05.390 --> 02:20:10.390
ran around in circles covering things up for their own reasons and in fact most

2418
02:20:11.211 --> 02:20:15.320
of them had really terrible things to cover up that back then thing is really

2419
02:20:15.321 --> 02:20:18.860
fascinating when you think about it.
It's not that long ago.
I was,
I,
I was alive.

2420
02:20:18.861 --> 02:20:21.830
I remember being sent home from school when Kennedy was Ted Kennedy was killed.

2421
02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:25.820
And um,
but I,
I,
you know,

2422
02:20:25.890 --> 02:20:30.290
I go for the simple explanation much of the time.
It's the good move.
Um,

2423
02:20:31.590 --> 02:20:36.050
I keep the crazy open.
I opened the door for crazy because I've seen some things.

2424
02:20:36.140 --> 02:20:38.300
I leave it open.
I,
but I,
I agree with you.

2425
02:20:38.330 --> 02:20:42.470
Most of the time I go with a simple door with the crop circles and Ufo pose in

2426
02:20:42.471 --> 02:20:46.100
the loch ness monster and big foot.
Most of the time I go for the simple door.

2427
02:20:46.101 --> 02:20:49.490
People are full of Shit and that story sucks.
That's how I usually go.

2428
02:20:49.550 --> 02:20:53.850
But I leave the door for crazy open photos.
They just [inaudible].

2429
02:20:54.300 --> 02:20:56.810
It was very convincing.
Yeah.
But you know,

2430
02:20:58.580 --> 02:21:01.980
if I was going to be from a company that faked the moon landing you,

2431
02:21:02.020 --> 02:21:05.780
it definitely fake some pictures about it.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.

2432
02:21:06.190 --> 02:21:09.590
You know what,
Richard Branson will be there like within the next five years.

2433
02:21:09.591 --> 02:21:12.290
Right.
He'll have a hotel on the moon,
no doubt about it.
Well,

2434
02:21:12.291 --> 02:21:14.600
he's definitely going to get people into space.
Apparently,

2435
02:21:14.601 --> 02:21:17.330
but it's going to be like for like $200,000 or something.

2436
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:21.410
They've already built it.
We were driving through I think,
New Mexico or Arizona,

2437
02:21:21.411 --> 02:21:23.330
I forget where,
and we're in this tiny little town and said,

2438
02:21:23.331 --> 02:21:25.090
do you know him at the airport?
Airport?

2439
02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:28.550
They're not going out there because there's bill built a launch center.

2440
02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:29.840
He's built the launch center.

2441
02:21:29.841 --> 02:21:33.790
I think they're ready to go face.

2442
02:21:34.090 --> 02:21:38.690
They're selling tickets.
Your Janet already.
Totally,

2443
02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:41.510
yeah.
You'd have to totally imagine the view.

2444
02:21:41.511 --> 02:21:46.040
The view would be whatever view that you would get doing like high doses of

2445
02:21:46.041 --> 02:21:51.041
mushrooms in the dark by yourself probably wouldn't be as spectacular as looking

2446
02:21:51.591 --> 02:21:56.120
at the earth from 40,000 feet above it or you know more than that rather well,

2447
02:21:56.130 --> 02:21:59.180
whatever it is when you hit space,
but that would be good.
A hundred miles.

2448
02:21:59.181 --> 02:22:02.780
What does it,
what is it when you're 200 miles and Beta tested a little bit,

2449
02:22:02.810 --> 02:22:05.270
whatever this space shuttle is,
when you see that those photos,

2450
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:08.960
when you get the full circle of the earth,
I mean that just,
it must be,

2451
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:13.730
I would totally do that.
Life changing.
It's like wait a little steep.
Yeah.

2452
02:22:13.860 --> 02:22:16.930
On the travel channel.
Cough that up for a of DVD sales.
Get me,

2453
02:22:17.300 --> 02:22:22.190
that's happened season for us.
Yeah.
You,
you,
you supplement your income.

2454
02:22:22.191 --> 02:22:26.220
They'll doing um,
uh speakings too.
Right?
You go do this new found

2455
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:27.840
<v 2>respect for your profession.</v>

2456
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:33.240
I basically do stand up for a meeting.
I'm talking about a lot of issues that,

2457
02:22:33.241 --> 02:22:36.480
a lot of things,
but as you know,
cause we've worked a lot of the same theaters,

2458
02:22:36.970 --> 02:22:39.540
uh,
and I do about 40 of them a year.
Uh,

2459
02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:42.200
if you don't get a laugh every 60 seconds you're,

2460
02:22:42.210 --> 02:22:46.610
you've got a problem and I would think you would have a lot more liberty,

2461
02:22:46.611 --> 02:22:49.440
a lot more room for it.
Still.
It's,
you know,

2462
02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:54.180
it makes me want to laugh every 60 seconds and if they don't,

2463
02:22:54.210 --> 02:22:56.410
if not in 60 seconds,
the one that comes in two minutes,

2464
02:22:56.411 --> 02:22:59.700
we're going to be really fucking funny cause they had to wait for it.

2465
02:22:59.701 --> 02:23:02.310
And I've really learned a lot of things.

2466
02:23:02.311 --> 02:23:06.150
I mean I've done so many gigs now and I didn't understand.
I didn't know it.

2467
02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:11.040
I didn't realize I'm becoming a standup comic because I'm,
I am,
I'm starting it,

2468
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:15.750
you know,
I still totally understand why,
you know,
comics,

2469
02:23:15.870 --> 02:23:20.440
so many comics drink and when you kill,
when you have a really good night,
I,

2470
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:25.620
I come away like,
like kind of depressed by it really,
right.
Uh,
the,

2471
02:23:25.650 --> 02:23:29.170
the,
the,
the,
the,
the pressure of not knowing whether you're going to do well,

2472
02:23:29.260 --> 02:23:31.860
it's like being in a ski jump.
Like it's all decided,
you know,

2473
02:23:31.861 --> 02:23:34.330
how am I going to do on this jump?
You don't know when the,

2474
02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:37.380
when the thing's going,
beep,
beep,
beep and need before you head down the chute,

2475
02:23:38.460 --> 02:23:39.600
you just don't know.
You know,

2476
02:23:39.601 --> 02:23:42.630
you'd go and feeling really bad one night and you kill and then another night

2477
02:23:42.631 --> 02:23:45.000
you go in,
you're all pumped up.
You think you're 100%.

2478
02:23:45.001 --> 02:23:50.000
And it's just like you're out there like,
God,
that guy.
But,
but it's just weird.

2479
02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:53.700
Just like the bartender I was talking about before,
you start to learn,

2480
02:23:54.970 --> 02:23:57.360
you know where to lean.

2481
02:23:57.720 --> 02:24:02.100
You know what word to come down hard on how long the way,

2482
02:24:02.460 --> 02:24:06.780
and it is.
It is this terrible information that,
you know,
I feel guilty.

2483
02:24:07.660 --> 02:24:08.700
Why is it terrible?

2484
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:12.990
Because it's been essentially it's manipulative and,

2485
02:24:13.010 --> 02:24:16.140
and when you're interviewed a lot,
or when you're doing the same routine a lot,

2486
02:24:16.730 --> 02:24:18.060
you know,
you start to,

2487
02:24:18.210 --> 02:24:22.830
someone will ask you off camera or offstage a question too.

2488
02:24:23.250 --> 02:24:27.440
You know,
something that you've just,
you're doing bit,
you know,

2489
02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:30.120
you slide into it and say,
well,

2490
02:24:30.121 --> 02:24:32.730
I was actually talking about this last night in the stage of the past leader.

2491
02:24:32.731 --> 02:24:36.600
But you're very humble.
You're very humble and the way you approach things.

2492
02:24:36.601 --> 02:24:39.630
And that's one of the reasons why you're such an interesting guy and one of the

2493
02:24:39.631 --> 02:24:43.630
reasons why your opinion is so respected.
But when you're,
uh,

2494
02:24:43.650 --> 02:24:44.700
when you're talking about this,

2495
02:24:44.701 --> 02:24:49.650
that it's what you're doing is all you're doing is getting the thought to them

2496
02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:54.860
as efficiently as possible and a method that you're already successful at.

2497
02:24:55.500 --> 02:24:59.820
It still what they need,
it's what they want to hear.
It's just,

2498
02:24:59.821 --> 02:25:03.150
even though you've already answered it exactly this way before,

2499
02:25:03.151 --> 02:25:06.960
you tend to think there's something wrong with that because it's not honest,

2500
02:25:06.961 --> 02:25:10.200
but you know the right way to say it,
it is the right tool to use.

2501
02:25:10.260 --> 02:25:12.720
I toured by basically had an evolving thing.

2502
02:25:12.721 --> 02:25:16.530
I started out talking and it became certain things work,
some things didn't.

2503
02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:19.440
But over time it would,
it would become,

2504
02:25:19.790 --> 02:25:24.610
it would an hour of solid material and he had the a at a material and you had to

2505
02:25:24.611 --> 02:25:25.590
be material be mature.

2506
02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:28.420
Like I'd go out and it's like nothing but fucking golfers and it's like,
oh shit.

2507
02:25:28.780 --> 02:25:32.020
You know?
Then I'd totally choked up.
I mean,
I've done casino,

2508
02:25:32.050 --> 02:25:35.830
I've done casinos were like belligerent,
you know,
drunks.
I mean I really,

2509
02:25:35.831 --> 02:25:38.950
how did you get started doing this?
I went out,
I went out on,

2510
02:25:38.980 --> 02:25:41.080
I was doing a lot of book tours and the books,

2511
02:25:41.290 --> 02:25:43.930
the bookstore crowds are getting bigger and bigger and so then they start

2512
02:25:43.931 --> 02:25:46.060
booking me in halls,
the bookstore,
you know,
so I'm basically,

2513
02:25:46.061 --> 02:25:47.020
I'm just looking to sell books.

2514
02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:51.370
I stand up there then and I talked for awhile about my book or I read from my

2515
02:25:51.371 --> 02:25:53.920
book and then,
and then,
you know,
I signed the book,

2516
02:25:54.940 --> 02:25:58.210
I started doing talks a while,
a book tour.

2517
02:25:58.211 --> 02:26:01.810
And then there are people who do this speaker's bureaus,
you know,

2518
02:26:01.811 --> 02:26:04.590
you want some macro economics,
macro,
macro economy.

2519
02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:09.310
So guided to talk about that are,
you know,
you need some Dick Jokes,

2520
02:26:09.311 --> 02:26:13.090
whatever,
you know,
the speakers bureau will have someone for you presumably,

2521
02:26:13.450 --> 02:26:15.580
you know,
um,
and,
and they just hook me up.

2522
02:26:15.581 --> 02:26:20.200
And I studied first I started doing a few corporate gigs and then theater

2523
02:26:20.201 --> 02:26:24.610
promoters to start a book in me.
So I just do theaters now as like if the local,

2524
02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:27.400
I'm sure we weren't so many of the same places,
I'm sure.

2525
02:26:27.430 --> 02:26:31.750
And it just suddenly I found myself,
well,
you know,

2526
02:26:31.751 --> 02:26:36.100
I've got an hour and then I do Q and a for another 45 minutes or until it's not

2527
02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:40.000
fun.
Not a poop jokes.

2528
02:26:41.530 --> 02:26:44.110
But you know,
those were the,
the buttons.
You know,

2529
02:26:44.111 --> 02:26:47.440
I've run up to this while I was enjoying your Carlos and then see a shit so much

2530
02:26:47.441 --> 02:26:51.400
because you know,
you run it,
you come up to this,
uh,
uh,
this point,

2531
02:26:51.401 --> 02:26:52.510
after two years,
he goes,
well,

2532
02:26:52.511 --> 02:26:56.450
I've done all the major cities now with this routine and it has been quoted in,

2533
02:26:56.451 --> 02:27:00.100
repeated in,
in,
uh,
uh,
in the local press.

2534
02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:04.360
And chances are if I said it in the first place live at some point earlier in my

2535
02:27:04.361 --> 02:27:07.870
career,
I may have written it or put it in the show.
So you reach this point,

2536
02:27:07.871 --> 02:27:11.440
it's like,
oh shit,
I need another completely new hour.

2537
02:27:12.370 --> 02:27:16.520
And that's hard.
It's very hard.
That is hard.
That's what plagiarism comes from.

2538
02:27:16.521 --> 02:27:20.160
And standup comedy,
a lot of it comes from desperation.
Yeah.
They just,
uh,

2539
02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:22.420
and then,
but then that guy's case,
it's a little different.

2540
02:27:22.430 --> 02:27:24.640
He's just fucking crazy.
But some of them,

2541
02:27:24.641 --> 02:27:27.760
they just need a new hour and they just get a little,
little funky.
You know,

2542
02:27:27.761 --> 02:27:29.800
it's just as funny if you say somebody else said it.
You know,

2543
02:27:29.801 --> 02:27:32.350
like I'll often say,
you know,
a Raymond Chandler said,

2544
02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:36.040
and then I'll say the thing and it just,
it was a really good fucking wine,

2545
02:27:36.100 --> 02:27:39.460
but that's why I used it.
You know,
spirit of it though is different.

2546
02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:43.420
The spirit of repeating someone in quoting them is very different than claiming

2547
02:27:43.421 --> 02:27:46.570
and for yourself.
And that's where it gets tricky.
You know,

2548
02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:49.730
standup comedy is a fucking weird art form,
man.
It's,
it's,

2549
02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:53.550
if there's any lies at all and then people are angry you,
you know,

2550
02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:56.110
if there's any bullshit in it and 30 faking it,

2551
02:27:56.140 --> 02:27:58.150
like that's not even his fucking name.

2552
02:27:58.300 --> 02:28:02.770
You mean his name is really not Larry the cable guy.
People will get mad,
man.

2553
02:28:03.130 --> 02:28:07.090
They'll get mad if you're,
if you're not honest about the whole package,

2554
02:28:07.150 --> 02:28:09.820
know they'll accept a character.
I mean,
I'm exaggerating obviously,

2555
02:28:09.821 --> 02:28:13.180
but they find out you don't really think the way you're talking on stage.

2556
02:28:13.181 --> 02:28:15.730
It's just bullshit.
Yeah.
I'll tell you though,

2557
02:28:15.731 --> 02:28:20.620
there was a casino I did to Harris Lake Tahoe and you know,

2558
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:22.040
was that I never had a crowd

2559
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:25.380
<v 0>like this is going to do.
We're drunk gamblers.
They were already,
there were,</v>

2560
02:28:25.940 --> 02:28:26.780
there were,
there were heckler.

2561
02:28:26.781 --> 02:28:29.450
I've never been heckled other than the occasional vegetarian,

2562
02:28:29.930 --> 02:28:31.430
but these were just drunk ass.

2563
02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:35.360
They would just heckling for them cause there was because they were trying to
do,

2564
02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:38.900
they were friendly hackers.
Right.
Uh,
but I just never,

2565
02:28:39.140 --> 02:28:40.940
I'd never contended with that man.
That is a,

2566
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:45.410
that's a skill you got to learn quick.
Yeah.
Well I started out,
um,

2567
02:28:45.470 --> 02:28:49.970
doing really bad clubs.
I did a lot of,
I did strip clubs where I did a,

2568
02:28:50.070 --> 02:28:55.070
I guested at a rather mc to Jack and Jill Strip club in Woonsocket,

2569
02:28:55.071 --> 02:28:57.620
Rhode Island where the a guy would strip and a girl was trip.

2570
02:28:57.770 --> 02:28:59.780
I've done some horrible,
horrible places.

2571
02:29:00.170 --> 02:29:03.920
And when you do a lot of bars and a lot of like comedy nights and bars,

2572
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:07.670
you're going to get hecklers.
Yeah,
no,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's all good.
I mean,

2573
02:29:07.671 --> 02:29:12.350
it's fun.
It's fun.
It's exhausting.
It's really exhausting.

2574
02:29:12.351 --> 02:29:13.670
It's a rush for sure.

2575
02:29:14.300 --> 02:29:18.500
When you have the perfect word to say and that the heckler gets shut down and

2576
02:29:18.501 --> 02:29:19.400
everybody starts laughing.

2577
02:29:19.401 --> 02:29:23.510
Tell me that doesn't feel like the most awesome shit ever.
Yeah,
that's nice.

2578
02:29:26.610 --> 02:29:28.850
I get a bit.
Yeah.
Thank you very much for doing this,

2579
02:29:28.850 --> 02:29:32.480
<v 4>man.
This was fun as hell I this all night.
I really enjoyed it,
man.</v>

2580
02:29:32.481 --> 02:29:36.170
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

this has been a dream come true man.
