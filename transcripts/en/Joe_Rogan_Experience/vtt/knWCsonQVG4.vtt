00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.863
<v Speaker 1>Hello</v>

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:02.973
<v Speaker 2>bitches.</v>

3
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.881
<v Speaker 2>I would love to play you.</v>

4
00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:06.010
<v Speaker 2>The dinosaurs are not real video.</v>

5
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.030
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>

6
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.410
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

7
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.860
<v Speaker 2>See if he flagged JV.</v>

8
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.800
<v Speaker 2>We probably can't play it on youtube where we'll get pulled,</v>

9
00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:12.634
<v Speaker 2>but we can play the Wii,</v>

10
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.391
<v Speaker 2>the audio,</v>

11
00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:14.224
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

12
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.001
<v Speaker 2>play the audio.</v>

13
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.680
<v Speaker 2>We'll put the video up on the screen and play the audio for you.</v>

14
00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:18.640
<v Speaker 2>And you could just fucking,</v>

15
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.330
<v Speaker 2>your head could turn beet red smokes can come out of your ears.</v>

16
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Because the thing is about these videos,</v>

17
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.460
<v Speaker 2>and this is the issue that I have with not just videos,</v>

18
00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:29.230
<v Speaker 2>but also with blogs.</v>

19
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.270
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

20
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.550
<v Speaker 2>you're writing things and you're not,</v>

21
00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:35.650
<v Speaker 2>you're not being checked as you're going along.</v>

22
00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:36.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

23
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.800
<v Speaker 2>it's just you broadcasting and idea.</v>

24
00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:40.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not a conversation.</v>

25
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.930
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>

26
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.980
<v Speaker 2>you can give off the illusion of expertise without being checked.</v>

27
00:00:44.981 --> 00:00:45.521
<v Speaker 2>Here it goes.</v>

28
00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Dinosaurs never existed.</v>

29
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.191
<v Speaker 2>And by my God,</v>

30
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:49.150
<v Speaker 2>Eric to bay,</v>

31
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>

32
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.690
<v Speaker 2>the flat Earth Guy.</v>

33
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

34
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 2>The guy that does 200 proofs,</v>

35
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 2>the earth is flat.</v>

36
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has debunked.</v>

37
00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:57.184
<v Speaker 2>Fucking,</v>

38
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

39
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.571
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

40
00:00:58.571 --> 00:00:58.751
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

41
00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Shills shows or listen to this guy</v>

42
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>of the royal society.</v>

43
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Don't you dare mention anyone's name assholes,</v>

44
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>natural history department in 1842 or in other words,</v>

45
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>the existence of dinosaurs was first speculatively hypothesized by young</v>

46
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 1>knighted museum head.</v>

47
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Coincidentally in the mid 19th century,</v>

48
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.680
<v Speaker 1>during the heyday of evolutionism before a single dinosaur fossil had ever been</v>

49
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>found wrong.</v>

50
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 2>They sound pause,</v>

51
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 2>pause every time.</v>

52
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Pause,</v>

53
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.443
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

54
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.740
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs.</v>

55
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

56
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.041
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

57
00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 2>we discovered marine reptiles and the first dinosaurs about a century before</v>

58
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:41.214
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

59
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 2>So that right there,</v>

60
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Eric,</v>

61
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking wrong.</v>

62
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Wups it's like,</v>

63
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 2>don't bring your flat Earth Bullshit into my profession.</v>

64
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm pissed.</v>

65
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.171
<v Speaker 2>But keep going.</v>

66
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

67
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.801
<v Speaker 2>keep,</v>

68
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:53.634
<v Speaker 2>keep us rolling</v>

69
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.360
<v Speaker 1>and stream.</v>

70
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Press worldwide.</v>

71
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Got To work hyping stories of these supposedly long lost animals.</v>

72
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 1>And then Lo and behold,</v>

73
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.470
<v Speaker 1>12 years later in 1854,</v>

74
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden,</v>

75
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.230
<v Speaker 1>during his exploration of the upper Missouri River,</v>

76
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.990
<v Speaker 1>found proof of Owen's theory.</v>

77
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>A few unidentified teeth he mailed to leading paleontologist Joseph Leidy,</v>

78
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>who several years later declared them to be from an ancient extinct track,</v>

79
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:26.980
<v Speaker 1>a don dinosaur,</v>

80
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.690
<v Speaker 1>which beyond ironic.</v>

81
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

82
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 2>that's because we can do things like look at modern analogs and see how teeth</v>

83
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 2>are fucking made.</v>

84
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 2>We know if it's a Predator or if its prey,</v>

85
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 2>we know if it's an herbivore or a carnivore,</v>

86
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.090
<v Speaker 2>we know how teeth are fucking built.</v>

87
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Even back then,</v>

88
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:48.660
<v Speaker 2>even when they're doing naturalistic drawings like this,</v>

89
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.600
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

90
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.240
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

91
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.461
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

92
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

93
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 2>the mcgalin on tooth on my arm.</v>

94
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 2>It is a predator.</v>

95
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously a [inaudible] Galla don or mega.</v>

96
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

97
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.643
<v Speaker 2>How do you say it?</v>

98
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.711
<v Speaker 2>It depends on your,</v>

99
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 2>you're in fast as can be on a different syllable.</v>

100
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 2>It's both.</v>

101
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not like nuclear new Cuellar no,</v>

102
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 2>no cause cause it doesn't have to use,</v>

103
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.303
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

104
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>but it's spelled,</v>

105
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 2>it's spelled the same but it's like dimetrodon or dimetrodon.</v>

106
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

107
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.670
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing in the [inaudible] on,</v>

108
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

109
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 2>you're God.</v>

110
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.313
<v Speaker 2>Keep doing this.</v>

111
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.780
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

112
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.613
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes.</v>

113
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.013
<v Speaker 2>Firstly,</v>

114
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 2>needless to say that it is impossible to reconstruct an entire hypothetical</v>

115
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 2>ancient animal based on a few teeth.</v>

116
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 2>But even more importantly,</v>

117
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.190
<v Speaker 2>it is dubious that a myriad of tile,</v>

118
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 2>bird and reptile mammal,</v>

119
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:42.691
<v Speaker 2>transitional forms necessary for the blossoming theory of evolution would be</v>

120
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.820
<v Speaker 2>hypothesized and then conveniently discovered by teams of evolutionist</v>

121
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 2>archeologists purposely out looking to find such fossils.</v>

122
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.080
<v Speaker 2>It is even more dubious that such fossils have supposedly existed for millions</v>

123
00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 2>of years,</v>

124
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 2>but we're never found by or known to any civilization in the history of</v>

125
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:04.384
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>

126
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Kill evolution.</v>

127
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.971
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

128
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

129
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 2>The reason why we didn't know about things beforehand because we weren't doing</v>

130
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:16.321
<v Speaker 2>shit like wholesale intellectual studies of science when people were building</v>

131
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 2>fucking pyramids and stuff like that.</v>

132
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 2>That's why we have different ages in,</v>

133
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 2>throughout anthropological records.</v>

134
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 2>We have the brand age and Iron Age and all that because we have to do things</v>

135
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 2>like figure out the land around us.</v>

136
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 2>And when we start finding really old bones like,</v>

137
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

138
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 2>this looks like a really big chicken bone.</v>

139
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.153
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

140
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Or this looks like a huge human with a single eye.</v>

141
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.023
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

142
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.120
<v Speaker 2>We start looking at stuff like that saying just wholesale fucking bullshit like</v>

143
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:46.744
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

144
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.923
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn.</v>

145
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

146
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.550
<v Speaker 2>but that's a,</v>

147
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.190
<v Speaker 2>that's what a youtube videos and youtube conspiracy theory video is.</v>

148
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.311
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

149

<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

150
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 2>One person getting to spill.</v>

151
00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 2>There's nonsense and w there unchecked.</v>

152
00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

153
00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 2>This is why I wanted to play this for you.</v>

154
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.853
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

155
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.753
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

156
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

157
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 2>response videos can be blocked by the original person.</v>

158
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 2>They can curate all comments.</v>

159
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 2>They can only allow certain ones through.</v>

160
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 2>They can moderate everything.</v>

161
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Same with a blog.</v>

162
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:15.034
<v Speaker 2>Same with all of that.</v>

163
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 2>They control their own criticism.</v>

164
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.790
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy right now that a lot of the Paleo community,</v>

165
00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:21.611
<v Speaker 2>he's going after.</v>

166
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 2>His name's David Peters.</v>

167
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 2>He's a jackass,</v>

168
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.023
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

169
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.150
<v Speaker 2>who's like doing stupid things like all reptiles or mammals and all of these</v>

170
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 2>claims should be in this and just all this crap.</v>

171
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.143
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

172
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 2>he wholesale copied an article from,</v>

173
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 2>a colleague of mine posted it,</v>

174
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.370
<v Speaker 2>which is violation of copyright because he's attempting to supersede that work</v>

175
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 2>by importing his own ideas to it.</v>

176
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.350
<v Speaker 2>He will refuse any critical comments to be posted on his wordpress site.</v>

177
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.790
<v Speaker 2>That's a little,</v>

178
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.900
<v Speaker 2>it's really common now.</v>

179
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

180
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 2>It's really common with people.</v>

181
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 2>The war of ideas in the comment section.</v>

182
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's being fought.</v>

183
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

184
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 2>It's because it's an echo chamber.</v>

185
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

186
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like people don't look as why do people think the world is flat or why do</v>

187
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 2>people think dinosaurs don't exist there?</v>

188
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Google boolean search is dinosaurs don't exist or creationism is true.</v>

189
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Evolution is false.</v>

190
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.570
<v Speaker 2>The earth is flat.</v>

191
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Chem trails exist.</v>

192
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 2>They're creating their own echo chamber and preaching to their own fucking</v>

193
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:23.170
<v Speaker 2>choir,</v>

194
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.810
<v Speaker 2>and then they have a message board and then go on that message board.</v>

195
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Massive confirmation bias.</v>

196
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.364
<v Speaker 2>Nobody,</v>

197
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 2>anybody that doesn't follow that line gets booted out.</v>

198
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's play more of this because it gets,</v>

199
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.153
<v Speaker 2>it gets better.</v>

200
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Journalism's May sonic renaissance in the mid 19th century,</v>

201
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.910
<v Speaker 1>David was and he wrote,</v>

202
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.620
<v Speaker 1>why are there no discoveries by native Americans in all the years previous when</v>

203
00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:47.920
<v Speaker 1>they roamed the American continents because they weren't doing a fucking earth</v>

204
00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:51.670
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs in the native American religion or tradition because they were all</v>

205
00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:52.510
<v Speaker 1>dead that matter.</v>

206
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Why would there no discoveries prior to the 19th century in any part of the</v>

207
00:06:56.951 --> 00:06:58.210
<v Speaker 1>world there could have gone.</v>

208
00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.410
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know what it was.</v>

209
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.670
<v Speaker 1>That's to the world book.</v>

210
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like the same thing with mammoth cyclops.</v>

211
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

212
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know what the fuck it was.</v>

213
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:05.421
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know.</v>

214
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 2>It was a massive,</v>

215
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 2>a massive elephant species.</v>

216
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 2>We thought it was a giant person.</v>

217
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

218
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.200
<v Speaker 2>When the first animals were discovered in the liberate tarpits,</v>

219
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

220
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.100
<v Speaker 2>before 1913,</v>

221
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 2>they thought it was livestock that got trapped in there and died.</v>

222
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Then they realized,</v>

223
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:25.460
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck cows don't have nine inch long incisors that are,</v>

224
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

225
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.150
<v Speaker 2>perfectly evolved to slash open the throats of things.</v>

226
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.100
<v Speaker 2>And then you started questioning.</v>

227
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 2>So the native Americans and all the people they were finding possibly scatters</v>

228
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 2>of bone and didn't know what it was.</v>

229
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

230
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 2>did the uh,</v>

231
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.060
<v Speaker 2>did the northern uh,</v>

232
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.450
<v Speaker 2>first people start licking bones and rocks?</v>

233
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

234
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:45.661
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

235
00:07:45.661 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 2>we discovered that,</v>

236
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

237
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 2>the science as it figures out going,</v>

238
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:49.610
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

239
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 2>this is porous material.</v>

240
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.580
<v Speaker 2>If I lik porous material,</v>

241
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.990
<v Speaker 2>it's going to stick to my tongue.</v>

242
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.801
<v Speaker 2>Holy Fuck,</v>

243
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:55.634
<v Speaker 2>that's a fossil.</v>

244
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:57.531
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

245
00:07:57.531 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

246
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.660
<v Speaker 2>this kind of just,</v>

247
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.590
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

248
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 2>the problem with you Eric,</v>

249
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.080
<v Speaker 2>is you are starting from an improper position.</v>

250
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 2>You are starting on a confirmation bias.</v>

251
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.620
<v Speaker 2>You are stating from the beginning that dinosaurs don't exist and you were using</v>

252
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.260
<v Speaker 2>pair of Delia and apathy Enia the ability for humans to find patterns in order</v>

253
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:25.390
<v Speaker 2>to fit your bullshit and then only cherry pick what belongs.</v>

254
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.531
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

255
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:27.980
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

256
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.480
<v Speaker 2>that's what he does with fucking flat earth.</v>

257
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with this is like I was saying earlier,</v>

258
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 2>because now the stupid minority has a voice.</v>

259
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 2>All,</v>

260
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 2>I dunno how many million people subscribe to his fucking channel.</v>

261
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Every single flat earth dip shit is going to go 61,000 people.</v>

262
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

263
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.830
<v Speaker 2>look at that 300,000 views and here's the thing.</v>

264
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Check out the comments.</v>

265
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 2>The comments he calms down are almost identical.</v>

266
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:57.691
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

267
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 2>34 86 to 34 94 are you kidding me?</v>

268
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Son of a bitch.</v>

269
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

270
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 2>but I remember being forced to have the same dinosaur toys.</v>

271
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Is Everyone Matt?</v>

272
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

273
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:12.540
<v Speaker 2>that's because it's called consumerism.</v>

274
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:13.561
<v Speaker 2>Flat Earth.</v>

275
00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:14.161
<v Speaker 2>No dinosaur.</v>

276
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 2>What's the point in making these?</v>

277
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

278
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.563
<v Speaker 2>Love this very much.</v>

284
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Thank you Max Haskins.</v>

285
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.983
<v Speaker 2>Don't breed.</v>

286
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Don't ruin dinosaurs with facts.</v>

287
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

288
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.180
<v Speaker 2>And there's more.</v>

289
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.140
<v Speaker 2>My favorite animal.</v>

290
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Here's another problem.</v>

291
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.630
<v Speaker 2>His voice is annoying as fuck.</v>

292
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:34.171
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

293
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:34.890
<v Speaker 2>let's play more.</v>

294
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh thanks.</v>

295
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.583
<v Speaker 1>Good luck to you.</v>

296
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Before the 18 hundreds no one ever knew that dinosaurs existed during the late</v>

297
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 1>18 hundreds early 19 hundreds large deposits of dinosaur remains were</v>

298
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:48.114
<v Speaker 1>discovered.</v>

299
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Why has man suddenly made all these discoveries?</v>

300
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.500
<v Speaker 1>No tribes,</v>

301
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 1>cultures or countries in the world ever discovered a dinosaur bone before the</v>

302
00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 1>mid 18 hundreds and then they were suddenly found all over the world in North</v>

303
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:01.771
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

304
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:02.581
<v Speaker 1>South America,</v>

305
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

306
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:03.541
<v Speaker 1>Asia,</v>

307
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>

308
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>

309
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.491
<v Speaker 1>Belgium,</v>

310
00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Mongolia,</v>

311
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.811
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania,</v>

312
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:11.811
<v Speaker 1>West Germany and many other places apparently had larger deposits of dinosaur</v>

313
00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:12.391
<v Speaker 1>fossils.</v>

314
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Never before seen.</v>

315
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Well because we find the first one and then we're like,</v>

316
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

317
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 2>there must be more of these out there.</v>

318
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 2>And then the bone more started between Ogden and marsh.</v>

319
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.920
<v Speaker 2>You had the man tell collection with the first Iguanas,</v>

320
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:30.921
<v Speaker 2>Don that was found and they put it and they made these really stupid statues and</v>

321
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.300
<v Speaker 2>put them in Crystal Palace in London.</v>

322
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.150
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

323
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Mary Anning,</v>

324
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.530
<v Speaker 2>one of the first theme will be first female pal paleontologist.</v>

325
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:42.660
<v Speaker 2>And one of the first people actually find fossils.</v>

326
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 2>She discovered the [inaudible] Mary Anning was the girl from the rhyme.</v>

327
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.620
<v Speaker 2>She sells seashells on the seashore cause that's what she did as a child.</v>

328
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.960
<v Speaker 2>And as she was looking for seashells,</v>

329
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.460
<v Speaker 2>she found a skeleton of an atheist sore buried and a cliff.</v>

330
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.773
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

331
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:01.860
<v Speaker 2>As like a kid.</v>

332
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 2>I think she was 12,</v>

333
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 2>13 of Holy Shit.</v>

334
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 2>I think paleontology,</v>

335
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Twitter is going to rip me apart for not knowing the thing,</v>

336
00:11:07.741 --> 00:11:08.281
<v Speaker 2>but come on,</v>

337
00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:08.491
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

338
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:09.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm hyped up now.</v>

339
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm drunk.</v>

340
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:11.443
<v Speaker 2>He's hyped up.</v>

341
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.211
<v Speaker 2>I'm not dude,</v>

342
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:13.044
<v Speaker 2>that's one beer.</v>

343
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

344
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.320
<v Speaker 2>I've got it.</v>

345
00:11:15.321 --> 00:11:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Had before you got here.</v>

346
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.950
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>

347
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:17.551
<v Speaker 2>We got excited.</v>

348
00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:18.510
<v Speaker 2>I've got nine more in there.</v>

349
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.733
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

350
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:20.773
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to need them.</v>

351
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

352
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:22.531
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

353
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:26.310
<v Speaker 2>it's just so Marianne and discovered a [inaudible] and once you discover</v>

354
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:27.144
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

355
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.860
<v Speaker 2>you want to go around the world and say,</v>

356
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.400
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

357
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 2>where else is this stuff?</v>

358
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Let's go somewhere that no one has been,</v>

359
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.310
<v Speaker 2>which means North America,</v>

360
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:36.061
<v Speaker 2>South America,</v>

361
00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Tanzania believes all the things that Captain Jack Ass just rattled off.</v>

362
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Captain Fuckface.</v>

363
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.520
<v Speaker 2>So Tom kept kept my face.</v>

364
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.460
<v Speaker 2>God fucking fuck.</v>

365
00:11:44.461 --> 00:11:45.420
<v Speaker 2>What did shit given?</v>

366
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.283
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

367
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.160
<v Speaker 2>Just something.</v>

368
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

369
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 2>I stole.</v>

370
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.370
<v Speaker 2>I stole shit given from a Trump thing,</v>

371
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.680
<v Speaker 2>but Gibbons shit given like a monkey,</v>

372
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:55.450
<v Speaker 2>like a gibbon monkey ape.</v>

373
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.800
<v Speaker 2>I think they're technically apes.</v>

374
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Gibbons are eight.</v>

375
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.750
<v Speaker 2>I think Gibbons are raped.</v>

376
00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

377
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.093
<v Speaker 2>They have tails.</v>

378
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.570
<v Speaker 2>No Art.</v>

379
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.950
<v Speaker 1>All Apes.</v>

380
00:12:03.951 --> 00:12:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Monkeys.</v>

381
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.590
<v Speaker 1>But not all monkeys or apes.</v>

382
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.491
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

383
00:12:07.491 --> 00:12:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Apes and monkeys are prime.</v>

384
00:12:08.511 --> 00:12:09.680
<v Speaker 1>But a monkey is just,</v>

385
00:12:09.681 --> 00:12:11.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not a technical term.</v>

386
00:12:11.091 --> 00:12:11.241
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

387
00:12:11.241 --> 00:12:12.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not a scientific term.</v>

388
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.130
<v Speaker 1>There was an article that was written there was explaining that all apes or</v>

389
00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:16.641
<v Speaker 1>monkeys,</v>

390
00:12:16.641 --> 00:12:18.350
<v Speaker 1>but not all monkeys or apes.</v>

391
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.363
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find that.</v>

392
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

393
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.240
<v Speaker 1>we'll go to that afterwards probably because like one of those beers.</v>

394
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

395
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:24.591
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

396
00:12:24.591 --> 00:12:25.580
<v Speaker 1>let's keep this rolling.</v>

397
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

398
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to see how deep we can go with this bake character.</v>

399
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what kind of explored for thousands for this time.</v>

400
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.260
<v Speaker 1>No one ever found a dinosaur fossil before.</v>

401
00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:37.760
<v Speaker 1>According to the book,</v>

402
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.140
<v Speaker 1>the dinosaur project,</v>

403
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.090
<v Speaker 1>paleontological journalists,</v>

404
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Wayne Grady,</v>

405
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:47.210
<v Speaker 1>cause the period following this from around 1870 to 1880 became a period in</v>

406
00:12:48.441 --> 00:12:53.240
<v Speaker 1>North America where some of the most underhanded shenanigans in the history of</v>

407
00:12:53.241 --> 00:12:54.740
<v Speaker 1>science were conducted.</v>

408
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.720
<v Speaker 2>That's because of the two paleontologists going at it against each other going,</v>

409
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.070
<v Speaker 2>I can find the cooler thing.</v>

410
00:13:01.071 --> 00:13:01.281
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

411
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:02.450
<v Speaker 2>I can find the cooler thing.</v>

412
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find more shit than you.</v>

413
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.510
<v Speaker 2>It was called the bone wars.</v>

414
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Ogden versus marsh.</v>

415
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.730
<v Speaker 2>You already talked about this,</v>

416
00:13:07.731 --> 00:13:07.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

417
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

418
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.900
<v Speaker 2>What was,</v>

419
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.100
<v Speaker 2>what was underhanded about it?</v>

420
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.143
<v Speaker 2>They would,</v>

421
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:11.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

422
00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.120
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

423
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.953
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

424
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.793
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

425
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:14.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

426
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.790
<v Speaker 2>sabotage each other's digs.</v>

427
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.100
<v Speaker 2>They would try and steal fossils.</v>

428
00:13:19.101 --> 00:13:20.300
<v Speaker 2>They were assholes.</v>

429
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.150
<v Speaker 2>But because of the competition,</v>

430
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.530
<v Speaker 2>it's like a fight when you have one dude that,</v>

431
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:27.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

432
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.920
<v Speaker 2>two dudes had been training all their lives and trying to do the whole thing.</v>

433
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.540
<v Speaker 2>The more amped up one gets,</v>

434
00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:33.650
<v Speaker 2>the more amped up the others gate.</v>

435
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.503
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a fucking,</v>

436
00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.353
<v Speaker 2>just throw down.</v>

437
00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.810
<v Speaker 2>This is what happened on an intellectual and fieldwork scale.</v>

438
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.400
<v Speaker 2>You had two guys trying to make a name for themselves in a burgeoning brand new</v>

439
00:13:43.401 --> 00:13:48.401
<v Speaker 2>field that just wanted to get in and roll and they had direct competition with</v>

440
00:13:49.611 --> 00:13:49.971
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

441
00:13:49.971 --> 00:13:50.804
<v Speaker 2>So it's going to be,</v>

442
00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:51.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

443
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:51.981
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

444
00:13:51.981 --> 00:13:53.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find these bones first.</v>

445
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:54.390
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

446
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.760
<v Speaker 2>it got nasty man.</v>

447
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

448
00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

449
00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

450
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.130
<v Speaker 2>think of it as Edison versus Tesla's paleontology,</v>

451
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.033
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

452
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Except Tesla wasn't very aggressive.</v>

453
00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:05.630
<v Speaker 2>He sort of like let all that shit</v>

454
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.500
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

455
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.333
<v Speaker 1>True,</v>

456
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:08.763
<v Speaker 1>very true.</v>

457
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Keep keep this going on as the great dinosaur rash or the bone wars.</v>

458
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Edward Drinker Co of the academy off of the Peabody Museum of natural history</v>

459
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:26.000
<v Speaker 1>began a lifelong rivalry and passion for a dinosaur hunting.</v>

460
00:14:26.001 --> 00:14:27.850
<v Speaker 1>I said on my bad,</v>

461
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:32.660
<v Speaker 1>but became bitter enemies during the legendary feud involving double crossing</v>

462
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 1>slander,</v>

463
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.543
<v Speaker 1>bribery,</v>

464
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.240
<v Speaker 1>theft,</v>

465
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.600
<v Speaker 1>spying and destruction of bones by both parties.</v>

466
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Marsh is said to have discovered over 500 different ancient species including 80</v>

467
00:14:44.661 --> 00:14:49.661
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs while cope discovered 56 out of the hundred and 36 dinosaur species</v>

468
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:52.880
<v Speaker 1>supposedly discovered by the two men.</v>

469
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.743
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

470
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:58.610
<v Speaker 1>close with 32 are presently considered valid as the rest of all proven to be</v>

471
00:14:58.611 --> 00:15:00.800
<v Speaker 1>falsifications and fabrications.</v>

472
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.710
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit Bull Shit,</v>

473
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.290
<v Speaker 2>not a falsifications or fabrication.</v>

474
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Turns out a lot of those dinosaurs.</v>

475
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.700
<v Speaker 2>We're the same species that were previously discovered,</v>

476
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.980
<v Speaker 2>so oh look,</v>

477
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.500
<v Speaker 2>this sauropod femur looks a lot like that.</v>

478
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:16.251
<v Speaker 2>Sauropod Femur,</v>

479
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 2>but I found this slightly in a different place,</v>

480
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.360
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to name it a new species.</v>

481
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

482
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Turns out those are both Brontosaurus or a pat disorders or triceratops or</v>

483
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:25.671
<v Speaker 2>stegosaurs,</v>

484
00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:26.504
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>

485
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

486
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:27.861
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

487
00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:28.161
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

488
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:31.280
<v Speaker 2>that is just an outright fucking lie that he just said.</v>

489
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.280
<v Speaker 2>When things are discovered,</v>

490
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:36.710
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that they're the same.</v>

491
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.950
<v Speaker 2>It becomes taxonomically what's called a junior synonym.</v>

492
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.383
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

493
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

494
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

495
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:47.330
<v Speaker 2>tyrannosaurus rex had another name for a really long time.</v>

496
00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:48.710
<v Speaker 2>It's totally mega,</v>

497
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 2>mega,</v>

498
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.540
<v Speaker 2>no one,</v>

499
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.433
<v Speaker 2>regardless,</v>

500
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.600
<v Speaker 2>whatever the first name for it was,</v>

501
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.050
<v Speaker 2>was technically the first discovered name for it.</v>

502
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.530
<v Speaker 2>But since tyrannosaurus rex became the more popular,</v>

503
00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:01.350
<v Speaker 2>the more documented,</v>

504
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.430
<v Speaker 2>the more thing that became a junior synonym or what,</v>

505
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:07.670
<v Speaker 2>or in that one actually became what we call no mum obscure him.</v>

506
00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:09.320
<v Speaker 2>There were the obscure name no longer,</v>

507
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.183
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

508
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.510
<v Speaker 2>no longer talked about.</v>

509
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.610
<v Speaker 2>But that's what happened.</v>

510
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:15.380
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't an outright fabrication.</v>

511
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.300
<v Speaker 2>It was two dudes finding bones of the same species or type of animal,</v>

512
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.170
<v Speaker 2>but not naming it the same thing.</v>

513
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.710
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

514
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 2>that's an absolute bullshit.</v>

515
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Eric Dubay outright lie</v>

516
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.590
<v Speaker 1>of them once claimed to find a complete skeleton either.</v>

517
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.380
<v Speaker 1>So all their work involved reconstructions,</v>

518
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.550
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

519
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.390
<v Speaker 1>to this day,</v>

520
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.360
<v Speaker 1>no complete skeleton has ever been found.</v>

521
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:42.880
<v Speaker 1>And so all dinosaurs are reconstruction.</v>

522
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

523
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:43.993
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

524
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

525
00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Su in the field museum is,</v>

526
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:47.720
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

527
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 2>not a hundred percent complete,</v>

528
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:50.630
<v Speaker 2>98% complete,</v>

529
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.810
<v Speaker 2>including formerly unknown elements from any other train.</v>

530
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.653
<v Speaker 2>Assor.</v>

531
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

532
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

533
00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.231
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

534
00:16:58.231 --> 00:17:03.231
<v Speaker 2>a commercial paleontology group just found like a 99% or almost all 100%</v>

535
00:17:03.471 --> 00:17:04.304
<v Speaker 2>complete dinosaur.</v>

536
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:09.380
<v Speaker 2>We have found entireties or near entireties of animals.</v>

537
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.340
<v Speaker 2>So He's right by a very small technicality of one or 2%.</v>

538
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

539
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:14.670
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

540
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.660
<v Speaker 2>But what he's implying is completely misleading.</v>

541
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.560
<v Speaker 2>He's implying that they're finding a shin bone and drawing and a dinosaur</v>

542
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:22.280
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

543
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:22.881
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

544
00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:23.391
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

545
00:17:23.391 --> 00:17:23.841
<v Speaker 2>like we,</v>

546
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:24.740
<v Speaker 2>we'll find,</v>

547
00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:26.720
<v Speaker 2>we can find 70% of a train.</v>

548
00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:27.291
<v Speaker 2>This horse wrecks.</v>

549
00:17:27.291 --> 00:17:28.370
<v Speaker 2>We know what they look like.</v>

550
00:17:28.371 --> 00:17:29.090
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

551
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.170
<v Speaker 2>we will use three d printing or casting of all that many.</v>

552
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:33.890
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>

553
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm happily admitting this because everyone knows,</v>

554
00:17:36.621 --> 00:17:37.910
<v Speaker 2>or at least everyone should know,</v>

555
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:43.510
<v Speaker 2>many dinosaurs in museums are what we call conglomerates.</v>

556
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.983
<v Speaker 2>It will be,</v>

557
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:45.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

558
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.970
<v Speaker 2>see a triceratops.</v>

559
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.800
<v Speaker 2>The skull will be real.</v>

560
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the front half of the animals,</v>

561
00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:51.151
<v Speaker 2>some ribs,</v>

562
00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:54.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe some tail vertebrae or the pelvis will be from one animal.</v>

563
00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:00.950
<v Speaker 2>We will have to use casts of other triceratops that we have throughout</v>

564
00:18:01.711 --> 00:18:03.870
<v Speaker 2>paleontology in other museums.</v>

565
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 2>Many of the fossils you see on display,</v>

566
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.480
<v Speaker 2>our casts now cast doesn't mean bullshit created on the spot.</v>

567
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.890
<v Speaker 2>It means very technically,</v>

568
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:19.190
<v Speaker 2>this is a cast that is a replica of an actual existing bone that was wrapped,</v>

569
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.700
<v Speaker 2>made a mold of,</v>

570
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.350
<v Speaker 2>and then filled with resin,</v>

571
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.880
<v Speaker 2>painted to the correct color.</v>

572
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:28.110
<v Speaker 2>It is the exact match of a bone that exists.</v>

573
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 2>It is not something we are just making up.</v>

574
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.790
<v Speaker 2>That is bullshit and I hate that when they come in and go,</v>

575
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.511
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

576
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:38.610
<v Speaker 2>that's link plastic.</v>

577
00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

578
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:39.910
<v Speaker 2>it's plants and it gets all like,</v>

579
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.111
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

580
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:40.441
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

581
00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:42.750
<v Speaker 2>you know why fossils are fucking fragile.</v>

582
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.440
<v Speaker 2>It takes us weeks to get a single bone out and then it is covered in glue.</v>

583
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:50.280
<v Speaker 2>It is wrapped in tissue paper.</v>

584
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes tin foil,</v>

585
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.900
<v Speaker 2>a shit ton of plaster and reinforcement is wrapped around it.</v>

586
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Then it has to be very carefully slid down a mountain on a car hood in one time</v>

587
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.860
<v Speaker 2>or airlifted out in another and put in the back of trucks and then take an all</v>

588
00:19:04.861 --> 00:19:07.920
<v Speaker 2>the way to its museum and then cracked open and then PR and then prepared</v>

589
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.083
<v Speaker 2>everything has to get,</v>

590
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:09.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

591
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.530
<v Speaker 2>get lift off it very carefully and we're adding more glue as we're going because</v>

592
00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:16.110
<v Speaker 2>if you sneeze wrong on some,</v>

593
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:16.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

594
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:17.640
<v Speaker 2>on some,</v>

595
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

596
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.080
<v Speaker 2>mineralized specimens,</v>

597
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.340
<v Speaker 2>it goes away.</v>

598
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.410
<v Speaker 2>It just goes boom.</v>

599
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:27.720
<v Speaker 2>So you have to work very carefully in a booth with like an error Brater so</v>

600
00:19:27.721 --> 00:19:28.141
<v Speaker 2>you're just,</v>

601
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:32.820
<v Speaker 2>you're shooting extremely fine particles just to get the top millimeter of</v>

602
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:33.654
<v Speaker 2>material off.</v>

603
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.560
<v Speaker 2>This is hard detailed work on things that are 65 plus million years old that if</v>

604
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:41.874
<v Speaker 2>we're not careful,</v>

605
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.410
<v Speaker 2>they fall apart.</v>

606
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:48.750
<v Speaker 2>We are not going to wrap something like that in fucking steal and put it up on a</v>

607
00:19:48.961 --> 00:19:49.470
<v Speaker 2>mount,</v>

608
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:50.303
<v Speaker 2>especially somewhere,</v>

609
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.010
<v Speaker 2>I dunno like Los Angeles where things like earthquakes happen.</v>

610
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:59.150
<v Speaker 2>It's statements like that that he makes are just fucking irritating.</v>

611
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:00.781
<v Speaker 2>Keep it,</v>

612
00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:01.291
<v Speaker 2>keep it going.</v>

613
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:02.124
<v Speaker 2>The last thing he wrote,</v>

614
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.170
<v Speaker 2>discoveries and excavations.</v>

615
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:07.710
<v Speaker 2>The same not to be made by disinterested people such as farmers,</v>

616
00:20:07.711 --> 00:20:08.311
<v Speaker 2>ranchers,</v>

617
00:20:08.311 --> 00:20:08.851
<v Speaker 2>hikers,</v>

618
00:20:08.851 --> 00:20:09.570
<v Speaker 2>bullshit,</v>

619
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.230
<v Speaker 2>bullshit,</v>

620
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.741
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

621
00:20:10.741 --> 00:20:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Building constructional issues they face is a fucking lutely bullshit.</v>

622
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you Eric.</v>

623
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Paleo Monitor.</v>

624
00:20:17.491 --> 00:20:18.360
<v Speaker 2>You asshole.</v>

625
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.470
<v Speaker 2>I am actually contracted to go out to fucking building sites and make sure</v>

626
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:25.800
<v Speaker 2>fossils are protected and dug up correctly.</v>

627
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:26.670
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

628
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 2>you know what Jack Ass,</v>

629
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.600
<v Speaker 2>I found a whale in downtown La.</v>

630
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.021
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you Eric.</v>

631
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Do Bay.</v>

632
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:32.430
<v Speaker 2>He found a whale.</v>

633
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.960
<v Speaker 2>I found a way only downtown away.</v>

634
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.111
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

635
00:20:34.111 --> 00:20:36.610
<v Speaker 2>you talked about this last podcast you were talking about how to,</v>

636
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.010
<v Speaker 2>they had a shutdown construction.</v>

637
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:38.844
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

638
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

639
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Cause building construction finds fucking dinosaurs and Ma and whales and pre</v>

640
00:20:43.471 --> 00:20:44.101
<v Speaker 2>stork animals.</v>

641
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:44.970
<v Speaker 2>You Jack Ass.</v>

642
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

643
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:46.900
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

644
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you farmers.</v>

645
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.433
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

646
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

647
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 2>sue was found on a guy's farm.</v>

648
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 2>There have been numerous dinosaurs,</v>

649
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.080
<v Speaker 2>numerous prehistoric animals found on a guy's farm.</v>

650
00:20:59.230 --> 00:20:59.771
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

651
00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:03.970
<v Speaker 2>there's an entire private area up in Bakersfield called shark's tooth hill where</v>

652
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:04.930
<v Speaker 2>they find meg teeth.</v>

653
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Miguel on onto all the fucking time.</v>

654
00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.470
<v Speaker 2>It's honors field in Bakersfield.</v>

655
00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:11.890
<v Speaker 2>It's on private land farmers builders.</v>

656
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.510
<v Speaker 2>Recreational people.</v>

657
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:13.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

658
00:21:13.751 --> 00:21:13.991
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

659
00:21:13.991 --> 00:21:14.501
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

660
00:21:14.501 --> 00:21:19.330
<v Speaker 2>A couple people hiking in Red Rock Canyon up near Palmdale found a trackway from</v>

661
00:21:19.331 --> 00:21:21.400
<v Speaker 2>an ancient camel rec.</v>

662
00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.350
<v Speaker 2>We recreational people.</v>

663
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:23.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

664
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.810
<v Speaker 2>This happens all the fucking time.</v>

665
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 2>The reason why it's happening more and more lately it's because people know what</v>

666
00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:31.090
<v Speaker 2>they're looking for now.</v>

667
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.140
<v Speaker 2>They understand.</v>

668
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

669
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:33.850
<v Speaker 2>there could be shit out here.</v>

670
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:34.421
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

671
00:21:34.421 --> 00:21:35.470
<v Speaker 2>if we're digging a road,</v>

672
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:37.780
<v Speaker 2>if we're widening the 99 freeway in Fresno,</v>

673
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:38.831
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

674
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:42.070
<v Speaker 2>we hit a mammoth or holy shit,</v>

675
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:47.130
<v Speaker 2>we found a whale in downtown la like with within blocks of the one 10 freeway</v>

676
00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 2>and good Samaritan Hospital.</v>

677
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:50.650
<v Speaker 2>I won't tell you where I can't,</v>

678
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:51.880
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

679
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to secrecy.</v>

680
00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

681
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.200
<v Speaker 2>It's just part of the part of the contracts that's,</v>

682
00:21:56.201 --> 00:21:56.711
<v Speaker 2>that's the deal.</v>

683
00:21:56.711 --> 00:21:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Because if you find something,</v>

684
00:21:58.810 --> 00:21:59.770
<v Speaker 2>if you find something there,</v>

685
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.760
<v Speaker 2>you can find more shit.</v>

686
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:05.360
<v Speaker 2>We found over 400 specimens of shark teeth whale's,</v>

687
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:05.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

688
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.480
<v Speaker 2>or a rib cage of a whale,</v>

689
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 2>snails,</v>

690
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.040
<v Speaker 2>fossil coral,</v>

691
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:14.190
<v Speaker 2>all of this because downtown La was underwater 7 million years ago and yeah,</v>

692
00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:15.430
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

693
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.001
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

694
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.260
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking bullshit.</v>

695
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

696
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:18.621
<v Speaker 2>keep going.</v>

697
00:22:18.621 --> 00:22:18.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

698
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Blind trench digger and mining industry personnel found all the time by people</v>

699
00:22:23.921 --> 00:22:27.940
<v Speaker 1>with a vested interest such as paleontologists scientists,</v>

700
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.440
<v Speaker 1>university professors,</v>

701
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.710
<v Speaker 1>and museum organization personnel who meaning trained motherfuckers,</v>

702
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:34.660
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur bones,</v>

703
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:37.150
<v Speaker 1>or who have studied dinosaurs previously.</v>

704
00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Fines are often made during special dinosaur bone hunting trips and expeditions</v>

705
00:22:42.401 --> 00:22:46.690
<v Speaker 1>by these people to far away regions already inhabited and explored.</v>

706
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.910
<v Speaker 1>This seems highly implausible.</v>

707
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.680
<v Speaker 1>More believable is the case of the discovery of the first original Dead Sea</v>

708
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Scrolls in 1947 which were unintentionally discovered by a child and which were</v>

709
00:22:58.331 --> 00:23:00.310
<v Speaker 1>all published by 1955</v>

710
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

711
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.980
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

712
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:07.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's perfectly fine to accidentally find ancient scrolls or silver dinero AI</v>

713
00:23:08.671 --> 00:23:13.671
<v Speaker 2>from the Roman period or a never before known pyramid and South America.</v>

714
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:15.091
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>

715
00:23:15.091 --> 00:23:15.721
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

716
00:23:15.721 --> 00:23:16.201
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

717
00:23:16.201 --> 00:23:17.970
<v Speaker 2>Because humans fucking made those.</v>

718
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.840
<v Speaker 2>But it's completely out of the norm for some kid,</v>

719
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:26.870
<v Speaker 2>some nine year old kid to be walking around Montana and find a mummified</v>

720
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Hadrosaur because I don't know why I made that distinction.</v>

721
00:23:30.871 --> 00:23:32.490
<v Speaker 2>That's it were weird comparison.</v>

722
00:23:32.491 --> 00:23:32.650
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

723
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:33.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

724
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:37.080
<v Speaker 2>it's more plausible the find the Dead Sea Scrolls in Qumran than it is to find a</v>

725
00:23:37.081 --> 00:23:39.050
<v Speaker 2>megalodon tooth bullshit.</v>

726
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.881
<v Speaker 2>Bakersfield's yeah,</v>

727
00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:40.690
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

728
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:40.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

729
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:41.140
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

730
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.270
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

731
00:23:42.271 --> 00:23:42.631
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

732
00:23:42.631 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 2>he's anthropomorphise sizing this and he's using a very,</v>

733
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:50.930
<v Speaker 2>an absolutely invalid invalid argument and a logical fallacies trying.</v>

734
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.220
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to,</v>

735
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:53.990
<v Speaker 2>its absolute false equivocation.</v>

736
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:54.921
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to go,</v>

737
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:55.131
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

738
00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

739
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:55.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

740
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:57.680
<v Speaker 2>you can't find this stuff because it's super,</v>

741
00:23:57.681 --> 00:23:58.221
<v Speaker 2>super old,</v>

742
00:23:58.221 --> 00:24:01.640
<v Speaker 2>but you can find this stuff because it's younger and it's humans and you know,</v>

743
00:24:01.641 --> 00:24:02.421
<v Speaker 2>people live there.</v>

744
00:24:02.421 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 2>So we'd expect stuff there.</v>

745
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.821
<v Speaker 2>Well guess what,</v>

746
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:05.654
<v Speaker 2>asshole?</v>

747
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:10.690
<v Speaker 2>There's 65 million years of difference between humans deciding to write shit</v>

748
00:24:13.341 --> 00:24:14.750
<v Speaker 2>down and go,</v>

749
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:15.703
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

750
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

751
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.630
<v Speaker 2>there's a day and a night.</v>

752
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 2>That means something's ruling the day in the night.</v>

753
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:22.430
<v Speaker 2>God's religion and industry and all that,</v>

754
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:27.460
<v Speaker 2>and dinosaurs eating shit 65 million years.</v>

755
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:29.570
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

756
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.730
<v Speaker 2>we were tree shrews and moles.</v>

757
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:32.683
<v Speaker 2>We didn't,</v>

758
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.160
<v Speaker 2>we weren't building shit.</v>

759
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.870
<v Speaker 2>We weren't writing stuff down.</v>

760
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Such a false fucking argument.</v>

761
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:39.771
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

762
00:24:39.771 --> 00:24:40.160
<v Speaker 2>this guy said,</v>

763
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:40.610
<v Speaker 2>check.</v>

764
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:44.760
<v Speaker 1>So some cases of a discovery of dinosaur bones by a disinterested person.</v>

765
00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:49.350
<v Speaker 1>It was suggested to them by some professional in the field [inaudible] in a</v>

766
00:24:49.351 --> 00:24:50.140
<v Speaker 1>certain area.</v>

767
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.450
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't also very interesting to note our special areas set aside and</v>

768
00:24:54.451 --> 00:24:58.240
<v Speaker 1>designated as dinosaur parks because we found a judging short.</v>

769
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Hector's are required to first obtain a dinosaur hunting license,</v>

770
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:07.590
<v Speaker 1>whatever destination these establishment finance national's hard paleontologists</v>

771
00:25:07.591 --> 00:25:08.280
<v Speaker 1>set,</v>

772
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:08.860
<v Speaker 1>it seemed,</v>

773
00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.150
<v Speaker 1>they found incredible numbers of fossils and tiny areas.</v>

774
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:17.510
<v Speaker 1>In one of the largest dinosaur excavation sites called the Ruth Mason Corey,</v>

775
00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.690
<v Speaker 1>over 2000 fossils were allegedly discovered.</v>

776
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:22.711
<v Speaker 1>Stop saying,</v>

777
00:25:22.711 --> 00:25:27.711
<v Speaker 1>fuck legend skeleton assembled from these bones are currently on display in over</v>

778
00:25:27.811 --> 00:25:32.811
<v Speaker 1>60 museums worldwide because dino head of paleontology at Laplata museum is</v>

779
00:25:35.191 --> 00:25:40.191
<v Speaker 1>amazingly responsible for 6,000 fossil species supposedly discovered throughout</v>

780
00:25:40.711 --> 00:25:45.000
<v Speaker 1>his career all in Argentina or oh really?</v>

781
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

782
00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:45.721
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

783
00:25:45.721 --> 00:25:46.650
<v Speaker 1>guess what Eric?</v>

784
00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:52.610
<v Speaker 1>I ran a lab that we had three and a half million specimens from the ice age that</v>

785
00:25:53.791 --> 00:25:55.740
<v Speaker 1>goes back 90,000 years.</v>

786
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.960
<v Speaker 2>So the libray a tarpits,</v>

787
00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:03.020
<v Speaker 2>the largest ice age mammal collection on the fucking planet and this stuff isn't</v>

788
00:26:04.081 --> 00:26:04.914
<v Speaker 2>mineralized.</v>

789
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:09.100
<v Speaker 2>It's actually subsumed with asphalt keeping the,</v>

790
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:09.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

791
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.240
<v Speaker 2>all of the calcium and everything intact.</v>

792
00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.150
<v Speaker 2>These are actual bones.</v>

793
00:26:12.151 --> 00:26:13.800
<v Speaker 2>When we find a saber tooth cat tooth,</v>

794
00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:15.750
<v Speaker 2>it's the physical tooth of the animal.</v>

795
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

796
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Which is kind of freaky to think about but,</v>

797
00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:19.500
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

798
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.240
<v Speaker 2>but seeing that it's like,</v>

799
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:21.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

800
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.640
<v Speaker 2>we find a lot of shit in places.</v>

801
00:26:23.641 --> 00:26:27.330
<v Speaker 2>The river of death and Alberta d when they're digging the pipeline,</v>

802
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:27.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

803
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.441
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

804
00:26:28.441 --> 00:26:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Mammoth hot springs.</v>

805
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:35.360
<v Speaker 2>There are things called death traps and Predator traps in sinkholes and natural</v>

806
00:26:36.421 --> 00:26:39.060
<v Speaker 2>trap caves and I don't know,</v>

807
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.180
<v Speaker 2>entire sand dunes falling on things while they're fighting the dueling</v>

808
00:26:42.181 --> 00:26:42.751
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs.</v>

809
00:26:42.751 --> 00:26:46.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a air tops versus a velociraptor that was found in Mongolia because of</v>

810
00:26:46.761 --> 00:26:47.491
<v Speaker 2>fucking sand.</v>

811
00:26:47.491 --> 00:26:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Dune fell on them while they were tussling around cause the v Raptor wanted to</v>

812
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:52.670
<v Speaker 2>eat the thing it that,</v>

813
00:26:52.671 --> 00:26:52.851
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

814
00:26:52.851 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 2>that's a rad specimen by the way.</v>

815
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.950
<v Speaker 2>You know what's interesting about this guy is that he knows so much is that his,</v>

816
00:26:58.980 --> 00:26:59.700
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

817
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:04.700
<v Speaker 2>his knowledge of the history of paleontology and of researching dinosaur bones,</v>

818
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.730
<v Speaker 2>he knows so much I call bullshit on that.</v>

819
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.640
<v Speaker 2>What I'm thinking is that he's reading from a script that he cobbled together on</v>

820
00:27:11.641 --> 00:27:12.570
<v Speaker 2>fucking Wikipedia.</v>

821
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.840
<v Speaker 2>I challenge him to go toe to toe with somebody in the business.</v>

822
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

823
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.240
<v Speaker 2>like me and go,</v>

824
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:18.601
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

825
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:19.421
<v Speaker 2>start throwing date.</v>

826
00:27:19.421 --> 00:27:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Start throwing specimens.</v>

827
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.960
<v Speaker 2>I will fucking own you be,</v>

828
00:27:23.961 --> 00:27:24.511
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

829
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:25.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>

830
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:25.951
<v Speaker 2>he's obviously,</v>

831
00:27:25.951 --> 00:27:27.060
<v Speaker 2>he knows all these people.</v>

832
00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:29.470
<v Speaker 2>He knows about the bone war as he knows well,</v>

833
00:27:29.471 --> 00:27:34.230
<v Speaker 2>who's in charge of all these different simple Google search of largest dinosaur</v>

834
00:27:34.231 --> 00:27:34.951
<v Speaker 2>thing found.</v>

835
00:27:34.951 --> 00:27:35.251
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

836
00:27:35.251 --> 00:27:38.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to write these three things down on this Manila in Manila.</v>

837
00:27:38.641 --> 00:27:38.911
<v Speaker 2>Fucking,</v>

838
00:27:38.911 --> 00:27:39.601
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>

839
00:27:39.601 --> 00:27:40.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that it's,</v>

840
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.290
<v Speaker 2>it's impressive and that it's conclusive evidence.</v>

841
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it's,</v>

842
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:48.270
<v Speaker 2>it's impressive that this guy has done this much research but yet still has this</v>

843
00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:51.280
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous idea and he's used to this.</v>

844
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

845
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:57.170
<v Speaker 2>He's using all this data that's actually factual about how many different people</v>

846
00:27:57.481 --> 00:28:01.920
<v Speaker 2>found how many different things and he's decided that this is proof and all</v>

847
00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.380
<v Speaker 2>information allegedly in front of it.</v>

848
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:04.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

849
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:05.101
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

850
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:05.311
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

851
00:28:05.311 --> 00:28:05.970
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

852
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Over 6,000 specimens were found there.</v>

853
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Fucking go with it.</v>

854
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.373
<v Speaker 2>Hunter.</v>

855
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Earl Douglas sent 350 tons of excavated dinosaur bones to the Carnegie Museum of</v>

856
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:18.451
<v Speaker 2>Natural History.</v>

857
00:28:18.451 --> 00:28:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Throughout his career,</v>

858
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:23.340
<v Speaker 2>all coming from the Dinosaur National Monument in Utah.</v>

859
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think it's called the dinosaur national monument now,</v>

860
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.640
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Lewis Chackbay and Dr Lowell,</v>

861
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.610
<v Speaker 2>a key off bay,</v>

862
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:34.670
<v Speaker 2>actually thousands of dinosaur eggs at a site of only a few hundred square yard.</v>

863
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.540
<v Speaker 2>It was called the tiniest giant exhibition.</v>

864
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:41.640
<v Speaker 2>How such fines have huge quantities of fossils in one area by just a few highly</v>

865
00:28:41.641 --> 00:28:42.900
<v Speaker 2>invested individuals.</v>

866
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:47.930
<v Speaker 2>It goes against the laws of natural probability to the likelihood of forgeries</v>

867
00:28:48.151 --> 00:28:50.520
<v Speaker 2>or concentrated planting efforts wrong.</v>

868
00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:52.450
<v Speaker 2>If you find a fossil planting efforts,</v>

869
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:53.640
<v Speaker 2>the plant,</v>

870
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.080
<v Speaker 2>what were the things that they planted?</v>

871
00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:55.550
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

872
00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:57.420
<v Speaker 2>there's dinosaur bones that they planted,</v>

873
00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:01.500
<v Speaker 2>that's the dinosaur bones made out of like residency.</v>

874
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:04.170
<v Speaker 2>So that is actually an argument with these jackasses.</v>

875
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:04.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

876
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:05.281
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

877
00:29:05.281 --> 00:29:06.630
<v Speaker 2>so big Paleo.</v>

878
00:29:06.631 --> 00:29:07.710
<v Speaker 2>The big paleontologist,</v>

879
00:29:07.711 --> 00:29:10.200
<v Speaker 2>people like me being Paleo,</v>

880
00:29:10.201 --> 00:29:10.711
<v Speaker 2>Paleo,</v>

881
00:29:10.711 --> 00:29:11.544
<v Speaker 2>big Pharma,</v>

882
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.541
<v Speaker 2>big Pharma,</v>

883
00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:13.680
<v Speaker 2>and big they,</v>

884
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.270
<v Speaker 2>and you know all that podcast,</v>

885
00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.113
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

886
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.880
<v Speaker 2>We're big podcasts where an industry,</v>

887
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:23.930
<v Speaker 2>so they say they not in the black man,</v>

888
00:29:24.211 --> 00:29:24.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

889
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.290
<v Speaker 2>black helicopter day,</v>

890
00:29:25.291 --> 00:29:30.291
<v Speaker 2>but they as in the detractors state that paleontologists like me,</v>

891
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.660
<v Speaker 2>we'll create a fossil,</v>

892
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:39.020
<v Speaker 2>whether it's like a cast or we'll just make one up and on these expeditions we</v>

893
00:29:41.201 --> 00:29:46.201
<v Speaker 2>go out and we actually bury it and uncover it and make the news and all that.</v>

894
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.291
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

895
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:48.400
<v Speaker 2>if that was true,</v>

896
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.293
<v Speaker 2>Eric,</v>

897
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.800
<v Speaker 2>why is it that when we find something say in,</v>

898
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

899
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 2>2008</v>

900
00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:57.300
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

901
00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:02.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not usually written about until say 2012 and that's just a symbol,</v>

902
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.600
<v Speaker 2>a single note in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology,</v>

903
00:30:06.601 --> 00:30:11.601
<v Speaker 2>which I guarantee you've never read or it's done as a poster at the Society of</v>

904
00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:12.541
<v Speaker 2>Vertebrate Paleontology,</v>

905
00:30:12.541 --> 00:30:14.550
<v Speaker 2>which I will absolutely guarantee you've never been to.</v>

906
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:16.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

907
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.730
<v Speaker 2>And then the fossils still in prep at that point,</v>

908
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.590
<v Speaker 2>we haven't done all the research on it.</v>

909
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.720
<v Speaker 2>It's still undiscovered fossil found.</v>

910
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:28.140
<v Speaker 2>If we are going out and investing all of this money in order to make these fakes</v>

911
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.990
<v Speaker 2>and bury them and pay all of these people to shut them up and huge excavations</v>

912
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

913
00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.550
<v Speaker 2>we would kind of want to recoup that money as fast as possible and immediately</v>

914
00:30:39.551 --> 00:30:44.551
<v Speaker 2>dump it to the news and get paid for spokesman ships and all of that,</v>

915
00:30:44.561 --> 00:30:45.460
<v Speaker 2>but we don't.</v>

916
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.620
<v Speaker 2>We suffer natural history.</v>

917
00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Museums are some of the lowest donated two institutions on the planet.</v>

918
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.250
<v Speaker 2>Art Museums are generally number one.</v>

919
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.570
<v Speaker 2>There are people that get laid off all the time from museums,</v>

920
00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.280
<v Speaker 2>museums close.</v>

921
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.390
<v Speaker 2>If we were making all this money and making all this fame,</v>

922
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.300
<v Speaker 2>why are there paleontologists out of a job?</v>

923
00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Why do I know a dozen monitors that don't have work right now?</v>

924
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Why are their museums that have problem actually getting a budget to get an</v>

925
00:31:16.691 --> 00:31:19.420
<v Speaker 2>excavation going that they have to use private donors,</v>

926
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:21.250
<v Speaker 2>that they have to use their board of directors,</v>

927
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:24.640
<v Speaker 2>that they have to go from a county museum to a foundation,</v>

928
00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.730
<v Speaker 2>nonprofit non profit.</v>

929
00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.970
<v Speaker 2>This is such a line of fucking bullshit that,</v>

930
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean that that pisses me off because his simple statements are looping in</v>

931
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:42.270
<v Speaker 2>thousands and tens of thousands of employees and museums and all of that</v>

932
00:31:42.271 --> 00:31:43.260
<v Speaker 2>worldwide.</v>

933
00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.880
<v Speaker 2>This would be one of the largest conspiracies ever other than,</v>

934
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:48.330
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

935
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Moon hoax is a NASA earth flat earth and shit other he does.</v>

936
00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

937
00:31:52.021 --> 00:31:52.854
<v Speaker 2>That is the other one.</v>

938
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:53.933
<v Speaker 2>Keep gone.</v>

939
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

940
00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.373
<v Speaker 2>let's get them one on one.</v>

941
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaur bones sell for a lot of money at auctions.</v>

942
00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.950
<v Speaker 1>It is a profitable business.</v>

943
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:03.890
<v Speaker 1>There is pressure for academics to publish papers.</v>

944
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Museums are in the business of producing displays that are popular and</v>

945
00:32:07.851 --> 00:32:08.330
<v Speaker 1>appealing.</v>

946
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:12.680
<v Speaker 1>What the nonprofit uselessness media need to produce material to sell to stay in</v>

947
00:32:12.681 --> 00:32:13.514
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

948
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:18.320
<v Speaker 1>The mainstream media loves to hype alleged dinosaur fines much just to be gained</v>

949
00:32:18.321 --> 00:32:23.321
<v Speaker 1>by converting a bland non dinosaur discovery of a bone of modern origin into an</v>

950
00:32:23.871 --> 00:32:25.070
<v Speaker 1>impressive dinosaur.</v>

951
00:32:25.071 --> 00:32:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Find and letting artists interpretations and imaginations take the spotlight.</v>

952
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:29.761
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

953
00:32:29.761 --> 00:32:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Rather than the basic boring real find.</v>

954
00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

955
00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:33.010
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

956
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:34.170
<v Speaker 2>if that's true,</v>

957
00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.560
<v Speaker 2>then why do dinosaurs become passe?</v>

958
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Why does somebody like who has been on,</v>

959
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:41.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

960
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:41.931
<v Speaker 2>13,</v>

961
00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:44.900
<v Speaker 2>14 different television shows talking about paleontology,</v>

962
00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:45.860
<v Speaker 2>geology and all that.</v>

963
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.620
<v Speaker 2>I have pitched dinosaur,</v>

964
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:52.250
<v Speaker 2>like live dig stuff to BBC and all of that.</v>

965
00:32:52.251 --> 00:32:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm consulting on a couple projects right now,</v>

966
00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:55.041
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

967
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:55.874
<v Speaker 2>can't name them,</v>

968
00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.470
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

969
00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:59.300
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs become passe very,</v>

970
00:32:59.301 --> 00:33:00.830
<v Speaker 2>very quickly because people are like,</v>

971
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:01.131
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

972
00:33:01.131 --> 00:33:01.341
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

973
00:33:01.341 --> 00:33:02.210
<v Speaker 2>New dinosaurs found.</v>

974
00:33:02.211 --> 00:33:02.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

975
00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:03.164
<v Speaker 2>Big Deal.</v>

976
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Or Oh well brontosauruses back.</v>

977
00:33:04.981 --> 00:33:05.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

978
00:33:05.131 --> 00:33:05.964
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

979
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:08.670
<v Speaker 2>But the mainstream media as he said,</v>

980
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.530
<v Speaker 2>is just like,</v>

981
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:11.930
<v Speaker 2>they love a dinosaur story,</v>

982
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.800
<v Speaker 2>but that's bullshit.</v>

983
00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.120
<v Speaker 2>That's absolute bullshit.</v>

984
00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 2>When was the women's the last like dinosaur document?</v>

985
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:17.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

986
00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:17.894
<v Speaker 2>there was um,</v>

987
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

988
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:19.933
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

989
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:21.471
<v Speaker 2>what was it called?</v>

990
00:33:21.471 --> 00:33:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Autopsy of a t rex with,</v>

991
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

992
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.190
<v Speaker 2>my friend Tori and uh,</v>

993
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.053
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

994
00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:26.571
<v Speaker 2>that okay.</v>

995
00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:27.790
<v Speaker 2>That was a speculative science show.</v>

996
00:33:27.791 --> 00:33:28.101
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

997
00:33:28.101 --> 00:33:31.040
<v Speaker 2>what happens if we found a t rex and cut it open and do an autopsy?</v>

998
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
<v Speaker 2>That was a hit and then paleontology TV died again two years ago.</v>

999
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.200
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

1000
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.250
<v Speaker 2>to our national geographic documentary about digging up wooly mammoths in that</v>

1001
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.020
<v Speaker 2>it aired a night.</v>

1002
00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.720
<v Speaker 2>There was a little bit of press fucking done.</v>

1003
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:49.820

1006
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:54.740

<v Speaker 2>he'd be a fun,</v>

1086
00:35:58.830 --> 00:35:59.600
<v Speaker 2>he would be Rad.</v>

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:02.370
<v Speaker 2>If he's ever on the show,</v>

1091
00:36:02.371 --> 00:36:05.190
<v Speaker 2>I want to be outside waiting with a fucking baseball bat.</v>

1092
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:05.611
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1093
00:36:05.611 --> 00:36:07.800
<v Speaker 2>how do you want to be violent with him?</v>

1094
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Almost almost that you want to talk to him.</v>

1095
00:36:09.991 --> 00:36:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Would you have to meet?</v>

1096
00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:14.880
<v Speaker 2>I think you could gain a lot from sitting down with a guy like this and just</v>

1097
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:18.420
<v Speaker 2>sort of picking them apart because you would realize what he was wrong about and</v>

1098
00:36:18.421 --> 00:36:21.750
<v Speaker 2>instead of him being able to just spout off on a youtube video who'd would be</v>

1099
00:36:21.751 --> 00:36:24.870
<v Speaker 2>checked at every step of the way whenever he said something incorrect.</v>

1100
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1101
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.890
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is the only reason why I would do that,</v>

1102
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.050
<v Speaker 2>he will never change his mind.</v>

1103
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:31.711
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1104
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:32.760
<v Speaker 2>he's probably crazy.</v>

1105
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1106
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:34.613
<v Speaker 2>Duh.</v>

1107
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.060
<v Speaker 2>He's absolutely crazy.</v>

1108
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.310
<v Speaker 2>But think about it right now.</v>

1109
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.270
<v Speaker 2>You have 4 million subscribers that now know this video exists,</v>

1110
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.920
<v Speaker 2>that no Eric debased name,</v>

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:47.640
<v Speaker 2>that know that paleontologist w can get riled up by this guy.</v>

1112
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.440
<v Speaker 2>They're now going to go look,</v>

1113
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.320
<v Speaker 2>if any one of your listeners is on the fence about dinosaurs,</v>

1114
00:36:52.321 --> 00:36:53.550
<v Speaker 2>why would you be?</v>

1115
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.950
<v Speaker 2>But you could have some,</v>

1116
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.940
<v Speaker 2>those are the people that I would have to try and convince.</v>

1117
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.470
<v Speaker 2>I will never convince him.</v>

1118
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:05.790
<v Speaker 2>I will mock the living shit out of him until he wants to put himself into a</v>

1119
00:37:05.791 --> 00:37:06.630
<v Speaker 2>chipper shredder.</v>

1120
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:09.540
<v Speaker 2>But I will never convince him.</v>

1121
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:10.680
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

1122
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.220
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1123
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.001
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

1124
00:37:12.001 --> 00:37:14.220
<v Speaker 2>So all you Sai Khan people out there,</v>

1125
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.600
<v Speaker 2>we don't do it to try and convince the big mouth pieces for these movements were</v>

1126
00:37:21.511 --> 00:37:25.650
<v Speaker 2>trying to go for the people that aren't quite sure if we embarrass the living</v>

1131
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.940

1132
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:34.200
<v Speaker 2>or the dinosaurs didn't exist,</v>

1133
00:37:34.201 --> 00:37:35.640
<v Speaker 2>or creationism exists,</v>
