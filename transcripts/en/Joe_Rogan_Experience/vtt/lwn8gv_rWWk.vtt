1
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Day One of legal marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bert Kreischer.</v>

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.990
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel any different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it feel less naughty?</v>

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4
00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:10.124
<v Speaker 2>I'm just worried that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>clog up the dispensary's the people </v>

5
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:12.921
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Because now you have to use the wait in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the waiting room sometimes.</v>

7
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Now that it's going to be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they're like one in one</v>

8
00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:20.390
<v Speaker 2>out thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna be a fucking nightmare.</v>

9
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Are they allowed to just open up down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the general public?</v>

10
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:23.544
<v Speaker 1>Is that how it works?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just looking right before we </v>

11
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:25.554
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have until 2018 to start </v>

12
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:29.650
<v Speaker 1>issuing licenses and 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>

13
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>The current dispensary's can only sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>to their current patients.</v>

14
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Like they can't sell the people walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>in off the street.</v>

15
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 1>They're going to change some rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

16
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.393
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But 2018 before they start giving out </v>

17
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>licenses haven't tilled that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't push it until that long.</v>

18
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.853
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they wanted to hold back and dig </v>

19
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>their heels in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

20
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have at the very most,</v>

21
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 1>a year before it just get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes like Colorado,</v>

22
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.120
<v Speaker 1>which is Carla was goddamn while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>circling.</v>

23
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:56.954
<v Speaker 1>It happened in Colorado too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took him about a year before they </v>

24
00:00:58.201 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 1>figured everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you,</v>

25
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you been down and gone down to like</v>

26
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>the areas of Colorado where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling pot now?</v>

27
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went with you right?</v>

28
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Because you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

29
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.703
<v Speaker 1>we didn't go down to the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a couple stores on my own </v>

30
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:11.641
<v Speaker 1>without you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

31
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.233
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've driven by them but I haven't gone </v>

33
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:18.690
<v Speaker 1>in and checked them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what's going to happen here.</v>

34
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be crazy and it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be better for everybody.</v>

35
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be better for the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be better for people.</v>

36
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 2>My wife doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't smoke weed at all and voted yes.</v>

37
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.890

<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

38

<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

39
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.740

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she voted for um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>64.</v>

44
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 2>That might've been my favorite night </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment of the whole night last night.</v>

45
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.440
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty awesome by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I give 100 percent credit to Jamie.</v>

46
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.540
<v Speaker 2>That was like you gave me an ace in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hole.</v>

47
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.760
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting off the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even have a mic at time.</v>

48
00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:49.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Jamie just goes breaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>news and hands me his phone.</v>

49
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.210
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't even reading it up the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I grabbed the mic and I go,</v>

50
00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:53.044
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have breaking news prop 64 has been </v>

56
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm a whiskey guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was stoned too.</v>

59
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.890

<v Speaker 1>but good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh mercy was such a beautiful night.</v>

64
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>That was probably the most fun I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>had on a podcast.</v>

65
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:35.204
<v Speaker 1>I keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said that before because I had </v>

66
00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:36.740
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like borough had me laughing harder </v>

<v Speaker 1>laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so fun.</v>

72
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Everything was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

73
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.893
<v Speaker 2>The bar me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have me with that line because you </v>

74
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:57.280
<v Speaker 2>guys see that picture of trump looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at his wife voting and you were like,</v>

75
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 2>what did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

76
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 2>that's the look I give my dog when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets too close to my cat.</v>

77
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Hey motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave her alone.</v>

78
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 2>That whole show was so quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so.</v>

79
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.773
<v Speaker 2>It was literally like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they were doing double Dutch with </v>

80
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 2>comedy and you had to know when to jump </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and went and I'm going to hop out and</v>

81
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 2>I said this to you this morning or this </v>
<v Speaker 2>afternoon.</v>

82
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.063
<v Speaker 2>That first 133 minutes was not that much</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking over each other when something </v>

83
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 2>happened that I wasn't aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people started to show it up.</v>

84
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 2>They weren't invited and sat down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>

85
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>We're just sort of sorting that out now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's microphones that were there</v>

86
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.703
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was people that we had asked to </v>

87
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:39.244
<v Speaker 2>come that we're kind of waiting to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>on and then other people that just sort </v>

88
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 2>of walked in and got on.</v>

89
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was clear to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it was set up,</v>

90
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's chaotic when you have more than</v>

91
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 2>two people just to people's hearts </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes to manage conversations,</v>

92
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.183
<v Speaker 2>but then you get three and four and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you play it in front of a live audience </v>

93
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 2>and then people just coming in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>jumping in.</v>

94
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 2>So there was a couple of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

95
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't paying too much attention and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were too drunk.</v>

96
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 2>We were gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You bailed out when,</v>

97
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you went into the set.</v>

98
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I went and do a set,</v>

99
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 2>that's apparently what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Sarah Tiana went at it.</v>

100
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 2>I missed all the goodness.</v>

101
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.180
<v Speaker 2>All I'll tell you is that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing comedy 17 years.</v>

102
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:20.014
<v Speaker 2>I am well aware that bill burrs practice</v>
<v Speaker 2>of comedy is to assemble brilliantly </v>

103
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 2>laid arguments that you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>normally agree with.</v>

104
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.683
<v Speaker 2>To go head to head with them in a debate</v>
<v Speaker 2>about porn would not be something I </v>

105
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:34.760
<v Speaker 2>think would be wise of anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was her,</v>

106
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 2>her position was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is when I was leaving,</v>

107
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 2>her position was that people watch too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much porn.</v>

108
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Then men like pouring too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

109
00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

110
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 2>and it was about the condoms and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving to a different place and,</v>

111
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.143
<v Speaker 2>and then it turned into the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>crossover states are just racists and </v>

112
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.170
<v Speaker 2>just broad stroking kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was what bill was doing,</v>

113
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>

114
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.900
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty fucked up at this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was,</v>

115
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 2>he was disassembling what is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>elitist liberal movement,</v>

116
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't agree with me,</v>

117
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 2>you're a racist rape apologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist,</v>

118
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 2>and bill just was saying that's not it.</v>

119
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Some people want change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

120
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

121
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.393
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a real sweeping brush that </v>

122
00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:21.940
<v Speaker 2>people from both sides like to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

123
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 2>The people and the right to use it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the liberals,</v>

124
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.180
<v Speaker 2>the liberals like conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconservative,</v>

125
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 2>we like to paint people like real </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious,</v>

126
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.140
<v Speaker 2>put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

127
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.720
<v Speaker 2>put them in a box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure we can categorize them.</v>

128
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

129
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

130
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I got,</v>

131
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.203
<v Speaker 2>I think I might have accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>started a little bit of it because it </v>

132
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.893
<v Speaker 2>looked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you have to realize is there's just </v>

133
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:41.704
<v Speaker 2>a disenfranchised part of America that </v>
<v Speaker 2>feels like they're not being </v>

134
00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:44.704
<v Speaker 2>represented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then immediately I think Sarah got </v>

135
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 2>jumped on me and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

136
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about the racists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

137
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say that.</v>

138
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 2>You can't say that I voted for him by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>

139
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 2>I voted for Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just saying,</v>

140
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm noticing.</v>

141
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 2>I have an election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I.</v>

142
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

143
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was good of her to stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>her ground and,</v>

144
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.310
<v Speaker 2>and to hold into say her point and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to backpedal and,</v>

145
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 2>and I appreciate it</v>

146
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:08.623
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

147
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.613
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>the problem is the problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that anybody that voted for trump</v>

149
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>is a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real,</v>

150
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:14.733
<v Speaker 1>the real problem with that is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only other alternative is Hillary </v>

151
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>and Hillary was very flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way it is.</v>

152
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

153
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.363
<v Speaker 1>it's not an anti woman thing to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone who has all the ties to </v>

154
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:27.674
<v Speaker 1>corruption that she apparently does mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go into it all day long if you </v>

155
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:31.334
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to like look at the Clinton </v>

156
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.333
<v Speaker 1>Foundation or any of the other crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that those people were involved </v>

157
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of legal,</v>

158
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.323
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really breaking any laws so you can </v>

159
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>get away with doing all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all of it is learning,</v>

160
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 1>deleted emails and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing?</v>

161
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Like what is this you?</v>

162
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.383
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a large portion of </v>

163
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:53.114
<v Speaker 2>America who just didn't want to show </v>
<v Speaker 2>their opinion because they didn't want </v>

164
00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 2>to be called a name</v>

165
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

166
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.670
<v Speaker 1>there's real concerns too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people don't want to say this.</v>

167
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.130
<v Speaker 1>There's real concerns about her health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

168
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.950
<v Speaker 1>She hurt her head in 2012 because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>blacked out.</v>

169
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.960
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she blacked out,</v>

170
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.460
<v Speaker 1>fell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fainted,</v>

171
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.280
<v Speaker 1>and hit her head really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really bad.</v>

172
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:12.773
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently she was fucked up for like </v>

173
00:07:14.671 --> 00:07:18.810
<v Speaker 1>six months and this was 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's only four years ago,</v>

174
00:07:18.811 --> 00:07:19.644
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really significant head </v>

175
00:07:21.481 --> 00:07:25.260
<v Speaker 1>trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was very eloquent into debates.</v>

176
00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:26.094
<v Speaker 1>She's really articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought she kicked his ass and the </v>

177
00:07:27.631 --> 00:07:28.680
<v Speaker 1>debates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I honestly did.</v>

178
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I thought she came off smoother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially that second one.</v>

179
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Like he would say some crazy shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she would smile.</v>

180
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.663
<v Speaker 1>I thought she handled it great and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was so much more eloquent and so much </v>

181
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.690
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much more.</v>

182
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 1>So much better economy of words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

183
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:48.041
<v Speaker 1>is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to trust that she's telling</v>

184
00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:49.044
<v Speaker 1>you the truth.</v>

185
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.183
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just too many things that she's </v>

186
00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:53.070
<v Speaker 1>been like the difference between that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Komi Guy,</v>

187
00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:56.430
<v Speaker 1>what he said she had done with her email</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what she said she had done,</v>

188
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.500
<v Speaker 1>and you play them back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen the video?</v>

189
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.660
<v Speaker 1>They do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty shocking,</v>

190
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.620
<v Speaker 1>you know what he says is very different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than heard descriptions of what he says.</v>

191
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.903
<v Speaker 1>What he says is she violated some laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what most people thought in the </v>

192
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:10.883
<v Speaker 1>apparently in the FBI.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that people got </v>

193
00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:14.700
<v Speaker 1>upset at Komi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently from this article I read,</v>

194
00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:18.090
<v Speaker 1>at least they were saying that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the FBI were very disappointed</v>

195
00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:20.010
<v Speaker 1>because they thought that he should have</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressed charges.</v>

196
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.133
<v Speaker 1>They thought that when they looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the evidence and all the stuff that </v>

197
00:08:25.051 --> 00:08:25.884
<v Speaker 1>he talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he admitted that she had done that </v>

198
00:08:27.151 --> 00:08:27.984
<v Speaker 1>you can't do with classified data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had violated all these laws like if </v>

199
00:08:30.991 --> 00:08:31.824
<v Speaker 1>you were a regular person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are really regular enlisted </v>

200
00:08:34.021 --> 00:08:36.570
<v Speaker 1>person and you violated those same </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of loss,</v>

201
00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:37.590
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be fucked.</v>

202
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.160
<v Speaker 1>You will be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phil really puts you in a Goddamn cage.</v>

203
00:08:41.161 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

204
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this sounds silly,</v>

205
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 2>but she just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

206
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:45.974
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd like to see your emails.</v>

207
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.600
<v Speaker 1>She just got rid of them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She deleted them all.</v>

208
00:08:48.601 --> 00:08:52.710
<v Speaker 1>She deleted 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>emails and she did it after a subpoena.</v>

209
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 1>At least some of them after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't.</v>

210
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.913
<v Speaker 1>What was after the subpoena?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See how many find out how many emails </v>

211
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:02.500
<v Speaker 1>she deleted after the subpoena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

212
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absolute specifics of it,</v>

213
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:06.174
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my point is it wasn't like she was </v>

214
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.340
<v Speaker 1>this awesome alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:12.174
<v Speaker 1>so people that want to change and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt like what Hillary represented is a </v>

216
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Speaker 1>part of that big system as well as she </v>
<v Speaker 1>says her words and is a stately.</v>

217
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:21.804
<v Speaker 1>She is and she's a much better </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of America in some ways </v>

218
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>than he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's just too tied to corruption.</v>

219
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Like all of the stuff that she's done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all the,</v>

220
00:09:32.691 --> 00:09:33.524
<v Speaker 1>the experience she has in government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that should be on her favorite in </v>

221
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:37.344
<v Speaker 1>her favor.</v>

222
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>But for a lot of people it wasn't this </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

223
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:40.703
<v Speaker 1>For a lot of people that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this government is just too intertwined </v>

224
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:44.154
<v Speaker 1>with these businesses that support it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pay it money and they're going to </v>

225
00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:48.174
<v Speaker 1>all these different foreign countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>and getting paid exorbitant sums of </v>

226
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:52.164
<v Speaker 1>money to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Bill Clinton was getting like </v>

227
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:59.450
<v Speaker 1>half a million dollars to fly to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that are all these like really</v>

228
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.503
<v Speaker 1>serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like civil rights violations on their </v>

229
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:04.560
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

230
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 1>There was like something that Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 1>had done.</v>

231
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 1>We kept trying to push this one through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find that there was this</v>

232

<v Speaker 2>have to take that shirt off and you're </v>

415
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.203
<v Speaker 2>My Thor Sampson's long hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it in a meeting one time cause I </v>

<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

419
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:22.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can see it in the shirt and</v>

420
00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:24.750
<v Speaker 2>nothing looks worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just take your shirt off.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why is it the whole thing?</v>

426
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.400
<v Speaker 2>The thing that I'm stuck with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup is like,</v>

427
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.353
<v Speaker 2>especially during my next hour is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>we get caught up into these and I was </v>

428
00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:43.104
<v Speaker 2>talking to Justin Brooke about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get caught up in these mechanisms of </v>

429
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:47.550
<v Speaker 2>this is what we have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a period where every comic has</v>

430
00:18:47.551 --> 00:18:48.384
<v Speaker 2>to have a sweatshirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm new balance sneakers and a Hoodie </v>

431
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.000
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone did the same thing and then you</v>

432
00:18:54.001 --> 00:18:54.834
<v Speaker 2>see someone like Judah friedlander doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>something totally different and you're </v>

433
00:18:57.061 --> 00:18:57.661
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>

434
00:18:57.661 --> 00:18:59.100
<v Speaker 2>that really separates itself from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pack.</v>

435
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:03.290
<v Speaker 2>But you are my only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My only problem is,</v>

436
00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.630
<v Speaker 2>and I've talked to have thought about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and I've talked to you about it,</v>

437

<v Speaker 2>is I don't wanna have to do stand up </v>
<v Speaker 2>every time in my fucking shirt off.</v>

438
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.423
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't need to have my shirt off </v>

439
00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:14.370
<v Speaker 2>to do stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to have it off.</v>

440
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.020

447
00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:35.454
<v Speaker 2>done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part I don't because </v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like there's no other place,</v>

453
00:19:49.951 --> 00:19:51.960
<v Speaker 2>a better place in the world to find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>if something works.</v>

454

<v Speaker 2>Whatever the Mojo in there is,</v>

463
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.063

<v Speaker 2>they find its flaws.</v>

465
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.943
<v Speaker 2>They find the lazy writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find the overcompensation with </v>

466
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:25.750
<v Speaker 2>inflection or energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I,</v>

467
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.520
<v Speaker 2>I took two bits in there and I worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>them out like last call.</v>

468
00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.490
<v Speaker 2>It was probably a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worked them out three nights,</v>

469
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.850
<v Speaker 2>then come to them on the road and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just were so much better.</v>

470
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.730
<v Speaker 2>I was like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the stories too.</v>

471
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.680
<v Speaker 2>So like the other thing about the is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't necessarily lend itself great to</v>

472
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.523
<v Speaker 2>storytelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more of like a punch and Jab fuck </v>

473
00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:50.020
<v Speaker 2>with the audience dancing type of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like they're there two.</v>

474
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.590
<v Speaker 2>I went up there and did 15 minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>told two stories in another working.</v>

475
00:20:53.591 --> 00:20:55.090
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

476
00:20:55.091 --> 00:20:56.780
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a good workout room.</v>

477
00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:58.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the belly room to the belly </v>

478
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:02.480
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might be almost better sometimes because</v>

479
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.240
<v Speaker 2>so intimate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So small.</v>

480
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:05.800
<v Speaker 2>What is it like 80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 people?</v>

481
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have those?</v>

482
00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're going to do an there.</v>

483
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.533
<v Speaker 2>Got a new material show there tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever done that with Nick </v>

484
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Youssef?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

485
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.490
<v Speaker 2>I did that with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did try that joke that,</v>

486
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:16.324
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Helen Keller named frank came up </v>

487
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.813
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that the new material night or was </v>

488
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:21.370
<v Speaker 2>that the standup on the spot night?</v>

489
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Stand up on the spot is Jeremiah Watkins</v>
<v Speaker 2>show where you just,</v>

490
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.583
<v Speaker 2>the audience will yell out topics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You literally have no idea those </v>

491
00:21:29.671 --> 00:21:30.610
<v Speaker 2>dentists on the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

492
00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:34.270
<v Speaker 2>It was that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the other one is Nick Youssef show,</v>

493
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.193
<v Speaker 2>which is a new material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you only stuff that you're </v>

494
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.000
<v Speaker 2>working on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

495
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.930
<v Speaker 2>police yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's,</v>

496
00:21:40.931 --> 00:21:42.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done it like 10 times,</v>

497
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not new anymore.</v>

498
00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Like whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that number is where it becomes</v>

499
00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:48.460
<v Speaker 2>not new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it is new,</v>

500
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.910
<v Speaker 2>like this is like an opportunity to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>only on stuff that's brand new.</v>

501
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

502
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.610
<v Speaker 2>my problem is I write on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like I like to take,</v>

503
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.790
<v Speaker 2>I like to just be on the fly and things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>

504
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:01.923
<v Speaker 2>the adrenaline of the stage makes me </v>
<v Speaker 2>think quicker and then a lot of times </v>

505
00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:08.140
<v Speaker 2>what I'll do is I'll write on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I will go for the easier punchline.</v>

506
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.303
<v Speaker 2>Like meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'll get the premise will be good </v>

507
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.370
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes I won't have the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>punchline,</v>

508
00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:12.940
<v Speaker 2>but I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

509
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.640
<v Speaker 2>that could be so much fucking better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

510
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:16.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why that stand up on the spot </v>

511
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.380
<v Speaker 2>show is perfect for you because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could just get loose.</v>

512
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.460
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fun show,</v>

513
00:22:22.461 --> 00:22:23.294
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great way to come up with the </v>

514
00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:25.344
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a bunch of different </v>

515
00:22:25.901 --> 00:22:29.860
<v Speaker 2>ways to come material and you gotta you </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotTa do you gotTa do a mall if you can.</v>

516
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.590
<v Speaker 2>I tension to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

517
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.820

<v Speaker 3>It's a great store.</v>

556
00:24:01.251 --> 00:24:02.084
<v Speaker 3>It's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally sometimes don't believe it </v>

557
00:24:03.771 --> 00:24:05.120
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I go,</v>

558
00:24:05.121 --> 00:24:06.590

<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

00:24:06.591 --> 00:24:07.424
<v Speaker 3>but I've had people come to my shows in </v>
<v Speaker 3>from my class stand up on stage with me </v>

<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had a conversation about it once you </v>

580
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.670
<v Speaker 3>and bill burr one night talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

581
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said something.</v>

582
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.440
<v Speaker 3>You said something very fascinating to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me that night.</v>

583
00:25:15.441 --> 00:25:16.274
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much money is enough money like </v>

584
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.790
<v Speaker 3>comparatively speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like is it,</v>

585
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:20.893
<v Speaker 3>is spending the whole year away for next</v>
<v Speaker 3>for an extra like two double your money </v>

586
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:25.873
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or can you get by on this and really do </v>

587
00:25:27.681 --> 00:25:32.150
<v Speaker 3>what you love and be be filled with all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the friends and the work that you love.</v>

588
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:37.510
<v Speaker 4>My problem is I know how funny you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know that there's no way you could</v>

589
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:39.194
<v Speaker 4>be at your best if you're off like </v>
<v Speaker 4>months and months at a time doing that </v>

590
00:25:42.411 --> 00:25:42.810
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>

591
00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.400
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you said that to me,</v>

592
00:25:44.401 --> 00:25:46.590
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember thinking like I.</v>

593
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.080
<v Speaker 3>I go up all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was wrong.</v>

594
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.500
<v Speaker 3>I was lying to myself because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going up once,</v>

595
00:25:52.501 --> 00:25:53.910
<v Speaker 3>twice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twice a month,</v>

596
00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:54.753
<v Speaker 3>doing two dates out of the month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a whole portion of the </v>

597
00:25:56.821 --> 00:25:59.430
<v Speaker 3>month where I wasn't working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't writing,</v>

598
00:25:59.431 --> 00:26:00.264
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't thinking comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the biggest difference when </v>

599
00:26:02.791 --> 00:26:04.050
<v Speaker 3>you're in production,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking production.</v>

600
00:26:04.051 --> 00:26:05.670
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's our call time?</v>

601
00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.000
<v Speaker 3>What's our heart out like your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where your mind's occupied.</v>

602
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.203
<v Speaker 3>When you're a stand up man is just there</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's all you're thinking like and </v>

603
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:16.283
<v Speaker 3>that's how you get better at it and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be going up all the fucking </v>

604
00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.060
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the other thing.</v>

605
00:26:21.061 --> 00:26:21.894
<v Speaker 3>Man and I added me again changed my life</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the better by passing me at the </v>

606
00:26:25.651 --> 00:26:28.260
<v Speaker 3>store and letting me be a paid regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

607
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:32.060
<v Speaker 3>it gave me so much more momentum and </v>
<v Speaker 3>passionate about it.</v>

608
00:26:32.061 --> 00:26:32.894
<v Speaker 3>So I was like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going up to the best place in the </v>

609
00:26:34.051 --> 00:26:36.330
<v Speaker 3>world to do standup comedy and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting spots when I,</v>

610
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:38.010
<v Speaker 3>whenever I call and I'll get a spot </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

611
00:26:38.011 --> 00:26:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Coolest fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm only home,</v>

612
00:26:39.691 --> 00:26:40.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three days a week.</v>

613
00:26:40.471 --> 00:26:43.140
<v Speaker 3>But if I'm going up twice a week or at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least once a week,</v>

614
00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.660
<v Speaker 3>if you really feel the difference in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your act.</v>

615
00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

616
00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.030
<v Speaker 1>And if you can go to other clubs too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

617
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.880
<v Speaker 1>like I like going to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sat at the Improv,</v>

618
00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:54.760
<v Speaker 1>shoot over and do a set of the comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've done three and nine,</v>

619
00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.313
<v Speaker 1>which is big for La and New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're laughing at us because those </v>

620
00:26:58.361 --> 00:27:01.510
<v Speaker 1>guys will do like 10 different sets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>night hopping from one place to another.</v>

621
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.760
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done um,</v>

622
00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:04.743
<v Speaker 1>the laugh factory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the store and the ha ha on one night or </v>

623
00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:10.750
<v Speaker 1>that the Improv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the store and the ha all in one night.</v>

624
00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.793
<v Speaker 1>So different man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do a set in one place and you get </v>

625
00:27:14.651 --> 00:27:15.484
<v Speaker 1>sort of a vibe of what comedy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're in a set of just a </v>

626
00:27:17.441 --> 00:27:18.274
<v Speaker 1>completely different energy in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely different like vibe of the </v>

627
00:27:20.891 --> 00:27:21.724
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all right,</v>

628
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.890
<v Speaker 1>bye folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you run over and do a different</v>

629
00:27:23.891 --> 00:27:25.870
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a totally different vibe as</v>

630
00:27:25.871 --> 00:27:26.704
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And mostly I was going up with the same </v>

631
00:27:28.541 --> 00:27:30.520
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was real strange.</v>

632
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.600
<v Speaker 1>So there's just like different fields to</v>
<v Speaker 1>different places in different crowds.</v>

633
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.160
<v Speaker 3>When Joey was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting ready for his hour,</v>

634
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.580
<v Speaker 3>he was hitting it mean easily to spot </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight and uh,</v>

635
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:45.390
<v Speaker 3>and we live right next door to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other practically.</v>

636
00:27:45.391 --> 00:27:47.700
<v Speaker 3>So he just calls me up and he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dog.</v>

637
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.570
<v Speaker 3>I got us down for two spots tight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he would just call my avail in with</v>

638
00:27:51.571 --> 00:27:52.404
<v Speaker 3>his and no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going together and I go to the </v>

639
00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:58.560
<v Speaker 3>dark horse saloon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The uniform was a fun look like fun dead</v>

640
00:27:58.561 --> 00:27:59.400
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you like,</v>

641
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.650
<v Speaker 3>like meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it not packed out.</v>

642
00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:02.653

<v Speaker 3>I'm not promoting it and it's just </v>

643
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.020
<v Speaker 3>people coming in to see a show and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

696
00:30:04.591 --> 00:30:07.030
<v Speaker 4>my face because I was afraid I was going</v>

699
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:14.770
<v Speaker 4>going to fucking pass out and I was like</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>about this crazy thing that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening for us.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We didn't know that you were only </v>

707
00:30:34.751 --> 00:30:38.170
<v Speaker 4>getting it through one ear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what to do about that.</v>

712
00:30:47.561 --> 00:30:49.450
<v Speaker 4>issues that were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that existed before.</v>

713
00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.030

<v Speaker 4>stream like that.</v>

716
00:30:55.811 --> 00:30:58.450
<v Speaker 4>But whenever I kept thinking this could </v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

718
00:30:58.871 --> 00:31:01.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anyone on that stage would</v>

719
00:31:01.511 --> 00:31:04.120
<v Speaker 4>do it for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This can be a fucking TV show.</v>

720
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:05.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But why?</v>

<v Speaker 2>You could see them.</v>

759
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I love the way you start sentences </v>
<v Speaker 2>though is so simple.</v>

760
00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:53.030
<v Speaker 2>I have herpes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on fire.</v>

761
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.513
<v Speaker 2>It was all firewood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fitzsimmons said something that didn't </v>

762
00:32:56.271 --> 00:32:57.440
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug goes,</v>

763
00:32:57.441 --> 00:33:00.060
<v Speaker 2>now I understand why talk shows have </v>
<v Speaker 2>lead in question.</v>

764
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a little hostile.</v>

765
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Some of the guests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was definitely a.</v>

766
00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 2>At one point he was laying in my lap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of my favorite pictures of my</v>

767
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:12.650
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was He sucking on your nipple?</v>

768
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.650
<v Speaker 2>He sucked on my nipple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Sarah and bill started fighting too</v>

769
00:33:15.651 --> 00:33:16.484
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would try to break up the tension by </v>

770
00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:19.330
<v Speaker 2>sucking on my nipple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

771
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:20.923
<v Speaker 2>Was a Sarah in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but was it in entertaining the bill and </v>

772
00:33:23.421 --> 00:33:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Sarah thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was for me.</v>

773
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

774
00:33:26.251 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

775
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate either of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't like.</v>

776
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:33.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure to the average viewer who maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know Sarah but loves bill,</v>

777
00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:35.240
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you disagree with him?</v>

778
00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:37.130
<v Speaker 2>He's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

779
00:33:37.131 --> 00:33:42.131
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with those conversations</v>
<v Speaker 2>is as much as I would probably agree,</v>

780
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:46.220
<v Speaker 2>that's just my opinion and there's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be someone out there that's like,</v>

781
00:33:46.221 --> 00:33:47.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah.</v>

782
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

783
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:49.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

784
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:49.993
<v Speaker 2>there are definitely women that will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if any women lot were when </v>

785
00:33:52.601 --> 00:33:53.434
<v Speaker 2>the live stream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we had four women watching the live </v>

786
00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.313
<v Speaker 2>stream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sure it was thousand humans at any </v>

787
00:33:59.181 --> 00:34:00.560
<v Speaker 2>given time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people were screaming?</v>

788
00:34:00.561 --> 00:34:03.860
<v Speaker 2>It was like 35,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

789
00:34:03.861 --> 00:34:05.000
<v Speaker 2>3000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

790
00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy crap.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's been videos that were up that we</v>

792
00:34:09.501 --> 00:34:12.590
<v Speaker 2>took down on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were up and they were private,</v>

793
00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:14.630
<v Speaker 2>but there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sound was fucked up still.</v>

794
00:34:14.631 --> 00:34:16.390
<v Speaker 2>That's why there are private.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to fix this out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>video because everyone,</v>

797
00:34:22.011 --> 00:34:22.844
<v Speaker 2>every one of us tweeted the link to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>video on our facebook live pages or </v>

798
00:34:27.501 --> 00:34:29.030
<v Speaker 2>facebook pages.</v>

799
00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

800
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Because I was looking for at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning and I couldn't find it and I was</v>

801
00:34:32.451 --> 00:34:33.111
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

802
00:34:33.111 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 2>did we not record that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

803
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:37.160
<v Speaker 2>that would stink if we missed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

804
00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:39.770
<v Speaker 2>That would suck hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot to hit record.</v>

805
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>We could do that again.</v>

807
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.713
<v Speaker 2>Next time we do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't just have people just walk on </v>

808
00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:49.250
<v Speaker 2>stage and just sit down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that that was going on.</v>

809
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.760
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a specific amount of people that</v>

810
00:34:52.761 --> 00:34:55.640
<v Speaker 2>we do it with because anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything more than three or four.</v>

811
00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:57.363
<v Speaker 2>Doug was putting people on stage because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he definitely put Brendan Walsh on </v>

812
00:34:59.421 --> 00:34:59.991
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

<v Speaker 2>forever and he wasn't even on for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.360
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really is so funny.</v>

816
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.720
<v Speaker 2>He's so crazy to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug was telling a story about Bingo,</v>

817
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:13.970
<v Speaker 2>having a seizure and hitting her head </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Brendan goes,</v>

818
00:35:13.971 --> 00:35:17.060
<v Speaker 2>I've had a few girlfriends have seizures</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they don't cook the food.</v>

819
00:35:17.061 --> 00:35:22.061
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

820
00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:24.853
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you've been paying attention to </v>

821
00:35:26.871 --> 00:35:27.704
<v Speaker 2>all these people's reactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's trying to like figure out </v>

822
00:35:30.081 --> 00:35:31.970
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why trump won.</v>

823
00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:33.973
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating to see people freak </v>

824
00:35:35.751 --> 00:35:37.350
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fat.</v>

825
00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:38.580
<v Speaker 2>People are crying.</v>

826
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.910
<v Speaker 4>People are fucking cry or they stormed </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of a school in Arizona.</v>

827
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:46.860
<v Speaker 4>The kids marched out of a school to </v>
<v Speaker 4>protest the president elect.</v>

828
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.470
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

829
00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:53.400
<v Speaker 4>This is crazy now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there is a weird,</v>

830
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:55.830
<v Speaker 4>like there was a weird energy when trump</v>
<v Speaker 4>gave his speech last night.</v>

831
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.440
<v Speaker 4>It was almost like the bullies saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop hitting yourself.</v>

832
00:35:58.441 --> 00:36:00.330
<v Speaker 4>Stop hitting yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he was like,</v>

833
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.770
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now we can be like.</v>

834
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.633
<v Speaker 4>It was kind of weird because he has not </v>
<v Speaker 4>been like super inclusive and then all </v>

835
00:36:05.761 --> 00:36:06.594
<v Speaker 4>of a sudden he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to heal together and you're </v>

836
00:36:08.311 --> 00:36:08.521
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

837
00:36:08.521 --> 00:36:11.070
<v Speaker 4>you totally feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like part of me goes on.</v>

838
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.250
<v Speaker 4>Is there a part of him that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>hates everyone that doesn't like him?</v>

839
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:15.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

840
00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:18.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He certainly mean he's,</v>

841
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:19.163
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a super businessman and super </v>

842
00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:22.734
<v Speaker 4>businessman there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like their game players that </v>

843
00:36:24.961 --> 00:36:25.650
<v Speaker 4>play in a game.</v>

844
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.070
<v Speaker 4>So if you move towards them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

845
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.150
<v Speaker 4>and you make a move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to make a move to county,</v>

846
00:36:30.151 --> 00:36:32.580
<v Speaker 4>you're moving fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's Donald Trump's personality.</v>

847
00:36:32.581 --> 00:36:35.010
<v Speaker 4>That's why he sues all those people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>in the morning calling him a pussy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh Dude.</v>

870
00:37:22.921 --> 00:37:25.860
<v Speaker 4>Political correctness just took a </v>
<v Speaker 4>missile to the Deq.</v>

871
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:26.790
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think,</v>

872
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:29.880
<v Speaker 4>do you think that's good or bad for </v>
<v Speaker 4>standup on?</v>

873
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.490
<v Speaker 4>Unquestionably good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unquestionably good.</v>

874
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.840
<v Speaker 4>In every way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shape or form?</v>

875
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.010
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>

876
00:37:35.011 --> 00:37:37.620
<v Speaker 4>It's good because he's going to do some </v>
<v Speaker 4>goofy shit.</v>

877
00:37:37.621 --> 00:37:41.010
<v Speaker 4>He's going to say some ridiculous things</v>
<v Speaker 4>a week in it.</v>

878
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.600
<v Speaker 4>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If someone.</v>

879
00:37:42.601 --> 00:37:43.434
<v Speaker 4>If you said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to go up and grab them by the </v>

880
00:37:44.851 --> 00:37:46.890
<v Speaker 4>posies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone will be like,</v>

881
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:47.803
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That has to be acceptable because half </v>

882
00:37:49.171 --> 00:37:53.250
<v Speaker 4>of America is not offended by that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you seat?</v>

883
00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:55.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm a believer in that.</v>

884
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:56.183
<v Speaker 4>The president in a lot of ways shapes </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mindset of the country because it's </v>

885
00:38:01.081 --> 00:38:03.450
<v Speaker 4>just a natural thing that happens in </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribes.</v>

886
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:04.603
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have one fierce tribal leader in </v>

887
00:38:06.931 --> 00:38:07.764
<v Speaker 4>a tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guarantee you the warriors that are in </v>

888
00:38:09.211 --> 00:38:13.050
<v Speaker 4>that tribal also be fierce because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll be under the guidance of the one</v>

889
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.090
<v Speaker 4>wild fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

890
00:38:15.091 --> 00:38:16.430
<v Speaker 4>that's how.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

891
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.600
<v Speaker 4>that's how like fierce armies get put </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

892
00:38:18.601 --> 00:38:20.280
<v Speaker 4>You have to have a bad ass fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>

893
00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:21.913
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when your president is this guy who </v>

894
00:38:24.421 --> 00:38:27.450
<v Speaker 4>rarely gets riled up about anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not emotional at all.</v>

895
00:38:27.451 --> 00:38:31.320
<v Speaker 4>He's super articulate and really well </v>
<v Speaker 4>spoken and he's a great orator.</v>

896
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:33.250
<v Speaker 4>That's Barack Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

897
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.760
<v Speaker 4>that's what you would think of when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think of a presidential person.</v>

898
00:38:36.761 --> 00:38:39.670
<v Speaker 4>He's probably the most presidential guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've ever had as president,</v>

899
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:42.920
<v Speaker 4>but then you go with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he's,</v>

900
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.620
<v Speaker 4>he's not doing that at all.</v>

901
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.233
<v Speaker 4>Like he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just rocking it at a totally </v>

902
00:38:47.321 --> 00:38:48.910
<v Speaker 4>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A hundred percent.</v>

903
00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's doing it like a businessman.</v>

904
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.260
<v Speaker 4>You fuck with him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to fuck with you back.</v>

905
00:38:53.261 --> 00:38:54.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fucking piece of Shit,</v>

906
00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.340
<v Speaker 4>Jon Stewart,</v>

<v Speaker 4>in the morning,</v>

908
00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.553
<v Speaker 4>but that's the kind of guy that can </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking finance campaign for president </v>

909
00:39:05.831 --> 00:39:10.831
<v Speaker 4>all on his own and when it's crazy it </v>
<v Speaker 4>ma,</v>

910
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:12.123
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forget about whether you think it's a </v>

911
00:39:13.901 --> 00:39:15.970
<v Speaker 4>good thing for the country or bad thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the country.</v>

912
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 4>It might be the greatest success story </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

913
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:23.950
<v Speaker 4>It might be like the greatest upset of </v>
<v Speaker 4>any contest ever.</v>

914
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:26.920
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no bigger upset ever.</v>

915
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.293
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you think the odds were </v>

916
00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.720
<v Speaker 4>when Donald trump first entered the race</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Vegas?</v>

917
00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:33.160
<v Speaker 4>That he would eventually become </v>
<v Speaker 4>president?</v>

918
00:39:33.161 --> 00:39:35.230
<v Speaker 4>What do you think the odds were?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember watching,</v>

919
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:37.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm Seth Meyers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>state of the Union address,</v>

920
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.700
<v Speaker 4>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump's here.</v>

921
00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.790
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump said he's voting as he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>running as a Republican.</v>

922
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.750
<v Speaker 4>I thought he was running as a joke and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>doubled over and I thought.</v>

923
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.270
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

924
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:51.030
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what an idiot healed.</v>

925
00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:51.903
<v Speaker 4>He could never be president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I literally thought he could never be </v>

926
00:39:55.301 --> 00:39:56.134
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then to think that that's a fucking </v>

927
00:39:58.931 --> 00:40:00.940
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

928
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.013
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Has any celebrity other than we'll </v>

929
00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:04.803
<v Speaker 4>Ronald Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ronald Reagan's one I was curious about </v>

930
00:40:06.431 --> 00:40:10.060
<v Speaker 4>because they said that I don't remember </v>
<v Speaker 4>the election,</v>

931
00:40:10.061 --> 00:40:10.894
<v Speaker 4>I was too young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were saying that despite the </v>

932
00:40:13.151 --> 00:40:16.400
<v Speaker 4>fact that he had already been governor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that was like Kinda like he,</v>

933
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:19.420
<v Speaker 4>he had been an office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were shocked that anyone would vote</v>

934
00:40:19.421 --> 00:40:20.254
<v Speaker 4>for Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They thought he was a fucking joke and </v>

935
00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:23.620
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he destroyed Mondale.</v>

936
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.593
<v Speaker 4>Like I look at those county by county </v>
<v Speaker 4>polls where they show you what the </v>

937
00:40:28.331 --> 00:40:28.930
<v Speaker 4>counties voted.</v>

938
00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:31.660
<v Speaker 4>It's really fucking interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at Ohio,</v>

939
00:40:31.661 --> 00:40:32.494
<v Speaker 4>it's all red,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Cleveland's blue and like Columbus </v>

940
00:40:35.391 --> 00:40:40.391
<v Speaker 4>is blue and Toledo's blue and so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is all the,</v>

941
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.390
<v Speaker 4>just outside the city,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's voting for trump,</v>

942
00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:47.620
<v Speaker 4>but in a city people are voting for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Democrat.</v>

943
00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.510
<v Speaker 4>But you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at Reagan's,</v>

944
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:52.990
<v Speaker 4>it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean literally it's all fucking read.</v>

945
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:56.830
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever gone back and watched some</v>
<v Speaker 4>or Reagan speeches?</v>

946
00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:58.240
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want.</v>

947
00:40:58.241 --> 00:41:00.280
<v Speaker 4>I watched a few of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other day I did.</v>

948
00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:01.893
<v Speaker 4>I did a youtube rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went down and watched a bunch of </v>

949
00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:09.720
<v Speaker 4>Reagan's speeches there were so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so weird because now that he's dad and,</v>

950
00:41:09.721 --> 00:41:10.554
<v Speaker 4>you know the history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so weird because it was in my </v>

951
00:41:11.951 --> 00:41:13.750
<v Speaker 4>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember these events,</v>

952
00:41:13.751 --> 00:41:16.090
<v Speaker 4>I remember these things happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

953
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:16.953
<v Speaker 4>he was onstage onstage and doing some </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech and he started talking about how </v>

954
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:23.643
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't it be if we were attacked by </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of an alien invader for </v>

955
00:41:28.571 --> 00:41:29.320
<v Speaker 4>another planet?</v>

956
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.153
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't it be easy for us to abandon </v>
<v Speaker 4>all of our differences and joined </v>

957
00:41:33.831 --> 00:41:38.000
<v Speaker 4>together as one race to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to face this alien threat?</v>

958
00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.580
<v Speaker 4>And everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck did he just say,</v>

959
00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.190
<v Speaker 4>save the fucking president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just say there's aliens.</v>

960
00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.840
<v Speaker 4>That's what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I already said,</v>

961
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.670
<v Speaker 4>the fucking aliens are coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're coming.</v>

962
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.440
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got to get together.</v>

963
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:52.993
<v Speaker 4>That's literally what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was one of those conspiracy </v>

964
00:41:56.001 --> 00:42:00.680
<v Speaker 4>theorists dreams where someone like me </v>
<v Speaker 4>or like Eddie Bravo,</v>

965
00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:02.470
<v Speaker 4>fucking look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

966
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.120
<v Speaker 4>you hear what he just said?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking hear what he just said.</v>

967
00:42:05.121 --> 00:42:08.900
<v Speaker 4>He said if an alien species came down </v>
<v Speaker 4>here to,</v>

968
00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:10.610
<v Speaker 4>they're coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to let us know.</v>

969
00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:11.750
<v Speaker 4>Slow to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let us know.</v>

970
00:42:11.751 --> 00:42:12.584
<v Speaker 4>Slow.</v>

971
00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:14.613
<v Speaker 2>I used to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to think they should release a </v>

972
00:42:15.911 --> 00:42:19.660
<v Speaker 2>tiger in every major city who chooses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about your kids?</v>

973
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

974
00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:21.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just kind of.</v>

975
00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.710
<v Speaker 2>We got to deal with the chips fall where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may,</v>

976
00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:24.573
<v Speaker 2>but the reason being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine how tighter the communities </v>

977
00:42:26.441 --> 00:42:29.320
<v Speaker 2>would get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People will be cooler to each other.</v>

978
00:42:29.321 --> 00:42:30.250
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

979
00:42:30.251 --> 00:42:31.970
<v Speaker 2>have you seen the tiger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

980
00:42:31.971 --> 00:42:32.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on the other side of town.</v>

981
00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God man.</v>

982
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Have a great day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't you shoot that tiger?</v>

983
00:42:37.031 --> 00:42:42.031
<v Speaker 2>Or is it like you gotta leave it feeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feeds off people.</v>

984
00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:44.613
<v Speaker 2>That's the balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or baby come into neighborhoods for </v>

985
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:47.783
<v Speaker 2>gentrification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine if that's how we </v>

986
00:42:49.721 --> 00:42:53.130
<v Speaker 2>rocked it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just left a tiger and every $100,000</v>

987
00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.520
<v Speaker 4>you to keep her at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

988
00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.400
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a game with you and nature.</v>

989
00:43:00.401 --> 00:43:03.430
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

990
00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:05.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in,</v>

991
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.700
<v Speaker 2>when I was in Tanzania with the massage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>

992
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:09.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

994
00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:14.483
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're crammed in together and </v>

995
00:43:15.421 --> 00:43:18.240
<v Speaker 2>they got thorns like thorn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big thorn bushes.</v>

996
00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keeping them together and they're always</v>

997
00:43:20.221 --> 00:43:21.054
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always in clumps because they </v>

998
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:24.060
<v Speaker 2>got fucking lions everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

999
00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:24.923
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet that makes you a lot tighter when </v>

1000
00:43:27.241 --> 00:43:28.980
<v Speaker 2>you know you could get eaten by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking line.</v>

1001
00:43:28.981 --> 00:43:31.410
<v Speaker 2>If you go take a shit by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1002
00:43:31.411 --> 00:43:32.820
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gonna go hang out while take a shit.</v>

1003
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:34.403
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are so much more connected </v>

1004
00:43:36.331 --> 00:43:39.840
<v Speaker 2>to nature because how many animals must </v>
<v Speaker 2>act get killed?</v>

1005
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:40.853
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you they cut a goat's throat in </v>

1006
00:43:43.021 --> 00:43:44.640
<v Speaker 2>front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1007
00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:45.301
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1008
00:43:45.301 --> 00:43:46.134
<v Speaker 2>welcome to our jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slit his throat and blend it into a </v>

1009
00:43:47.731 --> 00:43:49.230
<v Speaker 2>horn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could drink it.</v>

1010
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so casual.</v>

1011
00:43:51.931 --> 00:43:55.120
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't taste like a little like liver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1012
00:43:55.121 --> 00:43:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Like a drinking liver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably super good for you.</v>

1013
00:43:57.691 --> 00:43:58.524
<v Speaker 2>Write it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mind the taste other than the </v>

1014
00:44:00.451 --> 00:44:02.610
<v Speaker 2>fact that we get all in your 10 blood on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your teeth.</v>

1015
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:05.310
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mind that and it was Africa and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get aids.</v>

1016
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.960
<v Speaker 2>You didn't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mind the taste.</v>

1017
00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:10.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine me.</v>

1018
00:44:10.201 --> 00:44:14.160
<v Speaker 4>The first guy to get sick from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>

1019
00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:14.700
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1020
00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:15.533
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder like what kind of bloodborne </v>

1021
00:44:17.041 --> 00:44:19.640
<v Speaker 4>pathogens they could be carrying in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their body that you're in,</v>

1022
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.270
<v Speaker 4>but this wouldn't that be in the meat </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

1023
00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.360
<v Speaker 4>I guess you'd probably have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 4>that less with herbivores.</v>

1024
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:25.913
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you would like kicked and drink </v>

1025
00:44:27.121 --> 00:44:28.560
<v Speaker 4>bear blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't do it?</v>

1026
00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.700
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

1027
00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:30.563
<v Speaker 4>I think you can get tricky gnosis if </v>
<v Speaker 4>they say something like 90 something </v>

1028
00:44:33.031 --> 00:44:35.550
<v Speaker 4>percent of bears of Kenosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1029
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:36.683
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how do you have to cook that out of </v>

1030
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:38.460
<v Speaker 4>them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1031
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:40.110
<v Speaker 4>you have to cook it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Cook pork,</v>

1032
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:42.690
<v Speaker 4>which is 160 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1033
00:44:42.691 --> 00:44:44.210
<v Speaker 4>I've been cooking pork.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Medium rare.</v>

1034
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:45.323
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now that you probably can get away with </v>

1035
00:44:47.071 --> 00:44:49.140
<v Speaker 4>that because you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>domestic pork.</v>

1036
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:52.740
<v Speaker 4>See the standards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They actually lowered the temperature.</v>

1037
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:55.920
<v Speaker 4>I think they lowered the pork </v>
<v Speaker 4>recommended to 1:40,</v>

1038
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:58.320
<v Speaker 4>which is really kind of like a medium.</v>

1039
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.800
<v Speaker 4>Not like I'm not a medium rare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think medium was like 1:35,</v>

1040

00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:58.990
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the way he moved,</v>

1156
00:49:58.991 --> 00:49:59.824
<v Speaker 2>it was very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew what he was doing and the guy </v>

1157
00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:02.031
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1158
00:50:02.031 --> 00:50:02.261
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1159
00:50:02.261 --> 00:50:05.170
<v Speaker 2>no street fight going to be a street </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and I'm going to be in like,</v>

1160
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:08.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he fucking killed him.</v>

1161
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:11.170
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be a street fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1162
00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:12.213
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the one that told me like one </v>

1163
00:50:14.471 --> 00:50:16.150
<v Speaker 2>time I remember her saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to somebody,</v>

1164
00:50:16.151 --> 00:50:18.400
<v Speaker 2>this must have been five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you were like,</v>

1165
00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:19.630
<v Speaker 2>do you know how to fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1166
00:50:19.631 --> 00:50:20.231
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

1167
00:50:20.231 --> 00:50:23.050
<v Speaker 2>why would you ever talk to someone if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know how to fight?</v>

1168
00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.400
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1169
00:50:24.401 --> 00:50:25.234
<v Speaker 2>I've been going on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mindset that my whole life just </v>

1170
00:50:27.201 --> 00:50:31.520
<v Speaker 2>rolling the dice that they'll back down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's dangerous.</v>

1171
00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:33.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't talk shit to anybody.</v>

1172
00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:34.660
<v Speaker 1>She never talked shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1173
00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:37.870
<v Speaker 1>first of all you shouldn't because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just not worth it and it's a bad path to</v>

1174
00:50:37.871 --> 00:50:39.400
<v Speaker 1>go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you get into arguments.</v>

1175
00:50:39.401 --> 00:50:42.220
<v Speaker 1>People were probably all going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into them again,</v>

1176
00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wAy better for you,</v>

1177
00:50:44.951 --> 00:50:45.784
<v Speaker 1>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for everybody to avoid those kinds of </v>

1178
00:50:46.751 --> 00:50:49.780
<v Speaker 1>conversations at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you start insulting people,</v>

1179
00:50:49.781 --> 00:50:52.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn it so risky.</v>

1180
00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:54.160
<v Speaker 1>It's so risky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what they do.</v>

1181
00:50:54.161 --> 00:50:55.390
<v Speaker 1>They made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can be a killer.</v>

1182
00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:58.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like literally a killer.</v>

1183
00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.800
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

1184
00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:00.693
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea what that person does </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so for you to just meet some </v>

1185
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:06.820
<v Speaker 1>stranger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bump into them and then want to exchange</v>

1186
00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.480
<v Speaker 1>assault at each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have fucked up man.</v>

1187
00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.570
<v Speaker 1>You could be sitting right next to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lorenz larkin.</v>

1188
00:51:13.571 --> 00:51:16.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't know who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you decide to slap them.</v>

1189
00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.870
<v Speaker 1>You get you do something stupid because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you're a tough guy.</v>

1190
00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Anything you can to intimidate him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he just laid kicks you when you realized</v>

1191

<v Speaker 1>oh good lord.</v>

1192
00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Then he starts beating the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you slowly.</v>

1193
00:51:26.921 --> 00:51:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Whenever he wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hits you.</v>

1194
00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:30.123
<v Speaker 1>That's reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could find yourself in a terrible </v>

1195
00:51:31.241 --> 00:51:32.074
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's um,</v>

1511
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:44.100
<v Speaker 1>a picture of me when I was doing the ufc</v>
<v Speaker 1>had too fucked up eyes while I was doing</v>

1512
01:03:44.101 --> 01:03:46.190
<v Speaker 1>the commentary commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terry,</v>

1513
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:47.063
<v Speaker 1>that was all from my same friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got me with the knee and then he got </v>

1514
01:03:49.411 --> 01:03:51.450
<v Speaker 1>me wIth his elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally accidental.</v>

1515
01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Ow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hurts so bad when you're scrambling.</v>

1516
01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:55.403
<v Speaker 1>If you know you move that way and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he was going to put his knee and </v>

1517
01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:58.834
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just fucking collide with each other </v>

1518
01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:01.950
<v Speaker 1>dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noses explode.</v>

1519
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Happens all the time.</v>

1520
01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.130
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1521
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that I don't want that to happen,</v>

1522
01:04:07.421 --> 01:04:09.230
<v Speaker 3>but I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1523
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.900
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1524
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:13.050
<v Speaker 1>but you got to also look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be careful.</v>

1525
01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:13.913
<v Speaker 1>Don't roll with spazzes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't try to be a world champion </v>

1526
01:04:16.471 --> 01:04:19.530
<v Speaker 1>superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learn how to do the technique correctly.</v>

1527
01:04:19.531 --> 01:04:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Be willing to tap and just try to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have fun.</v>

1528
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:25.260
<v Speaker 1>The gracies have a good saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say keep it playful.</v>

1529
01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good saying to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1530
01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:28.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as soon as you get tense and </v>

1531
01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:30.960
<v Speaker 1>real rigid and real concern with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome,</v>

1532
01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.153
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1533
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:34.080
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't do as well.</v>

1534
01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:34.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become,</v>

1535
01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:37.470
<v Speaker 1>it's too exhausting and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on technique,</v>

1536
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:39.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're not worried about getting</v>

1537
01:04:39.661 --> 01:04:41.640
<v Speaker 1>tapped or you're not worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting into a bad position,</v>

1538
01:04:41.641 --> 01:04:43.890
<v Speaker 1>you'll relax and sort of go with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flow of things.</v>

1539
01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.560
<v Speaker 1>And when you find like a certain level </v>
<v Speaker 1>of efficiency,</v>

1540
01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:49.560
<v Speaker 1>then you can operate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can roll for like long times.</v>

1541
01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:51.510
<v Speaker 1>I've had roles with people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10,</v>

1542
01:04:51.511 --> 01:04:52.344
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes long or even longer because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get to a good place we can kind </v>

1543
01:04:56.041 --> 01:05:00.240
<v Speaker 1>of conserve your energy and you're both </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving at a good pace.</v>

1544
01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Good pace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but keeping it really technical to.</v>

1545
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:05.880
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the,</v>

1546
01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:10.620
<v Speaker 1>to me it's one of the only martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>that does as advertised.</v>

1547
01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Like when you look at martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always think of what I would like is</v>

1548
01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.293
<v Speaker 1>some Bruce Lee type scenario or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>small could beat up everybody around </v>

1549
01:05:19.091 --> 01:05:21.280
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well striking.</v>

1550
01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:24.210
<v Speaker 1>That really doesn't work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just does it.</v>

1551
01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:24.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1552
01:05:24.661 --> 01:05:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I was just doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1553
01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:30.020
<v Speaker 1>brock lesnar is just as bad ass as </v>
<v Speaker 1>joseph benevidez.</v>

1554
01:05:30.021 --> 01:05:33.160
<v Speaker 1>As brock lesnar was chasing him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be kind of fucked.</v>

1555
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.500
<v Speaker 1>He just be kind of fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just too much.</v>

1556
01:05:35.501 --> 01:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>There's just too much man.</v>

1557
01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:37.893
<v Speaker 1>But if brock lesnar road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if he did jujitsu with like a guy </v>

1558
01:05:42.701 --> 01:05:46.840
<v Speaker 1>like gary tonin who just won the ebi </v>
<v Speaker 1>this past weekend,</v>

1559
01:05:46.841 --> 01:05:49.900
<v Speaker 1>he won the heavyweight division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a 100 sixTy nine pounds,</v>

1560
01:05:49.901 --> 01:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Champion.</v>

1561
01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:54.490
<v Speaker 1>And he went up and he won the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight division two.</v>

1562
01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh five I guess is the way class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm.</v>

1563
01:05:57.550 --> 01:05:59.620
<v Speaker 1>That guy would choke out brock lesnar </v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely.</v>

1564
01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:01.140
<v Speaker 1>So brock lesnar when he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1565
01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:03.280
<v Speaker 1>when he's fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not doing jujitsu.</v>

1566
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:05.740
<v Speaker 1>He doeS jujitsu and he's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic,</v>

1567
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:06.783
<v Speaker 1>but he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think [inaudible] has got his blue </v>

1568
01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:10.990
<v Speaker 1>belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if that's correct.</v>

1570
01:06:13.871 --> 01:06:16.240

<v Speaker 1>wrestler beast and there were,</v>

1576
01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.330

1584
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Well it Depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people get weird,</v>

1585
01:06:47.801 --> 01:06:50.980
<v Speaker 1>they hAd a bunch of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is most jujitsu schools because</v>

1586
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:53.590
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo is very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but jujitsu is white,</v>

1587
01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:55.360
<v Speaker 1>blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purple,</v>

1588
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:56.350
<v Speaker 1>brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

1589
01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.900
<v Speaker 1>So some people put stripes and stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1590
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.033
<v Speaker 1>John john was never really ended that </v>
<v Speaker 1>john jack would just go from belt to </v>

1591
01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:05.450
<v Speaker 1>belt and eddie just goes from belt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>belt and um,</v>

1592
01:07:05.650 --> 01:07:08.290
<v Speaker 1>it's all just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's up to them too.</v>

1593
01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of weird,</v>

1594
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:11.613
<v Speaker 1>like everywhere else in taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have to learn forms and have </v>

1595
01:07:14.351 --> 01:07:15.400
<v Speaker 1>to learn these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1596
01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.410
<v Speaker 1>these little jabs at Japan.</v>

1597
01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:21.100
<v Speaker 1>They call them katas and these are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of like knife,</v>

1598
01:07:21.101 --> 01:07:22.690
<v Speaker 1>hand strike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sidekick,</v>

1599
01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.200
<v Speaker 1>knife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fence,</v>

1600
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.033
<v Speaker 1>trike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sidekick.</v>

1601
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like a dance that you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1602
01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:26.863
<v Speaker 1>just this preformed thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you had to know these things in </v>

1603
01:07:29.561 --> 01:07:30.394
<v Speaker 1>order to get certain Belts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if you were a purple belt and </v>

1604
01:07:32.981 --> 01:07:35.680
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to become a brown belt or is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it a red belt?</v>

1605
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

1606
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:40.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it went in taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it went purple,</v>

1607
01:07:40.211 --> 01:07:43.120
<v Speaker 1>red for a member correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Purple,</v>

1608
01:07:43.121 --> 01:07:44.230
<v Speaker 1>red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>green,</v>

1609
01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.311
<v Speaker 1>blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>green,</v>

1610
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:46.510
<v Speaker 1>purple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yellow,</v>

1611
01:07:46.511 --> 01:07:47.261
<v Speaker 1>blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>green,</v>

1612
01:07:47.261 --> 01:07:49.540
<v Speaker 1>purple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red,</v>

1613
01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it that.</v>

1614
01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:53.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's different than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some schools,</v>

1615
01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.510
<v Speaker 1>some schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would not have the red.</v>

1616
01:07:55.511 --> 01:07:56.890
<v Speaker 1>They would have a brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

1617
01:07:56.891 --> 01:07:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Karate was always brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't red.</v>

1618
01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:00.940
<v Speaker 1>And jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red is like the super master.</v>

1619
01:08:00.941 --> 01:08:01.774
<v Speaker 1>They have like a coral belt for guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>like hixon gracie and john jacques </v>

1620
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:04.390
<v Speaker 1>machado.</v>

1621
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:05.900
<v Speaker 1>They give them this red belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1622
01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:07.210
<v Speaker 1>who gives it to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their master.</v>

1623
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:12.670
<v Speaker 1>They asked to see someone of </v>
<v Speaker 1>commensurate achievement in jujitsu.</v>

1624
01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to get it from one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great masters.</v>

1625
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.371
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1626
01:08:16.371 --> 01:08:20.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of great masters out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there like henzel gracie hoists,</v>

1627
01:08:20.781 --> 01:08:22.580
<v Speaker 1>gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1628
01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:23.623
<v Speaker 1>there's like the old guard to like hixon</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course fixing gives you your coral </v>

1629
01:08:27.621 --> 01:08:28.454
<v Speaker 1>belle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave.</v>

1630
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.360
<v Speaker 1>He gave john jacques machado was coral </v>
<v Speaker 1>belt.</v>

1631
01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:33.950
<v Speaker 1>That's just so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get any,</v>

1632
01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.510
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more prestigious.</v>

1633
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:39.410
<v Speaker 1>You know who john jack is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a really special guy.</v>

1634
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:44.190
<v Speaker 1>His jujitsu is so technical and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1635
01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:45.043
<v Speaker 1>he was also instrumental in making </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain techniques work in mma because </v>

1636
01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:50.924
<v Speaker 1>john jack was born with one hand is </v>
<v Speaker 1>deformed and all he has is a thumb on </v>

1637
01:08:55.941 --> 01:08:56.774
<v Speaker 1>his left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have any fingers and because </v>

1638
01:09:00.471 --> 01:09:01.304
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1639
01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.173
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he figured out that he can't rely and </v>

1640
01:09:04.911 --> 01:09:06.260
<v Speaker 1>grabbing the jujitsu.</v>

1641
01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.120
<v Speaker 1>He can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the kimono,</v>

1642
01:09:08.121 --> 01:09:08.954
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He cannot rely on holding on to collars </v>

1643
01:09:11.541 --> 01:09:13.760
<v Speaker 1>and grabbing sleeves and manipulating </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with that.</v>

1644
01:09:13.761 --> 01:09:14.594
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he switched to over hooks and under </v>

1645
01:09:16.701 --> 01:09:19.130
<v Speaker 1>hooks and went to a more wrestling base </v>
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

1646
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:22.760
<v Speaker 1>so when jujitsu went from being gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>based,</v>

1647
01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:26.220
<v Speaker 1>primarily in competition to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started doing abu dhabi.</v>

1648
01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:27.543
<v Speaker 1>Abu dhabi was nogi and when when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>went with the abu dhabi submission </v>

1649
01:09:31.791 --> 01:09:34.370
<v Speaker 1>fighting championships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>john jacques dominated people.</v>

1650
01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Really one of the reasons why dominated </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's because he's awesome.</v>

1651
01:09:36.861 --> 01:09:39.680
<v Speaker 1>He's just a super high level world </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion black belt,</v>

1652
01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.370
<v Speaker 1>but two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he had never relied on the geek.</v>

1653
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:44.893
<v Speaker 1>He was just about holding bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was all over hooks and under hooks </v>

1654
01:09:47.391 --> 01:09:52.391
<v Speaker 1>and it translated perfectly in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie bravo learned that from john jock.</v>

1655
01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:53.373
<v Speaker 1>He learned that from watching john </v>
<v Speaker 1>jacques and from training under john </v>

1656
01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:59.340
<v Speaker 1>jacques and getting his black belt under</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and so eddie developed his style and</v>

1657
01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.400
<v Speaker 1>eddie branched out away from the gate </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1658
01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.233
<v Speaker 1>It's like a big controversial thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he stopped wearing a gi and he </v>

1659
01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:06.284
<v Speaker 1>started teaching nogi jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people got upset at him and the </v>

1660
01:10:09.231 --> 01:10:11.730
<v Speaker 1>jujitsu community that he was abandoning</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gay.</v>

1661
01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:12.950
<v Speaker 1>It was like a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1662
01:10:12.951 --> 01:10:15.650
<v Speaker 1>and he's a revolutionary man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really is.</v>

1663
01:10:15.690 --> 01:10:16.523
<v Speaker 1>It's in when it comes to jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy has a crazy database of </v>

1664
01:10:20.631 --> 01:10:21.464
<v Speaker 1>information in his head when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like jujitsu moves and a lot of it he </v>

1665
01:10:25.161 --> 01:10:29.420
<v Speaker 1>learned because he learned john jocks </v>
<v Speaker 1>the at least the base of his style,</v>

1666
01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:32.060
<v Speaker 1>which john jack developed because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't grab onto things.</v>

1667
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>

1668
01:10:35.121 --> 01:10:36.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a silly question.</v>

1669
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:37.703
<v Speaker 1>Could could Bruce Lee really fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure Bruce Lee could fuck up a lot </v>

1670
01:10:41.601 --> 01:10:42.720
<v Speaker 1>of people if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1671
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:43.583
<v Speaker 1>You watched him throw kicks and punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy definitely knew how to hit </v>

1672
01:10:45.981 --> 01:10:48.760
<v Speaker 1>things and there's some video of him </v>
<v Speaker 1>sparring it.</v>

1673
01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Definitely where he did some sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that means if you've done sparring,</v>

1674
01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.710
<v Speaker 1>like if you've never hit anybody before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

1675
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:58.190
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even wHat do you hit?</v>

1676
01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:59.990
<v Speaker 1>You hit bags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't hit a bag either.</v>

1677
01:10:59.991 --> 01:11:00.824
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever have anybody hold the myths </v>

1678
01:11:01.581 --> 01:11:02.414
<v Speaker 1>for you and no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing and just kind of try to hit a </v>

1679
01:11:03.471 --> 01:11:04.304
<v Speaker 1>person as a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to hit people hitting the </v>

1680
01:11:06.351 --> 01:11:07.184
<v Speaker 1>person is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel like You think it's </v>

1681
01:11:08.121 --> 01:11:09.440
<v Speaker 1>going to feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels weird.</v>

1682
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:12.530
<v Speaker 1>It feels really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1683
01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.300
<v Speaker 1>after being hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feels totally normal.</v>

1684
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Does It?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get hit you're like,</v>

1685
01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.570
<v Speaker 1>there's no weirdness to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1686
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:19.583
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just like what I remember when I </v>

1687
01:11:20.911 --> 01:11:23.250
<v Speaker 1>ran into my friend's elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same feeling.</v>

1688
01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you get tuned up on your jaw.</v>

1689
01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never popped a new job.</v>

1690
01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:29.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird feeling because your legs</v>

1691
01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:30.450
<v Speaker 1>just stopped working.</v>

1692
01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:31.973
<v Speaker 1>I got dropped in a kickboxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got dropped with a left hook and my </v>

1693
01:11:34.741 --> 01:11:37.500
<v Speaker 1>legs just so they just shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

1694
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:39.360
<v Speaker 1>shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My legs just shut off.</v>

1695
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.820
<v Speaker 1>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped working like somebody.</v>

1696
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I thought that when you got hit on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>john,</v>

1697
01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:46.590
<v Speaker 1>you went down like that because you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

1698
01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:48.410
<v Speaker 1>And because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1699
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:49.141
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

1700
01:11:49.141 --> 01:11:50.670
<v Speaker 1>this hurts so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to fall down.</v>

1701
01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Like almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1702
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:52.703
<v Speaker 1>But it's not really that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something hAppens when you get hit </v>

1703
01:11:56.401 --> 01:12:01.290
<v Speaker 1>with like a perfect knockout punch or </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a knockdown punch when your jaw,</v>

1704
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:03.570
<v Speaker 1>when they connect with your jaw and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>jaw,</v>

1705
01:12:03.571 --> 01:12:08.571
<v Speaker 1>like displaces all that energy on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pivot of your jaw and the brain stem and</v>

1706
01:12:10.351 --> 01:12:11.184
<v Speaker 1>your spine and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Is getting damaged in there when </v>

1707
01:12:13.381 --> 01:12:15.690
<v Speaker 1>your jaws rattling around inside of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

1708
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:20.870
<v Speaker 1>but it sends a spark like a and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit just goes really?</v>

1709
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just get shut off.</v>

1710
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:25.580
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And mine was a like,</v>

1711
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:26.423
<v Speaker 1>I would say a half shut off because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was still conscious but my legs stopped </v>

1712
01:12:29.541 --> 01:12:30.374
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was still super aware that I was </v>

1713
01:12:31.861 --> 01:12:34.080
<v Speaker 1>in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew exactly what was going on.</v>

1714
01:12:34.081 --> 01:12:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I knew I just got tagged and I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1715
01:12:36.031 --> 01:12:37.950
<v Speaker 1>this has never happened to me before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never had my legs give out.</v>

1716
01:12:37.951 --> 01:12:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Like she didn't go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1717
01:12:39.061 --> 01:12:39.390
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1718
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:39.870
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1719
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:43.560
<v Speaker 1>onlY 50 percent there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've of course seen every variety of</v>

1720
01:12:43.561 --> 01:12:47.160
<v Speaker 1>that and sometimes you'll see a guy gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut off with a punch.</v>

1721
01:12:47.161 --> 01:12:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Like someone just hit someone with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect punch,</v>

1722
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:51.090
<v Speaker 1>like you remember when manny pacquiao </v>
<v Speaker 1>fought one,</v>

1723
01:12:51.091 --> 01:12:53.670
<v Speaker 1>one mil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Juan manuel marquez the last fight.</v>

1724
01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:55.050
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

1725
01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.390
<v Speaker 1>One of the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All time.</v>

1726
01:12:57.391 --> 01:12:58.860
<v Speaker 1>One punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knockouts packing.</v>

1727
01:12:58.860 --> 01:12:59.693
<v Speaker 1>I was charging in and this is I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>the third or the fourth time they had </v>

1728
01:13:03.181 --> 01:13:06.020
<v Speaker 1>fought each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the third and one men.</v>

1729
01:13:06.021 --> 01:13:06.854
<v Speaker 1>Well mark as an corks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perfect right hand on packing house </v>

1730
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.970
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh I didn't see that.</v>

1731
01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:15.420
<v Speaker 1>I did face plants and he's out for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long ass time.</v>

1732
01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:18.330
<v Speaker 1>He just face plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1733
01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.130
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

1734
01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Watched it blow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.823
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is a god damn perfect punch </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can knock a guy like that </v>

1736
01:13:26.311 --> 01:13:27.900
<v Speaker 1>completely out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1737
01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:29.033
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the highest level that you </v>

1738
01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:32.880
<v Speaker 1>achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh jesus.</v>

1739
01:13:32.881 --> 01:13:33.714
<v Speaker 1>Hitting that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The highest level is eveRything stops </v>

1740
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:37.343
<v Speaker 1>and they got to wake you up and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably don't even Remember what </v>

1741
01:13:38.851 --> 01:13:39.684
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

1742
01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:42.443
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

1743
01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:44.080
<v Speaker 1>I never got to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1744
01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:46.060
<v Speaker 1>I never got hit and had that happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1745
01:13:46.061 --> 01:13:46.894
<v Speaker 1>But having that halfway thing happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>where your legs just stopped but you're </v>

1746
01:13:49.141 --> 01:13:50.500
<v Speaker 1>awake and you know exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1747
01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:53.200
<v Speaker 1>It's such a weird feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>

1748
01:13:53.201 --> 01:13:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't even know that was the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a button there.</v>

1749
01:13:55.151 --> 01:13:55.984
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know it was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't really know what is it </v>

1750
01:13:57.761 --> 01:13:59.260
<v Speaker 1>that happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a nerve that.</v>

1751
01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1752
01:14:00.551 --> 01:14:01.384
<v Speaker 1>something I've explained it and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>had someone correct me and say that's </v>

1753
01:14:03.941 --> 01:14:07.240
<v Speaker 1>not scientifically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking which shocker bro.</v>

1754
01:14:07.241 --> 01:14:08.074
<v Speaker 1>Science.</v>

1755
01:14:10.230 --> 01:14:11.063
<v Speaker 1>But about something happens when you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>punched in the jaw that your jaw of </v>

1756
01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.100
<v Speaker 1>rattles against your spine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

1757
01:14:15.101 --> 01:14:15.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really.</v>

1758
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.811
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1759
01:14:16.811 --> 01:14:18.320
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what does happen is like,</v>

1760
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:21.340
<v Speaker 1>is it the spin of the head?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it that makes sense?</v>

1761
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Because there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ThAt's one thing,</v>

1762
01:14:22.961 --> 01:14:26.260
<v Speaker 1>like what's happens if you get clipped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He noticed that people's jaws,</v>

1763
01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:29.920
<v Speaker 1>they had fucking bounces around a lot on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the impact.</v>

1764
01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get caught with a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good body shot,</v>

1765
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:33.840
<v Speaker 1>you get dropped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1766
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get hit,</v>

1767
01:14:35.710 --> 01:14:36.543
<v Speaker 1>you get dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body's kind of absorbing all the </v>

1768
01:14:39.611 --> 01:14:42.760
<v Speaker 1>shock of that punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your head when your head absorbs it,</v>

1769
01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:44.163
<v Speaker 1>your shit just swivels around your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think about your head is like the </v>

1770
01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:51.010
<v Speaker 1>worst thing you could ever hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing is barely connected.</v>

1771
01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:54.250
<v Speaker 1>All wobbly and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bones are.</v>

1772
01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.680
<v Speaker 1>There's like little stacks of boston on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a big bone.</v>

1773
01:14:56.770 --> 01:15:00.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a big ass thighbone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>connects my fucking head to my neck.</v>

1774
01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's wrong with this shitty </v>

1775
01:15:01.811 --> 01:15:02.644
<v Speaker 1>vertebrae?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff with gooey gel in between pieces </v>

1776
01:15:05.711 --> 01:15:07.470
<v Speaker 1>of bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1777
01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:10.390
<v Speaker 1>What a shit idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whose plan is this?</v>

1778
01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.313
<v Speaker 1>I made this.</v>

1779
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:14.250
<v Speaker 2>I've been knocked unconscious a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of times now that I think about it.</v>

1780
01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:15.923
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about this at one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many concussions as normal and I </v>

1781
01:15:18.921 --> 01:15:21.180
<v Speaker 2>think I've had like 10 concussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not normal.</v>

1782
01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:23.760
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at least seven.</v>

1783
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I probably have a bunch that I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>denial about because like inspiring,</v>

1784
01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.270
<v Speaker 1>like you would get hit in the head all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

1785
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Yo jay me bring it the b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sparring.</v>

1786
01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:42.230
<v Speaker 1>You get hit in the head all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you get rocked and if you.</v>

1787
01:15:42.231 --> 01:15:46.040
<v Speaker 1>If you're sparring and you get rocked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what does constitute a concussion?</v>

1788
01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:46.933
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people have concussions and </v>

1789
01:15:47.751 --> 01:15:49.340
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even have a bad sparring </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1790
01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:51.920
<v Speaker 1>They go home and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start throwing up.</v>

1791
01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:51.960

1793
01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:56.190
<v Speaker 2>can cost and they don't even remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shot.</v>

1794

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1814
01:16:37.201 --> 01:16:41.760
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to ever admit that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up when you hit your head dudes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

1817
01:16:45.061 --> 01:16:45.894
<v Speaker 2>My parents did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if my parents called </v>

1818
01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:49.440
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>LiKe I look back at that and I wonder if</v>

1819
01:16:49.441 --> 01:16:51.480
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as a parent of a 12 year old,</v>

1820
01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:55.470
<v Speaker 2>I would lose my shit if my kid was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>philadelphia and she got a concussion,</v>

1821
01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.260
<v Speaker 2>I'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be on a fucking plane tomorrow.</v>

1822
01:16:58.650 --> 01:16:59.483
<v Speaker 2>We'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone gets a concussIon like </v>

1823
01:17:00.541 --> 01:17:02.190
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta really keep an eye on them for</v>

1824
01:17:02.191 --> 01:17:04.330
<v Speaker 2>quite a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kept me up.</v>

1825
01:17:04.331 --> 01:17:07.440
<v Speaker 2>They put me in the rectory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why do they keep you awake?</v>

1826
01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.333
<v Speaker 2>What's the logic behind that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't that we kept like every hour I </v>

1827
01:17:10.971 --> 01:17:13.460
<v Speaker 2>think is you don't want to fall asleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go to sleep forever.</v>

01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:51.140
<v Speaker 2>I raised my eyebrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything eLse?</v>

1841
01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:52.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny.</v>

1842
01:17:52.131 --> 01:17:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I could probably get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like oblivious.</v>

1843
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:54.854
<v Speaker 2>You ever see those movies where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sharks in the water and the people are </v>

1844
01:17:56.661 --> 01:17:58.700
<v Speaker 2>swimming and dance and have a good time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you're like,</v>

1845
01:17:58.730 --> 01:17:59.301
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to get it.</v>

1846
01:17:59.301 --> 01:18:00.590
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna get it's gonna get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to get it.</v>

1847
01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:02.120
<v Speaker 2>And then they just get out there like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1848
01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:04.130
<v Speaker 2>let's go do something else now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they don't get attacked.</v>

1849
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:07.580
<v Speaker 2>But I was probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was with molestation really.</v>

1850
01:18:07.670 --> 01:18:10.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm certain of it really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it just barely missed you.</v>

1851
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Every time I would have been a mark like</v>
<v Speaker 2>molesters,</v>

1852
01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.010
<v Speaker 2>wet dream because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>

1853
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:21.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always attracted those people in my</v>

1854
01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:22.154
<v Speaker 2>life to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that take advantage of people I </v>

1855
01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.370
<v Speaker 2>molesters must have seen had spots on </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1856
01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:32.180
<v Speaker 2>I remember watching the kid get molested</v>
<v Speaker 2>one time.</v>

1857
01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

1858
01:18:33.581 --> 01:18:34.970
<v Speaker 2>not like molested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

1859
01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:37.040
<v Speaker 2>it was definitely a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an assault.</v>

1860
01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:41.420
<v Speaker 2>We were in a kids camp of baptist kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp and uh,</v>

1861
01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:42.553
<v Speaker 2>I remember we were all in our bunk beds </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was lights out and all of a </v>

1862
01:18:44.151 --> 01:18:47.420
<v Speaker 2>sudden the lights came on and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1863
01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.410
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two counselors,</v>

1864
01:18:48.411 --> 01:18:51.620
<v Speaker 2>or like a hog tie in time and this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's like,</v>

1865
01:18:51.621 --> 01:18:56.000
<v Speaker 2>seth run and this one kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they just came down to the bronx.</v>

1866
01:18:56.001 --> 01:18:56.834
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one kid came running and they </v>

1867
01:18:58.761 --> 01:18:59.594
<v Speaker 2>grabbed him and they flipped him over </v>
<v Speaker 2>that rope and they hog tied him and </v>

1868
01:19:03.081 --> 01:19:05.630
<v Speaker 2>ripped his underwear off him and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought him into the shower.</v>

1869
01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.480
<v Speaker 2>And we all went into the shower and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had him in the shower and they were</v>

1870
01:19:08.481 --> 01:19:09.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

1871
01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:10.593
<v Speaker 2>And then like it was fucking creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they didn't touch his dick or </v>

1872
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:14.630
<v Speaker 2>fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottle or anything,</v>

1873
01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:17.490
<v Speaker 2>but just the fact that he was tied up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

1874
01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.900
<v Speaker 2>like thrown them in the shower and threw</v>
<v Speaker 2>him in the shower.</v>

1875
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:22.280
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember going,</v>

1876
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:23.323
<v Speaker 2>jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>note to self hide when they say hog </v>

1877
01:19:24.651 --> 01:19:27.110
<v Speaker 2>tying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to camp.</v>

1878
01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:28.400
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same guy,</v>

1879
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:31.100
<v Speaker 2>those same two guys that did that to him</v>
<v Speaker 2>taught me archery.</v>

1880
01:19:31.210 --> 01:19:32.043
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

1881

1882
01:19:35.241 --> 01:19:36.074
<v Speaker 1>this kid up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tied this kid up in his bed and </v>

1883
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.153
<v Speaker 1>they took his bunk is a little cot cot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They carried it out and he woke up as </v>

1884
01:19:41.571 --> 01:19:42.404
<v Speaker 1>they were taking them outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pitch black outside to pitch </v>

1885
01:19:45.201 --> 01:19:48.800
<v Speaker 1>black and you couldn't see a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>inch in front of your face.</v>

1886
01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.670
<v Speaker 1>And They took this kid deep in the woods</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a.</v>

1887
01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:54.570
<v Speaker 1>It gets yellow and put me back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put me back.</v>

1888
01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:56.790
<v Speaker 1>They covered all of this shit with </v>
<v Speaker 1>toothpaste,</v>

1889
01:19:56.791 --> 01:19:57.624
<v Speaker 1>apparently toothpaste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least some toothpaste does not wash </v>

1890
01:19:59.821 --> 01:20:01.260
<v Speaker 1>out of your clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1891
01:20:01.261 --> 01:20:02.094
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if it does take a tremendous effort </v>

1892
01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 1>so that this guy squirt toothpaste all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over this guy's and rubbed it in</v>

1893
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.160
<v Speaker 4>this fucking piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck.</v>

1894
01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:13.380
<v Speaker 4>Kids away from their parents for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first time.</v>

1895
01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:14.363
<v Speaker 4>And it was just a few weird counselors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember I had this conversation with </v>

1896
01:20:17.941 --> 01:20:19.360
<v Speaker 4>his counselor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1897
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:21.270
<v Speaker 4>or I guess what do you call him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boy scout leaders,</v>

1898
01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.730
<v Speaker 4>a scout leader.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like an eagle scout and the kid was</v>

1899
01:20:23.731 --> 01:20:26.090
<v Speaker 4>a 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like the last year that you can</v>

1900
01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:27.430
<v Speaker 4>be a boy scout,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1901
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:31.950
<v Speaker 4>and he and I were hanging out and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was uh,</v>

1902
01:20:32.010 --> 01:20:35.370
<v Speaker 4>talking to me about all his time in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>boy scouts and all the things he learned</v>

1903
01:20:35.371 --> 01:20:38.070
<v Speaker 4>about the boys and now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're kind of kicking them out because</v>

1904
01:20:38.071 --> 01:20:40.260
<v Speaker 4>you can't be in the boy scouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a fucking boy.</v>

1905
01:20:40.261 --> 01:20:41.094
<v Speaker 4>Loser.</v>

1906
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:46.070
<v Speaker 4>Boy scouts are weird that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I started to realize like,</v>

1907
01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:48.690
<v Speaker 4>this is due at the end of his career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's over for you.</v>

1908
01:20:48.691 --> 01:20:50.040
<v Speaker 4>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your eagle scout.</v>

1909
01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:53.370
<v Speaker 4>You peak two peaks at 18.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1910
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.440
<v Speaker 4>put.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was a huge part of his life.</v>

1911
01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:56.693
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had all these merit badges and shit </v>

1912
01:20:57.871 --> 01:20:59.580
<v Speaker 4>all over his clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were telling him,</v>

1913
01:20:59.581 --> 01:21:01.360
<v Speaker 4>sOn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to fucking stop you gotta.</v>

1914
01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:02.213
<v Speaker 4>Stop with your fantasy worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether your badges and your fucking </v>

1915
01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:07.650
<v Speaker 4>ropes around your shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those ropes of those little,</v>

1916
01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:08.543
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1917
01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:09.653
<v Speaker 4>Lockton's reps don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have those little ropes with the </v>

1918
01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:13.920
<v Speaker 4>flux,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that rope all about.</v>

1919
01:21:13.921 --> 01:21:16.120
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have definitely got melissa if I</v>

1920
01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:18.960
<v Speaker 4>was the boy scouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was an article I wrote.</v>

1921
01:21:18.961 --> 01:21:20.940
<v Speaker 4>It's funny how you read things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not wrote,</v>

1922
01:21:20.941 --> 01:21:21.774
<v Speaker 4>read rather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny how you read things when </v>

1923
01:21:23.131 --> 01:21:24.240
<v Speaker 4>you're a little kid.</v>

1924
01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:25.463
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I was maybe beef maybe 14 or 15 </v>

1925
01:21:27.451 --> 01:21:28.284
<v Speaker 4>when I read this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some guy wrote it in the school </v>

1926
01:21:30.031 --> 01:21:34.500
<v Speaker 4>newspaper in newton south high school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was talking about the,</v>

1927
01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:35.473
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that they make you say when </v>

1928
01:21:36.811 --> 01:21:39.540
<v Speaker 4>you're a boy scout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I promised to be trustworthy,</v>

1929
01:21:39.541 --> 01:21:41.370
<v Speaker 4>loyal blade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brave,</v>

1930
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:43.260
<v Speaker 4>clean and reverent or something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1931
01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:45.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that'S the honest,</v>

1932
01:21:45.271 --> 01:21:46.350
<v Speaker 4>trustworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>loyal,</v>

1933
01:21:46.351 --> 01:21:47.790
<v Speaker 4>brave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clean and reverent.</v>

1934
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:50.730
<v Speaker 4>I think those are the commandments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I remember correctly,</v>

1935
01:21:50.731 --> 01:21:51.564
<v Speaker 4>maybe there's more of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was describing them and they </v>

1936
01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:55.163
<v Speaker 4>were just describing keeping your </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts clean and this guy who who </v>

1937
01:21:58.621 --> 01:22:00.060
<v Speaker 4>wrote an article was another high school</v>
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>

1938
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:02.280
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really good point.</v>

1939
01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:05.120
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mind is my.</v>

1940
01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:05.963
<v Speaker 4>I can have whatever thoughts I want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like as long as I don't do anything </v>

1941
01:22:08.821 --> 01:22:09.930
<v Speaker 4>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why?</v>

1942
01:22:09.931 --> 01:22:11.850
<v Speaker 4>Why should you try to control my </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts?</v>

1943
01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:14.760
<v Speaker 4>And like he's right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's right.</v>

1944
01:22:14.761 --> 01:22:16.530
<v Speaker 4>Like what is this thing clean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why,</v>

1945
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:18.240
<v Speaker 4>why can't you think terrible dirty </v>
<v Speaker 4>things?</v>

1946
01:22:18.241 --> 01:22:20.070
<v Speaker 4>Because it amuses you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1947
01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:23.870
<v Speaker 4>as long as you're not hurting anybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>then what is the point like?</v>

1948
01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:27.240
<v Speaker 4>Like I've never once thought about </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking a kid,</v>

1949
01:22:27.810 --> 01:22:31.320
<v Speaker 4>but like are there people that are legit</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that like they must think that.</v>

1950
01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:32.963
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think that like I don't have to </v>

1951
01:22:34.261 --> 01:22:37.830
<v Speaker 4>control my thoughts was absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are attracted to children.</v>

1952
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:42.900
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so obviously there is something to blame</v>

1953
01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:47.250
<v Speaker 4>anyone that does that to a child,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how then do you stop their brains?</v>

1954
01:22:47.251 --> 01:22:49.770
<v Speaker 4>That's what the brain's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not doing it on purpose,</v>

1955
01:22:49.771 --> 01:22:50.604
<v Speaker 4>but their brains going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the real debate when it comes to </v>

1956
01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:58.260
<v Speaker 4>like when neuroscientists try to analyze</v>
<v Speaker 4>different types of behavior,</v>

1957
01:22:58.290 --> 01:23:00.430
<v Speaker 4>destructive behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1958
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.433
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you can look at any type of </v>

1959
01:23:03.031 --> 01:23:06.250
<v Speaker 4>horrible destructive behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1960
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:10.300
<v Speaker 1>you get to that one where you literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even want to help them.</v>

1961
01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:11.403
<v Speaker 1>And that's the one you were gambling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism and even being prone to </v>

1962
01:23:16.631 --> 01:23:20.470
<v Speaker 1>violence and are the different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of different therapies</v>

1963
01:23:20.471 --> 01:23:23.860
<v Speaker 1>and different ways that people would try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move you away from that.</v>

1964
01:23:23.861 --> 01:23:24.694
<v Speaker 1>But I got to imagine there's very few </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapies that anybody wants to invest </v>

1965
01:23:29.261 --> 01:23:31.720
<v Speaker 1>in to try to get someone to stop fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

1966
01:23:32.010 --> 01:23:32.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now just like we don't have any </v>

1967
01:23:33.371 --> 01:23:34.660
<v Speaker 1>tolerance for that at all.</v>

1968
01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.273
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean this is a really volatile </v>

1969
01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:41.080
<v Speaker 2>question to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is it their fault?</v>

1970
01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:43.503
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real good question and it's so </v>

1971
01:23:45.041 --> 01:23:46.150
<v Speaker 1>easy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it is.</v>

1972
01:23:46.151 --> 01:23:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1973
01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:49.270
<v Speaker 1>you're having sex with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you piece of shit.</v>

1974
01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:50.133
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in a way you're right for saying </v>

1975
01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:53.194
<v Speaker 1>that you're right for thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're angry because what </v>

1976
01:23:55.151 --> 01:23:57.040
<v Speaker 1>they're doing is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're ruining lives.</v>

1977
01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.353
<v Speaker 1>We all know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think human beings are just a </v>

1978
01:24:01.391 --> 01:24:02.224
<v Speaker 1>combination of experiences and genetics </v>
<v Speaker 1>and environment and all the data that </v>

1979
01:24:05.831 --> 01:24:10.330
<v Speaker 1>comes into them and the decisions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you make based on all those things.</v>

1980
01:24:10.331 --> 01:24:11.164
<v Speaker 1>They're not even like your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your life experience is way different </v>

1981
01:24:13.301 --> 01:24:14.134
<v Speaker 1>than my life experience and I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened to him when he was a baby </v>

1982
01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:21.530
<v Speaker 1>that Made him this monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this 45 year old guy who wants to.</v>

1983
01:24:21.810 --> 01:24:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1984
01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Like jared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1985
01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know who the fuck knows what torture</v>

1986
01:24:28.811 --> 01:24:30.790
<v Speaker 1>he endured when he was young?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1987
01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:34.410
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's just a bad person that could.</v>

1988
01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:36.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a possibility too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not discounting that,</v>

1989
01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:37.773
<v Speaker 1>but what is it about that one thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular that we don't have any faith </v>

1990
01:24:44.591 --> 01:24:48.310
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever that you can ever completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it out of your system?</v>

1991
01:24:48.570 --> 01:24:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never could.</v>

1992
01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:51.210
<v Speaker 2>It will be like curing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to cure him.</v>

1993
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Crew me from being straight.</v>

1994
01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:55.900
<v Speaker 1>You say that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that crazy that,</v>

1995
01:24:55.901 --> 01:24:59.750
<v Speaker 1>that there's no biological imperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1996
01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:04.320
<v Speaker 1>there's no biological pole to have sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>with little kids.</v>

1997
01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just a crazy fucked up reversion.</v>

1998
01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not like saying you could never be </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a woman again.</v>

1999
01:25:09.781 --> 01:25:11.640
<v Speaker 1>You can never feel a woman's touch </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2000
01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:15.750
<v Speaker 1>It's more like saying you can't gamble </v>
<v Speaker 1>again or more like saying,</v>

2001
01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:16.773
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the campbell campbell's that there's </v>

2002
01:25:17.941 --> 01:25:18.774
<v Speaker 1>something like a crazy perverted sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction connection that they're </v>

2003
01:25:22.981 --> 01:25:25.800
<v Speaker 1>having with people that they shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like young people.</v>

2004
01:25:25.801 --> 01:25:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's that coming from?</v>

2005
01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:29.093
<v Speaker 1>and if it's coming from them being </v>
<v Speaker 1>victimized and that's what a lot of it </v>

2006
01:25:31.351 --> 01:25:32.184
<v Speaker 1>is a lot of is coming from them being </v>
<v Speaker 1>victimized when they're young and they </v>

2007
01:25:35.041 --> 01:25:40.041
<v Speaker 1>in turn start victimizing other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tHe most common form of um,</v>

2008
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:43.223
<v Speaker 1>how they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pedophilia actually travels back and </v>

2009
01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:49.140
<v Speaker 1>forth almost like a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fucked up.</v>

2010
01:25:49.141 --> 01:25:49.974
<v Speaker 1>It's like a disease of the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could give it to somebody and </v>

2011
01:25:52.921 --> 01:25:55.020
<v Speaker 1>fuck with their sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it,</v>

2012
01:25:55.021 --> 01:25:58.550
<v Speaker 1>if you read less to ken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you molest kids and you.</v>

2013
01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:00.910
<v Speaker 1>If you look at all these guys that wind </v>
<v Speaker 1>up being the lesters,</v>

2014
01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:04.340
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them were molested as kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible</v>

2015
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:05.173
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and obviously a lot of them don't do </v>

2016
01:26:07.431 --> 01:26:08.264
<v Speaker 2>that and don't have the urge to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something that happens to </v>

2017
01:26:10.821 --> 01:26:11.654
<v Speaker 2>some of them where it becomes this </v>
<v Speaker 2>really fucked up thing that just keeps </v>

2018
01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:18.800
<v Speaker 2>passing on from person to person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from victim to victim,</v>

2019
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:20.263
<v Speaker 2>which is a horrible stigmatization if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been molested because you assume </v>

2020
01:26:22.881 --> 01:26:25.910
<v Speaker 2>if you tell people that everyone thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be molesting kids,</v>

2021
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:27.583
<v Speaker 2>what a weird thing it must be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To have that impulse to an impulse that </v>

2022
01:26:32.451 --> 01:26:33.284
<v Speaker 2>you know is hoRrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad I don't have that because I </v>

2023
01:26:37.011 --> 01:26:39.230
<v Speaker 2>cannot control my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely cannot.</v>

2024
01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:42.380
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think massively horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking thoughts,</v>

2025
01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:46.190
<v Speaker 2>but that has never crept in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To the point where I think,</v>

2026
01:26:46.191 --> 01:26:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine what draw it is to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2027
01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:51.413
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2028
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:55.500
<v Speaker 2>the withdrawal would be to be with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>child does not draw.</v>

2029
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:57.440
<v Speaker 2>There's something broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men,</v>

2030
01:26:57.710 --> 01:27:00.470
<v Speaker 2>some crazy disconnect in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2031
01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:04.070
<v Speaker 2>I look at sexuality and I look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to be with someone.</v>

2032
01:27:04.890 --> 01:27:05.723
<v Speaker 2>I would like to share a moment with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone accomplished that knows what </v>

2033
01:27:09.711 --> 01:27:12.230
<v Speaker 2>they're doing and I would hate to </v>
<v Speaker 2>instruct someone.</v>

2034
01:27:12.231 --> 01:27:14.480
<v Speaker 2>I would never want to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even say that you say that,</v>

2035
01:27:14.481 --> 01:27:16.490
<v Speaker 2>but do you remember that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2036
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:17.840
<v Speaker 2>10 with bo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Derek?</v>

2037

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty hot,</v>

2038
01:27:19.221 --> 01:27:19.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2039
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine bo,</v>

2040
01:27:21.281 --> 01:27:22.700
<v Speaker 2>derek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2041
01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:23.563

<v Speaker 2>for the first 24 years of her life that </v>

2042
01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:28.063
<v Speaker 2>she's never seen a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And finally you and her meat and you're </v>

2043
01:27:31.941 --> 01:27:34.190
<v Speaker 2>hanging out and it's going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

2044
01:27:34.191 --> 01:27:36.560
<v Speaker 2>which she doesn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you fucking help her out.</v>

2045
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:37.783
<v Speaker 2>I definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can show her the way and I definitely </v>

2046
01:27:39.321 --> 01:27:41.600
<v Speaker 2>tell her a bunch of how it works.</v>

2047
01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:41.871
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2048
01:27:41.871 --> 01:27:43.580

2051
01:27:48.531 --> 01:27:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Lolita.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that book?</v>

2052
01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:51.993
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read it.</v>

2053
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2054
01:27:54.591 --> 01:27:56.690
<v Speaker 2>I read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I read it in russian.</v>

2055
01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:57.711
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>swear to god.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2058
01:28:00.621 --> 01:28:02.600
<v Speaker 2>I can understand russian though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2059
01:28:02.630 --> 01:28:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Now how much can you read a nun anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You used to be able to.</v>

2060
01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to because of the.</v>

2061
01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:08.443
<v Speaker 2>Because the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different alphabet and I can't </v>

2062
01:28:10.101 --> 01:28:10.934
<v Speaker 2>read it at all anymore and I thought it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be able to pick it up a little </v>

2063
01:28:12.441 --> 01:28:14.330
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a diary written in russian.</v>

2064
01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:15.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was backpacking through europe </v>

<v Speaker 2>to do it all the fucking time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>to cut out to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a better way to describe what was </v>

<v Speaker 3>real life.</v>

2531
01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:18.780
<v Speaker 3>My wife is one of the fucked me up.</v>

2532
01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:20.760
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why was watching someone?</v>

2533
01:48:20.761 --> 01:48:22.800
<v Speaker 3>And it was like a guy in the girl's </v>
<v Speaker 3>gagging.</v>

2534
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:24.270
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking gag.</v>

2535
01:48:24.271 --> 01:48:25.320
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no shit.</v>

2536
01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:26.950
<v Speaker 3>And then she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god.</v>

2537
01:48:26.970 --> 01:48:28.070
<v Speaker 3>And then she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2538
01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:29.700
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

2539
01:48:29.701 --> 01:48:30.534
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's so funny that you'd watch </v>

2540
01:48:30.881 --> 01:48:33.180
<v Speaker 3>something that you don't even do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went,</v>

2541
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:34.440
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

2542
01:48:34.710 --> 01:48:36.630
<v Speaker 3>you're watching something that's total </v>
<v Speaker 3>fantasy.</v>

2543
01:48:36.631 --> 01:48:37.464
<v Speaker 3>Like you have no attachment to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's almost like the sex you have is </v>

2544
01:48:40.411 --> 01:48:42.240
<v Speaker 3>something totally different than what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you masturbate too.</v>

2545
01:48:42.241 --> 01:48:43.051
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2546
01:48:43.051 --> 01:48:46.680
<v Speaker 3>that's a good fucking call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I tried to really dial it in to like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what is My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>

2548
01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:52.530
<v Speaker 3>what are the things that actually turned</v>
<v Speaker 3>me on in real life and one of the things</v>

2549
01:48:52.531 --> 01:48:54.420
<v Speaker 3>is with my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an orgasm,</v>

2550
01:48:54.421 --> 01:48:57.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm usually down there and that really </v>
<v Speaker 3>turns me on when that happens.</v>

2551
01:48:57.870 --> 01:48:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>

2552
01:48:58.861 --> 01:49:03.360

2747
01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:01.170
<v Speaker 3>making it or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were rappers.</v>

2748
01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:03.570
<v Speaker 3>It was a scripted reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>

2749
01:57:03.730 --> 01:57:05.670
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was scripted,</v>

2750
01:57:05.671 --> 01:57:10.671
<v Speaker 3>but it was about them wanting to be hip </v>
<v Speaker 3>hop stars all blowing up,</v>

2751
01:57:11.070 --> 01:57:11.903
<v Speaker 3>blowing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's an episode where they </v>

2752
01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:16.950
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's doing a test,</v>

2753
01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:20.220
<v Speaker 3>he's going to do a tv show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a movie with tracy morgan,</v>

2754
01:57:20.610 --> 01:57:22.560
<v Speaker 3>and to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do the screen test.</v>

2755
01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:25.860
<v Speaker 3>He needs to get put in blackface.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He needs to be addressed as a black man,</v>

2756
01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:27.053
<v Speaker 3>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they dress him as a black man and he </v>

2757
01:57:28.441 --> 01:57:29.274
<v Speaker 3>gets all dressed up as a black guy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tracy morgan convinces them that he's </v>

2758
01:57:32.341 --> 01:57:33.174
<v Speaker 3>very convincing as a black guy and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he should do is him and stu stone </v>

2759
01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:38.453
<v Speaker 3>should both get in face paint and look </v>
<v Speaker 3>like by people and then go down to the </v>

2760
01:57:41.761 --> 01:57:42.594
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six mafia show and freestyle for them </v>

2761
01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:48.690
<v Speaker 3>because as black men for the three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six mafia will really appreciate it.</v>

2762
01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and joe,</v>

2763
01:57:51.370 --> 01:57:54.740
<v Speaker 3>there is a moment where they're driving </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a car to long beach address,</v>

2764
01:57:55.390 --> 01:57:58.870
<v Speaker 6>black guys and they're talking to each </v>
<v Speaker 6>other and they're like,</v>

2765
01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:04.200
<v Speaker 6>do you think this is a good idea?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is there a hidden cameras in the car?</v>

2766
01:58:08.590 --> 01:58:10.460
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no man.</v>

2767
01:58:11.250 --> 01:58:12.083
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're just going to be trained in the </v>

2768
01:58:14.681 --> 01:58:19.360
<v Speaker 6>order snoop's go into the three six </v>
<v Speaker 6>mafia,</v>

2769
01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:21.693
<v Speaker 6>like</v>

2770
01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:23.800
<v Speaker 3>they start rapping and then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this jamie,</v>

2771
01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:32.210
<v Speaker 6>this is a black person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go out in front of the audience.</v>

2772
01:58:32.270 --> 01:58:37.270
<v Speaker 6>Joe got all black people and rap and how</v>
<v Speaker 6>good was it?</v>

2773
01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:41.010
<v Speaker 6>Who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I couldn't stop.</v>

2774
01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:42.090
<v Speaker 6>It</v>

2775
01:58:42.090 --> 01:58:47.090
<v Speaker 3>was the greatest thing I've ever fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen and I saw jamie kennedy one time at</v>

2776
01:58:47.441 --> 01:58:49.690
<v Speaker 3>the ontario improv and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2777
01:58:49.691 --> 01:58:52.750
<v Speaker 3>I gotta take two seconds and tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>how hard that made me laugh.</v>

2778
01:58:52.751 --> 01:58:53.830
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2779
01:58:53.831 --> 01:58:54.664
<v Speaker 3>you can't find it anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like mtv dropped it and they like burn </v>

2780
01:58:56.621 --> 01:58:57.454
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't get it because he's in black </v>

2781
01:58:58.311 --> 01:58:59.960
<v Speaker 3>face because he's in black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is in.</v>

2782
01:59:00.490 --> 01:59:03.390
<v Speaker 3>He looks so much like a black man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even find an image,</v>

2783
01:59:03.590 --> 01:59:05.980
<v Speaker 3>a screen grab of that all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No weird is that.</v>

2784
01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:09.810
<v Speaker 1>How weird is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But think how strange that is.</v>

2785
01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I get it that it was from minstrel </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows or black or white men would put on</v>

2786
01:59:14.191 --> 01:59:18.990
<v Speaker 1>black face and do these offensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of black men,</v>

2787
01:59:18.991 --> 01:59:21.480
<v Speaker 1>but that's a different look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they were doing it,</v>

2788
01:59:21.481 --> 01:59:22.314
<v Speaker 1>they were doing like this big thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were putting like white </v>

2789
01:59:24.241 --> 01:59:27.180
<v Speaker 1>around their lips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like really exaggerated.</v>

2790
01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you receive that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2791
01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:30.960
<v Speaker 1>what's this guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Al jolson.</v>

2792
01:59:30.990 --> 01:59:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Al jolson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2793
01:59:32.230 --> 01:59:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Was received when he would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

2794
01:59:34.141 --> 01:59:37.200
<v Speaker 1>pull up some video of al jolson in </v>
<v Speaker 1>blackface.</v>

2795
01:59:37.290 --> 01:59:38.123
<v Speaker 1>See if they take it off youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think they take that shit down </v>

2796
01:59:40.711 --> 01:59:41.544
<v Speaker 1>now or do you think you can catch a </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate that actually might be in the </v>

2797
01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:45.720
<v Speaker 1>public domain because it's like one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>

2798
01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:47.273
<v Speaker 1>but I would worry that it was offensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it violates their terms of service </v>

2799
01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:51.280
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2800
01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:53.280
<v Speaker 1>it's already on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2801
01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:55.123
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't bill cosby like take down the </v>

2802
01:59:56.971 --> 01:59:59.220
<v Speaker 1>little rascals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He owns a little rascals,</v>

2803
01:59:59.221 --> 02:00:00.054
<v Speaker 1>the little rascals and tucked it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I hear the rapists are going to </v>

<v Speaker 1>start airing it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really rape the people that got raped </v>

<v Speaker 1>because getting them ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to start airing them.</v>

2806
02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:07.651
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>

2807
02:00:07.651 --> 02:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>

2810
02:00:19.370 --> 02:00:24.370

<v Speaker 7>Hi,</v>

2811
02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:31.433
<v Speaker 7>I'm a seven.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm wide open like he's moving into </v>

2812
02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:51.020
<v Speaker 7>tears,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like walk five miles.</v>

2813
02:00:56.020 --> 02:00:58.180
<v Speaker 3>This is so crazy</v>

2814
02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:04.800
<v Speaker 7>trying when</v>

2815
02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:12.550
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't do a good impression of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>black guy.</v>

2816
02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe black men were different in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the twenties.</v>

2817
02:01:16.690 --> 02:01:20.250
<v Speaker 3>He's using the words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a black guy would use,</v>

2818
02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:21.730
<v Speaker 3>but he's doing it as a white guy,</v>

2819
02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>as a white guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2820
02:01:23.790 --> 02:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just really bizarre.</v>

2821
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:26.663
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bizarre when you think that that </v>

2822
02:01:27.721 --> 02:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>was top of the food chain entertainment </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1927,</v>

2823
02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>so less than 100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine if somebody went to.</v>

2824
02:01:35.850 --> 02:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>You went to a concert and the dude was </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing black paint on</v>

2825
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:43.100
<v Speaker 4>with white stuff around his lips and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was singing that song.</v>

2826
02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:47.360
<v Speaker 4>You would think you were in some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a weird abstract,</v>

2827
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:50.090
<v Speaker 4>modern performance art show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2828
02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:53.870
<v Speaker 4>some weird like alt hipster vincent </v>
<v Speaker 4>gallo would do that now.</v>

2829
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.823
<v Speaker 4>It's something strange that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then he wasn't joking around that </v>

2830
02:01:57.871 --> 02:01:58.704
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was trying to like be what a </v>

2831
02:01:59.721 --> 02:02:01.340
<v Speaker 4>wonderful song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Al.</v>

2832
02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:02.353
<v Speaker 4>What a wonderful song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like those people were apes like just </v>

2833
02:02:05.841 --> 02:02:06.980
<v Speaker 4>from 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>27.</v>

2834
02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:10.280
<v Speaker 4>They were so goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was fun for them to like,</v>

2835
02:02:10.281 --> 02:02:11.114
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna go see the al jolson movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>that al jolson's a hell of an </v>

2836
02:02:13.941 --> 02:02:16.310
<v Speaker 4>entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love when he sings.</v>

2837
02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:19.700
<v Speaker 4>He's got a beautiful voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just liked it.</v>

2838
02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:23.480
<v Speaker 4>It was the first talkie that was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first movie was synchronized sound.</v>

2839
02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:26.510

<v Speaker 4>dick all over town.</v>

2842
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:34.070
<v Speaker 4>I bet there's a part of him that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2917
02:05:52.210 --> 02:05:54.610
<v Speaker 3>but if you're a white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can become a redhead.</v>

2918

2920
02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:00.033
<v Speaker 3>If you were black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can dress in white face and no one </v>

2921
02:06:01.211 --> 02:06:02.170

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're black,</v>

2923
02:06:04.061 --> 02:06:06.190
<v Speaker 3>you can't be a chinese guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's offensive.</v>

2924
02:06:06.970 --> 02:06:09.070
<v Speaker 3>And if you're a chinese guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't pretend to be black.</v>

2925
02:06:09.130 --> 02:06:11.020
<v Speaker 3>That's offensive too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2926
02:06:11.110 --> 02:06:13.900
<v Speaker 3>I used to live with this girl from Peru </v>

<v Speaker 3>98 and nine.</v>

2929
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:22.210
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went in,</v>

02:06:22.660 --> 02:06:26.590
<v Speaker 3>we went in to a room at halloween and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she was dressed like a puerto rican,</v>

2931
02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:27.893
<v Speaker 3>but she was peruvian and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like all the horrible stereotypes </v>

2932
02:06:31.691 --> 02:06:32.524
<v Speaker 3>that you would say would be the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that lowest common denominator puerto </v>

2933

<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

2976
02:08:14.530 --> 02:08:16.310
<v Speaker 1>What is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that being a hip hop fan?</v>

2977
02:08:16.311 --> 02:08:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Like when does it become cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriation?</v>

2978
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:22.190
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you cover someone song,</v>

2979
02:08:22.340 --> 02:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>it's cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that sound weird?</v>

2980
02:08:24.590 --> 02:08:28.940
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you're pretending that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life that you're talking about,</v>

2981
02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:30.013
<v Speaker 1>but clearly she's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just having fun singing a song </v>

2982
02:08:34.251 --> 02:08:36.650
<v Speaker 1>that beyonce sings because she's a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

2983
02:08:37.010 --> 02:08:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2984
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:43.310
<v Speaker 1>It looks like they're having fun just </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it for the fuck of it.</v>

2985
02:08:44.810 --> 02:08:45.643

<v Speaker 1>What are we really getting offended by?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting offended by this.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2993
02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:02.853

02:09:03.401 --> 02:09:04.420
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who gives a shit?</v>

02:13:22.770 --> 02:13:23.603
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people that find things </v>

3091
02:13:24.931 --> 02:13:25.770
<v Speaker 1>offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3092
02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:27.870
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that don't find </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything offensive.</v>

3093
02:13:28.110 --> 02:13:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Some people would find anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive.</v>

3094
02:13:29.791 --> 02:13:30.624
<v Speaker 1>And then along the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people on the </v>

3095
02:13:32.610 --> 02:13:33.443
<v Speaker 1>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them have their own reasons why </v>

3096
02:13:34.921 --> 02:13:37.740
<v Speaker 1>they have a line that they draw and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't like it anymore.</v>

3097
02:13:37.770 --> 02:13:40.410
<v Speaker 1>And you're allowed to have a line </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere you want.</v>

3098
02:13:40.411 --> 02:13:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he.</v>

3099
02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:43.920
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you impose that on other people,</v>

3100
02:13:44.250 --> 02:13:45.083
<v Speaker 1>that's the only time it becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem if you think for some reason </v>

3101
02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:51.720
<v Speaker 1>that just because some people like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain style,</v>

3102
02:13:51.721 --> 02:13:53.670
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a style of music or style </v>
<v Speaker 1>of art,</v>

3103
02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:56.460
<v Speaker 1>anything comedy is just one thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people make,</v>

3104
02:13:56.461 --> 02:13:57.294
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If some people like that style and you </v>

3105
02:13:59.311 --> 02:14:00.144
<v Speaker 1>don't and you get mad at it and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start deciding that these jokes are </v>

3106
02:14:05.401 --> 02:14:08.400
<v Speaker 1>harming people and these jokes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaging people.</v>

3107
02:14:09.180 --> 02:14:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every art form,</v>

3108
02:14:13.110 --> 02:14:16.110
<v Speaker 1>whether it's music or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

3109
02:14:16.111 --> 02:14:16.944
<v Speaker 1>every art form is allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sort of false is we have this </v>

3110
02:14:21.331 --> 02:14:23.820
<v Speaker 1>understanding that you've created some </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>

3111
02:14:24.230 --> 02:14:25.063
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have this understanding that this is </v>

3112
02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:31.290
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily the person who's written</v>
<v Speaker 1>this book's exact thoughts on things.</v>

3113
02:14:32.610 --> 02:14:33.443
<v Speaker 1>Nor is it the person who makes this </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie who made a fictional movie that's </v>

3114
02:14:36.681 --> 02:14:37.560
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a work of art,</v>

3115
02:14:37.561 --> 02:14:38.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've created these scenarios.</v>

3116
02:14:38.731 --> 02:14:39.900
<v Speaker 1>These people didn't really die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3117
02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:40.793
<v Speaker 1>nothing really happened in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in comedy for some reason you can't </v>

3118
02:14:43.111 --> 02:14:46.320
<v Speaker 1>say something ridiculously offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fulling knowing that,</v>

3119
02:14:46.321 --> 02:14:47.154
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the audience knows you don't believe </v>

3120
02:14:48.031 --> 02:14:49.860
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you do do it,</v>

3121
02:14:49.861 --> 02:14:51.290
<v Speaker 1>it's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3122
02:14:51.450 --> 02:14:54.360
<v Speaker 1>So there's that weird thing where you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something really funny,</v>

3123
02:14:54.361 --> 02:14:57.000
<v Speaker 1>that super offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your karate kid joke.</v>

3124
02:14:57.420 --> 02:15:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it about a mr miyagi?</v>

3125
02:15:01.950 --> 02:15:04.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to give it away,</v>

3126
02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:06.600
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

3127
02:15:06.601 --> 02:15:07.530
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3128
02:15:07.531 --> 02:15:08.940
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3129
02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:10.193
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was wondering if you think that at </v>

3130
02:15:11.941 --> 02:15:14.610
<v Speaker 3>some point a danielson's mom would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3131
02:15:14.670 --> 02:15:16.830
<v Speaker 3>I think the janitor is trying to fuck my</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>

3132
02:15:20.230 --> 02:15:21.270
<v Speaker 3>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3133
02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:24.030
<v Speaker 3>I forgot about that tote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny and it's offensive.</v>

3134
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's not a good example because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually logical joke.</v>

3135
02:15:27.061 --> 02:15:28.330
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3136
02:15:28.910 --> 02:15:31.290
<v Speaker 3>It's a logical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally logical,</v>

3137
02:15:31.470 --> 02:15:34.680
<v Speaker 3>but there's many times we say something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's completely ridiculous.</v>

3138
02:15:34.681 --> 02:15:37.620
<v Speaker 3>He don't meet at all and you only say it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a funny thing to say.</v>

3139
02:15:37.730 --> 02:15:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3140
02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:38.953
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take that and to extract it and to </v>

3141
02:15:40.941 --> 02:15:43.410
<v Speaker 1>say that that's like a hate crime when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3142
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:45.380
<v Speaker 1>you know that that person just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around like,</v>

3143
02:15:45.410 --> 02:15:47.090
<v Speaker 1>do you remember when tracy morgan got in</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble?</v>

3144
02:15:47.540 --> 02:15:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Because it said if his son was gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stab them.</v>

3145
02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:55.880
<v Speaker 3>People get so fucking mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting is that there must've</v>

3146
02:15:55.900 --> 02:16:00.310
<v Speaker 3>been a few people that believed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so crazy though.</v>

3147
02:16:00.350 --> 02:16:03.100
<v Speaker 3>Tracy is always crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only met him once.</v>

3148
02:16:03.250 --> 02:16:06.450
<v Speaker 3>He's a madman and that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only met him one fucking time.</v>

3149
02:16:06.460 --> 02:16:07.780
<v Speaker 3>One story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One time.</v>

3150
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:10.210
<v Speaker 3>That's a great story though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't wait time.</v>

3151
02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:12.280
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope to run into them again.</v>

<v Speaker 3>didn't like it and he was like never </v>

3153

<v Speaker 3>guess as what happened when it goes into</v>

3169
02:16:53.261 --> 02:16:54.270
<v Speaker 3>because he was talking about it.</v>

02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:00.153
<v Speaker 3>like old school player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so tony comes in and in the back of </v>

3206
02:18:02.831 --> 02:18:04.480
<v Speaker 3>the room he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3207
02:18:04.481 --> 02:18:06.820
<v Speaker 3>why don't you tell that tracy morgan's </v>
<v Speaker 3>story?</v>

3208
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:09.010
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that tony woods?</v>

3209
02:18:09.011 --> 02:18:10.630
<v Speaker 3>My wife is there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3210
02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:11.980
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tony.</v>

3211
02:18:11.981 --> 02:18:12.671
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3212
02:18:12.671 --> 02:18:14.710
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear what it sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I go,</v>

3213
02:18:14.711 --> 02:18:16.330
<v Speaker 3>why don't you come on stage and tell it </v>
<v Speaker 3>with me?</v>

3214
02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:17.493
<v Speaker 3>So he comes up on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have two mikes and I tell my side of </v>

3215
02:18:20.111 --> 02:18:20.944
<v Speaker 3>the story and he corrects me because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know how everyone's got their side of </v>

3216
02:18:24.131 --> 02:18:26.680
<v Speaker 3>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I remember it man.</v>

3217
02:18:26.681 --> 02:18:31.681
<v Speaker 3>I remember it very vividly that I was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pastor by like I was just hanging on and</v>

3218
02:18:32.381 --> 02:18:34.630
<v Speaker 3>I was there for this story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really do anything.</v>

3219
02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:36.970
<v Speaker 3>And tony's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is not how that happened.</v>

3220
02:18:37.510 --> 02:18:38.343
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3221
02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:39.280
<v Speaker 3>And then he said it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3222
02:18:39.281 --> 02:18:41.560
<v Speaker 3>do you really think the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3223
02:18:41.561 --> 02:18:43.840
<v Speaker 3>the reason he took his shirt off just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you took your shirt off.</v>

3224
02:18:43.870 --> 02:18:46.900
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking way he told you.</v>

3225
02:18:46.901 --> 02:18:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it totally different?</v>

3226
02:18:48.010 --> 02:18:48.843
<v Speaker 3>The only thing we agree on is the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of the story where when he said </v>

3227
02:18:51.671 --> 02:18:52.660
<v Speaker 3>that's how you get out of pain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>check,</v>

3228
02:18:52.690 --> 02:18:54.760
<v Speaker 3>that's the only thing we agree on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3229
02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:55.653
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting how two people can </v>

3230
02:18:56.741 --> 02:18:57.574
<v Speaker 3>share an experience and it's being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be very similar in like the places </v>

3231
02:19:03.191 --> 02:19:04.540
<v Speaker 3>like we went to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Madame sets the bar,</v>

3232
02:19:04.541 --> 02:19:08.560
<v Speaker 3>we were at [inaudible] and I told tony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like started telling on stage.</v>

3233
02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:11.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human memory super flawed.</v>

3234
02:19:11.410 --> 02:19:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really flawed.</v>

3235
02:19:12.671 --> 02:19:13.504
<v Speaker 3>They find that more and more that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're checking out crimes in </v>

3236
02:19:16.841 --> 02:19:17.674
<v Speaker 3>particular that a human experience like </v>
<v Speaker 3>memory is like one of the worst pieces </v>

3237
02:19:21.941 --> 02:19:22.774
<v Speaker 3>of evidence that you could ever have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neil degrasse tyson was talking about </v>

3238
02:19:25.031 --> 02:19:25.864
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was tHat it's like the difference </v>

3239
02:19:27.921 --> 02:19:28.340
<v Speaker 3>between</v>

3240
02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:30.110
<v Speaker 1>an actual reality and how people </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember it.</v>

3241
02:19:30.111 --> 02:19:30.944
<v Speaker 1>It's sometimes significantly different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain just puts together a </v>

3242
02:19:33.951 --> 02:19:37.110
<v Speaker 1>narrative and sticks with it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3243
02:19:37.260 --> 02:19:38.900
<v Speaker 1>if something weird happened to crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

3244
02:19:38.901 --> 02:19:39.734
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're all jacked up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>adrenaline and your brain just create </v>

3245
02:19:42.691 --> 02:19:45.710
<v Speaker 1>some goofy ass scenario and then that </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes your memory.</v>

3246
02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:48.260
<v Speaker 1>That becomes your realIty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How weird,</v>

3247
02:19:48.261 --> 02:19:50.300
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're so malleable.</v>

3248
02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3249
02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:53.493
<v Speaker 1>Well hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever think of like manchurian </v>

3250
02:19:54.861 --> 02:19:55.694
<v Speaker 1>candidate type shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that they could trick you by </v>

3251
02:19:58.701 --> 02:19:59.534
<v Speaker 1>putting a word in your head and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone says that work you fucking snap </v>

3252
02:20:02.810 --> 02:20:05.210
<v Speaker 1>and you turn it into an assassin was </v>
<v Speaker 1>pavlovian</v>

3253
02:20:05.700 --> 02:20:07.490
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be connected to tableau.</v>

3254
02:20:07.570 --> 02:20:12.160
<v Speaker 3>Vion because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when my wife's alarm goes off on</v>

3255
02:20:12.161 --> 02:20:14.980
<v Speaker 3>her phone at 5:45,</v>
<v Speaker 3>priscilla wakes up,</v>

3256
02:20:15.790 --> 02:20:16.623
<v Speaker 3>facility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets up and starts wagging her tail and </v>

3257
02:20:17.681 --> 02:20:19.380
<v Speaker 3>stands by the fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's ready to eat.</v>

3258
02:20:19.420 --> 02:20:21.370

3260
02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:25.330
<v Speaker 3>And it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be similar,</v>

3261
02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:28.420
<v Speaker 3>but there are things you could say to </v>
<v Speaker 3>put me into a mood.</v>

3262
02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:30.260

<v Speaker 3>he's not going to start out long white </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys and his son's a white guy and it's.</v>

3300
02:22:12.231 --> 02:22:14.780
<v Speaker 3>And it's going to be tax breaks for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to make money,</v>

3301
02:22:16.130 --> 02:22:18.170
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like this.</v>

3304
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:22.250

<v Speaker 3>this will sound bad,</v>

3305
02:22:22.251 --> 02:22:23.084
<v Speaker 3>but I'm in my backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing a press tour this morning in </v>

3306
02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:27.300
<v Speaker 3>every market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:34.260
<v Speaker 3>the guys that are building my house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all mexican and I saw them come to</v>

3309
02:22:34.261 --> 02:22:35.730
<v Speaker 3>work and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3310
02:22:35.731 --> 02:22:40.290
<v Speaker 3>that sucks that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that what he said about mexicans,</v>

3311
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:42.900
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>America stood behind a tad bit.</v>

3312
02:22:43.610 --> 02:22:44.443
<v Speaker 3>And because these guys aren't rapists </v>
<v Speaker 3>and murderers were the coolest guys in </v>

3313
02:22:46.081 --> 02:22:46.914
<v Speaker 3>the world that are fucking killing </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves so that I can have a better </v>

3314
02:22:48.721 --> 02:22:52.390
<v Speaker 3>life and they're doing it at wages that </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite honestly are affordable,</v>

3315
02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:56.010
<v Speaker 3>only [inaudible] their fear of losing </v>
<v Speaker 3>their stability in this country.</v>

3316
02:22:56.130 --> 02:23:00.090
<v Speaker 3>So they don't argue with standards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of how immigrant labor works</v>

3317
02:23:00.091 --> 02:23:03.220
<v Speaker 3>a tad bit is they don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have an uh,</v>

3318
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:04.260
<v Speaker 3>an uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a way out.</v>

3319
02:23:04.740 --> 02:23:08.700
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that really fucking sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I saw it for the first time that way</v>

3320
02:23:09.860 --> 02:23:11.550
<v Speaker 3>and I was Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are all really cool dudes.</v>

3321
02:23:11.551 --> 02:23:12.384
<v Speaker 3>And it stinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That last night they saw that and they </v>

3322
02:23:13.411 --> 02:23:14.250
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we lost.</v>

3323
02:23:14.570 --> 02:23:16.320
<v Speaker 3>And maybe they didn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking know.</v>

3324
02:23:16.430 --> 02:23:17.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them did.</v>

3325
02:23:17.700 --> 02:23:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I know some mexican folks that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty upset.</v>

3326
02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.500
<v Speaker 3>And here I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3327
02:23:21.501 --> 02:23:22.334
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

3328
02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:23.960
<v Speaker 3>on the winning team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless,</v>

3329
02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:26.720
<v Speaker 3>like again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to win.</v>

3330
02:23:27.020 --> 02:23:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Whoever wins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If hillary wins,</v>

3331
02:23:28.731 --> 02:23:30.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want everyone for good things.</v>

3332
02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:32.540
<v Speaker 3>I win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Donald Trump wins,</v>

3333
02:23:32.990 --> 02:23:36.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm in that camp too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I when their [inaudible] you know,</v>

3334
02:23:36.261 --> 02:23:37.790
<v Speaker 3>so you're a winner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>burke,</v>

3335
02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:40.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm the luckiest guy in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

3336
02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:45.840
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] the whole mexican thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange because it's real.</v>

3337
02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:49.813
<v Speaker 1>This is why it's really racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're dealing with an </v>

3338
02:23:52.341 --> 02:23:53.174
<v Speaker 1>exorbitant percentage difference in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of people that are of mexican </v>

3339
02:23:57.201 --> 02:23:58.034
<v Speaker 1>descent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the commit crimes versus the amount of </v>

3340
02:23:59.331 --> 02:24:02.660
<v Speaker 1>people that are american born that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't commit crimes.</v>

3341
02:24:02.661 --> 02:24:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both agree on that.</v>

3342
02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:06.590
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not much difference at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

3343
02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:10.280
<v Speaker 1>but when someone comes here from another</v>
<v Speaker 1>country and commits a crime,</v>

3344
02:24:10.310 --> 02:24:14.170
<v Speaker 1>we look at it far worse than if someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is born,</v>

3345
02:24:14.190 --> 02:24:16.580
<v Speaker 1>this patch of soil commits a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3346
02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:17.533
<v Speaker 1>we decide that that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We decided that it's a bigger deal when </v>

3347
02:24:20.781 --> 02:24:24.620
<v Speaker 1>someone from over there comes over here </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegally and commits a crime,</v>

3348
02:24:24.621 --> 02:24:27.710
<v Speaker 1>even if it's like the same percentage as</v>
<v Speaker 1>just people,</v>

3349
02:24:27.890 --> 02:24:29.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get like 20 percent of the people</v>

3350
02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:30.770
<v Speaker 1>commit crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter,</v>

3351
02:24:30.810 --> 02:24:32.570
<v Speaker 1>no matter what are immigrant or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3352
02:24:32.571 --> 02:24:33.404
<v Speaker 1>you'll look at the immigrant ones as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being more significant because they </v>

3353
02:24:36.611 --> 02:24:39.590
<v Speaker 1>didn't even fuck it's supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and they're doing those crimes.</v>

3354
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:42.000
<v Speaker 3>It's sliding doors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if that person that just never come</v>

3355
02:24:42.001 --> 02:24:42.900
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all</v>

3356
02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:44.073
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's probably a percentage of the </v>

3357
02:24:46.361 --> 02:24:47.194
<v Speaker 1>population no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it also depends upon what does </v>

3358
02:24:50.171 --> 02:24:53.410
<v Speaker 1>that person experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if they're coming from the Congo or</v>

3359
02:24:53.411 --> 02:24:57.640
<v Speaker 1>some crazy fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember my friend went to high school</v>

3360
02:24:57.641 --> 02:25:01.690
<v Speaker 1>with some kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say the kid was from Jamaica.</v>

3361
02:25:01.770 --> 02:25:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he's from Jamaica and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3362
02:25:04.270 --> 02:25:08.890
<v Speaker 1>apparently he was a super violent kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is first time the United States and</v>

3363
02:25:08.891 --> 02:25:10.480
<v Speaker 1>he got with a fight and a fight with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some boy.</v>

3364
02:25:10.481 --> 02:25:11.314
<v Speaker 1>He went out to his car and he got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking giant kitchen knife and he </v>

3365
02:25:14.621 --> 02:25:15.454
<v Speaker 1>stabbed that kid right through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stomach in front of everybody and </v>

3366
02:25:18.670 --> 02:25:20.380
<v Speaker 1>everybody for any cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some other kid,</v>

3367
02:25:20.381 --> 02:25:23.050
<v Speaker 1>the other kid ran away and he's chasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>him with a knife trying to cut.</v>

3368
02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3369
02:25:24.551 --> 02:25:26.410
<v Speaker 1>and this is his first days in America.</v>

3370
02:25:26.410 --> 02:25:29.890
<v Speaker 1>They just lead them into this school and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid went into his fucking trunk and</v>

3371
02:25:29.891 --> 02:25:33.670
<v Speaker 1>pulled out a knife and I guess that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how he rocked it in Jamaica and that was</v>

3372
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:38.320
<v Speaker 1>what he had been exposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're that kind of situation.</v>

3373
02:25:38.321 --> 02:25:42.490
<v Speaker 1>If you're letting someone into a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>legally or illegally,</v>

3374
02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:44.020
<v Speaker 1>illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he got in.</v>

3375
02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the details of the storage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know the story,</v>

3376
02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:49.360
<v Speaker 1>but then people are scared because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

3377
02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:51.280
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person's been living in the Congo.</v>

3378
02:25:51.281 --> 02:25:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Say or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the xenophobia?</v>

3379
02:25:53.561 --> 02:25:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Then based on the fact that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribe to the same cultural rules,</v>

3380
02:25:57.491 --> 02:25:58.324
<v Speaker 1>we subscribe to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say that xenophobic or you can </v>

3381
02:26:02.291 --> 02:26:03.124
<v Speaker 1>say that you're very conservative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalistic and you could look at it </v>

3382
02:26:05.471 --> 02:26:09.460
<v Speaker 1>as a proud traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a real touch and go issue,</v>

3383
02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:10.473
<v Speaker 1>especially right now because what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in Germany and a lot of parts </v>

3384
02:26:13.991 --> 02:26:14.824
<v Speaker 1>of europe where these syrian refugees </v>
<v Speaker 1>are coming in and they've opened their </v>

3385
02:26:17.801 --> 02:26:21.070
<v Speaker 1>arms to them in Germany and it's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really out of control.</v>

3386
02:26:21.310 --> 02:26:22.143
<v Speaker 1>Like germany's had some horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>assaults and rapes and groups of men </v>

3387
02:26:25.841 --> 02:26:29.440
<v Speaker 1>that are actively targeting white blonde</v>
<v Speaker 1>women for rape.</v>

3388
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:30.423
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the truth and I won't say any </v>

3389
02:26:31.601 --> 02:26:33.970
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are places in this world where</v>

3390
02:26:33.971 --> 02:26:38.470
<v Speaker 1>the social norm of rape is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rape is a social norm.</v>

3391
02:26:38.890 --> 02:26:39.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women just get raped and they believe </v>

3392
02:26:41.410 --> 02:26:42.243
<v Speaker 1>that's just what happens because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were women and there's a lot of those </v>

3393
02:26:44.861 --> 02:26:46.660
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of those places.</v>

3394
02:26:46.810 --> 02:26:48.610
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those people too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the.</v>

3395
02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:49.833
<v Speaker 1>The sheer numbers of humans that </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribed to that kind of thinking </v>

3396
02:26:52.211 --> 02:26:53.044
<v Speaker 1>still in 2016 would shock you if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could just look at it as numbers on a </v>

3397
02:26:56.081 --> 02:26:56.914
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just looked at the worldwide </v>

3398
02:26:58.121 --> 02:27:00.340
<v Speaker 1>population and how many people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept something like that,</v>

3399
02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:01.660
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

3400
02:27:02.030 --> 02:27:02.863
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just getting rid of beating a </v>

3401
02:27:04.091 --> 02:27:04.924
<v Speaker 1>child right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adrian peterson did it and everyone </v>

3402
02:27:07.001 --> 02:27:09.160
<v Speaker 1>fucking attacked him and I'm sure he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3403
02:27:09.161 --> 02:27:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I just hit him with a switch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty brutal,</v>

3404
02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:12.333
<v Speaker 1>but now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are places where in this </v>

3405
02:27:13.961 --> 02:27:15.460
<v Speaker 1>country where you could totally hit a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

3406
02:27:15.461 --> 02:27:16.294
<v Speaker 1>no one would say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there are places in the world </v>

3407
02:27:17.651 --> 02:27:19.660
<v Speaker 1>where you can hit someone and no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say anything.</v>

3408
02:27:19.661 --> 02:27:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where it's enough.</v>

3409
02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:24.400
<v Speaker 1>That's part of like if you tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissect xenophobia,</v>

3410
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.863
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's that is that you go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social norm is different than my social </v>

3411
02:27:29.501 --> 02:27:31.420
<v Speaker 1>norm and I don't want people.</v>

3412
02:27:32.180 --> 02:27:33.013
<v Speaker 1>I mean is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like I'm defending </v>

3413
02:27:34.071 --> 02:27:35.360
<v Speaker 1>xenophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3414
02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:38.210
<v Speaker 1>I have a theory that I've said several </v>
<v Speaker 1>times in the podcast.</v>

3415
02:27:38.211 --> 02:27:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me if you've heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the cradle of civilization.</v>

3416
02:27:41.330 --> 02:27:43.520
<v Speaker 1>If you go to the middle east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where civilization began.</v>

3417
02:27:43.521 --> 02:27:46.640
<v Speaker 1>It's the oldest written language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oldest form of mathematics,</v>

3418
02:27:46.740 --> 02:27:47.573
<v Speaker 1>like sumir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's responsible for all these </v>

3419
02:27:49.611 --> 02:27:51.730
<v Speaker 1>different first first agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

3420
02:27:51.731 --> 02:27:52.564
<v Speaker 1>they were like a really depending upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think that human human </v>

3421
02:27:55.521 --> 02:27:58.010
<v Speaker 1>civilization was established,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was reestablished,</v>

3422
02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:01.750
<v Speaker 1>but those people back then that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>

3423
02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:06.830
<v Speaker 1>a really complicated civilization and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like 6,000</v>

3424
02:28:06.831 --> 02:28:07.664
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

3425
02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:11.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean</v>

3426
02:28:13.100 --> 02:28:15.480
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we try to think about like how long</v>

3427
02:28:15.481 --> 02:28:16.314
<v Speaker 1>human beings have been on this planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how long we been living our lives </v>

3428
02:28:20.371 --> 02:28:23.210
<v Speaker 1>and what we've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a really,</v>

3429
02:28:23.211 --> 02:28:27.380
<v Speaker 1>really recent thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very do think about this.</v>

3430
02:28:27.381 --> 02:28:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Slavery was just 200 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3431
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:31.850
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>65</v>

3432
02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:37.040
<v Speaker 3>black people just got rights as humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the sixties that,</v>

3433
02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:41.250
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

3434
02:28:41.260 --> 02:28:42.093
<v Speaker 3>I like one of the things I watched roots</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things that blew me away </v>

3435
02:28:45.031 --> 02:28:46.260
<v Speaker 3>was that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that,</v>

3436
02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:48.053
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's it called when black people talk </v>

3437
02:28:49.821 --> 02:28:51.800
<v Speaker 3>like black people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a robotics.</v>

3438
02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:54.090
<v Speaker 3>I remember when a bonox came out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

3439
02:28:54.270 --> 02:28:56.370
<v Speaker 3>conservatives were fucking up and arms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3440
02:28:56.371 --> 02:28:58.410
<v Speaker 3>learn the language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speak the way we speak.</v>

3441
02:28:58.830 --> 02:29:00.300
<v Speaker 3>And then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey motherfucker,</v>

3442
02:29:00.301 --> 02:29:01.134
<v Speaker 3>when we brought them here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't teach him how to speak at all </v>

3443
02:29:03.020 --> 02:29:05.270
<v Speaker 3>when when they were brought as slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was better.</v>

3444
02:29:05.271 --> 02:29:05.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3445
02:29:05.310 --> 02:29:06.143
<v Speaker 1>they didn't speak english.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what the problem with that </v>

3446
02:29:07.980 --> 02:29:10.860
<v Speaker 1>kind of thinking is on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem kind of thing is.</v>

3447
02:29:10.861 --> 02:29:12.420
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't bring any slaves over here.</v>

3448
02:29:12.421 --> 02:29:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't bring anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't slaves.</v>

3449
02:29:14.610 --> 02:29:17.640
<v Speaker 1>So both things are fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their ancestors were.</v>

3450
02:29:17.641 --> 02:29:21.480
<v Speaker 1>So we're acknowledging there's a ripple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a giant ripple effect from being</v>

3451
02:29:21.481 --> 02:29:25.710
<v Speaker 1>brought over here as slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me says that like what we should</v>

3452
02:29:25.711 --> 02:29:26.544
<v Speaker 1>have done and what we probably still </v>
<v Speaker 1>should do is figure out a way and not </v>

3453
02:29:30.091 --> 02:29:30.924
<v Speaker 1>just that ripple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the poor immigration ripple that's </v>

3454
02:29:32.730 --> 02:29:34.440
<v Speaker 1>in white neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>russian neighborhoods.</v>

3455
02:29:34.830 --> 02:29:35.663
<v Speaker 1>You got to figure out a way to like get </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods that are like really </v>

3456
02:29:38.671 --> 02:29:40.230
<v Speaker 1>fucking poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are traps,</v>

3457
02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:42.930
<v Speaker 1>especially if their crime ridden </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods that are really poor.</v>

3458
02:29:43.500 --> 02:29:44.333
<v Speaker 1>We've got to clean those up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have cuts that we just let scab up and </v>

3459
02:29:47.491 --> 02:29:52.491
<v Speaker 1>fester and we don't treat it and dress </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wound like that's kind of dangerous.</v>

3460
02:29:52.590 --> 02:29:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Crime ridden neighborhoods are there </v>
<v Speaker 1>like cultural wounds and we don't.</v>

3461
02:29:56.520 --> 02:29:58.380
<v Speaker 1>We don't do shit about him because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not us.</v>

3462
02:29:58.381 --> 02:29:59.214
<v Speaker 1>It's us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's can't fucking pay attention to </v>

3463
02:30:00.121 --> 02:30:02.460
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if presidents did that,</v>

3464
02:30:02.820 --> 02:30:03.653
<v Speaker 1>instead of fucking flying over to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan and dealing with some </v>

3465
02:30:05.671 --> 02:30:06.504
<v Speaker 1>nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has almost nothing to do with you </v>

3466
02:30:07.411 --> 02:30:08.244
<v Speaker 1>and me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could make an argument that we </v>

3467
02:30:10.201 --> 02:30:12.820
<v Speaker 1>can intervene in Mexico right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

3468
02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:14.640
<v Speaker 1>If you really wanted to protect peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>and love.</v>

3469
02:30:14.670 --> 02:30:15.503
<v Speaker 1>I mean every time you go to juarez and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a bunch of dudes heads cut off </v>

3470
02:30:18.300 --> 02:30:21.300
<v Speaker 1>and they're hanging them from fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>overpass with some sign,</v>

3471
02:30:21.301 --> 02:30:24.210
<v Speaker 1>they put some cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chop them up in garbage bags.</v>

3472
02:30:25.070 --> 02:30:26.280
<v Speaker 1>You know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3473
02:30:26.310 --> 02:30:27.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a good argument that you.</v>

3474
02:30:28.350 --> 02:30:29.760
<v Speaker 1>All the drugs are coming from these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people too.</v>

3475
02:30:29.761 --> 02:30:31.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to the war with them.</v>

3476
02:30:31.261 --> 02:30:33.550
<v Speaker 1>They never even bring that up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that up.</v>

3477
02:30:34.830 --> 02:30:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>

3478
02:30:37.320 --> 02:30:38.220
<v Speaker 1>God dang it.</v>

3479
02:30:38.690 --> 02:30:39.523
<v Speaker 3>You know what fucking sent me through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the roof and this election is the media </v>

3480
02:30:41.901 --> 02:30:42.734
<v Speaker 3>coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one of the things that I was I was </v>

3481
02:30:45.530 --> 02:30:46.363
<v Speaker 3>watching like I was laying in bed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday and I was just kind of </v>

3482
02:30:49.101 --> 02:30:51.680
<v Speaker 3>listening to the thing and they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were saying statements like,</v>

3483
02:30:51.980 --> 02:30:53.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida is definitely going to vote.</v>

3484
02:30:54.140 --> 02:30:54.973
<v Speaker 3>A torta is definitely going to vote </v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic because of the hispanic </v>

3485
02:30:59.691 --> 02:31:01.370
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How rude.</v>

3486
02:31:01.460 --> 02:31:02.390
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I thought,</v>

3487
02:31:02.391 --> 02:31:07.391
<v Speaker 3>what an ignorant statement to assume </v>
<v Speaker 3>cubans and mexicans are identical,</v>

3488
02:31:08.470 --> 02:31:09.303
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't say I'm cubans are that he </v>

3489
02:31:11.491 --> 02:31:14.990
<v Speaker 3>said mexicans and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from my experience,</v>

3490
02:31:14.991 --> 02:31:15.824
<v Speaker 3>and this is limited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did grow up in Florida and I do </v>

3491
02:31:17.181 --> 02:31:20.700
<v Speaker 3>live in la and that's where these the </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences.</v>

3492
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:23.730
<v Speaker 4>Cubans will speak spanish in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

3493
02:31:24.210 --> 02:31:25.920
<v Speaker 4>Mexicans don't speak spanish in front of</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

3494
02:31:26.490 --> 02:31:28.120
<v Speaker 4>When you hang out with like two </v>
<v Speaker 4>mexicans,</v>

3495
02:31:28.121 --> 02:31:31.950
<v Speaker 4>you're standing in like say you're at </v>
<v Speaker 4>like in line or something.</v>

3496
02:31:32.130 --> 02:31:32.963
<v Speaker 4>Mexican is usually just try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>assimilate so they don't raise the red </v>

3497
02:31:35.101 --> 02:31:35.934
<v Speaker 4>flag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all based on the fact that as a </v>

3498
02:31:36.841 --> 02:31:38.250
<v Speaker 4>cuban,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you come over to this country,</v>

3499
02:31:38.340 --> 02:31:39.173
<v Speaker 4>if you step foot on the land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're automatically a citizen as a </v>

3500
02:31:41.101 --> 02:31:42.480
<v Speaker 4>mexican.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want you here.</v>

3501
02:31:42.510 --> 02:31:44.040
<v Speaker 4>They want to send you back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the case still?</v>

3502
02:31:44.041 --> 02:31:46.590
<v Speaker 4>So if you're a cuban refugee and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>land in America,</v>

3503
02:31:46.690 --> 02:31:47.780
<v Speaker 4>the second you step foot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3504
02:31:47.781 --> 02:31:49.240
<v Speaker 4>you're naturalized citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3505
02:31:49.250 --> 02:31:50.083
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is the bone of contention </v>

3506
02:31:51.421 --> 02:31:53.400
<v Speaker 4>between cubans and mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that.</v>

3507
02:31:53.490 --> 02:31:54.323
<v Speaker 4>And that's why cubans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you go to miami to cuban guys will </v>

3508
02:31:56.431 --> 02:31:57.264
<v Speaker 4>speak spanish right in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in front of your face and you're </v>

3509
02:31:58.651 --> 02:31:59.471
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3510
02:31:59.471 --> 02:32:00.640
<v Speaker 4>you guys talking about me or.</v>

3511
02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:03.780
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cuba also,</v>

3512
02:32:03.810 --> 02:32:06.000
<v Speaker 4>cubans rather,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they tend to be more conservative.</v>

3513
02:32:06.050 --> 02:32:07.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Much more conservative vote.</v>

3514
02:32:07.710 --> 02:32:11.010
<v Speaker 4>Very republican,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very conservative.</v>

3515
02:32:11.011 --> 02:32:12.780
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of having said that,</v>

3516
02:32:12.781 --> 02:32:15.390
<v Speaker 4>a lot of miami did vote democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

3517
02:32:15.391 --> 02:32:17.940
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's predominantly the </v>
<v Speaker 4>jewish population,</v>

3518
02:32:17.941 --> 02:32:18.774
<v Speaker 4>the snowbirds that came down because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>started in like broward county and what </v>

3519
02:32:21.500 --> 02:32:22.333
<v Speaker 4>went down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3520
02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:23.910
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I grew up in Florida.</v>

3521
02:32:23.940 --> 02:32:24.920
<v Speaker 4>Cubans were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eh,</v>

3522
02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:27.660
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no limit to just miami.</v>

3523
02:32:27.750 --> 02:32:29.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now all my best friends are cuban.</v>

3524
02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:33.540
<v Speaker 4>Did Cuba has an interesting kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>flair to it,</v>

3525
02:32:33.541 --> 02:32:34.374
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's got a different thing than </v>

3526
02:32:37.081 --> 02:32:40.720
<v Speaker 4>say Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you think like their,</v>

3527
02:32:40.750 --> 02:32:42.390
<v Speaker 4>their language has a little bit more of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

3528
02:32:42.391 --> 02:32:46.470
<v Speaker 4>like a song type of thing to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took a little more flow to it,</v>

3529
02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:49.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all dancy and movie and shit and</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pikey travelers.</v>

3567

<v Speaker 1>so I'll be respectful so they.</v>

3568
02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:31.033
<v Speaker 1>The is move in.</v>

3571
02:34:37.871 --> 02:34:39.700
<v Speaker 1>They can't get them out of there because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have,</v>

3572
02:34:39.730 --> 02:34:43.120
<v Speaker 1>because of their culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their culture is that they travel around</v>

3573
02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:44.253
<v Speaker 1>and so the european government or the uk</v>
<v Speaker 1>government has established there's </v>

3574
02:34:47.821 --> 02:34:51.370
<v Speaker 1>certain like things that they're allowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do and one of them is they're allowed</v>

3575
02:34:51.371 --> 02:34:52.204
<v Speaker 1>to just like live in a place where </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody lives there so arbitrary within </v>

3576
02:34:57.911 --> 02:34:58.744
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean should they have like boundaries </v>

3577
02:35:00.101 --> 02:35:02.980
<v Speaker 1>where you're not supposed to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but next to this guy's fucking house,</v>

3578
02:35:02.990 --> 02:35:04.970
<v Speaker 3>they were allowed to lick and lose my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

3579
02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:10.170
<v Speaker 1>This guy's like this really wealthy guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that bought this insane house out in the</v>

3580
02:35:10.171 --> 02:35:11.004
<v Speaker 1>london countryside and travelers moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in right next door and they party all </v>

3581
02:35:15.331 --> 02:35:17.130
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have bonfires and shit.</v>

3582
02:35:17.180 --> 02:35:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking bonfire.</v>

3583
02:35:18.740 --> 02:35:20.780
<v Speaker 1>They beat guys asses if they talk shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>to him,</v>

3584
02:35:22.270 --> 02:35:23.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this isn't a good place to have a </v>

3585
02:35:24.330 --> 02:35:26.220
<v Speaker 1>fire at 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>

3586
02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:29.070
<v Speaker 1>They step up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punch that dude in the face and laugh,</v>

3587
02:35:29.220 --> 02:35:30.690
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can do shit.</v>

3588
02:35:31.620 --> 02:35:32.453
<v Speaker 1>They live at different world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live in a totally different life </v>

3589
02:35:35.880 --> 02:35:37.710
<v Speaker 1>than you or I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are people.</v>

3590
02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:39.690
<v Speaker 1>People were just so malleable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3591
02:35:40.740 --> 02:35:41.573
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was getting at before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why one of the things that </v>

3592
02:35:43.471 --> 02:35:44.304
<v Speaker 1>concerns me about trump is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president becomes sort of the way the </v>

3593
02:35:49.141 --> 02:35:53.290
<v Speaker 1>people that follow him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he leads the way they,</v>

3594
02:35:53.370 --> 02:35:54.203
<v Speaker 1>they sort of fall in and least in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>way he represents how we feel about </v>

3595
02:35:57.031 --> 02:35:57.864
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we feel about ourselves like a </v>

3596
02:35:59.671 --> 02:36:00.570
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3597
02:36:01.020 --> 02:36:03.090
<v Speaker 1>the wall just got 10 feet higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3598
02:36:03.091 --> 02:36:03.924
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff that could encourage </v>
<v Speaker 1>some ridiculous douche baggery from </v>

3599
02:36:08.131 --> 02:36:10.420
<v Speaker 1>people that might otherwise be persuaded</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

3600
02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:14.370
<v Speaker 1>to relax and settle in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people might go the other way now.</v>

3601
02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:15.913
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People might get more aggressive and </v>

3602
02:36:17.311 --> 02:36:19.440
<v Speaker 1>more shitty now that trump is in office?</v>

3603
02:36:19.650 --> 02:36:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got.</v>

3604
02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:21.653
<v Speaker 3>I got to be really honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trumping elected gave me a lot of </v>

3605
02:36:24.571 --> 02:36:26.210
<v Speaker 3>confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3606
02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:29.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know because I just was like,</v>

3607
02:36:29.430 --> 02:36:32.280
<v Speaker 3>I just never thought that would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I never thought that it happened.</v>

3608
02:36:32.281 --> 02:36:33.091
<v Speaker 3>Then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3609
02:36:33.091 --> 02:36:35.130
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy shit happens all the time.</v>

3610
02:36:35.610 --> 02:36:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Like crazy shit happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the time.</v>

3611
02:36:38.530 --> 02:36:38.880
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3612
02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:40.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying I want to be a movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>star,</v>

3613
02:36:40.051 --> 02:36:41.970
<v Speaker 3>but like I could be a movie star </v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow.</v>

3614
02:36:42.190 --> 02:36:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Like someone could go a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll take a couple of weeks,</v>

3615
02:36:44.770 --> 02:36:45.840
<v Speaker 3>maybe take seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3616
02:36:46.090 --> 02:36:46.923
<v Speaker 3>but like that could happen tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can have my own sitcom if I wanted it </v>

3617
02:36:49.050 --> 02:36:52.020
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow because that could happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>because trump became president and I got</v>

3618
02:36:52.030 --> 02:36:53.970
<v Speaker 3>real bounce in my step.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3619
02:36:54.250 --> 02:36:55.590
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything's possible.</v>

3620
02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:56.593
<v Speaker 3>Anything's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really thought there was no fucking </v>

3621
02:37:00.391 --> 02:37:05.350
<v Speaker 3>way in hell that would ever happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I almost thought last night was a</v>

3622
02:37:05.351 --> 02:37:06.184
<v Speaker 3>wash and I don't know why we're even </v>
<v Speaker 3>referencing the election and then all </v>

3623
02:37:09.421 --> 02:37:13.710
<v Speaker 3>the sudden bill burrs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they just took fucking Ohio.</v>

3624
02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:15.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

3625
02:37:15.140 --> 02:37:15.980
<v Speaker 3>like a war.</v>

3626
02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you took Pennsylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took Florida.</v>

3627
02:37:19.370 --> 02:37:20.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are still undecided in New </v>

3628
02:37:22.430 --> 02:37:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Hampshire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took Idaho.</v>

3629
02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:28.250
<v Speaker 1>What they saying that it was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to Alaska and when he got Alaska is</v>

3630
02:37:28.251 --> 02:37:30.990
<v Speaker 1>when someone said he just one boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

3631
02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:31.843
<v Speaker 1>he just got Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he won and that's the state that nobody </v>

3632
02:37:33.801 --> 02:37:35.510
<v Speaker 1>campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's interesting.</v>

3633
02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:37.590
<v Speaker 1>No one campaigns in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't.</v>

3634
02:37:37.670 --> 02:37:38.503
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think for the most part they </v>

3635
02:37:39.891 --> 02:37:43.090
<v Speaker 1>ignore it because that's the last date </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you get the results in last.</v>

3636
02:37:43.091 --> 02:37:43.924
<v Speaker 1>It's way the fuck over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know if you're looking at a map or </v>

3637
02:37:45.891 --> 02:37:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Alaska is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3638
02:37:47.740 --> 02:37:49.910
<v Speaker 1>you gotta go all the way up and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to go left.</v>

3639
02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:52.610
<v Speaker 1>It's all the way the fuck up by Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way up there,</v>

3640
02:37:52.611 --> 02:37:54.080
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you gone hunting up there?</v>

3641
02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

3642
02:37:56.210 --> 02:37:58.130
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except the bugs.</v>

3643
02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:01.490
<v Speaker 1>The bugs are brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mosquitoes are off the chain,</v>

3644
02:38:01.540 --> 02:38:02.373
<v Speaker 1>but nothing like in your life you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even breathe because they go in your </v>

3645
02:38:05.061 --> 02:38:05.571
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3646
02:38:05.571 --> 02:38:07.370
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went fishing.</v>

3647
02:38:07.430 --> 02:38:08.263
<v Speaker 1>We went salmon fishing uP there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did some gigs and we got out of the </v>

3648
02:38:12.081 --> 02:38:14.540
<v Speaker 1>car to get to the boat and when we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the car,</v>

3649
02:38:14.541 --> 02:38:15.374
<v Speaker 1>literally opening the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a cloud of mosquitoes that </v>

3650
02:38:17.571 --> 02:38:18.404
<v Speaker 1>found us instantly in swarmed us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>WE panicked like little girls jumped </v>

3651
02:38:21.201 --> 02:38:22.034
<v Speaker 1>back in the car and shut the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started to change our shoes while </v>

3652
02:38:24.501 --> 02:38:27.260
<v Speaker 1>we're in the car and there was 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes in the car with us.</v>

3653
02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:28.630

<v Speaker 1>Same.</v>

3654
02:38:28.631 --> 02:38:29.464
<v Speaker 1>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only have like a couple months to </v>

<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

3662
02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:51.260
<v Speaker 1>They're more alive because they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with nature.</v>

3663
02:38:51.710 --> 02:38:54.500
<v Speaker 1>They're more alive because they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with grizzly bears.</v>

<v Speaker 4>There's nothing funny about it.</v>

3720
02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:20.040
<v Speaker 4>You need to have a serious conversation </v>
<v Speaker 4>with your children about racism and rape</v>

3721
02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:21.750

<v Speaker 4>It was laughing about the child rapist </v>

3726
02:41:30.130 --> 02:41:30.963
<v Speaker 4>being able to pass a polygraph.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember when we were wIth norm </v>

3727
02:41:32.910 --> 02:41:33.743
<v Speaker 4>in the back of the comedy store and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was talking about bill clinton's </v>

3728
02:41:35.761 --> 02:41:37.620
<v Speaker 4>charges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked those up.</v>

3729
02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:39.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are fucking legit.</v>

3730
02:41:39.660 --> 02:41:40.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of stuff with.</v>

3731
02:41:40.970 --> 02:41:42.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows how much of it is real.</v>

3732
02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:46.560
<v Speaker 4>They allegedly did a lot of shit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>allegedly,</v>

3733
02:41:47.370 --> 02:41:49.680
<v Speaker 4>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>

3734
02:41:49.890 --> 02:41:52.140
<v Speaker 4>but not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None of it's good.</v>

3735
02:41:52.260 --> 02:41:53.093
<v Speaker 4>It's all gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not like if Donald Trump didn't </v>

3736
02:41:56.791 --> 02:41:58.230
<v Speaker 4>get in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we will hear out an angel,</v>

3737
02:41:59.070 --> 02:41:59.903
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone of that age set that's a weird </v>

3738
02:42:02.371 --> 02:42:03.204
<v Speaker 4>age bracket because like I'm the age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the generation where when I got to </v>

3739
02:42:07.951 --> 02:42:10.350
<v Speaker 4>college they came up with the phrase no </v>
<v Speaker 4>means no.</v>

3740
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:13.260
<v Speaker 4>Just they explained date rape at my age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 44.</v>

3741
02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:14.513
<v Speaker 4>So you think anyone over 40 for any </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman over 44 probably dealt with date </v>

3742
02:42:18.331 --> 02:42:19.810
<v Speaker 4>rape and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3743
02:42:19.870 --> 02:42:23.550
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of times there was a like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>stigma do not talk about it,</v>

3744
02:42:24.300 --> 02:42:26.340
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>

3745
02:42:26.341 --> 02:42:26.591
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3746
02:42:26.591 --> 02:42:27.424
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm just saying I'm the very </v>

3747
02:42:27.721 --> 02:42:28.554
<v Speaker 4>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a whole generation of girls my </v>

3748
02:42:29.971 --> 02:42:32.490
<v Speaker 4>age and just younger that have dealt </v>
<v Speaker 4>with it in the same way,</v>

3749
02:42:32.610 --> 02:42:33.443
<v Speaker 4>but now it's being brought to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>forefront and people are coming forward </v>

3750
02:42:35.671 --> 02:42:36.504
<v Speaker 4>and saying stuff.</v>

3751
02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:40.300
<v Speaker 4>Donald trump is what 70 did he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he,</v>

3752
02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:43.020
<v Speaker 4>I think he could hit women when he was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>kid probably.</v>

3753
02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:45.600
<v Speaker 4>They probably hit women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't think anything of it.</v>

3754
02:42:45.690 --> 02:42:46.523
<v Speaker 4>His dad throw his mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mom down a flight of stairs and no one </v>

3755
02:42:49.681 --> 02:42:52.260
<v Speaker 4>would say a fucking word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The stairs is rough.</v>

3756
02:42:52.410 --> 02:42:53.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you're on the couch.</v>

3757
02:42:53.950 --> 02:42:57.450
<v Speaker 4>just thrown on the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just get off me.</v>

3758
02:42:58.560 --> 02:42:59.393
<v Speaker 4>Get off me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you throw them somewhere nice and </v>

3759
02:43:02.491 --> 02:43:05.880
<v Speaker 4>soft and like you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You decelerate when you let go.</v>

3760
02:43:07.580 --> 02:43:12.160
<v Speaker 4>Just like a light judo demonstration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you dated a judo check dated</v>

3761
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:14.590
<v Speaker 1>ronda rousey and she just got mad at you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and start fucking hip,</v>

3762
02:43:14.591 --> 02:43:16.920
<v Speaker 1>toss it around the house right to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee table,</v>

3763
02:43:19.220 --> 02:43:22.030
<v Speaker 1>right to the glass coffee table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of those lethal weapon movies.</v>

3764
02:43:22.830 --> 02:43:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You do.</v>

3766
02:43:27.450 --> 02:43:30.250
<v Speaker 1>We're in the front yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sprinklers are going off the exact.</v>

3767
02:43:31.350 --> 02:43:35.680
<v Speaker 1>That lethal weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used the [inaudible] triangle choke.</v>

3768
02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:39.040

<v Speaker 1>Boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes for the arm bar for terrible </v>

3791
02:44:28.811 --> 02:44:30.160
<v Speaker 1>guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible guard,</v>

3792
02:44:30.310 --> 02:44:32.620

<v Speaker 1>a little bit of ground and pound.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He grabs it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secures it.</v>

3796
02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:39.273
<v Speaker 1>Let me see how he handles this here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary boosie should just bite his dick </v>

3797
02:44:43.810 --> 02:44:44.643
<v Speaker 1>are no rules here.</v>

3798
02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:48.310
<v Speaker 1>triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even secure it underneath the</v>

3799
02:44:48.311 --> 02:44:49.144
<v Speaker 1>knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be great if he was just kept the </v>

3800
02:44:50.321 --> 02:44:51.154
<v Speaker 1>crowd like nate diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes mistake number one and </v>

3801
02:44:52.951 --> 02:44:54.040
<v Speaker 1>triangles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3802
02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:57.350
<v Speaker 1>he Went with the calf over,</v>

3804
02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Touch the calf instead of go totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the knee.</v>

3805
02:45:01.210 --> 02:45:04.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just not awkward to know better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do a better trial.</v>

3806
02:45:04.110 --> 02:45:05.570
<v Speaker 1>he pushed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he choked him to sleep.</v>

3807
02:45:05.690 --> 02:45:07.900
<v Speaker 1>No tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened there?</v>

3810
02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's come back again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's what you want to do.</v>

3811
02:45:16.601 --> 02:45:17.434
<v Speaker 1>You want to get an angle and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to make sure that this insteps </v>

3812
02:45:19.870 --> 02:45:21.880
<v Speaker 1>underneath your neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way it's locked in place.</v>

3813
02:45:21.881 --> 02:45:23.160
<v Speaker 1>He can't get out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all sloppy shit.</v>

3818
02:45:28.750 --> 02:45:31.220
<v Speaker 1>He grabs a hold of his shin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he's supposed to do for real,</v>

3819
02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:32.153
<v Speaker 1>grab a hold of his right foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull his right foot down until it locks </v>

3820
02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:36.633
<v Speaker 1>underneath his left leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See how it's all fucking loose and </v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know how and let him get away </v>

3826
02:45:52.841 --> 02:45:53.674
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should have made them tighten that </v>

3827
02:45:54.131 --> 02:45:56.340
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it a.</v>

3828
02:45:56.560 --> 02:45:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Is it a possibility that it's just a </v>

<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

3833
02:46:03.340 --> 02:46:06.430
<v Speaker 1>When you do a triangle and you got </v>

3835
02:46:08.650 --> 02:46:10.850
<v Speaker 1>if you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any leverage.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You have no leverage,</v>

<v Speaker 1>about probably in the two twenties or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that or real athletic </v>

02:46:51.981 --> 02:46:52.814
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he waS all legs and this </v>

3851
02:46:53.991 --> 02:46:55.580
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you got in his guard,</v>

3852
02:46:55.581 --> 02:46:58.790
<v Speaker 1>it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's being constricted with giant bones</v>

3853
02:46:58.791 --> 02:47:03.791
<v Speaker 1>and huge muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just locked triangles in place.</v>

3854
02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:06.553
<v Speaker 1>So if you ever rolled with that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you needed to stay the fuck away from </v>

3855
02:47:09.231 --> 02:47:12.320
<v Speaker 1>his guard because he's just all legs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

3856
02:47:12.321 --> 02:47:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Like the amount of strength that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have in your legs.</v>

3857
02:47:14.421 --> 02:47:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Like people don't even recognize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't.</v>

3858
02:47:16.700 --> 02:47:17.533
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you have rolled with someone who </v>

3859
02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:20.583
<v Speaker 1>has developed their leg muscles and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dexterity to pull up jujitsu moves her </v>

3860
02:47:24.020 --> 02:47:24.853
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's certain guys that get to a </v>

3861
02:47:25.971 --> 02:47:27.620
<v Speaker 1>point where they get really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good at that.</v>

3862
02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:29.313
<v Speaker 1>WHen you rolled with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize how much you take your legS </v>

3863
02:47:31.401 --> 02:47:35.120
<v Speaker 1>and you run upstairs to think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take your legs.</v>

3864
02:47:35.121 --> 02:47:39.230
<v Speaker 1>You could have a a package in your hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could run up the stairs.</v>

3865
02:47:39.231 --> 02:47:43.010
<v Speaker 1>You're throwing your body like </v>
<v Speaker 1>plyometrics up these stairs.</v>

3866
02:47:43.310 --> 02:47:44.143
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that with your arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're so confident choking someone </v>

3867
02:47:46.761 --> 02:47:47.370
<v Speaker 1>with your arm.</v>

<v Speaker 3>hysterically and go,</v>

3902

<v Speaker 3>you really</v>

3903
02:49:08.130 --> 02:49:10.710
<v Speaker 2>should enter a calf contest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the biggest calves.</v>

3904
02:49:10.711 --> 02:49:13.380
<v Speaker 2>And taj gives on the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was bert.</v>

3905
02:49:13.530 --> 02:49:16.560
<v Speaker 2>He used to be 380 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why he's got big calves.</v>

3906
02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:17.791
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

02:49:17.791 --> 02:49:20.340
<v Speaker 2>this is uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good impression.</v>

3908
02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:25.350
<v Speaker 2>I felt tosh doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His inflection sounds like the real guy.</v>

3909
02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3910
02:49:27.090 --> 02:49:27.923
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have the flexibility and the </v>

3911
02:49:28.751 --> 02:49:31.140
<v Speaker 2>dexterity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do so much with your legs,</v>

3912
02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:32.353
<v Speaker 2>your legs control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like marcello garcia was one of the </v>

3913
02:49:33.991 --> 02:49:37.410
<v Speaker 2>greatest jujitsu players of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not have a big upper body,</v>

3914
02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:38.513
<v Speaker 2>but he had these giant ass fucking legs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would squeeze the shit out of </v>

3915
02:49:41.671 --> 02:49:45.540
<v Speaker 2>dudes and control them with his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a big part of his jujitsu game.</v>

3916
02:49:45.541 --> 02:49:48.120
<v Speaker 2>Was controlling your body legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you would.</v>

3917
02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I used to.</v>

3918
02:49:49.741 --> 02:49:50.574
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be able to squeeze my legs on </v>

3919
02:49:53.550 --> 02:49:54.383
<v Speaker 2>when you'd wrestle with friends I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get them in where I put my legs around </v>

3920
02:49:56.401 --> 02:49:59.670
<v Speaker 2>their waist and I remember my buddy came</v>

<v Speaker 1>the air and hit my eye brow.</v>

02:50:29.820 --> 02:50:30.653
<v Speaker 1>I can cut the shit out of my eye brow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it was a half an inch from my </v>

3932
02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:35.353
<v Speaker 1>eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like the pointy part of this </v>

<v Speaker 1>stick that snapped off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fd whacked against a tree,</v>

3934
02:50:40.470 --> 02:50:43.350

<v Speaker 4>to every other driver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't have to be.</v>

4019
02:54:39.190 --> 02:54:41.140

<v Speaker 4>between lanes,</v>

4020
02:54:41.141 --> 02:54:43.690
<v Speaker 4>which is a weird thing to be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that freak you out?</v>

4035
02:55:20.211 --> 02:55:21.044
<v Speaker 1>the best beginnings of a song ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill burke calls me up one day and he </v>

<v Speaker 1>interfaces with completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>devices and then the other 50 percent </v>

4080
02:57:09.141 --> 02:57:10.880
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you'll shut up.</v>

4121
02:58:44.280 --> 02:58:46.140
<v Speaker 4>Siri just keeps me to a website.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's contextual.</v>

02:58:48.841 --> 02:58:50.190
<v Speaker 4>Meaning it knows what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

4124
02:58:50.700 --> 02:58:51.930
<v Speaker 4>Like you can ask someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can go,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You don't have to say,</v>

4128
02:58:59.410 --> 02:59:00.500
<v Speaker 4>christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking insane.</v>

4129
02:59:00.510 --> 02:59:03.090
<v Speaker 4>The coolest thing about series that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can just be laying in bed and be like,</v>

4130
02:59:03.091 --> 02:59:05.010
<v Speaker 4>hey siri,</v>
<v Speaker 4>set an alarm for 5:00</v>

4131
02:59:05.010 --> 02:59:06.810
<v Speaker 4>PM and set an alarm for 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>PM.</v>

4132
02:59:07.050 --> 02:59:09.080
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you can always just set an alarm,</v>

4133
02:59:09.081 --> 02:59:09.901
<v Speaker 4>be lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But nobody,</v>

4134
02:59:09.901 --> 02:59:10.734
<v Speaker 4>like if you're laying in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't like to get up and swipe and </v>

4135
02:59:13.220 --> 02:59:18.220
<v Speaker 4>either your password and find five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh hm.</v>

4136
02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:22.343
<v Speaker 4>I can imagine using a regular alarm </v>
<v Speaker 4>clock when I go to a hotel and I see </v>

4137
02:59:24.841 --> 02:59:27.720
<v Speaker 4>that stupid thing next to the bed that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>flashing 12,</v>

4138
02:59:28.160 --> 02:59:28.993
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is this dumb thing that I have to </v>

4139
02:59:30.211 --> 02:59:32.220
<v Speaker 4>figure out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has a phone.</v>

4140
02:59:32.250 --> 02:59:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Your phone is gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna set an alarm on your phone.</v>

4141
02:59:35.730 --> 02:59:39.390
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your phone knows when you switch into,</v>

4142
02:59:39.391 --> 02:59:40.224
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>daylight savings time and it resets it </v>

4143
02:59:41.941 --> 02:59:43.620
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just happened when I was in New York,</v>

4144
02:59:43.650 --> 02:59:45.420
<v Speaker 4>all the clocks were off and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

4145
02:59:45.421 --> 02:59:47.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm late for the taping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I looked at.</v>

4146
02:59:47.090 --> 02:59:48.210
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my phone's fine.</v>

4147
02:59:48.690 --> 02:59:51.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that did it to me on sunday I woke up.</v>

4148
02:59:51.691 --> 02:59:54.210
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was late,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was actually an hour early.</v>

4149
02:59:54.780 --> 02:59:56.260
<v Speaker 4>That was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4150
02:59:56.310 --> 02:59:58.080
<v Speaker 4>that our sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should do that every day.</v>

4151
02:59:58.280 --> 02:59:59.113
<v Speaker 4>It's something though that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking change what time it is because </v>

4152
03:00:02.071 --> 03:00:02.904
<v Speaker 4>of when it's dark and when it's light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's one of the reasons why those </v>

4153
03:00:05.101 --> 03:00:05.934
<v Speaker 4>people in Alaska superior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they reached these stretches where it's </v>

4154
03:00:08.461 --> 03:00:10.670
<v Speaker 4>never dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>YeAh.</v>

4155
03:00:10.710 --> 03:00:11.543
<v Speaker 4>They have these weird moments in july,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when ari and I were there and we </v>

4156
03:00:14.911 --> 03:00:16.800
<v Speaker 4>went outside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was 2:00</v>

4157
03:00:16.830 --> 03:00:19.890
<v Speaker 4>in the morning and it was like 6:30</v>
<v Speaker 4>PM out here.</v>

4158
03:00:20.310 --> 03:00:23.490
<v Speaker 4>That's also arguably why there's so much</v>
<v Speaker 4>drinking in Russia.</v>

4159
03:00:23.970 --> 03:00:24.803
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I remember we were there during </v>

4160
03:00:26.011 --> 03:00:28.380
<v Speaker 4>the white knights and I remember being </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4161
03:00:28.930 --> 03:00:30.960
<v Speaker 4>you'd get done your night and you'd be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4162
03:00:31.020 --> 03:00:31.853
<v Speaker 4>it's time to go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you go out and it'll be fucking </v>

4163
03:00:32.941 --> 03:00:33.774
<v Speaker 4>bright out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd like go to your room and you'd </v>

4164
03:00:34.870 --> 03:00:37.920
<v Speaker 4>have to close all the blinds to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>dark.</v>

4165
03:00:38.010 --> 03:00:39.810
<v Speaker 4>It never got dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called the white knights.</v>

4166
03:00:39.811 --> 03:00:41.940
<v Speaker 4>As long as it lasts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty four hours a day.</v>

4167
03:00:42.080 --> 03:00:42.920
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean for how,</v>

4168
03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:43.833
<v Speaker 4>how long of the year?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably I have to ballpark it at maybe </v>

4169
03:00:46.501 --> 03:00:49.440
<v Speaker 4>like a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe two weeks.</v>

4170
03:00:50.850 --> 03:00:53.370
<v Speaker 4>You're at nature's whim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a week or maybe two weeks,</v>

4171
03:00:53.371 --> 03:00:54.204
<v Speaker 4>but then for three months going in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd say maybe maybe a month going in at </v>

4172
03:00:57.811 --> 03:00:59.530
<v Speaker 4>a month coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

4173
03:01:00.430 --> 03:01:01.263
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I remember walking around the </v>

4174
03:01:02.261 --> 03:01:05.200
<v Speaker 4>streets at like 11:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>at night and it was bright like 5:00</v>

4175
03:01:05.201 --> 03:01:05.830
<v Speaker 4>in the afternoon.</v>

4176
03:01:05.830 --> 03:01:08.350
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember 30 days and nights?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4177
03:01:08.351 --> 03:01:11.530
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking great vampire movie that </v>
<v Speaker 4>takes place in Alaska.</v>

4178
03:01:11.890 --> 03:01:12.723
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the vampires arrive in Alaska when it </v>

4179
03:01:14.261 --> 03:01:17.710
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get light out for 30 days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fuck up dude.</v>

<v Speaker 4>these weird jagged tearing teeth.</v>

4184
03:01:33.910 --> 03:01:36.010
<v Speaker 4>And you know what I love also about </v>

<v Speaker 4>who winds up selling everybody out for </v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like if it's a perfect beard,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like it makes him,</v>

4216
03:03:00.280 --> 03:03:02.490
<v Speaker 4>it defines him better because this,</v>

03:07:40.010 --> 03:07:42.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could do a gang of those.</v>

4336
03:07:42.980 --> 03:07:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Those are so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

4337
03:07:45.591 --> 03:07:47.390
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things were all </v>
<v Speaker 1>together like that.</v>

4338
03:07:47.391 --> 03:07:49.310
<v Speaker 1>We all just start making each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh.</v>

4339
03:07:49.660 --> 03:07:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Like when we were laughing at burger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see burst out ramping it up.</v>

4340
03:07:52.911 --> 03:07:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he,</v>

4341
03:07:53.840 --> 03:07:56.450
<v Speaker 1>he's got an audience of his friends too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4342
03:07:56.660 --> 03:07:58.760
<v Speaker 1>so we got all excited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to get ds on.</v>

4343
03:07:58.770 --> 03:07:59.603
<v Speaker 1>Ds was supposed to come by last night </v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he had a spot somewhere at </v>

4344
03:08:02.841 --> 03:08:05.120
<v Speaker 1>10 and then was going to shoot over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there afterwards,</v>

4345
03:08:05.121 --> 03:08:05.954
<v Speaker 1>but it probably went long but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get him to go out when he </v>

4346
03:08:08.871 --> 03:08:09.620
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want it.</v>

4347
03:08:09.620 --> 03:08:12.870
<v Speaker 3>We'll just do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll do it the wAy we like that.</v>

4348
03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.400
<v Speaker 3>It was the way it was supposed to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that site,</v>

4349
03:08:15.760 --> 03:08:19.480
<v Speaker 3>which is like we got the core of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>four guys or three guys,</v>

4350
03:08:19.481 --> 03:08:20.314
<v Speaker 3>four guys and then and throw out some </v>
<v Speaker 3>Invites to guys that we know that will </v>

4351
03:08:24.191 --> 03:08:26.350
<v Speaker 3>be fun on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like jim jefferies shown up was great.</v>

4352
03:08:26.650 --> 03:08:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Minus the kids were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish you were looking at each other.</v>

4353
03:08:31.061 --> 03:08:32.830
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck is going on here?</v>

4354
03:08:33.310 --> 03:08:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Is that a baby?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But jim was so confused.</v>

4355
03:08:36.011 --> 03:08:37.300
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be a good idea.</v>

4356
03:08:38.040 --> 03:08:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm down for a lot of stuff,</v>

4357
03:08:40.051 --> 03:08:43.170
<v Speaker 1>but I think I'm less the better </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly.</v>

4358
03:08:43.230 --> 03:08:44.970
<v Speaker 1>I think for people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the maximum.</v>

4359
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I think we were way over the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>

4360
03:08:48.260 --> 03:08:49.093
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at times it was so difficult for </v>

4361
03:08:50.311 --> 03:08:51.120
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everything.</v>

4362
03:08:51.120 --> 03:08:54.720
<v Speaker 1>We did a great job considering of not </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking over each other,</v>

4363
03:08:55.050 --> 03:08:55.883
<v Speaker 1>but it was really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a lot of times people </v>

4364
03:08:57.271 --> 03:08:58.104
<v Speaker 1>start a rant and someone would just shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate and dive right into the rant </v>

4365
03:09:01.411 --> 03:09:02.244
<v Speaker 1>and then they would have to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>restart the rant and then someone else </v>

4366
03:09:03.991 --> 03:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>would recognize there is a weakness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to step into and it's like,</v>

4367
03:09:07.680 --> 03:09:08.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bad.</v>

4368
03:09:08.800 --> 03:09:11.380
<v Speaker 3>That's what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need guys that are good at that.</v>

4369
03:09:11.410 --> 03:09:13.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying I'm perfect at it.</v>

4370
03:09:13.271 --> 03:09:14.104
<v Speaker 3>I definitely have flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I will promise you when I got </v>

4371
03:09:15.791 --> 03:09:19.570
<v Speaker 3>on that stage I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was not there to interrupt joe,</v>

4372
03:09:19.571 --> 03:09:21.550
<v Speaker 3>bill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>greg or doug.</v>

4373
03:09:21.551 --> 03:09:22.384
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>

4374
03:09:23.060 --> 03:09:23.893
<v Speaker 1>No one's trying to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like you might have something </v>

4375
03:09:25.191 --> 03:09:28.190
<v Speaker 1>really fun and to say and you've feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you've got it to get it out now,</v>

4376
03:09:28.520 --> 03:09:30.170
<v Speaker 1>but someone else still talking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

4377
03:09:30.171 --> 03:09:31.150
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when is this guy gonna talk.</v>

4378
03:09:31.160 --> 03:09:32.750
<v Speaker 1>And then three other people are waiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk like,</v>

4379
03:09:32.751 --> 03:09:33.920
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna be able to get this out.</v>

4380
03:09:33.921 --> 03:09:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna forgeT it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

4381
03:09:35.600 --> 03:09:36.130
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4382
03:09:36.130 --> 03:09:38.900
<v Speaker 3>and noticing when you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh there's a punchline right there.</v>

4383
03:09:38.960 --> 03:09:40.160
<v Speaker 3>But in my head I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bird,</v>

4384
03:09:40.161 --> 03:09:44.270
<v Speaker 3>have you recognize that when you also </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy to hear what greg fitzsimmons take</v>

4385
03:09:44.450 --> 03:09:47.750
<v Speaker 3>on that very recognizable punchline will</v>
<v Speaker 3>be because it would be better than yours</v>

4386
03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:49.460
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe or you know,</v>

4387
03:09:49.520 --> 03:09:51.290
<v Speaker 3>either way he's talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4388
03:09:51.300 --> 03:09:52.760
<v Speaker 3>like let them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let them rent it out.</v>

4389
03:09:52.761 --> 03:09:54.070
<v Speaker 3>There's worse than someone</v>

4390
03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:54.903
<v Speaker 1>waiting while you're ranting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you feel them waiting and they're </v>

4391
03:09:57.240 --> 03:09:58.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

4392
03:09:59.170 --> 03:10:00.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4393
03:10:00.081 --> 03:10:00.630
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4394
03:10:00.630 --> 03:10:01.540
<v Speaker 1>And you're still doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4395
03:10:01.541 --> 03:10:02.640
<v Speaker 1>hey you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

4396
03:10:03.010 --> 03:10:04.580
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to dance with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

4397
03:10:04.600 --> 03:10:06.850
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to step in on the dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4398
03:10:06.851 --> 03:10:09.700
<v Speaker 1>And when you're in mid stride it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4399
03:10:09.701 --> 03:10:10.534
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person around you have to kind of </v>

4400
03:10:11.171 --> 03:10:12.790
<v Speaker 1>recognize that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the big differences,</v>

4401
03:10:13.060 --> 03:10:16.960
<v Speaker 1>the difference between someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to you and with you,</v>

4402
03:10:17.350 --> 03:10:20.860
<v Speaker 1>like some people just talking to you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're waiting for their chance.</v>

4403
03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:21.873
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're done talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to talk and some people </v>

4404
03:10:23.261 --> 03:10:25.270
<v Speaker 1>are talking with you like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

4405
03:10:25.271 --> 03:10:26.620
<v Speaker 1>and then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4406
03:10:26.621 --> 03:10:27.454
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they start asking you </v>

4407
03:10:28.331 --> 03:10:29.164
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking with you and they might </v>

4408
03:10:30.130 --> 03:10:30.963
<v Speaker 1>have a rant and they might not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might have something funny to say </v>

4409
03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:33.673
<v Speaker 1>and they might not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're having a conversation with </v>

4410
03:10:35.051 --> 03:10:35.884
<v Speaker 1>you that's way easier to listen to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>when people just start talking at each </v>

4411
03:10:39.671 --> 03:10:42.940
<v Speaker 1>other and they're not listening to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other person that just waiting.</v>

4412
03:10:43.120 --> 03:10:45.610
<v Speaker 1>We're all guilty that sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes he fucking zone out,</v>

4413
03:10:45.670 --> 03:10:47.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking to people,</v>

4414
03:10:47.320 --> 03:10:49.060
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not engaged,</v>

4415
03:10:49.330 --> 03:10:50.950
<v Speaker 1>the people listening are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of that too.</v>

4416
03:10:50.980 --> 03:10:52.300
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to be weird to listen to.</v>

4417
03:10:52.770 --> 03:10:54.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be weird to listen to.</v>

4534
03:15:01.611 --> 03:15:02.444
<v Speaker 4>up the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from pressing up against the side of </v>

03:15:03.831 --> 03:15:06.320
<v Speaker 4>your head,</v>

<v Speaker 2>mostly like when I'm on the road,</v>

4574
03:16:37.441 --> 03:16:39.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm not someone who can Just like chill.</v>

4575
03:16:40.080 --> 03:16:43.230
<v Speaker 2>I cannot just sit in a hotel room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just sit there.</v>

4576
03:16:43.920 --> 03:16:45.390
<v Speaker 2>Like when I get off stage and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

4577
03:16:45.440 --> 03:16:48.180

<v Speaker 2>this is gonna sound like a lie,</v>

4578
03:16:48.480 --> 03:16:50.280
<v Speaker 2>but like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really drink on stage.</v>

4579
03:16:50.400 --> 03:16:52.800
<v Speaker 2>I bring a drink on stage for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

4580
03:16:52.830 --> 03:16:54.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't touch it cause I'm talking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour.</v>

03:16:54.810 --> 03:16:56.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only one talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4582
03:16:56.640 --> 03:16:57.473
<v Speaker 2>I don't drink in between shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the second show I'll definitely have </v>

4583
03:17:00.031 --> 03:17:02.030
<v Speaker 2>a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's now that's one drink probably</v>

4584
03:17:02.040 --> 03:17:06.360
<v Speaker 2>I've had throughout the whole night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at midnight when I'm done working I'm</v>

4585
03:17:06.361 --> 03:17:07.580
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

4586
03:17:07.620 --> 03:17:09.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a couple beers because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done working.</v>

4587
03:17:09.870 --> 03:17:10.703
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm not going to go fucking sit in </v>

4588
03:17:12.031 --> 03:17:14.610
<v Speaker 2>my room sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what I should do.</v>

4589
03:17:15.210 --> 03:17:17.460
<v Speaker 2>But like I definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you hit that minibar?</v>

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4592
03:17:18.861 --> 03:17:19.694
<v Speaker 2>but I'll just sit at the club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the club and have a few drinks and then </v>

4593
03:17:23.221 --> 03:17:24.054
<v Speaker 2>go back to my room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not fucking plastered but definitely </v>

4594
03:17:26.161 --> 03:17:30.900
<v Speaker 2>with definitely with probably 600 more </v>
<v Speaker 2>calories than I should have had.</v>

4595
03:17:32.160 --> 03:17:34.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the weight loss when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped drinking,</v>

4596
03:17:35.130 --> 03:17:37.740
<v Speaker 2>it literally tears off of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

4597
03:17:37.741 --> 03:17:39.540
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long have you not drank?</v>

4598
03:17:39.541 --> 03:17:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the longest time?</v>

4599
03:17:40.680 --> 03:17:43.020
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't drinking for three weeks.</v>

4600
03:17:43.350 --> 03:17:45.050
<v Speaker 2>How much weight you lose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4601
03:17:45.960 --> 03:17:49.580
<v Speaker 2>I got down to three to 30 to 35 was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lowest I got,</v>

4602
03:17:49.581 --> 03:17:51.510
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't really working out at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

4603
03:17:51.630 --> 03:17:54.900
<v Speaker 2>How much weight do you usually way right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm 2:42.</v>

4604
03:17:55.040 --> 03:17:58.150
<v Speaker 2>So he lost about 10 pounds or 10 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight to 10.</v>

4605
03:17:58.260 --> 03:18:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Just not doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even change my diet.</v>

4606
03:18:00.211 --> 03:18:01.044
<v Speaker 2>I was eating like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I stopped drinking just because we </v>

4607
03:18:03.331 --> 03:18:04.164
<v Speaker 2>were going under a renovation and a and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was getting the allergies and I got </v>

4608
03:18:08.551 --> 03:18:09.470
<v Speaker 2>sick and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4609
03:18:09.471 --> 03:18:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to drink.</v>

4610
03:18:10.260 --> 03:18:11.093
<v Speaker 2>I want to get healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't drink and I wasn't smoking </v>

4611
03:18:12.931 --> 03:18:15.000
<v Speaker 2>pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden I was like,</v>

4612
03:18:15.220 --> 03:18:16.980
<v Speaker 2>this is boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know shit.</v>

4613
03:18:18.190 --> 03:18:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm imagining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine watching a marching band,</v>

4614
03:18:21.781 --> 03:18:23.640
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have the instruments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just play the tape.</v>

4615
03:18:24.320 --> 03:18:28.590
<v Speaker 2>What I like is long periods of sobriety </v>
<v Speaker 2>followed by pot.</v>

4616
03:18:29.220 --> 03:18:30.990
<v Speaker 2>Like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I take a long time off,</v>

4617
03:18:30.991 --> 03:18:33.210
<v Speaker 2>like many days off and then I'll smoke a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little weed,</v>

4618
03:18:33.450 --> 03:18:35.500
<v Speaker 2>then I go on like adventures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4619
03:18:35.510 --> 03:18:38.190
<v Speaker 2>I can go on an adventure of the mind or </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go on a hike,</v>

4620
03:18:38.420 --> 03:18:39.253
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to get fucked up and go on and </v>

4621
03:18:40.101 --> 03:18:40.934
<v Speaker 2>walk up hills and shit like that really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I don't do it for awhile and </v>

4622
03:18:45.241 --> 03:18:46.074
<v Speaker 2>then I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I get a different feeling out of </v>

4623
03:18:47.201 --> 03:18:48.010
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yesterday was the</v>

4624
03:18:48.010 --> 03:18:50.740
<v Speaker 3>first time I smoked pot in probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>three months.</v>

4625
03:18:50.780 --> 03:18:53.230
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must have hit you so much.</v>

4626
03:18:53.231 --> 03:18:55.140
<v Speaker 3>Fucking fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was good.</v>

4627
03:18:55.180 --> 03:18:59.230
<v Speaker 3>It was so much fun that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember sitting on stage.</v>

4628
03:18:59.320 --> 03:19:00.153
<v Speaker 3>It was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had like a very surreal moment was </v>

4629
03:19:02.350 --> 03:19:04.630
<v Speaker 3>sitting on stage and looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>light and look into people going,</v>

4630
03:19:05.110 --> 03:19:06.370
<v Speaker 3>you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

4631
03:19:06.460 --> 03:19:09.670
<v Speaker 3>Why would anyone not love this drug?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is pure joy.</v>

4632
03:19:09.910 --> 03:19:11.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel confident.</v>

4633
03:19:12.020 --> 03:19:14.590
<v Speaker 3>They feel good about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Makes you friendly.</v>

4634
03:19:14.710 --> 03:19:15.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it makes you a little anxious </v>

4635
03:19:16.721 --> 03:19:19.510
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it does do that,</v>

4636
03:19:19.511 --> 03:19:21.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a little bit of anxiety or</v>

4637
03:19:21.041 --> 03:19:22.590
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4638
03:19:22.900 --> 03:19:24.400
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the three weeks was recent.</v>

4639
03:19:24.490 --> 03:19:27.580
<v Speaker 3>I didn't drink and but I wasn't working </v>
<v Speaker 3>out because I was sick so I.</v>

4640
03:19:27.610 --> 03:19:28.443
<v Speaker 3>But I just lost like eight pounds not </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing anything and eating kind of </v>

4641
03:19:31.480 --> 03:19:32.960
<v Speaker 3>shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4642
03:19:32.980 --> 03:19:33.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to tell you</v>

4643
03:19:33.910 --> 03:19:34.743
<v Speaker 1>because if you keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to drink all the time it's </v>

4644
03:19:36.101 --> 03:19:38.020
<v Speaker 1>going to be super hard to lose rate for </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

4645
03:19:38.110 --> 03:19:41.650
<v Speaker 1>But if you could go back to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to not drinking.</v>

4646
03:19:41.651 --> 03:19:42.484
<v Speaker 1>If you think you could perform and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a good time and be you and you </v>

4647
03:19:44.531 --> 03:19:45.210
<v Speaker 1>definitely could.</v>

4648
03:19:45.210 --> 03:19:46.043
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a problem performing </v>

4649
03:19:46.501 --> 03:19:47.950
<v Speaker 3>without alcohol at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4650
03:19:47.960 --> 03:19:48.600
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4651
03:19:48.600 --> 03:19:50.070
<v Speaker 3>After the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even then,</v>

4652
03:19:50.071 --> 03:19:53.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you just decided you wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>step away from that,</v>

4653
03:19:53.730 --> 03:19:55.380
<v Speaker 3>you could totally do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to.</v>

4654
03:19:55.381 --> 03:19:56.610
<v Speaker 3>I would like to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would really,</v>

4655
03:19:56.611 --> 03:19:57.444
<v Speaker 3>really genuinely love to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke pot by myself in a hotel room and </v>

4656
03:20:01.231 --> 03:20:04.620
<v Speaker 3>not lose my fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about candy?</v>

4657
03:20:04.650 --> 03:20:07.560
<v Speaker 3>Like pot cAndy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a small dose man.</v>

4658
03:20:07.561 --> 03:20:08.394
<v Speaker 3>I've done it and I sit in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting on the couch and I'm stone </v>

4659
03:20:10.741 --> 03:20:11.521
<v Speaker 3>sober.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4660
03:20:11.521 --> 03:20:13.950
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be my transition to </v>
<v Speaker 3>relaxing,</v>

4661
03:20:14.250 --> 03:20:15.083
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden I feel my </v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole so mesh into the couch and I'm </v>

<v Speaker 3>and then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4664
03:20:19.621 --> 03:20:20.520
<v Speaker 3>I can't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

4665

<v Speaker 3>I'm going down to the bar,</v>

4666
03:20:21.480 --> 03:20:23.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting a glass of wine and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to fucking relax.</v>

4667
03:20:24.600 --> 03:20:27.590
<v Speaker 3>And then you down and you're weird and </v>

4673
03:20:38.101 --> 03:20:40.350
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my old school way of like,</v>

4674

<v Speaker 1>Say I take a sleeping pill.</v>

4688
03:21:14.220 --> 03:21:15.600
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy who used to work with,</v>

4689
03:21:15.601 --> 03:21:17.540
<v Speaker 3>used to take my daffodil every day.</v>

03:21:17.690 --> 03:21:18.523
<v Speaker 1>Modafinil is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taken that before many times I've </v>

4691
03:21:21.861 --> 03:21:23.640
<v Speaker 1>taken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called new vigil,</v>

4692
03:21:23.720 --> 03:21:24.553
<v Speaker 1>new visuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new reverse this provigil and nuvigil </v>

4693
03:21:26.660 --> 03:21:28.910
<v Speaker 1>haven't taken it to take it pro vigil </v>
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>

4694
03:21:28.911 --> 03:21:29.744
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've taken new vigil several times </v>

4695
03:21:31.460 --> 03:21:35.720
<v Speaker 1>and it's weird because it doesn't pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>you up like a speed.</v>

4696
03:21:35.750 --> 03:21:38.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not like caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a crazy buzz,</v>

4697
03:21:38.360 --> 03:21:41.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's like you're awake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like tuned into things.</v>

4698
03:21:41.151 --> 03:21:43.010
<v Speaker 1>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's illegal in the olympics.</v>

03:21:43.280 --> 03:21:44.250
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4700
03:21:44.290 --> 03:21:45.123
<v Speaker 1>So it has some of performance benefits </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it and apparently I might be </v>

4701
03:21:48.411 --> 03:21:50.510
<v Speaker 1>spreading disinformation near,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's nothing new.</v>

4702
03:21:50.960 --> 03:21:51.793
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>google tHis for yourself if you want </v>

4703
03:21:52.821 --> 03:21:53.654
<v Speaker 1>verification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it was invented as a </v>

4704
03:21:57.230 --> 03:21:58.063
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had to give it some sort of a </v>

4705
03:22:00.890 --> 03:22:01.723
<v Speaker 1>medical reason that we would take it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said a narcolepsy because it kind </v>

4706
03:22:06.260 --> 03:22:07.700
<v Speaker 1>of keeps you awake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps you fired up.</v>

4707
03:22:07.730 --> 03:22:10.640
<v Speaker 1>But fighter pilots like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently jimmy kimmel,</v>

4708
03:22:10.880 --> 03:22:12.180
<v Speaker 1>jimmy kimmel takes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4709
03:22:12.240 --> 03:22:13.550

<v Speaker 1>that's a rumor bro.</v>

03:24:37.261 --> 03:24:39.420
<v Speaker 1>something about cleveland or pittsburgh </v>

4779
03:24:50.131 --> 03:24:52.370
<v Speaker 1>opposed to you might as well just keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>that song.</v>

4780
03:24:52.371 --> 03:24:53.204
<v Speaker 1>I'm just slightly lightly as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else is the numbers are so </v>

4781
03:24:56.341 --> 03:24:58.710
<v Speaker 1>hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like you get like ratings,</v>

4782
03:24:58.711 --> 03:24:59.251
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4784
03:25:01.620 --> 03:25:02.453
<v Speaker 1>You don't even really know how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that is just guessing based on </v>

4785
03:25:04.951 --> 03:25:07.170
<v Speaker 1>this algorithm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They created over a very small amount of</v>

4786
03:25:07.171 --> 03:25:09.270
<v Speaker 1>houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that many people you're pulling</v>

4787
03:25:09.271 --> 03:25:10.740
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not 100 percent.</v>

4788
03:25:11.010 --> 03:25:13.140
<v Speaker 1>When you're getting a podcast and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that number,</v>

4789
03:25:13.141 --> 03:25:15.420
<v Speaker 1>that is a hundred percent of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have downloaded it.</v>

4790
