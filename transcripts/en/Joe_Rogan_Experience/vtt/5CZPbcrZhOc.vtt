<v Speaker 1>People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done.</v>

53
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a part of me that rejects the</v>

54
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nonsense so hard.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't anything as well.</v>

56
00:01:58.131 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 1>It should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should always reject that horse</v>

57
00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:01.330
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sits.</v>

58
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking pretentious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

59
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>it's pretentious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think most pretentious here,</v>

60
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.661
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the here,</v>

61
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:09.710
<v Speaker 1>the way they describe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really holds you a pallet prison.</v>

62
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>It holds your palate prisoner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the good news in a velvet</v>

63
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:14.350
<v Speaker 1>casing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

64
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.250
<v Speaker 1>speaking of velvet casings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at a restaurant once,</v>

65
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>a very fun restaurant and fairphone</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian restaurant,</v>

66
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>and a gentleman walked in with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>briefcase with two bottles of wine and</v>

67
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>velvet in the briefcase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to resist the chimpanzee urge to</v>

68
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>over the table and smashed him in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking head with that case.</v>

69
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing about that.</v>

70
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's the reason I support him</v>

71
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>because I'm such a freak for one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot send $1,000 bottle of wine.</v>

72
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't ship it because a lot of times</v>

73
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>they put it in the hall of a ship and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes through,</v>

74
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>say the Suez Canal gets hyper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

75
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>it might be 150 degrees in that hall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Good.</v>

76
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>And it's below or above the waterline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in trouble.</v>

77
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.570
<v Speaker 1>So they fly that wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be fucked.</v>

78
00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you it.</v>

79
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>But this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just was bringing it to a restaurant,</v>

80
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>kind of a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of,</v>

81
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a weird move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And You bring your own food to a</v>

82
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:07.250
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

83
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like you bring your own</v>

84
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

85
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Could you tell the chef to chop these</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomatoes?</v>

86
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a parallel with the floor.</v>

87
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I've never brought my own one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell him it's,</v>

88
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>it's obnoxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The establishment.</v>

89
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

90
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is weird.</v>

91
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>And then they have a corkage fee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They charge you to open your won $35</v>

92
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>that's fairly reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>it's just if you're bringing $1,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottle of wine,</v>

94
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.740

<v Speaker 1>but I don't understand why one wine,</v>

95
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>I do understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't understand why someone is</v>

96
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>willing to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do understand it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it has a 93,</v>
<v Speaker 1>94,</v>

120
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're paying a lot of money.</v>

121
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I want to hang out with Robert Parker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

122
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's from Maryland and he's an</v>

123
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>American dude and he's got his taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean he's right.</v>

124
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 1>It just means he knows wine and he set</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard.</v>

125
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Now there are more people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part when Robert Park</v>

126
00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:47.220
<v Speaker 1>gives your wine and 95 or above God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why I hit him with a brick.</v>

127
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey.</v>

128
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

129
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Did you think he says snarky things when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to dinner with him?</v>

130
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Well he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll say for example the one I was</v>

131
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 1>drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called it a century and one,</v>

132
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:02.761
<v Speaker 1>one of the wines of the century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't try to please don't try to buy</v>

133
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 1>it because you know you can't find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he the Tony Hawk of wine connoisseurs</v>

134
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>as he is because nobody knows anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gates other than Tony Hawk.</v>

135
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually,</v>

136
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it is.</v>

137
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.950
<v Speaker 1>And the Lance Armstrong of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

138
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.930
<v Speaker 1>And there are people who are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make their way and,</v>

139
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 1>and real critics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part he's still the</v>

140
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much does it Piss people off?</v>

141
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who ride bikes,</v>

142
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.310
<v Speaker 1>who like are really good and no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives a fuck about them cause there's</v>

143
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 1>not Lance Armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one guy,</v>

144
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 1>there was Greg Lamont for awhile.</v>

145
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 1>I remember he was also an American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We remember him,</v>

146
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.333
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>

147
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 1>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it's also because he was</v>

148
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 1>an American and so dominant and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not,</v>

149
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans don't watch bike racing.</v>

150
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 1>I could never stand on the sideline and</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

151
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>how long aisles keep on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must keep bundling.</v>

152
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a water one,</v>

153
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 1>an orange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that guy.</v>

154
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Life is too short to watch a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>bike.</v>

155
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Race is definitely too short to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching on the sidelines,</v>

156
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 1>like waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that.</v>

157
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel about marathons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Europeans are so different than we</v>

158
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>are in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would Europeans obsess over Formula One</v>

159
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>they obsess over?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's different than a formula one is</v>

160
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>fucking why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

161
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>it's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen those videos?</v>

162
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 1>They do from inside the cockpit of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Formula One car.</v>

163
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some old lightening fast</v>

164
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>decision making going on there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when Senate died,</v>

165
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the streets of Brazil for</v>
<v Speaker 1>his funeral,</v>

166
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 1>it was something that you would never</v>
<v Speaker 1>see in the United States.</v>

167
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>If you have a great race car driver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say a great nascar driver,</v>

168
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was some crazy number of</v>

169
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>people that showed up in the streets of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil.</v>

170
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Brazilians are insanely</v>

171
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>nationalistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love their country.</v>

172
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:43.460
<v Speaker 1>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very patriotic.</v>

173
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>So when someone comes along like Sena</v>
<v Speaker 1>who dominates something that's</v>

174
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.280
<v Speaker 1>traditionally a European dominated</v>
<v Speaker 1>sport,</v>

175
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 1>like Formula One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was a wild man,</v>

176
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>you said a documentary on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't there.</v>

177
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Look at that funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

178
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

179
00:06:57.501 --> 00:06:58.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

180
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.960
<v Speaker 1>he was the guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who could have been a playboy,</v>

181
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 1>but he never really messed with girls.</v>

182
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.920
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

183
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.530
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

184
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.560
<v Speaker 1>a Samurai who's dedicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

185
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ability to shave milliseconds,</v>

186
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just to take crazy chances and cut</v>

187
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:15.620
<v Speaker 1>people off and Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

188
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 1>that precision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a,</v>

189
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>that is something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about it,</v>

190
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.460
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure when you follow it and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

191
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those millimeters,</v>

192
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 1>those differences are what make</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

193
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have a cultivated sense,</v>

194
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:31.190
<v Speaker 1>when you know what you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what looking for it's a,</v>

195
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 1>it must be very enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

196
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:37.811
<v Speaker 1>they have a deep connection with how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much traction there is exactly on those</v>

197
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 1>tires feel like they feel it kicking</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

198
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.721
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

199
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>they literally say with race car drivers</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to have an educated ass.</v>

200
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

201
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your ass has to be able to feel when</v>

202
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:50.930
<v Speaker 1>your car is breaking loose.</v>

203
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Like if you are a race car driver and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a numb ass,</v>

204
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.340
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

205
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had like Sciatica or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and asked went numb,</v>

206
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 1>which I would imagine it'd be a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with someone who sits down all</v>

207
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:02.750
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

208
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 1>They're truck drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

209
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 1>They get Sciatica or all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but race car drivers itself,</v>

210
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.690
<v Speaker 1>physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical,</v>

211
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 1>they lose so much water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lose like somebody like seven</v>

212
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 1>pounds of water or something in inner</v>
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>

213
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine the crazy sweat like a</v>

214
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:14.841
<v Speaker 1>pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

215
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:16.820
<v Speaker 1>It's hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have air conditioning in that</v>

216
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:17.361
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

217
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 1>There's giant engine.</v>

218
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.100
<v Speaker 1>They're flying down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lazy.</v>

219
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.091
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mad.</v>

220
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an educated ass.</v>

221
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think horseback riding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch high,</v>

222
00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:30.650
<v Speaker 1>high level jumpers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

223
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just Saje guys.</v>

224
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.050
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

225
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 1>it's the same exact thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all feel literally it looks like</v>

226
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:38.840
<v Speaker 1>they're doing nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the differences between the best in</v>

227
00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:43.310
<v Speaker 1>the world and the number 300 you and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could never tell the difference because</v>

228
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:44.450
<v Speaker 1>they don't look like they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

229
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>

230
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.480
<v Speaker 1>they look like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look like they're sitting upright</v>

231
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 1>very still as why I could never ride a</v>
<v Speaker 1>horse and just,</v>

232
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the details,</v>

233
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:55.220
<v Speaker 1>those little like where are they placed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The micro,</v>

234
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.550
<v Speaker 1>how they micromanage that saddle and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>signals they're sending to the horse</v>

235
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 1>with their hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their legs and their ass is a whole</v>

236
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 1>different thing.</v>

237
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 1>That's so often the case though with</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

238
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Would things look effortless because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are awesome at them do it so</v>

239
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 1>smoothly that it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

240
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:15.090
<v Speaker 1>you can't appreciate it unless you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually do it.</v>

241
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love about life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's literally what I love about,</v>

242
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it sounds silly,</v>

243
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:26.031
<v Speaker 1>but you can touch a little of that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything you do when you,</v>

244
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

245
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 1>when you practice something you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at.</v>

246
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 1>So tennis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always talking about tennis unboxing.</v>

247
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Am I good at boxing and tennis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

248
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Do I obsess over where my feet are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I have cess over my grip with the</v>

249
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:38.881
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

250
00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God the actual,</v>

251
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:46.490
<v Speaker 1>maybe the actual activity is secondary</v>
<v Speaker 1>to how I love to work on the little</v>

252
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:52.881
<v Speaker 1>details and get better through daily</v>
<v Speaker 1>attendance through daily practice</v>

253
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 1>because something happens to me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaches beyond that sport.</v>

254
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 1>So when I do something that I'm maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little afraid of or maybe I'm not good</v>

255
00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it forces me to think in a way that</v>

256
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:07.410
<v Speaker 1>informs the other things in my life that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make a living at.</v>

257
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I do better at Standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write better when I pushed myself in</v>

258
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:13.380
<v Speaker 1>these other areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

259
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it totally makes sense because I think</v>

260
00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:16.980
<v Speaker 1>very difficult endeavors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

261
00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:18.480
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that you're trying to do.</v>

262
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Any fucking dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:10:20.451 --> 00:10:22.320
<v Speaker 1>If you were trying to be a ballerina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I am.</v>

264
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

265
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 1>keep calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were done with that.</v>

266
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.920
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Bella is my foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm so passionate.</v>

267
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live,</v>

268
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.830
<v Speaker 1>there's too much a quatre in me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in my groin,</v>

269
00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:34.200
<v Speaker 1>so I had to move to southside Madang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

270
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:38.520
<v Speaker 1>people that get really get into Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that as well for has been saying</v>

271
00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:39.130
<v Speaker 1>that a lot.</v>

272
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.700
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting into it is to him it's a lot</v>

273
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:45.690
<v Speaker 1>like writing in some ways or it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a meditation and it</v>

274
00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:47.760
<v Speaker 1>completely obsessed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Lot,</v>

275
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.460
<v Speaker 1>lot of people that get into Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>become completely obsessed with it too.</v>

276
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:52.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's for those same reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you get obsessed,</v>

277
00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:56.280
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with how deep the rabbit hole goes.</v>

278
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the same with tennis or</v>

279
00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.640
<v Speaker 1>with golf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's most certainly the same.</v>

280
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I've never played golf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know the people that exactly the</v>

281
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:04.840
<v Speaker 1>same thing I talked to will jerky will</v>
<v Speaker 1>durkee,</v>

282
00:11:04.841 --> 00:11:05.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

283
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.650
<v Speaker 1>he won,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took second in the,</v>

284
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:10.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10th planet Jiu Jitsu Tournament over</v>

285
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and in Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

286
00:11:12.091 --> 00:11:13.800
<v Speaker 1>He's a professional poker player as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

287
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:17.790
<v Speaker 1>And he was a d one wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think out of Virginia and you know,</v>

288
00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:19.290
<v Speaker 1>watching him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

289
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.670
<v Speaker 1>he lost to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

290
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.770
<v Speaker 1>another guy who was really good but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just barely.</v>

291
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.990
<v Speaker 1>And when you watch those high level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high level competition,</v>

292
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.540
<v Speaker 1>black belts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'd never seen the subtlety,</v>

293
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't even see what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even see them tapping the guy.</v>

294
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was talking to me about how much</v>

295
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:37.170
<v Speaker 1>he loves games and why poker and Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>inform each other.</v>

296
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.070
<v Speaker 1>We know Josh Waitzkin same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with chess.</v>

297
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a Jujitsu.</v>

298
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenal.</v>

299
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 1>If you know him well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's trying,</v>

300
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I think he has a school where he teaches</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids how to think.</v>

301
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:48.750
<v Speaker 1>You can cause it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he teaches them how to learn through</v>

302
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.430
<v Speaker 1>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Math,</v>

303
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.740
<v Speaker 1>I know martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music and chess.</v>

304
00:11:52.741 --> 00:11:55.690
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all kind of the same.</v>

305
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.130
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of why I feel like a lot of</v>

306
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 1>times that I do think there's a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>for self help and you know,</v>

307
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:05.140
<v Speaker 1>inspiration when you're young.</v>

308
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.990
<v Speaker 1>But after a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.290
<v Speaker 1>just trying to get really good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>something under proper tutelage.</v>

310
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll teach you all of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things may be,</v>

311
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.170
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of people that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get good at it.</v>

312
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 1>They never get good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That probably would do better if they</v>

313
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>had better pathways to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

314
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:23.650
<v Speaker 1>if they learned how to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

315
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:27.340
<v Speaker 1>I think first what someone like Tony</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robins does because I've listened to a</v>

316
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 1>lot of his tapes when I was younger and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I was all set to make fun of him</v>

317
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 1>because I was trying to write this</v>
<v Speaker 1>parody on him and then I listened to him</v>

318
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:35.830
<v Speaker 1>and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

319
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker knows exactly how my</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain works.</v>

320
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of ways he simplifies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has tools that helped.</v>

321
00:12:43.001 --> 00:12:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Helped me</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus my energy and recognize,</v>

322
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 1>recognize certain patterns you recognize</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain unhelpful,</v>

323
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:51.190
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

324
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.900
<v Speaker 1>It's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is having pathways in your mind like</v>

325
00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:58.960
<v Speaker 1>abandoning negative thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on positive ones,</v>

326
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.240
<v Speaker 1>abandoning nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating.</v>

327
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a lot of what traps are</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people fall into like addictive</v>

328
00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:09.040
<v Speaker 1>traps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's gambling or whatever.</v>

329
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Fill in the blank pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was watching this whole thing of</v>

330
00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:15.280
<v Speaker 1>the day where people were coming out</v>
<v Speaker 1>against pornography and pornography</v>

331
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:18.610
<v Speaker 1>addiction like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were talking about how harmful</v>

332
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.050
<v Speaker 1>pornography's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

333
00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:23.710
<v Speaker 1>your fucking mind is harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pornography's people having sex and sex</v>

334
00:13:23.711 --> 00:13:24.850
<v Speaker 1>is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So shut up.</v>

335
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a dean to that.</v>

336
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Well you can simplify it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a dean who said,</v>

337
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.650
<v Speaker 1>I am not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

338
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.600
<v Speaker 1>it's less important what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I want to know is how you think and</v>

339
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.820
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about methodology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

340
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.650
<v Speaker 1>it's how it's exactly what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

341
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:44.950
<v Speaker 1>It's how you think about life and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about things.</v>

342
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:50.040
<v Speaker 1>So you may be a slave to certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathways and learning how to reprogram</v>

343
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:56.410
<v Speaker 1>you are your pathways is a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more important thing.</v>

344
00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's not so much that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>pornography that's the enemy.</v>

345
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

346
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.830
<v Speaker 1>it's the methodology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pornography is just sex.</v>

347
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just talking about regular</v>

348
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 1>pornography there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain pornography that you go,</v>

349
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:08.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that for?</v>

350
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does anybody need to see people spit</v>

351
00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 1>in people's eyes and come and people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>noses and stuff?</v>

352
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of really fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>pornography,</v>

353
00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:19.000
<v Speaker 1>but I always equate that to like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing was like if you watch a</v>

354
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:23.050
<v Speaker 1>certain violent movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like they are the product of</v>

355
00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:26.260
<v Speaker 1>the ramping up effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three other violent movie that's come</v>

356
00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:29.020
<v Speaker 1>before them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've had to go further and further</v>

357
00:14:29.021 --> 00:14:31.660
<v Speaker 1>and further to the point where it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally ridiculous.</v>

358
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.610
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not entertaining.</v>

359
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:35.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just there.</v>

360
00:14:35.051 --> 00:14:38.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a response to like taking it to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next level.</v>

361
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
<v Speaker 1>The guy who wrote the double helix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote for the,</v>

362
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 1>for a serial killer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the making of a serial killer,</v>

363
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.150
<v Speaker 1>a guy named Richard Walter who's an FBI</v>
<v Speaker 1>profiler,</v>

364
00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:48.010
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that,</v>

365
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serial killers,</v>

366
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:52.430
<v Speaker 1>we'll typically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is from literally interviewing</v>

367
00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:54.980
<v Speaker 1>20,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,000 prisoners,</v>

368
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of whom were murderers,</v>

369
00:14:56.661 --> 00:15:00.290
<v Speaker 1>violent criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he put together this profile,</v>

370
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:05.291
<v Speaker 1>which was that serial killers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many times start as with fetishes.</v>

371
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.590
<v Speaker 1>They'll start with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

372
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 1>well a lot of times it can be as</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocuous as rubbing against people in</v>

373
00:15:13.071 --> 00:15:14.680
<v Speaker 1>public places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

374
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 1>and then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>

375
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.380
<v Speaker 1>you graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that doesn't do it for you anymore.</v>

376
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to go into a store and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut leather jackets with a razor because</v>

377
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.000
<v Speaker 1>you might get caught.</v>

378
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.150
<v Speaker 1>But it's like skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

379
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 1>And S and what he said was that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

380
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:32.780
<v Speaker 1>once you get to one level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never can go back.</v>

381
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.030
<v Speaker 1>You have to go forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see them go,</v>

382
00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:36.530
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is too much.</v>

383
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Let me go back to rubbing against people</v>
<v Speaker 1>on will never,</v>

384
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:40.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

385
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.460
<v Speaker 1>don't some people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there people that are potential</v>

386
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:44.690
<v Speaker 1>serial killers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

387
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:46.340
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing in my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed,</v>

388
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take Yoga.</v>

389
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

390
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:52.370
<v Speaker 1>But I do know that there've been some</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies about how,</v>

391
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less there are,</v>

392
00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I guess a lot of serial killers are</v>
<v Speaker 1>maniacs are doing less of that stuff</v>

393
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:02.270
<v Speaker 1>because they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can get more of it to a simulated</v>

394
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:03.200
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

395
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:07.250
<v Speaker 1>that was the argument that the Japanese</v>
<v Speaker 1>had or some Japanese scholars had about</v>

396
00:16:07.251 --> 00:16:11.750
<v Speaker 1>pornography is a Japanese porn is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is my might be wrong about this.</v>

397
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:16.820
<v Speaker 1>That it's more embraced and that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at like deviant behavior,</v>

398
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.430
<v Speaker 1>it's more embraced and films and things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

399
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:22.130
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of keeps him from doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in real life.</v>

400
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that you can get</v>

401
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 1>satiated visually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have those,</v>

402
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:28.940
<v Speaker 1>those visual triggers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that the triggers for fighting,</v>

403
00:16:28.941 --> 00:16:30.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you watch mma,</v>

404
00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:34.430
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of those visual triggers</v>
<v Speaker 1>for men that are similar to what</v>

405
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:37.880
<v Speaker 1>pornography does to a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we see two dudes kicking each other</v>

406
00:16:37.881 --> 00:16:39.650
<v Speaker 1>and knocking each other out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to do it.</v>

407
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least we can't take our eyes off</v>

408
00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:41.991
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

409
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:43.640
<v Speaker 1>We definitely can't take your eyes off</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

410
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that also it's possible that</v>

411
00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 1>that could work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they say that about video games,</v>

412
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:51.590
<v Speaker 1>like the argument against video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always been the video games</v>

413
00:16:51.591 --> 00:16:53.810
<v Speaker 1>encourage violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it shows the,</v>

414
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.140
<v Speaker 1>the actual facts show that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite is true.</v>

415
00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.400
<v Speaker 1>That video games actually get people</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in the violence of video games</v>

416
00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:05.240
<v Speaker 1>and it satisfies whatever weird cravings</v>
<v Speaker 1>people might have for violence,</v>

417
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.950
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:12.010
<v Speaker 1>leftover from thousands and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of DNA of people being successful</v>

419
00:17:12.171 --> 00:17:14.180
<v Speaker 1>in violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being rewarded for it.</v>

420
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.400
<v Speaker 1>You violence was a way you survived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

421
00:17:16.401 --> 00:17:18.500
<v Speaker 1>think about hunting while the coliseum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

422
00:17:18.501 --> 00:17:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I went to the coliseum this week been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

423
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:23.450
<v Speaker 1>that is a fucking trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

424
00:17:23.451 --> 00:17:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that the coliseum</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally means next to the Colossus.</v>

425
00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.640
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that it was all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a gigantic,</v>

426
00:17:31.641 --> 00:17:36.641
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 150 foot high bronze</v>
<v Speaker 1>statue of Nero that he had constructed.</v>

427
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

428
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:41.840
<v Speaker 1>the entire colosseum was Niro's house at</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point in time.</v>

429
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.090
<v Speaker 1>It didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

430
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 1>there's like seven areas of Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like seven hills of Rome or something</v>

431
00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And His</v>

432
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.740
<v Speaker 2>fucking house was three of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

433
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:57.630
<v Speaker 2>His house had an enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like more than a hundred</v>

434
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.590
<v Speaker 2>acre lake in the backyard of his house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A man made lake.</v>

435
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that manmade lake like to drain it,</v>

436
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.010
<v Speaker 2>the drainage system to build that lake</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

437
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:10.110
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just discovering some of the</v>

438
00:18:10.111 --> 00:18:14.610
<v Speaker 2>areas of the coliseum today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they did is when they tore down</v>

439
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:17.730
<v Speaker 2>his house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they built the coliseum for the people.</v>

440
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 2>And it was like one of the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>public buildings ever.</v>

441
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.590
<v Speaker 2>And they built it to satisfy the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were just fucking furious that this</v>

442
00:18:25.591 --> 00:18:26.660
<v Speaker 2>cunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

443
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Taken over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burned Rome.</v>

444
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.160
<v Speaker 2>He was just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

445
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Nero was just fucking completely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what they had done with his,</v>

446
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.860
<v Speaker 2>his structure was turned it into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>call scene,</v>

447
00:18:37.861 --> 00:18:40.890
<v Speaker 2>but it was right next to this enormous</v>
<v Speaker 2>statue of him.</v>

448
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.640
<v Speaker 2>So when you say like the La Coliseum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a stupid name,</v>

449
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:44.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

450
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 2>Because the La next to the call next</v>
<v Speaker 2>colossus,</v>

451
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:50.910
<v Speaker 2>that does not make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what coliseum means.</v>

452
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wild.</v>

453
00:18:52.171 --> 00:18:53.970
<v Speaker 2>When you go to Italy and especially</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rome,</v>

454
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.320
<v Speaker 2>and you're standing and structures that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been there for an,</v>

455
00:18:58.321 --> 00:19:02.160
<v Speaker 2>and we're living and had people died on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

456
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:04.110
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the original octagon,</v>

457
00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:04.600
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

458
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.120
<v Speaker 2>way more fucked up than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

459
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Here's one of the things they found out</v>
<v Speaker 2>just recently,</v>

460
00:19:08.371 --> 00:19:11.550
<v Speaker 2>like really recently that they had boat</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

461
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.630
<v Speaker 2>They would fill the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>coliseum with water.</v>

462
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they would have boats,</v>

463
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Jesus and they would get them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've literally just discovered this.</v>

464
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.760
<v Speaker 2>They discovered some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

465
00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:28.610
<v Speaker 2>some sort of artwork or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some writing that indicated that these</v>

466
00:19:28.621 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 2>boat fights took place for a very short</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of time,</v>

467
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:33.330
<v Speaker 2>like a couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He do that fight each other with your</v>

468
00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:33.840
<v Speaker 2>oars.</v>

469
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.420
<v Speaker 2>They bowels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have battles.</v>

470
00:19:36.421 --> 00:19:37.254
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

471
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would fill up powerful Jamie.</v>

472
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.650
<v Speaker 2>They would fill up the bottom with two</v>
<v Speaker 2>meters of water,</v>

473
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.790
<v Speaker 2>six feet of water and have these boats</v>
<v Speaker 2>and float these boats around and they</v>

474
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:50.880
<v Speaker 2>would fight to the death on boats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck would they do that?</v>

475
00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:54.150
<v Speaker 2>I guess the walls kept the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they'd say drain it.</v>

476
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Well they had a very complex drainage</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

477
00:19:56.611 --> 00:19:58.260
<v Speaker 2>Like they showed the draining system to</v>
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>

478
00:19:58.261 --> 00:19:59.850
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't new they take you on a tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

479
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.640
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were showing us the drainage system</v>

480
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:07.641
<v Speaker 2>and also the system of raising the wild</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals from the basement up through the</v>

481
00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:09.580
<v Speaker 2>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

482
00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.270
<v Speaker 2>How would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had this thing where these,</v>

483
00:20:12.271 --> 00:20:14.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a reenactment or,</v>

484
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.210
<v Speaker 2>or recreation of one that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took some photos of,</v>

485
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:21.840
<v Speaker 2>I put one of the photos on my instagram</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these wild animals would be a locked</v>

486
00:20:21.841 --> 00:20:23.220
<v Speaker 2>in these rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

487
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.620
<v Speaker 2>The small rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would give them no food,</v>

488
00:20:25.621 --> 00:20:28.260
<v Speaker 2>no water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'd keep them there for days.</v>

489
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.040
<v Speaker 2>So they'd be freaking out and starving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then finally they'd take them out of</v>

490
00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:33.350
<v Speaker 2>the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put them,</v>

491
00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they forced them into this platform.</v>

492
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.240
<v Speaker 2>And then they would have these slaves</v>
<v Speaker 2>crank this mechanism that would lift the</v>

493
00:20:41.521 --> 00:20:45.240
<v Speaker 2>platform up through a trap door in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>floor.</v>

494
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.930
<v Speaker 2>So their first light in days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would be out there with these</v>

495
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:53.920
<v Speaker 2>gladiators and a little and the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 2>floor,</v>

496
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:57.730
<v Speaker 2>like they had several levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the bottom level was all the rich</v>

497
00:20:57.731 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they fucked up and they didn't have</v>

498
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:05.260
<v Speaker 2>the walls high enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the lions with leap 12 feet over the</v>

499
00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:08.410
<v Speaker 2>wall and just Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these rich people,</v>

500
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:09.910
<v Speaker 2>she's just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's</v>

501
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.370
<v Speaker 2>now the wall thing and though I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

502
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's something that San Francisco</v>

503
00:21:16.281 --> 00:21:18.190
<v Speaker 2>soon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that tiger jumped that 12 foot wall.</v>

504
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

505
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Well they had to figure out how to do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

506
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:24.340
<v Speaker 2>because they would get these animals in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and most of the time they'd let</v>

507
00:21:24.341 --> 00:21:26.600
<v Speaker 2>the animals out and that animals would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be just fucking scared.</v>

508
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:27.640
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

509
00:21:27.641 --> 00:21:30.040
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they realized that by keeping them down</v>

510
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:33.910
<v Speaker 2>there with no food and no water and</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting them to a complete state of</v>

511
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:38.410
<v Speaker 2>desperation and hysteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would allow them to ensure that</v>

512
00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:41.380
<v Speaker 2>when they pop that trap door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lions would come out and just try to</v>

513
00:21:41.381 --> 00:21:42.560
<v Speaker 2>jack people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brutal.</v>

514
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would kill everything.</v>

515
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:45.030
<v Speaker 2>They had elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had all,</v>

516
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.310
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of crazy fucking animals they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had brought in from Africa,</v>

517
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.920
<v Speaker 2>which by the way is not even a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles away.</v>

518
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa was so close to the ceiling.</v>

519
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:54.940
<v Speaker 2>You can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

520
00:21:54.941 --> 00:21:55.630
<v Speaker 2>you know what I think?</v>

521
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.463
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see,</v>

522
00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.040
<v Speaker 2>you can see Africa from Sicily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

523
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:04.390
<v Speaker 2>You can see Africa from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see it.</v>

524
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm clear days.</v>

525
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

526
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.453
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean wrong.</v>

527
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.600
<v Speaker 2>It seems like too many miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

528
00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:13.090
<v Speaker 2>There are certain parts of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me look at a map.</v>

529
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.610
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what it seems like.</v>

00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

583
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.020
<v Speaker 1>let's call it the what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

584
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.510
<v Speaker 1>50s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30s,</v>

585
00:24:20.511 --> 00:24:22.670
<v Speaker 1>forties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you were gay,</v>

586
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:23.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

587
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.310
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were very Catholic.</v>

588
00:24:25.311 --> 00:24:27.470
<v Speaker 1>So that was already a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second of all,</v>

589
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.700
<v Speaker 1>you weren't really that welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't a whole lot of gay pride.</v>

590
00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wanted March.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

591
00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:34.310
<v Speaker 1>so he went to Italy.</v>

592
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.850
<v Speaker 1>We went to Rome and lived there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew he could be accepted.</v>

593
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he found his little niche.</v>

594
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 1>He got into the theater company there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I spoke Italian of course,</v>

595
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:49.091
<v Speaker 1>and a head of Horus and lived for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he died at 96 and lived above the</v>

596
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Piazza Navona in a rent controlled</v>
<v Speaker 1>penthouses die from that.</v>

597
00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:55.130
<v Speaker 1>The Vatican own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't die.</v>

598
00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

599
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to ask you to be a little more</v>
<v Speaker 1>mature.</v>

600
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.390
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot of people listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did not die from dicks.</v>

601
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a,</v>

602
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.050
<v Speaker 1>he was a character man and he did lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of plays.</v>

603
00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.530
<v Speaker 1>And did you know that the Vatican owns</v>
<v Speaker 1>the building that houses Europe's</v>

604
00:25:09.531 --> 00:25:12.800
<v Speaker 1>largest gay gathpath house?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>

605
00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:14.880
<v Speaker 1>But I also don't believe you because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

606
00:25:14.881 --> 00:25:16.160
<v Speaker 1>is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a matter of,</v>

607
00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:19.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a matter of a conjecture or it's</v>

608
00:25:19.341 --> 00:25:19.730
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>

609
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.150
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a bath house now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the largest gay bath house in</v>

610
00:25:23.151 --> 00:25:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Europe and the Vatican owns it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

611
00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.500
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see the,</v>

612
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:30.350
<v Speaker 1>there's the cardinals or the bishops</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's fucking office is right above the</v>

613
00:25:30.351 --> 00:25:31.730
<v Speaker 1>gay bath house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conveniently,</v>

614
00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:34.280
<v Speaker 1>conveniently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking shoot that just</v>

615
00:25:34.281 --> 00:25:36.970
<v Speaker 1>dropped down a lot of property as lube</v>
<v Speaker 1>up their button,</v>

616
00:25:36.971 --> 00:25:40.640
<v Speaker 1>drop down through the floor and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Vatican please.</v>

617
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Landlord to Europe's biggest gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>bathhouse.</v>

618
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Catholic church paid $30 million to</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquire a building that houses a senior.</v>

619
00:25:47.261 --> 00:25:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Will cardinal end a huge gay sauna?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

620
00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:52.910
<v Speaker 1>How weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird that,</v>

621
00:25:52.911 --> 00:25:53.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

622
00:25:53.811 --> 00:25:55.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they would want to own</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

623
00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:00.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know cause you want to sweat</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you get your Dick Dick work by</v>

624
00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:03.980
<v Speaker 1>strong man hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

625
00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Well the amount of artwork that is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Vatican,</v>

626
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.460
<v Speaker 1>like if you haven't been there before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was not that excited about going</v>

627
00:26:10.461 --> 00:26:11.720
<v Speaker 1>to the Vatican before went there.</v>

628
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.610
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I want to see the coliseum.</v>

629
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's like one of the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonders of history like that they had</v>

630
00:26:18.471 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 1>this thing there and that they did this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's also like the ultimate</v>

631
00:26:22.521 --> 00:26:24.410
<v Speaker 1>sign of excess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

632
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.840
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that people point to when</v>

633
00:26:26.841 --> 00:26:29.870
<v Speaker 1>they talk about society's falling apart</v>
<v Speaker 1>due to excess as the Romans,</v>

634
00:26:29.871 --> 00:26:31.190
<v Speaker 1>the Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went crazy.</v>

635
00:26:31.191 --> 00:26:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Like it was also sort of what gave food</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the reformation.</v>

636
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:38.750
<v Speaker 1>When Martin Luther,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this German Jesuit priest said,</v>

637
00:26:38.751 --> 00:26:41.690
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this money that's going to,</v>

638
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>idolatry essentially like building</v>

639
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.420
<v Speaker 2>these incredible statues and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible cathedrals and we're starving</v>

640
00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 2>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about if we just read the Bible,</v>

641
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:53.520
<v Speaker 2>we just read the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then maybe we'll be,</v>

642
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just is in favor with God as you guys.</v>

643
00:26:57.421 --> 00:27:01.920
<v Speaker 2>And maybe we don't need a hierarchy of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bishops and all these and popes and all</v>

644
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:06.921
<v Speaker 2>this sort of rank and file that also</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs a salary that's also taking money.</v>

645
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martin Luther was also the first guy to</v>

646
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:13.680
<v Speaker 2>translate the Bible phonetically so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular people could read it because</v>

647
00:27:13.681 --> 00:27:15.990
<v Speaker 2>everybody else was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one knew Latin.</v>

648
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.760
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't read Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

649
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:20.990
<v Speaker 2>So it was only these priests that we had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to rely on to,</v>

650
00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.700
<v Speaker 2>to get the word of God from Martin</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luther was like,</v>

651
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.090
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as luckily Martin Luther,</v>

652
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:29.670
<v Speaker 2>it had such a high standing in society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't kill him.</v>

653
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried.</v>

654
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:31.230
<v Speaker 2>He had to leave.</v>

655
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.580
<v Speaker 2>He was always on the run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're right.</v>

656
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.680
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he was anyone else,</v>

657
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.980
<v Speaker 2>if he wasn't like a very respected high</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing person in society,</v>

658
00:27:37.981 --> 00:27:39.600
<v Speaker 2>they probably would have jacked him a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time ago.</v>

659
00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there was already,</v>

660
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:43.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from an eye,</v>

661
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot about it back in the day,</v>

662
00:27:45.061 --> 00:27:47.790
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was always under threat of that.</v>

663
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:49.890
<v Speaker 2>He had to essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in bitten Berg.</v>

664
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:53.640
<v Speaker 2>And there's this a phrase that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>always associate with Rome called the</v>

665
00:27:53.641 --> 00:27:58.410
<v Speaker 2>vomitorium and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what it sounds like.</v>

666
00:27:58.411 --> 00:28:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Everybody thinks that they got there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they threw up and then they went back</v>

667
00:28:01.771 --> 00:28:03.840
<v Speaker 2>and eight again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what they did.</v>

668
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.240
<v Speaker 2>I always thought they did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

669
00:28:05.241 --> 00:28:08.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vomitorium refers to the way they</v>

670
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.750
<v Speaker 2>got people out of the stadium had</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with the word vomit.</v>

671
00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.360
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the way the stadium is structured.</v>

672
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Is this gigantic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a vomitorium is the,</v>

673
00:28:18.541 --> 00:28:19.770
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the exit.</v>

674
00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.640
<v Speaker 2>So they had all these exits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a bunch of different doors all</v>

675
00:28:23.641 --> 00:28:27.510
<v Speaker 2>throughout the building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at like some images of</v>

676
00:28:27.511 --> 00:28:30.180
<v Speaker 2>the colosseum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all these pathways.</v>

677
00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Like you would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

678
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.060
<v Speaker 2>30 yards over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another pathway,</v>

679
00:28:33.061 --> 00:28:34.530
<v Speaker 2>30 hours over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another pathway.</v>

680
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:39.060
<v Speaker 2>And that allowed an efficient way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting people see like look at all the</v>

681
00:28:39.061 --> 00:28:41.430
<v Speaker 2>doorways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see all those doorways all around it.</v>

682
00:28:41.431 --> 00:28:45.330
<v Speaker 2>That that was an efficient method of</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting people out of the stadium.</v>

683
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.160
<v Speaker 2>So they called it a vomitorium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like if you look the etymology of</v>

684
00:28:50.161 --> 00:28:51.780
<v Speaker 2>the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like look up the,</v>

685
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.710
<v Speaker 2>the origins of the word vomitorium and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it means in Latin,</v>

686
00:28:55.711 --> 00:28:58.710
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't have anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>vomit but sounds like it.</v>

687
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.620
<v Speaker 2>So everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

688
00:28:59.621 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just fucking eight and threw up.</v>

689
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:03.860
<v Speaker 2>So people like sort of repeated that</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again.</v>

690
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Let's stick a feather down their throat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure someone did that.</v>

691
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there was some fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

692
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.790
<v Speaker 2>that's right now in Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

693
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just did.</v>

694
00:29:12.301 --> 00:29:15.900
<v Speaker 2>A girl had a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So deny vomitorium.</v>

695
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it was a place which according to</v>

696
00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:21.120
<v Speaker 2>popular misconception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ancient Romans were supposed to</v>

697
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:22.410
<v Speaker 2>vomit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

698
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the arch of a series of entrances or</v>

699
00:29:25.021 --> 00:29:28.980
<v Speaker 2>exit pathways and an ancient Roman</v>
<v Speaker 2>amphitheater or theater.</v>

700
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:29.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

701
00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:33.120
<v Speaker 2>that's what it really means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the popular misconception,</v>

702
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.900
<v Speaker 2>the second version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but translate user over time.</v>

703
00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.360
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the origins of the word though?</v>

704
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Like what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vomitorium is the plural noun.</v>

705
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

706
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.520
<v Speaker 2>That's the plural vomitorium probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

707
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:52.120
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like it's where people would</v>
<v Speaker 2>vomit out of,</v>

708
00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:52.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

709
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not vomit.</v>

710
00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's our word.</v>

711
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not like what they would call</v>

712
00:29:59.231 --> 00:29:59.950
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

713
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Like you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like our word vomit is puke,</v>

714
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.060
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what they were referring</v>
<v Speaker 2>to when they were calling it a</v>

715
00:30:07.061 --> 00:30:09.220
<v Speaker 2>vomitorium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just one of those weird Latin</v>

716
00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:11.440
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But everybody always thinks that</v>

717
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.110
<v Speaker 2>everybody thinks that that's what a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vomitorium was like.</v>

718
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:16.720
<v Speaker 2>You should imagine if there was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking house that people would go to</v>

719
00:30:16.721 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 2>throw up and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

720
00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:20.560
<v Speaker 2>let's keep going to go to the vomitorium</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking puke.</v>

721
00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of assholes eat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a feather.</v>

722
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:27.190
<v Speaker 2>But you would call it the puke house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that is so ridiculous.</v>

723
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:30.280
<v Speaker 2>The puke room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vomitorium puke room.</v>

724
00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:32.860
<v Speaker 2>The sauna room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the actual,</v>

725
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.730
<v Speaker 2>does it say Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says here this tube misinterpret or</v>

726
00:30:36.731 --> 00:30:38.730
<v Speaker 2>where it might have came from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>misinterpretations.</v>

727
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what is the original?</v>

728
00:30:40.211 --> 00:30:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Was the actual word mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like vomitorium.</v>

729
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:48.310
<v Speaker 2>It just sounds like this is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrance.</v>

730
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Just fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

731
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:55.060
<v Speaker 2>to spew forth this beautiful earth and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder if involvement actually came from</v>

732
00:30:55.061 --> 00:30:57.350
<v Speaker 2>that then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

733
00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:02.320
<v Speaker 2>so the original thing was an exit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then vomit became that.</v>

734
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

735
00:31:03.971 --> 00:31:05.440
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of how language happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

736
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:06.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

737
00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:08.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird how it happens over thousands</v>

738
00:31:08.411 --> 00:31:10.150
<v Speaker 2>of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So things just stuart and warp.</v>

739
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how the language is always</v>

740
00:31:11.801 --> 00:31:13.690
<v Speaker 2>changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always changing.</v>

741
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:15.340
<v Speaker 2>We're always making up our own</v>
<v Speaker 2>languages.</v>

742
00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.770
<v Speaker 2>It's constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While we were there,</v>

743
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.600
<v Speaker 2>they had just found some new shit two</v>
<v Speaker 2>days before we were there.</v>

744
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:28.170
<v Speaker 2>They're constantly finding new path and</v>
<v Speaker 2>passages underneath the coliseum and new</v>

745
00:31:28.271 --> 00:31:31.930
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the amount of work that was done in</v>

746
00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:35.200
<v Speaker 2>completing that building and making</v>
<v Speaker 2>those structures,</v>

747
00:31:35.201 --> 00:31:38.830
<v Speaker 2>it's insane with free labor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why slavery isn't that bad.</v>

748
00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

749
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting that slavery was the</v>

750
00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:48.901
<v Speaker 2>order of the day for most of history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you look at like wage slavery</v>

751
00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:53.710
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you mean there's no slavery today,</v>

752
00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:57.430
<v Speaker 2>but if you can imprison people in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>state of poverty,</v>

753
00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.330
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not,</v>

754
00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.480
<v Speaker 2>not against their will voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

755
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:05.710
<v Speaker 2>You get people hooked on buying things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get them hooked on credit.</v>

756
00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:09.430
<v Speaker 2>So they need to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they constantly need to work and then</v>

757
00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:13.330
<v Speaker 2>they're in these jobs that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely dead end low wage jobs.</v>

758
00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:16.570
<v Speaker 2>They can't go anywhere and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>perform these menial tasks.</v>

759
00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:20.320
<v Speaker 2>And until we figure out robot that could</v>
<v Speaker 2>do those tasks far better and far more</v>

760
00:32:20.321 --> 00:32:24.070
<v Speaker 2>efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not slavery because they can quit</v>

761
00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:29.071
<v Speaker 2>and leave anytime they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in a lot of ways it has the same</v>

762
00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:31.600
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference.</v>

763
00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:36.250
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm talking about there's a macro</v>

764
00:32:36.251 --> 00:32:38.740
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's there</v>

765
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:45.250
<v Speaker 1>an idea that has gained great traction</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cause ideas move really slowly</v>

766
00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:49.430
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's an idea that has gained</v>

767
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:53.300
<v Speaker 1>traction in most of the world and even</v>
<v Speaker 1>in parts of the world where it isn't,</v>

768
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:58.310
<v Speaker 1>they try to defend it as it being so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is the idea of universal human</v>

769
00:32:58.311 --> 00:33:02.210
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Universal human rights was not an idea</v>

770
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.020
<v Speaker 1>that was embraced by most of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even as far back properly.</v>

771
00:33:06.021 --> 00:33:10.010
<v Speaker 1>You can make the argument as 1940</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery was alive and well.</v>

772
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Think about this country and it's and</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

773
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:17.440
<v Speaker 1>this country until 1964 was it a where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was separate but equal the idea</v>

774
00:33:18.951 --> 00:33:21.110
<v Speaker 1>that you had black and white water</v>
<v Speaker 1>fountains,</v>

775
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brown horse years before that,</v>

776
00:33:23.781 --> 00:33:26.060
<v Speaker 1>which is nothing slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

777
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:29.930
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course that had to be defended</v>

778
00:33:29.931 --> 00:33:33.260
<v Speaker 1>along biblical grounds and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of shotty ideas,</v>

779
00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:37.130
<v Speaker 1>but the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of universal human rights,</v>

780
00:33:37.131 --> 00:33:41.570
<v Speaker 1>even though the Judaeo Christian ethic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even Islam talked about sort of</v>

781
00:33:41.571 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 1>everybody being of the same moral worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're all from the same father,</v>

782
00:33:45.201 --> 00:33:45.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

783
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the monotheistic a notion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>where value comes in those religions,</v>

784
00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:51.990
<v Speaker 1>we're all the same as long as you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

785
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.300
<v Speaker 1>read the Bible and follow these tenants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But universally human rights is</v>

786
00:33:56.301 --> 00:33:59.890
<v Speaker 1>something a little bit different and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a modern concept and um,</v>

787
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.080
<v Speaker 1>that likes a germ theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that these things you can't</v>

788
00:34:03.081 --> 00:34:05.630
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still have to wash your hands or</v>

789
00:34:05.631 --> 00:34:07.820
<v Speaker 1>you can spread bacteria and things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

790
00:34:07.821 --> 00:34:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Those things that move very slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that is,</v>

791
00:34:10.191 --> 00:34:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I think where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you connecting those?</v>

792
00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:14.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll just talking about how both those</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas are ideas.</v>

793
00:34:14.861 --> 00:34:17.270
<v Speaker 1>It took a long time to gain traction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

794
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.860
<v Speaker 1>even though they were good for us and by</v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

795
00:34:19.861 --> 00:34:21.860
<v Speaker 1>But let's stick to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's stick to um,</v>

796
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:25.550
<v Speaker 1>universal human rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that idea,</v>

797
00:34:25.551 --> 00:34:30.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just that mindset and the fact that</v>

798
00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:35.321
<v Speaker 1>you have to defend it as a society is</v>
<v Speaker 1>why there's such a stark difference</v>

799
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:37.140
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you're saying by being</v>

800
00:34:37.141 --> 00:34:41.450
<v Speaker 1>at bondage to your lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to having to make a living because</v>

801
00:34:41.451 --> 00:34:43.220
<v Speaker 1>you've got people who depend on you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

802
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that'll ever go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

803
00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:46.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's such a,</v>

804
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.480
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that'll go with,</v>

805
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.070
<v Speaker 1>could definitely go on saying we</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery,</v>

806
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:54.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm saying is that there's,</v>

807
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I think when I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaves have zero dignity.</v>

808
00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Like it in fact there's no somebody one</v>
<v Speaker 1>time as a historian is that there's no</v>

809
00:35:02.511 --> 00:35:05.840
<v Speaker 1>such thing as a slave slave there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people in bondage.</v>

810
00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:10.100
<v Speaker 1>So anybody who is a slave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a slave,</v>

811
00:35:10.101 --> 00:35:12.530
<v Speaker 1>but you are a person in slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

812
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:13.790
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was like he,</v>

813
00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:14.870
<v Speaker 1>he poses the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

814
00:35:14.871 --> 00:35:16.790
<v Speaker 1>what did the civil rights movement begin</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country?</v>

815
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.541
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

816
00:35:17.541 --> 00:35:20.120
<v Speaker 1>and sell Alabama and the 60s and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth.</v>

817
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:20.931
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

818
00:35:20.931 --> 00:35:21.260
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

819
00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:21.411
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

820
00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:23.870
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said the civil rights movement began</v>

821
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:28.610
<v Speaker 1>the first day that an African American</v>
<v Speaker 1>was brought to this country against his</v>

822
00:35:28.611 --> 00:35:29.120
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

823
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Any human being doesn't want to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>bondage.</v>

824
00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.610
<v Speaker 1>You are always trying to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bondage.</v>

825
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:39.450
<v Speaker 1>And there is that striving for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're getting closer to,</v>

826
00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well wait a minute,</v>

827
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:42.540
<v Speaker 1>that's slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was that,</v>

828
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:45.180
<v Speaker 1>the civil rights movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the first day that someone's</v>

829
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:47.340
<v Speaker 1>brought to United States against their</v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

830
00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:51.510
<v Speaker 1>That's not the first day that someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>enacted some sort of a civil right.</v>

831
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was being,</v>

832
00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:54.810
<v Speaker 1>he was being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was saying was that,</v>

833
00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody is always fighting for dignity</v>

834
00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 1>and their own serenity and their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil rights regardless of,</v>

835
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:02.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they are.</v>

836
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.750
<v Speaker 1>If you put someone in bondage and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them do things against their will</v>

837
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:09.300
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take their dignity away,</v>

838
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:12.610
<v Speaker 1>they are immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're immediately beginning to</v>

839
00:36:12.611 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 1>struggle for their own freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

840
00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 1>and that's where the conspiracy theories</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall into play,</v>

841
00:36:17.251 --> 00:36:22.080
<v Speaker 1>where modern capitalism is thought of as</v>
<v Speaker 1>being some sort of a new way around that</v>

842
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:26.940
<v Speaker 1>that instead of having people slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally bonding them,</v>

843
00:36:26.941 --> 00:36:28.740
<v Speaker 1>putting them in chains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping them against their will.</v>

844
00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Instead you just set up these honey</v>
<v Speaker 1>traps and you allow people to get sucked</v>

845
00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:38.691
<v Speaker 1>into these things like having massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>debt from student loans and making</v>

846
00:36:38.941 --> 00:36:43.020
<v Speaker 1>credit cards easy and allowing people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortgage a house they can't really</v>

847
00:36:43.021 --> 00:36:47.340
<v Speaker 1>afford knowing full well that eventually</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bank's going to foreclose on this</v>

848
00:36:47.341 --> 00:36:51.060
<v Speaker 1>and reap some sort of a profit and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things,</v>

849
00:36:51.061 --> 00:36:53.010
<v Speaker 1>this is where conspiracy theories fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>into play,</v>

850
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:58.080
<v Speaker 1>that all these things are set up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enact a modern form of slavery and that</v>

851
00:36:58.081 --> 00:37:02.430
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to be people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are taking advantage of people below</v>

852
00:37:02.431 --> 00:37:06.480
<v Speaker 1>them and putting them in very</v>
<v Speaker 1>disadvantageous situations for their own</v>

853
00:37:06.481 --> 00:37:08.820
<v Speaker 1>gain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that that's literally the</v>

854
00:37:08.821 --> 00:37:09.970
<v Speaker 1>state of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

855
00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.910
<v Speaker 1>and what I mean by that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>

856
00:37:11.911 --> 00:37:13.530
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just take for example,</v>

857
00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm the marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

858
00:37:15.301 --> 00:37:17.310
<v Speaker 1>if you just let people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you let people go,</v>

859
00:37:17.311 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 1>let people do their thing.</v>

860
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.030
<v Speaker 1>They are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

861
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a marketplace for</v>

862
00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.670
<v Speaker 1>differences of opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I mean,</v>

863
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about to start up a,</v>

864
00:37:30.451 --> 00:37:32.250
<v Speaker 1>you start a company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

865
00:37:32.251 --> 00:37:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

866
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:37.350
<v Speaker 1>a tech gadget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to have groups of</v>

867
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:39.210
<v Speaker 1>people on this side that are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

868
00:37:39.211 --> 00:37:42.810
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be the next big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan's company's going to be the</v>

869
00:37:42.811 --> 00:37:45.360
<v Speaker 1>next apple and you're going to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of other people on the other side.</v>

870
00:37:45.361 --> 00:37:46.830
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

871
00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a shot.</v>

872
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.090
<v Speaker 1>And here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have these differences of opinion</v>

873
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:55.740
<v Speaker 1>and there's a marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a marketplace for what</v>

874
00:37:55.741 --> 00:37:57.430
<v Speaker 1>essentially is a derivative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

875
00:37:57.431 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a swap.</v>

876
00:37:58.381 --> 00:38:01.410
<v Speaker 1>There's a marketplace there too where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

877
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I will bet you I will short that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will basically say,</v>

878
00:38:05.551 --> 00:38:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll buy it at this price right now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll sell it to,</v>

879
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.690
<v Speaker 1>and if it goes up in value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay me the difference.</v>

880
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.000
<v Speaker 1>That's how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how marketplaces work.</v>

881
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:19.080
<v Speaker 1>So for me it's capitalism has just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people with different opinions</v>

882
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:22.110
<v Speaker 1>who are trying to make money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are coming up with ideas.</v>

883
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:27.450
<v Speaker 1>And if you create a society where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can enforce contracts and make people</v>

884
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:32.850
<v Speaker 1>keep their promises and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can ensure that people have what's</v>

885
00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 1>called property rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really important.</v>

886
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>courts essentially that have integrity,</v>

887
00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 2>that can't be bought off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's as far as I can see what</v>

888
00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 2>you'd call a free market capitalist</v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

889
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:51.400
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to be better than most of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other sort of,</v>

890
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:56.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems that require central oversight.</v>

891
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:59.560
<v Speaker 2>And because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because central oversight is such a</v>

892
00:38:59.561 --> 00:39:02.440
<v Speaker 2>bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's impossible to control.</v>

893
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way people think on such a macro</v>

894
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:07.030
<v Speaker 2>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very,</v>

895
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:11.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you have to control the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way people think well or behave or</v>

896
00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:12.750
<v Speaker 2>behave more harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

897
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.020
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

898
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.960
<v Speaker 2>And I see what you're saying about</v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism and I see what you're saying</v>

899
00:39:16.961 --> 00:39:20.140
<v Speaker 2>about society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that all these things,</v>

900
00:39:20.141 --> 00:39:23.710
<v Speaker 2>when we point to ancient room would</v>
<v Speaker 2>point to how fucked up their world was.</v>

901
00:39:23.711 --> 00:39:26.710
<v Speaker 2>And slavery is recently as a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred years ago.</v>

902
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I think what we're saying is things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting better or we're evolving.</v>

903
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:36.360
<v Speaker 2>We're figuring out a way to make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>society that is more beneficial to more</v>

904
00:39:36.731 --> 00:39:39.040
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still not to everyone.</v>

905
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:43.660
<v Speaker 2>And then the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it possible to create a Utopian</v>

906
00:39:43.661 --> 00:39:46.000
<v Speaker 2>society where it's beneficial to</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually everyone?</v>

907
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:49.890
<v Speaker 2>And then the way to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way to do that is like,</v>

908
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.850
<v Speaker 2>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a good example.</v>

909
00:39:51.851 --> 00:39:56.851
<v Speaker 2>Like people love to tout socialism as</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a cure to what ails us.</v>

910
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.040
<v Speaker 2>You know that somehow or another that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get people and you,</v>

911
00:40:03.041 --> 00:40:07.360
<v Speaker 2>you give everybody money and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's shares wealth equally.</v>

912
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:11.890
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with that cuts out</v>
<v Speaker 2>incentive incentive for madness and</v>

913
00:40:11.891 --> 00:40:16.180
<v Speaker 2>excellence and the incentive for madness</v>
<v Speaker 2>and excellence is why you have tesla</v>

914
00:40:16.181 --> 00:40:19.210
<v Speaker 2>motorcars and Ilan Musk and all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking jobs.</v>

915
00:40:19.211 --> 00:40:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Steve Jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve jobs is a fucking maniac.</v>

916
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.310
<v Speaker 2>He was up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean probably a bad dad.</v>

917
00:40:24.311 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

918
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Probably probably a shitty got to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

919
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a total asshole if you did</v>

920
00:40:29.201 --> 00:40:31.900
<v Speaker 2>something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you put a one instead of a zero and a</v>

921
00:40:31.901 --> 00:40:35.740
<v Speaker 2>line of code and the fucking phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>crashed when it hit a thousand emails or</v>

922
00:40:35.741 --> 00:40:37.270
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd probably beat the fuck out of him.</v>

923
00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

924
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.920
<v Speaker 2>but it was because of him that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>iphones.</v>

925
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Well it's because of that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>madness.</v>

926
00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:46.810
<v Speaker 2>100% how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many iphones have you bought that</v>

927
00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:48.650
<v Speaker 2>were made in Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many cars have you bought that were</v>

928
00:40:48.651 --> 00:40:49.530
<v Speaker 2>made in rush?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

929
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:54.070
<v Speaker 2>but in Russia's fucked up example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not really socialism,</v>

930
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.230
<v Speaker 2>it's really communist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dictatorship nowadays is,</v>

931
00:40:56.231 --> 00:40:58.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of was and then it wasn't and</v>

932
00:40:58.311 --> 00:41:00.160
<v Speaker 2>it was again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it never really recovered.</v>

933
00:41:00.161 --> 00:41:01.660
<v Speaker 2>The Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that their problem is they have</v>

934
00:41:01.661 --> 00:41:04.180
<v Speaker 2>one idea of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is biggest guns.</v>

935
00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Divert your eyes in my presence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fucked up is that?</v>

936
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Russia's getting kicked out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympics.</v>

937
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pay attention is,</v>

938
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:10.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

939
00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:11.711
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to tick.</v>

940
00:41:11.711 --> 00:41:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Kicked the whole team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole Russian team.</v>

941
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.680
<v Speaker 2>What cheating is so it's so systemic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so systemic.</v>

942
00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:19.930
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's state sponsored come.</v>

943
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.060
<v Speaker 2>They've got the KGB apparently are that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

944
00:41:22.061 --> 00:41:23.620
<v Speaker 2>it used to be the KGB involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

945
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.680
<v Speaker 2>now I have this one woman who was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whistle blower who's going to compete</v>

946
00:41:26.681 --> 00:41:29.800
<v Speaker 2>independently without a nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long before they kill her?</v>

947
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck with that bitch.</v>

948
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Get fucking bottle of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

949
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.370
<v Speaker 2>that's Russia's problem.</v>

950
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Russia's idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two types of power,</v>

951
00:41:36.411 --> 00:41:38.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the power that where you can't</v>

952
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.780
<v Speaker 1>stop staring at somebody because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have prestige and you want to be like</v>

953
00:41:41.781 --> 00:41:44.060
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a power that you can use for</v>

954
00:41:44.061 --> 00:41:45.680
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have all those eyeballs on you,</v>

955
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.850
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

956
00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:48.470
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're all looking at me and you</v>

957
00:41:48.471 --> 00:41:51.000
<v Speaker 1>do this all the time and how many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>love this?</v>

958
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:54.320
<v Speaker 1>How many people download this podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're very aware of the responsibility</v>

959
00:41:54.321 --> 00:41:55.910
<v Speaker 1>that comes with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you do two things.</v>

960
00:41:55.911 --> 00:41:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you try to keep it really honest and</v>
<v Speaker 1>true to yourself?</v>

961
00:41:58.671 --> 00:42:01.460
<v Speaker 1>But you also try to have really smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>people on who have different</v>

962
00:42:01.461 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 1>perspectives so you can kind of figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a way to get those ideas out into</v>

963
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:07.580
<v Speaker 1>people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one form of power that I would</v>

964
00:42:07.581 --> 00:42:09.050
<v Speaker 1>consider a positive use.</v>

965
00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the Russian model of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

966
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:13.490
<v Speaker 1>it's not power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's influence.</v>

967
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

968
00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.960
<v Speaker 1>I think they're very closely related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're joined at the hill.</v>

969
00:42:17.961 --> 00:42:19.610
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't control anyone.</v>

970
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference between like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>power that Putin has and the power that</v>

971
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.210
<v Speaker 1>the nerdist so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

972
00:42:26.211 --> 00:42:26.661
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

973
00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just use the word.</v>

974
00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:31.310
<v Speaker 1>So there's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's power that controls when</v>

975
00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:36.311
<v Speaker 1>there's power that inspires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think power that inspires is what</v>

976
00:42:36.801 --> 00:42:39.530
<v Speaker 1>this country needs to keep in mind at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all times.</v>

977
00:42:39.531 --> 00:42:41.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the power look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always need power,</v>

978
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:43.430
<v Speaker 1>you need guns and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're crazy people.</v>

979
00:42:43.431 --> 00:42:45.530
<v Speaker 1>You need a strong military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the difference is like is it</v>

980
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:48.920
<v Speaker 1>using a blanket statement like power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the board drugs,</v>

981
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.750
<v Speaker 1>like caffeine is drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was meth.</v>

982
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:53.930
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's power and then there's</v>

983
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.080
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's things that are powerful and</v>

984
00:42:57.081 --> 00:43:01.340
<v Speaker 1>then there's things that have power over</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and exactly like to control</v>

985
00:43:01.341 --> 00:43:03.500
<v Speaker 1>people like and then people can't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about it.</v>

986
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.000
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a difference.</v>

987
00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:06.470
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the word power,</v>

988
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:09.320
<v Speaker 1>the problem is the use of the word</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

989
00:43:09.321 --> 00:43:14.321
<v Speaker 1>I remember also mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that Russia and which is such</v>

990
00:43:14.721 --> 00:43:17.000
<v Speaker 1>an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with such an amazing group of people,</v>

991
00:43:17.001 --> 00:43:19.760
<v Speaker 1>they could do anything they wanted and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong culture,</v>

992
00:43:19.761 --> 00:43:22.070
<v Speaker 1>but I think the mindset of Russians in</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

993
00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:23.630
<v Speaker 1>in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not their fault,</v>

994
00:43:23.631 --> 00:43:27.770
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a product of their history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their mindset is that they admire the,</v>

995
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:32.890
<v Speaker 1>the first example of power control and</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and dominance more than they</v>

996
00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:38.750
<v Speaker 1>admire the power that influences and</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspires things that are powerful.</v>

997
00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:44.020
<v Speaker 1>So I like trump supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so they're polluting supporters.</v>

998
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.930
<v Speaker 1>They like a strong man at the helm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that trump like Putin and Putin</v>

999
00:43:47.931 --> 00:43:48.850
<v Speaker 1>likes trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1000
00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:50.210
<v Speaker 1>that sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1001
00:43:50.211 --> 00:43:51.290
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1002
00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1003
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:56.810
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been paying attention to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican national convention,</v>

1004
00:43:56.811 --> 00:43:59.450
<v Speaker 1>but shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Jamie did and I,</v>

1005
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.790
<v Speaker 1>but I am paying attention to the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is,</v>

1006
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:04.370
<v Speaker 1>this is what I like about all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1007
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.590
<v Speaker 1>What I like about all this trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsenses it's shown how vulnerable the</v>

1008
00:44:08.591 --> 00:44:13.591
<v Speaker 1>system is to fuckery that a madman and</v>
<v Speaker 1>come along and just take over the whole</v>

1009
00:44:14.721 --> 00:44:16.850
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see what his fucking biographer</v>

1010
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.070
<v Speaker 1>said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy,</v>

1011
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.790
<v Speaker 1>he had rosie for Morris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1012
00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Deep remorse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said that if Donald Trump becomes</v>

1013
00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:24.980
<v Speaker 1>president and it has the key to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear football,</v>

1014
00:44:24.981 --> 00:44:27.740
<v Speaker 1>he said he literally could be the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

1015
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.800
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book should have been titled and</v>

1016
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.680
<v Speaker 1>styled titled instead of the art of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal,</v>

1017
00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 1>should</v>

1018
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 2>have been titled the art of Sociopath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

1019
00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:35.781
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the,</v>

1020
00:44:35.781 --> 00:44:37.830
<v Speaker 2>the words of a sociopath or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>along those lines.</v>

1021
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.740
<v Speaker 2>But his take on trump is that he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>total sociopath.</v>

1022
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Not Surprising to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1023
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.810
<v Speaker 2>he's certainly a narcissist and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the same thing in some ways,</v>

1024
00:44:45.811 --> 00:44:46.410
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1025
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:47.360
<v Speaker 2>my wife though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1026
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:49.770
<v Speaker 2>he's got a hot wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always bringing things back to</v>

1027
00:44:49.771 --> 00:44:54.750
<v Speaker 2>himself and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just lies at his convenience.</v>

1028
00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable.</v>

1029
00:44:56.190 --> 00:45:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that he's been sued?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like 3,500 times?</v>

1030
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 2>I believe that when you have a huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

1031
00:45:02.401 --> 00:45:03.810
<v Speaker 2>that happens a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1032
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.110
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not as surprising to me.</v>

1033
00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:09.160
<v Speaker 2>What my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by waiters and stuff.</v>

1034
00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1035
00:45:10.261 --> 00:45:11.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his creditors,</v>

1036
00:45:11.371 --> 00:45:12.900
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that invested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1037
00:45:12.901 --> 00:45:14.850
<v Speaker 2>people that did work for him never got</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid.</v>

1038
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.320
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the companies that he started a</v>
<v Speaker 2>went bankrupt.</v>

1039
00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about how the university,</v>

1040
00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:22.141
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1041
00:45:22.141 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 2>we talk about him being this great</v>
<v Speaker 2>businessman.</v>

1042
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that we have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>

1043
00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:29.130
<v Speaker 2>He's done a good job creating a brand</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's worth something.</v>

1044
00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:32.820
<v Speaker 2>So if you put it on a hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes with in your mind,</v>

1045
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think of high quality prestige plus,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1048
00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:40.530
<v Speaker 2>or if he has a building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the trump tower.</v>

1049
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Also interesting that he took the name</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump because like I believe trump card,</v>

1050
00:45:46.231 --> 00:45:51.231
<v Speaker 2>that expression trump card was there</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the name trump because his last</v>

1051
00:45:51.631 --> 00:45:52.880
<v Speaker 2>name is drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1052
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:55.560
<v Speaker 2>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his actual last name that I saw.</v>

1053
00:45:55.561 --> 00:45:56.790
<v Speaker 2>John all ever her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk about that.</v>

1054
00:45:56.791 --> 00:45:58.200
<v Speaker 2>It's real nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's nothing wrong with that</v>

1055
00:45:58.201 --> 00:45:59.280
<v Speaker 2>named [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1056
00:45:59.281 --> 00:46:01.560
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arnold Schwarzenegger became famous as</v>

1057
00:46:01.561 --> 00:46:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Arnold Swartz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nigger.</v>

1058
00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got the goofy,</v>

1059
00:46:04.081 --> 00:46:07.020
<v Speaker 2>his fucking name ever and he smashed it</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that name in America.</v>

1060
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.790
<v Speaker 2>You can get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why couldn't you be drunk?</v>

1061
00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:12.090
<v Speaker 2>I did the wrong with drum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember it doesn't mean anything.</v>

1062
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:17.120
<v Speaker 2>I remember being amazed that the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States voted a man by the name of Barack</v>

1063
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Hussein Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when we are public enemy number one</v>

1064
00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:21.750
<v Speaker 2>was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1065
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Osama bin Ladin so phonetically they</v>

1066
00:46:24.541 --> 00:46:25.830
<v Speaker 2>sound very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1067
00:46:25.831 --> 00:46:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Well how about who's sane when we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>also Emma enemies with [inaudible]</v>

1068
00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:30.840
<v Speaker 2>saying exact crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:34.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had a goofy ass fucking name</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a guy to be elected president,</v>

1070
00:46:34.021 --> 00:46:35.640
<v Speaker 2>but that's why I give Americans a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>

1071
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.320
<v Speaker 2>I think Americans are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1072
00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you listened to European stock,</v>

1073
00:46:39.181 --> 00:46:41.730
<v Speaker 2>but they're always marveling at how</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote dumb Americans are.</v>

1074
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Americans are dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think Americans and a lot of ways</v>

1075
00:46:44.381 --> 00:46:46.200
<v Speaker 2>they're very fair minded too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1076
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:48.450
<v Speaker 2>there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also the fact that there's a</v>

1077
00:46:48.451 --> 00:46:50.790
<v Speaker 2>two party system where if you are on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

1078
00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:52.500
<v Speaker 2>you have to support whoever's on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

1079
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:56.850
<v Speaker 2>That's why all these people lining up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>support Hillary Clinton and ignoring</v>

1080
00:46:56.851 --> 00:47:00.000
<v Speaker 2>left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the crazy evidence against her just</v>

1081
00:47:00.001 --> 00:47:02.250
<v Speaker 2>being completely full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's corrupt.</v>

1082
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.390
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

1083
00:47:03.391 --> 00:47:06.180
<v Speaker 2>We played this video the other day where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were showing the differences</v>

1084
00:47:06.181 --> 00:47:09.480
<v Speaker 2>between with the FBI has said about her</v>
<v Speaker 2>trial,</v>

1085
00:47:09.481 --> 00:47:13.710
<v Speaker 2>about them looking into the email</v>
<v Speaker 2>server,</v>

1086
00:47:13.711 --> 00:47:18.660
<v Speaker 2>the illegal use of email server.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that top secret documents were</v>

1087
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:23.661
<v Speaker 2>shared cut and pasted and shared with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that did not have the status to</v>

1088
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:27.900
<v Speaker 2>be able to check those and that multiple</v>
<v Speaker 2>devices were used to access these and</v>

1089
00:47:27.901 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 2>then compare them to what she has</v>

1090
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.260
<v Speaker 1>said about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just a liar.</v>

1091
00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:34.030
<v Speaker 1>She's a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a liar.</v>

1092
00:47:34.031 --> 00:47:35.000
<v Speaker 1>She's a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1093
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:37.570
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think she set that server up</v>

1094
00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:39.670
<v Speaker 1>in our bathroom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the benefit of that do you</v>

1095
00:47:39.671 --> 00:47:41.740
<v Speaker 1>think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows?</v>

1096
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.500
<v Speaker 1>What's it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just convenience and what she told to do</v>

1097
00:47:44.501 --> 00:47:45.790
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be that.</v>

1098
00:47:45.791 --> 00:47:49.810
<v Speaker 1>It could be that she just didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody to have any oversight over her</v>

1099
00:47:49.811 --> 00:47:52.150
<v Speaker 1>email and she wanted to have a server in</v>
<v Speaker 1>her home.</v>

1100
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she deleted a lot of fucking emails,</v>

1101
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:58.360
<v Speaker 1>thousands of emails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not supposed to do that.</v>

1102
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a part of that Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of that Gig is transparency.</v>

1103
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.670
<v Speaker 1>She skirted around that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had Mike Baker in here from the CIA,</v>

1104
00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:10.510
<v Speaker 1>a former CIA operative who said flat out</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he had done the same thing,</v>

1105
00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:12.210
<v Speaker 1>he was how he says what he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1106
00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I would be in jail now he'd be in jail.</v>

1107
00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:17.350
<v Speaker 1>And he was discussing how this is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>not done and everyone knows this.</v>

1108
00:48:17.351 --> 00:48:19.300
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a woman who just stepped into</v>

1109
00:48:19.301 --> 00:48:21.670
<v Speaker 1>politics for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is someone who's been involved in</v>

1110
00:48:21.671 --> 00:48:25.270
<v Speaker 1>politics virtually your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a good article.</v>

1111
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Somebody sent me and I'll send it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1112
00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what the magazine was</v>

1113
00:48:28.361 --> 00:48:30.340
<v Speaker 1>credible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a credible magazine and the journalist,</v>

1114
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:31.721
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1115
00:48:31.721 --> 00:48:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I have my point of view on Hillary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>

1116
00:48:33.761 --> 00:48:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I left leaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's probably more of a</v>

1117
00:48:35.801 --> 00:48:36.970
<v Speaker 1>conservative columnists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1118
00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:41.350
<v Speaker 1>and he went and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he interviewed all the people that have</v>

1119
00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:43.870
<v Speaker 1>worked with Hillary Clinton for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1120
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:44.711
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1121
00:48:44.711 --> 00:48:48.010
<v Speaker 1>and even her opponents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was really,</v>

1122
00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.290
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting to get the</v>

1123
00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:51.220
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1124
00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.130
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that they talk about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

1125
00:48:54.131 --> 00:48:56.620
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't feel very comfortable in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of,</v>

1126
00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not a natural fit for her to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of audiences talking.</v>

1127
00:49:00.401 --> 00:49:02.020
<v Speaker 1>But Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's such a great speaker.</v>

1128
00:49:02.021 --> 00:49:02.854
<v Speaker 1>She's a great speaker.</v>

1129
00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I think her voice is very grounded and</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong like this.</v>

1130
00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:12.110
<v Speaker 1>It's boxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they all bought it.</v>

1131
00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.700
<v Speaker 1>They didn't use words like they consider</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to be funny,</v>

1132
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.700
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and very intelligent.</v>

1133
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1134
00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:21.550
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was an interesting eye.</v>

1135
00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.870
<v Speaker 1>My eyes were a little bit over and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1136
00:49:22.871 --> 00:49:24.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are close to it,</v>

1137
00:49:24.221 --> 00:49:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I've worked with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had more favorable things to say,</v>

1138
00:49:28.151 --> 00:49:30.790
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not a hillary supporter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had more favorable than</v>

1139
00:49:30.791 --> 00:49:32.650
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was pretty interesting</v>

1140
00:49:32.651 --> 00:49:34.990
<v Speaker 1>because I'd never thought of actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewing people that have worked</v>

1141
00:49:34.991 --> 00:49:36.040
<v Speaker 1>closely with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1142
00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Stop right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are political people.</v>

1143
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:41.560
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about what their job is,</v>

1144
00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:43.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they do for a living and how to</v>

1145
00:49:43.301 --> 00:49:46.300
<v Speaker 1>make it in that world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be full of Shit and you have</v>

1146
00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:47.220
<v Speaker 1>to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1147

<v Speaker 1>something bad about somebody else cause</v>

1148
00:49:49.931 --> 00:49:51.470

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Those girls are so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're such strong women.</v>

1155
00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:04.390
<v Speaker 1>It's my new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1156
00:50:04.391 --> 00:50:06.160
<v Speaker 1>My new thing is the empowerment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

1157
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:09.130
<v Speaker 1>I love this new talk that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not new either.</v>

1158
00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's totally empowered.</v>

1159
00:50:10.691 --> 00:50:12.820
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's totally embraced her new hoodie.</v>

1160
00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's bending over,</v>

1161
00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:17.560
<v Speaker 1>arching her back and licking her lips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She saw power.</v>

1162
00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:21.130
<v Speaker 1>She's brave because she's naked and fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's so brave.</v>

1163
00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.120
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she was brave,</v>

1164
00:50:25.121 --> 00:50:27.440
<v Speaker 1>she'd get up at four o'clock in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and hit the gym before she went</v>

1165
00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 1>to the set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wouldn't</v>

1166
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.040
<v Speaker 2>be fat anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell her what's period that Melissa</v>

1167
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.260
<v Speaker 2>McCarthy woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're angry that she's losing weight</v>

1168
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.850
<v Speaker 2>to understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

1169
00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.460
<v Speaker 2>They're angry that she's choosing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>become healthy.</v>

1170
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:41.210
<v Speaker 2>So they're saying this is in direct</v>
<v Speaker 2>contrast to who she was before,</v>

1171
00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:46.050
<v Speaker 2>who we loved is this fucking cartoonish</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat lady and this cartoonish fat laid</v>

1172
00:50:46.051 --> 00:50:47.970
<v Speaker 2>who we want to pretend is healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1173
00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:50.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a fucking slew of people out</v>

1174
00:50:50.061 --> 00:50:54.830
<v Speaker 2>there that have blogs out there talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about different things that are healthy</v>

1175
00:50:54.831 --> 00:50:58.040
<v Speaker 2>about being fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went down a rabbit hole one night</v>

1176
00:50:58.041 --> 00:51:00.620
<v Speaker 2>because some woman was writing shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this obese woman.</v>

1177
00:51:00.621 --> 00:51:03.110
<v Speaker 2>And I was really sad when I was looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at her photos.</v>

1178
00:51:03.111 --> 00:51:05.990
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like to highlight things that</v>

1179
00:51:05.991 --> 00:51:08.570
<v Speaker 2>people say about them on social media</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1180
00:51:08.571 --> 00:51:09.021
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1181
00:51:09.021 --> 00:51:11.090
<v Speaker 2>all these people are harassing her for</v>
<v Speaker 2>being fat,</v>

1182
00:51:11.091 --> 00:51:12.920
<v Speaker 2>but she putting out a blog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1183
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.170
<v Speaker 2>When you putting yourself out there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you putting a blog,</v>

1184
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.180
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put some honey out there,</v>

1185
00:51:17.181 --> 00:51:18.420
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna attract a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bugs.</v>

1186
00:51:18.421 --> 00:51:19.910
<v Speaker 2>It's just no way around that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1187
00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:25.180
<v Speaker 2>But she was talking about different</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of being overweight that are</v>

1188
00:51:25.611 --> 00:51:30.500
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is one weird phenomenon where</v>

1189
00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:35.560
<v Speaker 2>healthy people that catch a disease</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes don't do as well as fat people</v>

1190
00:51:37.911 --> 00:51:40.280
<v Speaker 2>that have the same disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the old days they said you should</v>

1191
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:43.310
<v Speaker 2>have some weight on you in case you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>a disease and you can fight it better.</v>

1192
00:51:43.311 --> 00:51:44.900
<v Speaker 2>That was always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that,</v>

1193
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:46.670
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could that be true?</v>

1194
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.100
<v Speaker 2>I guess because maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just,</v>

1195
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:53.000
<v Speaker 2>this is bro Science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from what I remember reading your</v>

1196
00:51:53.001 --> 00:51:57.320
<v Speaker 2>fat can actually absorb or store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1197
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:58.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

1198
00:51:58.281 --> 00:51:59.300
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where you have,</v>

1199
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.330
<v Speaker 2>you have reserves when you're not eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff at you,</v>

1200
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:04.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body will use the fatty acids for</v>

1201
00:52:04.401 --> 00:52:05.960
<v Speaker 2>energy was that makes sense.</v>

1202
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.650
<v Speaker 2>So your body gets into a state of</v>
<v Speaker 2>burning fat rather than burning food.</v>

1203
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:13.040
<v Speaker 2>And many times when people are sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge issue.</v>

1204
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:17.060
<v Speaker 2>Coming up with some form of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Italian relatives,</v>

1205
00:52:17.061 --> 00:52:19.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>th the Sicilian side back in the day,</v>

1206
00:52:19.521 --> 00:52:21.950
<v Speaker 2>I remember if somebody was too skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look,</v>

1207
00:52:21.951 --> 00:52:23.450
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would say,</v>

1208
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be careful.</v>

1209
00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:25.820
<v Speaker 2>You get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1210
00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 2>you'll die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or was it totally makes sense,</v>

1211
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:30.230
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean it's healthy to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>

1212
00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.560
<v Speaker 2>but it just means it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a reserve policy in case you get a</v>

1213
00:52:33.561 --> 00:52:37.520
<v Speaker 2>fucking catastrophic disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also more likely to get that</v>

1214
00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:39.590
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic disease if you're fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:43.250
<v Speaker 2>So she's such a catch 22,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this book by Gary Taubes,</v>

1216
00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:45.950
<v Speaker 2>I just love called why we get fat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do about it.</v>

1217
00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.550
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he traces the genealogy of the obesity</v>

1218
00:52:49.551 --> 00:52:54.350
<v Speaker 2>epidemic and he goes all the way back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 30s in New York City and he looks at</v>

1219
00:52:54.351 --> 00:52:59.210
<v Speaker 2>how ineffective all these obesity</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinics and even the science of obesity</v>

1220
00:52:59.211 --> 00:52:59.960
<v Speaker 2>has been.</v>

1221
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.990
<v Speaker 2>It's been so difficult because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>times they treated it like it was a</v>

1222
00:53:02.991 --> 00:53:04.970
<v Speaker 2>psychological disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you eat too much,</v>

1223
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:07.340
<v Speaker 2>so you'd go to a psychiatrist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1224
00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.980
<v Speaker 2>or they would put you on these very</v>
<v Speaker 2>restrictive diets,</v>

1225
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:12.560
<v Speaker 2>1200 calories a day and you would lose</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>

1226
00:53:12.561 --> 00:53:13.760
<v Speaker 2>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you descend,</v>

1227
00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:17.030
<v Speaker 2>but also your body gets into this state</v>
<v Speaker 2>of panic.</v>

1228
00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tries to store energy.</v>

1229
00:53:18.741 --> 00:53:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really quickly because it's worried that</v>

1230
00:53:20.541 --> 00:53:21.680
<v Speaker 2>you're in a famine state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1231
00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:24.800
<v Speaker 2>So what he traces in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he looks at the native Americans</v>

1232
00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 2>that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to sort of</v>

1233
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on government rations when their</v>

1234
00:53:28.051 --> 00:53:30.810
<v Speaker 1>land was taken and they all blew up like</v>
<v Speaker 1>balloons because they were given white</v>

1235
00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:31.980
<v Speaker 1>flour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

1236
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:36.600
<v Speaker 1>the thesis of the book is essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you eat simple carbohydrates</v>

1237
00:53:36.601 --> 00:53:39.780
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially things like white flour and</v>

1238
00:53:39.781 --> 00:53:42.270
<v Speaker 1>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body produces a lot of insulin.</v>

1239
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:44.910
<v Speaker 1>And for a whole bunch of metal metabolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>

1240
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:49.740
<v Speaker 1>it's insulin that causes you to retain</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat molecules and need more sugar for</v>

1241
00:53:49.741 --> 00:53:51.840
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he does a really great job in the</v>

1242
00:53:51.841 --> 00:53:53.130
<v Speaker 1>buffet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a book of explaining it.</v>

1243
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that sort of,</v>

1244
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:58.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1245
00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:00.870
<v Speaker 1>when you look at it that way and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the fact that it's just a</v>

1246
00:54:00.871 --> 00:54:03.450
<v Speaker 1>question of changing what you put into</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>

1247
00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:04.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1248
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:07.650
<v Speaker 1>you will then eventually at this Keto</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diet,</v>

1249
00:54:07.651 --> 00:54:10.200
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really good way to lose weight</v>

1250
00:54:10.201 --> 00:54:11.970
<v Speaker 1>and not have to restrict your calories.</v>

1251
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:14.310
<v Speaker 1>It just is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's for everybody.</v>

1252
00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a single die that's for</v>

1253
00:54:16.621 --> 00:54:17.790
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't either.</v>

1254
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those bodies are differently.</v>

1255
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Obviously people have different</v>
<v Speaker 1>allergies to foods like or allergies,</v>

1256
00:54:23.011 --> 00:54:24.260
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1257
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:26.250
<v Speaker 1>that's a great indication that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1258
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:31.170
<v Speaker 1>there's so much biological diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many people have genetics that have</v>

1259
00:54:31.171 --> 00:54:33.270
<v Speaker 1>come from all sorts of different parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>

1260
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.720
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different environments that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we evolve from.</v>

1261
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:41.790
<v Speaker 1>There's no one single dime for obesity</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fairly recent only because when</v>

1262
00:54:41.791 --> 00:54:46.740
<v Speaker 1>people started eating that much sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know the think that's universal,</v>

1263
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's nothing wrong with eating a</v>

1264
00:54:48.871 --> 00:54:51.030
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of carbs and breads and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pastas,</v>

1265
00:54:51.031 --> 00:54:54.540
<v Speaker 1>but it is universal that massive amounts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sugar bad for you.</v>

1266
00:54:54.541 --> 00:54:56.300
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any question any</v>

1267
00:54:56.301 --> 00:54:58.340
<v Speaker 1>more scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things,</v>

1268
00:54:58.341 --> 00:55:01.260
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for a very fat people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obese people who have trouble with this,</v>

1269
00:55:01.261 --> 00:55:05.620
<v Speaker 1>who may have gotten caught into that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern as kids at or they have.</v>

1270
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's very true that some people</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically do put weight on.</v>

1271
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.860
<v Speaker 1>They don't process carbs the way other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do.</v>

1272
00:55:10.861 --> 00:55:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Like I can eat carbs all day and stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>very thin.</v>

1273
00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Some people just can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a long time,</v>

1274
00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:17.700
<v Speaker 1>very active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very active,</v>

1275
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:21.060
<v Speaker 1>but for a long time what I'm saying is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's always been instilled as a</v>

1276
00:55:21.061 --> 00:55:22.830
<v Speaker 1>stigma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your fat,</v>

1277
00:55:22.831 --> 00:55:27.560
<v Speaker 1>which means you are a of weak character</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you have a faulty character you're</v>

1278
00:55:27.561 --> 00:55:29.250
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why they take so much shit.</v>

1279
00:55:29.251 --> 00:55:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Gary Tab and his books had a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it was just the fact that people</v>

1280
00:55:32.611 --> 00:55:37.080
<v Speaker 1>didn't know how the body worked and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of this information came out in</v>

1281
00:55:37.081 --> 00:55:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Germany before the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were these Austrian and German</v>

1282
00:55:39.901 --> 00:55:43.860
<v Speaker 1>scientists that we're really closing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what insulin does to make you gain</v>

1283
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:44.880
<v Speaker 1>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>

1284
00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.450
<v Speaker 1>When the war was over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no American scientists,</v>

1285
00:55:48.451 --> 00:55:50.330
<v Speaker 1>we're going to use German data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1286
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:51.420
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1287
00:55:51.421 --> 00:55:53.910
<v Speaker 1>we'll come up with our own data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We use the rocket data.</v>

1288
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:58.230
<v Speaker 1>We did use their rocket fucking scooped</v>
<v Speaker 1>up all their operation paperclip.</v>

1289
00:55:58.231 --> 00:56:02.080
<v Speaker 1>We scooped up all their fucking rocket</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists and made them Americans.</v>

1290
00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:06.600
<v Speaker 1>There is a fucking thing about Wernher</v>
<v Speaker 1>von Braun being a great American and</v>

1291
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:08.490
<v Speaker 1>like Wernher von Braun was a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi.</v>

1292
00:56:08.491 --> 00:56:13.491
<v Speaker 1>The guy who ran the NASA space program</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a straight up Nazi who the Simon</v>

1293
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Wiesenthal Center said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he was alive today,</v>

1294
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:19.550
<v Speaker 1>they would prosecute him for crimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>against humanity.</v>

1295
00:56:19.551 --> 00:56:20.384
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

1296
00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:24.280
<v Speaker 1>They hung the five slowest workers every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day at his fucking</v>

1297
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.440
<v Speaker 2>rocket factory in Berlin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweet guys.</v>

1298
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.470
<v Speaker 2>They've hung Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hung them in the front of the</v>

1299
00:56:29.471 --> 00:56:32.260
<v Speaker 2>fucking rocket factory to encourage the</v>
<v Speaker 2>workers to work faster.</v>

1300
00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:33.970
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sit by the way,</v>

1301
00:56:33.971 --> 00:56:36.340
<v Speaker 2>coming directly from people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>still alive,</v>

1302
00:56:36.341 --> 00:56:39.190
<v Speaker 2>who worked in that factory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe with tattoos on their arm.</v>

1303
00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:40.740
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a,</v>

1304
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:42.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think that's a point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>conjecture.</v>

1305
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Brazy is it that we just scooped up all</v>
<v Speaker 2>those monsters and they can.</v>

1306
00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:50.630
<v Speaker 2>We all scooped out good at fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting Middle Dixon to the sky,</v>

1307
00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:53.410
<v Speaker 2>so let's come over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also,</v>

1308
00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:58.210
<v Speaker 2>but we also scooped up a lot of a German</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Austrian Jewish scientists because</v>

1309
00:56:58.211 --> 00:56:59.470
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1310
00:56:59.471 --> 00:57:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Einstein I believe emigrated after a</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of,</v>

1311
00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:06.010
<v Speaker 2>or that thing was two scientists who</v>
<v Speaker 2>were Jewish were assassinated,</v>

1312
00:57:06.011 --> 00:57:07.180
<v Speaker 2>was shot on the street.</v>

1313
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.480
<v Speaker 2>And so all of these like brilliant</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish,</v>

1314
00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:12.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists said,</v>

1315
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:15.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get the fuck outta here and go to</v>

1316
00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:20.400
<v Speaker 2>the UK and go to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will tragedy of Fritz Harbor,</v>

1317
00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:24.160
<v Speaker 2>the harbor method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The [inaudible] method is incredible</v>

1318
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:27.100
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy figured out a way to extract</v>

1319
00:57:27.101 --> 00:57:29.350
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen from the air and it's one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1320
00:57:29.351 --> 00:57:34.351
<v Speaker 2>they say today that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a fantastic radio lab podcast on</v>

1321
00:57:34.541 --> 00:57:37.600
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called the bad show.</v>

1322
00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:40.210
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it's called because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1323
00:57:40.211 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 2>they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did a good show in a bad show.</v>

1324
00:57:42.371 --> 00:57:44.500
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And would they just showed is that</v>

1325
00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:46.120
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>

1326
00:57:46.121 --> 00:57:49.330
<v Speaker 2>we've all known this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so sometimes people that have done</v>

1327
00:57:49.331 --> 00:57:52.060
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible things are also amazing.</v>

1328
00:57:52.061 --> 00:57:53.860
<v Speaker 2>It's something that benefits a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>

1329
00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:57.730
<v Speaker 2>And this is one of the classic example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fritz harbor figured out this way to</v>

1330
00:57:57.731 --> 00:58:02.620
<v Speaker 2>extract nitrogen from the air and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen in our bodies today.</v>

1331
00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:05.620
<v Speaker 2>They estimate that some 50 in nitrogen</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1332
00:58:05.621 --> 00:58:08.110
<v Speaker 2>they use it for his fertilizer and for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the longest pneumonia.</v>

1333
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:08.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1334
00:58:08.921 --> 00:58:12.070
<v Speaker 2>For the longest time they used to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get like dead fish or mulch or</v>

1335
00:58:12.071 --> 00:58:13.240
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Compost.</v>

1336
00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:15.070
<v Speaker 2>And then the fact that Bat Guano,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1337
00:58:15.071 --> 00:58:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Back when I was a big one literally bat</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit crazy was like because people would</v>

1338
00:58:19.721 --> 00:58:21.520
<v Speaker 2>have wars over a bat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

1339
00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:24.670
<v Speaker 2>it's nuts that I didn't know that but I</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly,</v>

1340
00:58:24.671 --> 00:58:25.481
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

1341
00:58:25.481 --> 00:58:29.830
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking wars over bat shit like</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that's how you grow your food is</v>

1342
00:58:29.831 --> 00:58:31.540
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would starve during the winter</v>

1343
00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:34.480
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't know how to get that</v>
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen into the soil.</v>

1344
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:39.720
<v Speaker 2>And Fritz harbor is literally credited</v>
<v Speaker 2>with stopping mass scale starvation.</v>

1345
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:43.400
<v Speaker 2>But then there's the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other side.</v>

1346
00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Well they said that today the nitrogen</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our bodies,</v>

1347
00:58:46.541 --> 00:58:48.820
<v Speaker 2>50% of it came from the hopper method.</v>

1348
00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Degas though all the people today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally he's responsible for a</v>

1349
00:58:52.331 --> 00:58:55.150
<v Speaker 2>massive increase in the population of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this world.</v>

1350
00:58:55.690 --> 00:59:00.580
<v Speaker 2>But he also was the guy that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>used gas in war for the first time.</v>

1351
00:59:00.581 --> 00:59:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he personally oversaw it,</v>

1352
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.740
<v Speaker 2>he went to the front lines and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>started with,</v>

1353
00:59:05.741 --> 00:59:06.574
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started with a p,</v>

1354
00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.290
<v Speaker 2>he was working on insecticides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1355
00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is by the way,</v>

1356
00:59:09.641 --> 00:59:12.580
<v Speaker 2>is what Zyklon B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was used to gas,</v>

1357
00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:14.250
<v Speaker 2>the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came up with Xy,</v>

1358
00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:18.000
<v Speaker 2>clown eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psych on a had a smell it to it so that</v>

1359
00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:20.770
<v Speaker 2>you could know what it was and get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck away from it.</v>

1360
00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Whereas B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis</v>

1361
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.460
<v Speaker 1>extracted the smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He will harbor was at ju.</v>

1362
00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:30.110
<v Speaker 1>So what a fucking crazy conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy found himself where his own</v>

1363
00:59:30.111 --> 00:59:34.370
<v Speaker 1>relatives died directly from an</v>
<v Speaker 1>invention that he creates.</v>

1364
00:59:34.371 --> 00:59:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know also if you,</v>

1365
00:59:36.681 --> 00:59:40.280
<v Speaker 1>if you take a sympathetic approach to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>man who was a patriot,</v>

1366
00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.980
<v Speaker 1>he was a patriot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His country was at war.</v>

1367
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:47.120
<v Speaker 1>He had benefited from this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a legacy in this country.</v>

1368
00:59:47.121 --> 00:59:51.380
<v Speaker 1>He had standing in this country and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>country was under direct threat.</v>

1369
00:59:51.381 --> 00:59:54.740
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I know a way to help this war</v>

1370
00:59:54.741 --> 00:59:57.410
<v Speaker 1>effort so we can stop the enemy and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1371
00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.690
<v Speaker 1>we should all again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not what you think.</v>

1372
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:03.020
<v Speaker 1>It's how you think we should all put</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in his shoes.</v>

1373
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:04.880
<v Speaker 1>If I had a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>

1374
01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm right about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had a way as an American is Brian</v>

1375
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Count to save my country from people I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought were going to actually take it</v>

1376
01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:15.590
<v Speaker 1>over our kill a bunch of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including my family.</v>

1377
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to gas the fuck out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can invent a technique,</v>

1378
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to gas them and I'm gonna come</v>
<v Speaker 1>up a way to shoot a rocket.</v>

1379
01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so,</v>

1380
01:00:24.411 --> 01:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>if that makes me a bad person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call me Fritz slow.</v>

1381
01:00:26.781 --> 01:00:31.781
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy though that this guy was</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally receiving the Nobel Prize for</v>

1382
01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:36.800
<v Speaker 1>the harbor method at the same time for</v>
<v Speaker 1>being wanted for crimes against humanity</v>

1383
01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>for war criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the same people that want to try him</v>

1384
01:00:41.241 --> 01:00:46.241
<v Speaker 1>for war crimes dropped nuclear fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs on two cities in Japan.</v>

1385
01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Like what is a war crime?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're killing people,</v>

1386
01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:51.261
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1387
01:00:51.261 --> 01:00:53.870
<v Speaker 1>you killed people the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we have rules,</v>

1388
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>can't kill her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

1389
01:00:54.781 --> 01:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>there's lemay who oversaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

1390
01:00:56.931 --> 01:00:59.840
<v Speaker 1>the bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the firebombing of Tokyo.</v>

1391
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1392
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:02.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>December before the,</v>

1393
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>the Hiroshima Nagasaki bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the fire bombs,</v>

1394
01:01:06.951 --> 01:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed more people,</v>

1395
01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.590
<v Speaker 1>did more distraught.</v>

1396
01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody concentrates on the D two</v>

1397
01:01:11.961 --> 01:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hiroshima,</v>

1398
01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Nagasaki firebombing was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1399
01:01:15.381 --> 01:01:17.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we did to Dresden,</v>

1400
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.510
<v Speaker 1>what we did to the allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really it was the British and the</v>

1401
01:01:20.511 --> 01:01:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1402
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean dressing looks like the surface</v>

1403
01:01:23.331 --> 01:01:24.830
<v Speaker 1>of the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1404
01:01:24.831 --> 01:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1405
01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Kurt Vonnegut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the book a slaughterhouse</v>

1406
01:01:27.891 --> 01:01:30.470
<v Speaker 1>five talks about this and the vivid</v>
<v Speaker 1>detail,</v>

1407
01:01:30.471 --> 01:01:35.330
<v Speaker 1>but look at just youtube dresden before</v>
<v Speaker 1>and after Jimmy bring up Dresden,</v>

1408
01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before Jimmy,</v>

1409
01:01:36.681 --> 01:01:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I said Jimmy said Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1410
01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Dresden before and after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>firebombing.</v>

1411
01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:42.980
<v Speaker 1>But Curtis Lemay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in a period of eight days in</v>

1412
01:01:42.981 --> 01:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo eight and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 1 million people died from fire and</v>

1413
01:01:46.671 --> 01:01:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Curtis Lemay said business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wars the business of killing people.</v>

1414
01:01:50.211 --> 01:01:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And if I had been on the losing side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably be tried as a war criminal,</v>

1415
01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>and if you see Curtis Lemay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's always chewing on a cigar and he</v>

1416
01:01:57.291 --> 01:02:01.250
<v Speaker 1>was the commander and he was the one who</v>
<v Speaker 1>made those decisions and they said,</v>

1417
01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:02.660
<v Speaker 1>we're going to punish the German</v>
<v Speaker 1>workers.</v>

1418
01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:05.240
<v Speaker 1>They're real pictures though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at what is this?</v>

1419
01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.590
<v Speaker 1>This?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like Dresden.</v>

1420
01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Dresden was a jewel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a jewel and there's an beautiful</v>

1421
01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the surface of the fucking moon.</v>

1422
01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.960
<v Speaker 1>You'll see they have videos of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Jamie,</v>

1423
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>this all this is before and after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>allied bombing.</v>

1424
01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just pictures.</v>

1425
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find some photos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some actual photo.</v>

1426
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Dresden Ruins after the allied</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombing.</v>

1427
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is drawing worse in that</v>

1428
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:32.671
<v Speaker 1>photograph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1429
01:02:32.671 --> 01:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>that's a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1430
01:02:33.901 --> 01:02:35.230
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's a photo.</v>

1431
01:02:35.290 --> 01:02:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like,</v>

1432
01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it,</v>

1433
01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then any time they talk about the</v>

1434
01:02:40.441 --> 01:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>survivors who were just walking around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city that had been standing for 700</v>

1435
01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>years or something crazy and it was no</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer,</v>

1436
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.660
<v Speaker 1>how would the neighbor have survived</v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

1437
01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:50.340
<v Speaker 1>They didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1438
01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>people were falling over and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1439
01:02:52.021 --> 01:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Those are bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were falling down.</v>

1440
01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were falling down because the</v>

1441
01:02:57.871 --> 01:03:00.450
<v Speaker 1>oxygen was sucked out of the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd be,</v>

1442
01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:03.450
<v Speaker 1>you'd be on the street and you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would just fall down because there</v>

1443
01:03:03.451 --> 01:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>was no air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1444
01:03:04.361 --> 01:03:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Or there'd be a bomb and the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>would open their shutters and stick</v>

1445
01:03:06.871 --> 01:03:09.180
<v Speaker 1>their head out and the aftershock would</v>
<v Speaker 1>take their heads off.</v>

1446
01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're very lucky.</v>

1447
01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Very lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't live at this time.</v>

1448
01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.180
<v Speaker 1>She very left Bryce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking strange thing.</v>

1449
01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:21.960
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] was an apocalypse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giant scale war is like that.</v>

1450
01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:23.070
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Europe,</v>

1451
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.660
<v Speaker 1>what was it a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it a 50 million people at the end of</v>

1452
01:03:27.661 --> 01:03:30.630
<v Speaker 1>World War II that were dead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe as many as 80 million.</v>

1453
01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Put that into context and that from</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ashes from these experiments like</v>

1454
01:03:36.151 --> 01:03:41.151
<v Speaker 1>fascism and the idea that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect human beings and perfect society</v>

1455
01:03:41.941 --> 01:03:46.410
<v Speaker 1>and create utopias from those</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments came,</v>

1456
01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:49.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ash and 80 million graves.</v>

1457
01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.350
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and from that came right Kinda Sorta,</v>

1458
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea like if you just wanted to</v>

1459
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:58.620
<v Speaker 1>improve upon human beings without</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing people that you thought were</v>

1460
01:03:58.621 --> 01:04:01.260
<v Speaker 1>inferior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just wanted to create the uber</v>

1461
01:04:01.261 --> 01:04:06.190
<v Speaker 1>manch without making everybody else die</v>
<v Speaker 1>without you.</v>

1462
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:10.260
<v Speaker 1>But you need to reeducate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So reeducation camps that Pol Pot would</v>

1463
01:04:10.261 --> 01:04:12.960
<v Speaker 1>put people in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to be marched to the countryside</v>

1464
01:04:12.961 --> 01:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>because he was creating a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you an agrarian utopia.</v>

1465
01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:17.430
<v Speaker 1>But why does it always have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1466
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Why does any beneficial act like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of creating better people?</v>

1467
01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Like we would all like a better society</v>
<v Speaker 1>with better people.</v>

1468
01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we all had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world where everybody had perfect</v>

1469
01:04:27.361 --> 01:04:29.190
<v Speaker 1>genetics and nobody had to worry about</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat shaming,</v>

1470
01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:31.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nobody had to worry about not being</v>

1471
01:04:31.741 --> 01:04:32.840
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody helped.</v>

1472
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.320
<v Speaker 1>But that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is like the stress and</v>

1473
01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>the anxiety of being a dork and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1474
01:04:40.811 --> 01:04:42.780
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stress of being bullied.</v>

1475
01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:47.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's where diamonds come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not good to someone.</v>

1476
01:04:48.211 --> 01:04:51.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not good to take advantage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

1477
01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:55.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not good to make someone's life</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

1478
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:57.960
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of times that's where you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Marvin Gaye.</v>

1479
01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.041
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1480
01:04:59.041 --> 01:05:01.200
<v Speaker 1>you get these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these jewels of art.</v>

1481
01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1482
01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.060
<v Speaker 1>you get these people that come out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these horrible environments and they</v>

1483
01:05:06.061 --> 01:05:08.760
<v Speaker 1>have this power to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to create,</v>

1484
01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:09.631
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

1485
01:05:09.631 --> 01:05:12.540
<v Speaker 1>You still have to create some respite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1486
01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:13.920
<v Speaker 1>that the great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest,</v>

1487
01:05:13.921 --> 01:05:18.240
<v Speaker 1>the Great Matthew Arnold who said that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States is the land of the</v>

1488
01:05:18.241 --> 01:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>stock market and big guns and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and powerful,</v>

1489
01:05:21.341 --> 01:05:22.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an agrarian state,</v>

1490
01:05:22.471 --> 01:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>it can feed the land of Prince.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he also said,</v>

1491
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1492
01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:30.930
<v Speaker 1>we have to always remember to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe haven for our gentler spirits are</v>

1493
01:05:31.121 --> 01:05:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Weirdos and people that think</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently and active.</v>

1494
01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.570
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you get prints,</v>

1495
01:05:34.571 --> 01:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>little Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marilyn Manson and all the things that</v>

1496
01:05:37.361 --> 01:05:39.580
<v Speaker 1>make our culture interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1497
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very important thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep in mind when you,</v>

1498
01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1499
01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:43.960
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1500
01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.740
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1501
01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:50.410
<v Speaker 1>bombing and how we're getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about for a second the methodology</v>

1502
01:05:50.411 --> 01:05:54.970
<v Speaker 1>in our brain of how we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people think of not only</v>

1503
01:05:54.971 --> 01:05:57.220
<v Speaker 1>terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm guilty of this too,</v>

1504
01:05:57.430 --> 01:06:00.430
<v Speaker 1>or even say something like cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have cancer,</v>

1505
01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.160
<v Speaker 1>there's one method of treating it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it works,</v>

1506
01:06:03.161 --> 01:06:05.800
<v Speaker 1>which is there's a tumor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's cut it out.</v>

1507
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's cut the tumor out was another</v>
<v Speaker 1>method of treating and which was diet</v>

1508
01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:11.920
<v Speaker 1>and health and taking care of your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>before it ever happens.</v>

1509
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:14.620
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the things that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking now about the duality is what</v>

1510
01:06:14.621 --> 01:06:18.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying is that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fall sometimes into the mindset that</v>

1511
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:23.170
<v Speaker 1>every problem can be cut out and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and removed,</v>

1512
01:06:23.171 --> 01:06:23.500
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1513
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Instead of saying prevention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you just said,</v>

1514
01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:30.210
<v Speaker 1>what you just said is there's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be another tact in,</v>

1515
01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:31.690
<v Speaker 1>in every issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

1516
01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:33.660
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1517
01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:37.000
<v Speaker 1>the bad guys and we talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to in,</v>

1518
01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:37.960
<v Speaker 1>and listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1519
01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.510
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a place in the time to take out</v>

1520
01:06:40.511 --> 01:06:42.550
<v Speaker 1>the bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no question of course,</v>

1521
01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:43.413
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1522
01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:48.420
<v Speaker 1>but we have to be careful that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't fall into one way of thinking</v>

1523
01:06:49.001 --> 01:06:52.510
<v Speaker 1>and one way of dealing with what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider threats.</v>

1524
01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1525
01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Because we could make the problem worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1526
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:59.440
<v Speaker 1>and instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes we might want to say,</v>

1527
01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:02.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is a problem that doesn't</v>

1528
01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:06.430
<v Speaker 1>require cutting and radiation and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1529
01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:07.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>removing,</v>

1530
01:07:07.301 --> 01:07:10.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's what you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should approach it systemically</v>

1531
01:07:10.751 --> 01:07:13.780
<v Speaker 1>from a different angle that's not as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1532
01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:16.390
<v Speaker 1>not as violent and not as physical.</v>

1533
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1534
01:07:17.531 --> 01:07:21.430
<v Speaker 1>there's also the problem of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>charismatic leader and there's also a</v>

1535
01:07:21.431 --> 01:07:23.770
<v Speaker 1>problem of people wanting to be a part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a team.</v>

1536
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Like you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could guess the people that are a</v>

1537
01:07:26.801 --> 01:07:29.200
<v Speaker 1>threat to the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who are those people?</v>

1538
01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Cause they're just people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that somehow or another,</v>

1539
01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:34.650
<v Speaker 1>someone who lives in Italy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1540
01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I've never met is against me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1541
01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:40.150
<v Speaker 1>someone who lives in the United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>who they've never met.</v>

1542
01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:42.430
<v Speaker 1>That's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just don't know each other.</v>

1543
01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.200
<v Speaker 1>And when you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1544
01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:47.200
<v Speaker 1>when I was in Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the weirdest fucking things about</v>

1545
01:07:47.201 --> 01:07:49.060
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've never been there before,</v>

1546
01:07:49.061 --> 01:07:51.400
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people that were there were</v>

1547
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:53.440
<v Speaker 1>describing to me how everything has</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

1548
01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.990
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to this one cab driver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really interesting guy.</v>

1549
01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:57.160
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1550
01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.060
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1551
01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:00.670
<v Speaker 1>we were commenting on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was asking him about everywhere you</v>

1552
01:08:00.671 --> 01:08:02.710
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have these land rover defenders</v>

1553
01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:05.920
<v Speaker 1>that are in Cammo with these military</v>
<v Speaker 1>people standing out there with fucking</v>

1554
01:08:05.921 --> 01:08:08.680
<v Speaker 1>machine guns everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

1555
01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:10.990
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this normal?</v>

1556
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.190
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1557
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.410
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the new way.</v>

1558
01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:15.590
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

1559
01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>the world</v>

1560
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.030
<v Speaker 2>is changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1561
01:08:17.031 --> 01:08:18.710
<v Speaker 2>this is not a good world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1562
01:08:18.711 --> 01:08:20.090
<v Speaker 2>this is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1563
01:08:20.091 --> 01:08:22.970
<v Speaker 2>so this is a direct response to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist threats and the things that</v>

1564
01:08:22.971 --> 01:08:24.110
<v Speaker 2>have been happening in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1565
01:08:24.111 --> 01:08:25.160
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1566
01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:25.701
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1567
01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:27.200
<v Speaker 2>they don't want it to happen here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1568
01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:29.210
<v Speaker 2>so all the places where there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>tourists,</v>

1569
01:08:29.211 --> 01:08:31.670
<v Speaker 2>where was the Vatican?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it was the coliseum.</v>

1570
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:34.820
<v Speaker 2>You saw these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these camouflage land rover defenders in</v>

1571
01:08:34.821 --> 01:08:38.030
<v Speaker 2>these public displays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's gun and a woman.</v>

1572
01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:40.160
<v Speaker 2>I saw a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about punching her and</v>

1573
01:08:40.161 --> 01:08:41.210
<v Speaker 2>taking her gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1574
01:08:41.211 --> 01:08:43.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it can sound as women are no</v>
<v Speaker 2>joke know.</v>

1575
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

1576
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.730
<v Speaker 2>They're trained to react.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Guy,</v>

1577
01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:48.900
<v Speaker 2>that's my guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my gun.</v>

1578
01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.510
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kidding,</v>

1579
01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:53.150
<v Speaker 2>but it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is weird to see these people.</v>

1580
01:08:53.151 --> 01:08:57.680
<v Speaker 2>They're standing out there holding guns</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had fucking very serious looks</v>

1581
01:08:57.681 --> 01:09:01.100
<v Speaker 2>on their face and they're scanning the</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd looking left and looking right in.</v>

1582
01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:04.610
<v Speaker 2>A lot of Middle Eastern people there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fucking people dressed up like</v>

1583
01:09:04.611 --> 01:09:08.030
<v Speaker 2>beekeepers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of poor ladies with gloves on and</v>

1584
01:09:08.031 --> 01:09:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Ninja masks and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck,</v>

1585
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:16.010
<v Speaker 2>2016 and you've got people wandering the</v>
<v Speaker 2>streets of one of the greatest cities in</v>

1586
01:09:16.011 --> 01:09:19.100
<v Speaker 2>the world and our liberal democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking that.</v>

1587
01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:22.970

<v Speaker 2>the serenity on him,</v>

1588

<v Speaker 2>I consider they trust their minimalists.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're mental mess and they did.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Did you see what happened in France over</v>

1595
01:09:37.641 --> 01:09:38.900
<v Speaker 2>the weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

1596
01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.650
<v Speaker 2>this man stabbed a woman and her three</v>
<v Speaker 2>children at a,</v>

1597
01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:46.580
<v Speaker 2>at a resort for being scantily dressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This Muslim man.</v>

1598
01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck man.</v>

1600
01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:54.170
<v Speaker 2>it's such a bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a bankrupt philosophy,</v>

1601
01:09:54.171 --> 01:09:57.740
<v Speaker 2>if you can even call it that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This ideology is an ideology.</v>

1602
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:01.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you talk about people who are</v>

1603
01:10:01.431 --> 01:10:02.720
<v Speaker 2>caught in a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

1604
01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:06.830
<v Speaker 2>this isis ideology talk about being</v>
<v Speaker 2>caught in a past.</v>

1605
01:10:06.831 --> 01:10:08.390
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy wasn't nicest.</v>

1606
01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:11.580
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't an isis guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just some radical Muslim.</v>

1607

<v Speaker 2>Some someone who deeply believes what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been taught,</v>

1608
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.370
<v Speaker 2>his ideology so powerful that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to stab an eight year old kid in</v>

<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1633
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.780
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1634
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1635
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.550
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we just bomb,</v>

1636
01:11:20.690 --> 01:11:21.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1637
01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their strongholds,</v>

1638

<v Speaker 1>you make a martyr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1639
01:11:23.601 --> 01:11:24.421
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also said,</v>

1640
01:11:24.421 --> 01:11:27.270
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that that's not</v>

1641
01:11:27.271 --> 01:11:30.870
<v Speaker 1>like they're all camped out in one area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in a town the size of,</v>

1642
01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say Baltimore and there they have</v>

1643
01:11:33.451 --> 01:11:35.070
<v Speaker 1>safe houses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>

1644
01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:37.500
<v Speaker 1>they're all over that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly,</v>

1645
01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.000
<v Speaker 1>as Isis fighters die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they do is they come to families</v>

1646
01:11:42.001 --> 01:11:44.100
<v Speaker 1>that are peace loving families and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1647
01:11:44.101 --> 01:11:45.510
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>two other sons.</v>

1649
01:11:49.441 --> 01:11:49.931
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

1650
01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:53.610
<v Speaker 1>They now belong to isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can say no and die or you can</v>

1651
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:56.190
<v Speaker 1>bring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring them over for the cause because</v>

1652
01:11:56.191 --> 01:11:57.870
<v Speaker 1>you better be down cause that what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

1653
01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:00.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's this happening?</v>

1654
01:12:00.151 --> 01:12:02.430
<v Speaker 1>We'll pull in the world in Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Iraq,</v>

1655
01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:04.140
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those places where they have</v>

1656
01:12:04.150 --> 01:12:06.360
<v Speaker 1>strongholds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] people are joining</v>

1657
01:12:06.361 --> 01:12:07.390
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1658
01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:07.831
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1659
01:12:07.831 --> 01:12:11.940
<v Speaker 1>including European women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this crazy shit where</v>

1660
01:12:11.941 --> 01:12:14.450
<v Speaker 1>girls are going from England and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>joining isis?</v>

1661
01:12:14.451 --> 01:12:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're also getting their also getting</v>

1662
01:12:16.411 --> 01:12:19.190
<v Speaker 1>wholesale just destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>

1663
01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now isis is trying to support the</v>

1664
01:12:22.891 --> 01:12:26.980
<v Speaker 1>families of the martyrs and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>running out of money and you know,</v>

1665
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.750
<v Speaker 1>so they're losing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're losing the physical battle.</v>

1666
01:12:30.751 --> 01:12:34.500
<v Speaker 1>But the ideology is always going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspire fuck faces.</v>

1667
01:12:34.501 --> 01:12:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy who kills children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think in that case,</v>

1668
01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:40.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do need a strong presence and people</v>

1669
01:12:40.531 --> 01:12:42.750
<v Speaker 1>willing to shoot those people before</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do what they do.</v>

1670
01:12:42.751 --> 01:12:44.370
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to prevent though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1671
01:12:44.371 --> 01:12:46.320
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to prevent crazy people.</v>

1672
01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the word crazy is not the right</v>

1673
01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:50.610
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to prevent even addicts,</v>

1674
01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.430
<v Speaker 2>psychopaths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to prevent people.</v>

1675
01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1676
01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:57.990
<v Speaker 2>forget religious ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who fucking shot up those people</v>

1677
01:12:57.991 --> 01:13:00.670
<v Speaker 2>in the movie theater in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to prevent that.</v>

1678
01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1679
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:02.310
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

1680
01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:04.140
<v Speaker 2>that happened more than once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1681
01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:05.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times people didn't,</v>

1682
01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.040
<v Speaker 2>someone gets shot up in Amy Schumer's</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

1683
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:13.320
<v Speaker 2>The one where there are people that went</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see train wreck that was right,</v>

1684
01:13:13.321 --> 01:13:13.921
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1685
01:13:13.921 --> 01:13:15.890
<v Speaker 2>And because she was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you set up?</v>

1686
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:18.350
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is the answer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a good question.</v>

1687
01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.050
<v Speaker 1>The answer is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a little bit radical,</v>

1688
01:13:21.051 --> 01:13:23.840
<v Speaker 1>but is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let all of us carry a gun.</v>

1689
01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:27.320
<v Speaker 2>How are you gonna stop that truck with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun?</v>

1690
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:30.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trucks are more dangerous than guns,</v>

1691
01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:31.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up.</v>

1692
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:35.870
<v Speaker 2>I kind of predicted that that truck</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack during the Steven crowder</v>

1693
01:13:35.871 --> 01:13:37.850
<v Speaker 2>podcasts and I didn't even realize I did</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1694
01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Somebody posted on the integrator in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>

1695
01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:42.950
<v Speaker 2>like a clip of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's to stop someone?</v>

1696
01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Cause we were talking about gun control</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

1697
01:13:44.541 --> 01:13:47.900
<v Speaker 2>the problem is mentally insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that are willing to kill people</v>

1698
01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:50.030
<v Speaker 2>and they could do it a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1699
01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:52.250
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's to stop someone from taking a car</v>

1700
01:13:52.251 --> 01:13:54.260
<v Speaker 2>and driving through a fucking crowd of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1701
01:13:54.261 --> 01:13:55.330
<v Speaker 2>There's not much you can do</v>

1702
01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.840
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't shoot him in the face so</v>

1703
01:13:58.870 --> 01:14:02.010
<v Speaker 1>that they die in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I do get lucky</v>

1704
01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.280
<v Speaker 2>hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how hard it is to shoot at</v>

1705
01:14:04.281 --> 01:14:06.170
<v Speaker 2>someone when they're driving at you in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

1706
01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:10.190
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to shoot a deer that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing still and in you resting your</v>

1707
01:14:10.191 --> 01:14:12.520
<v Speaker 2>gun on a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's possible.</v>

1708
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:16.060
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather have that answer then have to</v>

1709
01:14:16.061 --> 01:14:19.150
<v Speaker 2>run and scream with my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather be able to stand my ground</v>

1710
01:14:19.151 --> 01:14:20.920
<v Speaker 2>and fucking squeeze off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1711
01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:23.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six rounds in his direction.</v>

1712
01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:25.330
<v Speaker 2>And I really mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd know it's,</v>

1713
01:14:25.331 --> 01:14:27.100
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an argument there and I think</v>

1714
01:14:27.101 --> 01:14:28.570
<v Speaker 2>the argument against that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1715
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:31.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should not have that because you're</v>

1716
01:14:31.211 --> 01:14:33.100
<v Speaker 2>more likely to kill someone in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

1717
01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:35.920
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a great argument either.</v>

1718
01:14:35.921 --> 01:14:39.040
<v Speaker 2>I think on both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the real issue is mental health.</v>

1719
01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:42.850
<v Speaker 2>The real issue is inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real issue is people growing up.</v>

1720
01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.140
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I say inequality,</v>

1721
01:14:44.141 --> 01:14:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily even mean rights.</v>

1722
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the environment in which your</v>
<v Speaker 2>soul enters this world.</v>

1723
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1724
01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:54.610
<v Speaker 2>what is the environment that you and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>entered?</v>

1725
01:14:54.611 --> 01:14:56.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have really nice parents and we got</v>

1726
01:14:56.531 --> 01:14:58.820
<v Speaker 2>really lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got born in America and we didn't,</v>

1727
01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:01.750
<v Speaker 2>we even born American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>born in the Philippines,</v>

1728
01:15:01.751 --> 01:15:03.970
<v Speaker 2>there's Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 14 years old,</v>

1729
01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:07.090
<v Speaker 2>barely 100 different countries too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get my edge.</v>

1730
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:07.641
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a really nice family.</v>

1732

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got lucky,</v>

1733
01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.730
<v Speaker 2>great family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Nice people.</v>

1734
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:14.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very fortunate.</v>

1735
01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:19.900
<v Speaker 2>If you were born in Iraq or in Saudi</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia or in Afghanistan or in any of</v>

1736
01:15:19.901 --> 01:15:23.590
<v Speaker 2>these places where they're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ancient ideologies,</v>

1737
01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:25.330
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1738
01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:30.480
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's a race and the race is</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 miles long and you're starting out at</v>

1739
01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:36.340
<v Speaker 2>mile one where some people are at mile</v>
<v Speaker 2>29 like there's no way.</v>

1740
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:38.950
<v Speaker 2>It's no way this is fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no way.</v>

1741
01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:43.930
<v Speaker 2>It's just not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's gotta be a way through</v>

1742
01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.960
<v Speaker 2>either time or effort or just the sheer</v>
<v Speaker 2>expression of ideas that permeate</v>

1743
01:15:51.401 --> 01:15:54.880
<v Speaker 2>through this world where it slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1744
01:15:54.881 --> 01:15:59.320
<v Speaker 2>slowly but surely things have to even</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to the point where people realize</v>

1745
01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:01.630
<v Speaker 2>the correct way to behave and treat</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1746
01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say religious tolerance all</v>

1747
01:16:03.881 --> 01:16:05.680
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when there's a fucking woman dress</v>

1748
01:16:05.681 --> 01:16:10.360
<v Speaker 2>like a Ninja at the mall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that lady is not in a good place.</v>

1749
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:12.910
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's being forced to dress like that.</v>

1750
01:16:12.911 --> 01:16:15.580
<v Speaker 2>This is not her idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way it is.</v>

1751
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:20.790
<v Speaker 2>This is an idea that was stuck into her</v>
<v Speaker 2>life when she was a small person and she</v>

1752
01:16:21.401 --> 01:16:24.100
<v Speaker 2>grew up with that idea and now she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>married to some guy who enforces that</v>

1753
01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:27.490
<v Speaker 2>idea and this guy's walking around with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fucking golf shirt on and his wife's</v>

1754
01:16:27.491 --> 01:16:28.330
<v Speaker 2>dress like a Ninja.</v>

1755
01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:28.871
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says,</v>

1756
01:16:28.871 --> 01:16:31.750
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it makes their country</v>

1757
01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.430
<v Speaker 2>weaker if you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1758
01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.920
<v Speaker 2>you guys arise and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1759
01:16:35.921 --> 01:16:39.460
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creates these sort of fencing around an</v>

1760
01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:44.140
<v Speaker 2>entire class of people and agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take women and say,</v>

1761
01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:46.540
<v Speaker 2>you guys have to walk a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind me.</v>

1762
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.730
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just know that that doesn't work.</v>

1763
01:16:48.731 --> 01:16:51.450
<v Speaker 2>You're wasting a lot of human potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1764
01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.340
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people with ideas that can make</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world a better place.</v>

1765
01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:55.460
<v Speaker 2>And you also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1766
01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.790
<v Speaker 2>you're stifling the debate and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>

1767
01:16:57.791 --> 01:16:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that think</v>

1768
01:16:59.591 --> 01:17:00.460
<v Speaker 2>different than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1769
01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:04.570
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're from different parts of</v>

1770
01:17:04.571 --> 01:17:08.200
<v Speaker 2>the world or whether they have different</v>
<v Speaker 2>likes or dislikes and they have</v>

1771
01:17:08.201 --> 01:17:09.034
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1772
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:11.270
<v Speaker 2>art that they appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1773
01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.570
<v Speaker 2>I like hearing their point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that I don't</v>

1774
01:17:14.571 --> 01:17:17.600
<v Speaker 2>agree with what they're saying and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to hear what they say.</v>

1775
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:21.380
<v Speaker 2>There's radical feminists that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to their ideology and</v>

1776
01:17:21.381 --> 01:17:24.080
<v Speaker 2>unlistened to what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I try to figure out where the fuck</v>

1777
01:17:24.081 --> 01:17:25.810
<v Speaker 2>they're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to figure,</v>

1778
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:28.520
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this a direct response to something</v>

1779
01:17:28.521 --> 01:17:31.640
<v Speaker 2>they've experienced in their life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how much of this has to deal with</v>

1780
01:17:31.641 --> 01:17:34.490
<v Speaker 2>them being persecuted?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of them it has to,</v>

1781
01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:39.520
<v Speaker 2>how much of what people say has to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their direct experiences with the</v>

1782
01:17:40.521 --> 01:17:44.480
<v Speaker 2>opposite sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you look at a bunch of</v>

1783
01:17:44.481 --> 01:17:45.530
<v Speaker 2>feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1784
01:17:45.531 --> 01:17:49.680
<v Speaker 2>And some of them have pink hair and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>weigh 300 pounds and you,</v>

1785
01:17:49.690 --> 01:17:51.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life was not fucking awesome for them</v>

1786
01:17:51.891 --> 01:17:53.750
<v Speaker 2>around men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just know it wasn't he?</v>

1787
01:17:53.751 --> 01:17:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of this anti male sort of</v>

1788
01:17:58.251 --> 01:18:00.950
<v Speaker 2>ideology that they're espousing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how much of that comes from their</v>

1789
01:18:00.951 --> 01:18:04.400
<v Speaker 2>direct experiences with men and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>different would it be if they grew up</v>

1790
01:18:04.401 --> 01:18:06.070
<v Speaker 2>looking like Julia Roberts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1791
01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:07.243
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>

1792
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:09.650

<v Speaker 1>I sent you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sent you one of them just for you to</v>

1802
01:18:26.641 --> 01:18:27.960
<v Speaker 1>listen to because I did it with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

1803
01:18:27.961 --> 01:18:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Hunter Mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't listen.</v>

1804
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.510
<v Speaker 1>He was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just tell you right now.</v>

1805
01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I sent it to here like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a super busy,</v>

1806
01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:35.910
<v Speaker 1>we had an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>

1807
01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:38.470
<v Speaker 1>very busy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had an amazing conversation with</v>

1808
01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:41.000
<v Speaker 1>my buddy hunter that amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't believe it happened.</v>

1809
01:18:41.001 --> 01:18:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Is it more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>

1810
01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:46.500
<v Speaker 1>My buddy hunter is really good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading everything and putting it in the</v>

1811
01:18:46.501 --> 01:18:47.910
<v Speaker 1>context where I can understand it.</v>

1812
01:18:47.970 --> 01:18:48.930
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

1813
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:50.820
<v Speaker 1>he can put it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can create useful,</v>

1814
01:18:50.850 --> 01:18:52.980
<v Speaker 1>he can turn it into a useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1815
01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.500
<v Speaker 1>But you can read a bunch of books but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to put it together.</v>

1816
01:18:55.501 --> 01:18:58.740
<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker can put it all</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and contextualizes it and</v>

1817
01:18:58.741 --> 01:19:00.720
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we read this book,</v>

1818
01:19:00.721 --> 01:19:01.890
<v Speaker 1>we'll read a book and then talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1819
01:19:01.891 --> 01:19:05.760
<v Speaker 1>So we read this book called the secret</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their success at the secret of our</v>

1820
01:19:05.761 --> 01:19:08.220
<v Speaker 1>success by Joseph Henrik.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the book is,</v>

1821
01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:11.820
<v Speaker 1>the theme of the book is basically this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's to your point,</v>

1822
01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:15.600
<v Speaker 1>human beings are smart because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>borrow culture.</v>

1823
01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are smart because they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>societies that excel have to be open and</v>

1824
01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:26.010
<v Speaker 1>have to be open enough so that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>borrow the best things from other</v>

1825
01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:27.210
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1826
01:19:27.211 --> 01:19:31.890
<v Speaker 1>if you and I are put in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Arctic would get a flat unless we</v>

1827
01:19:31.891 --> 01:19:33.010
<v Speaker 1>find a bunch of Innuendo.</v>

1828
01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.730
<v Speaker 1>We're dead in about three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1829
01:19:35.731 --> 01:19:39.600
<v Speaker 1>if you and I are in the Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take an intuit who can kick ass</v>

1830
01:19:39.601 --> 01:19:41.850
<v Speaker 1>and find seal meat and everything else</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put them in the Amazon,</v>

1831
01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.020
<v Speaker 1>he's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know,</v>

1832
01:19:43.021 --> 01:19:46.530
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human beings survive and grow and excel</v>

1833
01:19:46.531 --> 01:19:50.190
<v Speaker 1>because we are really good at learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>from each other,</v>

1834
01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:53.640
<v Speaker 1>borrowing ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the diffusion of innovation.</v>

1835
01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.250
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the most important thing.</v>

1836
01:19:56.251 --> 01:20:01.251
<v Speaker 1>And when you have societies that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>these strong rules and the strong</v>

1837
01:20:02.191 --> 01:20:06.030
<v Speaker 1>ideologies that keep people essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>restricted,</v>

1838
01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 1>you are not to have</v>

1839
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:11.070
<v Speaker 2>the free flow exchange of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>

1840
01:20:11.071 --> 01:20:13.290
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mixed martial arts.</v>

1841
01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:18.300
<v Speaker 2>Think about where martial arts has come</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the ultimate fighting championship</v>

1842
01:20:18.301 --> 01:20:21.960
<v Speaker 2>and the grace he's created this crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing where everybody got to fight</v>

1843
01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:24.180
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty soon everybody starts sharing</v>

1844
01:20:24.181 --> 01:20:26.380
<v Speaker 2>secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody starts to Kinda like go,</v>

1845
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.600
<v Speaker 2>this works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't work.</v>

1846
01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:30.120
<v Speaker 2>And you were putting it in an arena</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you were actually,</v>

1847
01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:32.640
<v Speaker 2>it was just a very open place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the people who have been ground.</v>

1848
01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:35.700
<v Speaker 2>It was a proven ground and you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>borrow ideas and people are,</v>

1849
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:38.400
<v Speaker 2>look at what they're doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their borrower coaches here,</v>

1850
01:20:38.401 --> 01:20:41.360
<v Speaker 2>I have this idea in submissions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing and all this.</v>

1851
01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:45.360
<v Speaker 2>That's how societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how innovation happens.</v>

1852
01:20:45.361 --> 01:20:48.030
<v Speaker 2>That's the best way to get ideas to move</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

1853
01:20:48.031 --> 01:20:51.840
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with Wa this sort of</v>

1854
01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:53.880
<v Speaker 2>countries that are restrictive like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

1855
01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:59.300
<v Speaker 2>like Saudi Arabia with the strong sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of either cultures of power or cultures</v>

1856
01:21:00.271 --> 01:21:04.260
<v Speaker 2>of religion is that they create um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>

1857
01:21:04.261 --> 01:21:06.030
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very difficult atmosphere.</v>

1858
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Not only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only to be open with your ideas but,</v>

1859
01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:14.250
<v Speaker 2>but to benefit from your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are not going to start a company</v>

1860
01:21:14.251 --> 01:21:19.251
<v Speaker 2>like apple in Russia when you know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government like Putin or whoever is</v>

1861
01:21:19.561 --> 01:21:23.670
<v Speaker 2>co could take it anytime they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where would be the incentive that I'm</v>

1862
01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:25.950
<v Speaker 2>going to work for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's buddies with Putin.</v>

1863
01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might be able to pull it off,</v>

1864
01:21:27.481 --> 01:21:30.570
<v Speaker 2>but you'll never do it in Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's an economy of influence,</v>

1865
01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.000
<v Speaker 2>not a meritocracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this,</v>

1866
01:21:33.001 --> 01:21:35.340
<v Speaker 2>cause this is a kind of an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that's going through my head.</v>

1867
01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going on today that just really</v>

1868
01:21:39.991 --> 01:21:44.910
<v Speaker 2>wasn't going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the 70s you had the Iran</v>

1869
01:21:44.911 --> 01:21:48.000
<v Speaker 2>hostage crisis with Jimmy Carter and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that jazz,</v>

1870
01:21:48.001 --> 01:21:51.690
<v Speaker 2>but if you really go back and think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what that was all about and if you</v>

1871
01:21:51.691 --> 01:21:55.410
<v Speaker 2>really look at the history of the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States intervention in the Middle East,</v>

1872
01:21:55.530 --> 01:21:58.920
<v Speaker 2>it was really about controlling</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>

1873
01:21:58.921 --> 01:22:01.380
<v Speaker 2>controlling now also controlling Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence.</v>

1874
01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>controlling Soviet influence,</v>

1875
01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.920
<v Speaker 2>but that was also about resources too</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were trying to,</v>

1876
01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:07.650
<v Speaker 2>the mujahideen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to control Afghanistan</v>

1877
01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:10.050
<v Speaker 2>and they had wanted to get the natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>gas pipelines and there's,</v>

1878
01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:14.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of it to that deals with</v>
<v Speaker 2>monopolizing natural resources and the</v>

1879
01:22:14.551 --> 01:22:15.810
<v Speaker 2>amount of money that you can get from</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1880
01:22:15.811 --> 01:22:18.990
<v Speaker 2>And then also the amount of natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources that could be used to</v>

1881
01:22:18.991 --> 01:22:21.180
<v Speaker 2>strengthen military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1882
01:22:21.190 --> 01:22:22.670
<v Speaker 2>a regimes there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1883
01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:27.480
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of control issues in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you didn't have the kind of</v>

1884
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:30.780
<v Speaker 2>terrorist activity that you're having</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

1885
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:35.990
<v Speaker 2>which also coincides with the freedom</v>
<v Speaker 2>and expression of ideas and information</v>

1886
01:22:36.271 --> 01:22:39.030
<v Speaker 2>at an unprecedented rate that we're all</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing today.</v>

1887
01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:44.300
<v Speaker 2>And the areas where this is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The areas where the freedom of</v>

1888
01:22:44.461 --> 01:22:48.510
<v Speaker 2>expression and the tolerance of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you look at the United States,</v>

1889
01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:52.620
<v Speaker 2>there's some some nonsense that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on today with political correctness and</v>

1890
01:22:52.621 --> 01:22:57.270
<v Speaker 2>there's some complete the the the the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left that's taken so far left that it</v>

1891
01:22:57.271 --> 01:23:02.271
<v Speaker 2>almost becomes right because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>just completely trolling but could not</v>

1892
01:23:03.391 --> 01:23:08.391
<v Speaker 2>just controlling but so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so infatuated with the idea of enforcing</v>

1893
01:23:10.481 --> 01:23:15.460
<v Speaker 2>their version of what equality is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equality is and what life is on</v>

1894
01:23:15.461 --> 01:23:16.240
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>

1895
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.400
<v Speaker 2>That it becomes this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh this is radical.</v>

1896
01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:23.200
<v Speaker 2>You've very tyrannical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But point is this is this is the,</v>

1897
01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:25.120
<v Speaker 2>the west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is where we are.</v>

1898
01:23:25.121 --> 01:23:30.121
<v Speaker 2>We are in the real marketplace of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the boiling point of all these</v>

1899
01:23:31.271 --> 01:23:36.271
<v Speaker 2>ideas where things are changing at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>radical rate and this is the world that</v>

1900
01:23:36.461 --> 01:23:41.461
<v Speaker 2>is also being attacked and really being</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed by this completely constricted</v>

1901
01:23:43.721 --> 01:23:45.970
<v Speaker 2>world that really doesn't feel like it</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a chance.</v>

1902
01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Like this world is trying desperately to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cling to these old ways.</v>

1903
01:23:50.610 --> 01:23:52.570
<v Speaker 2>D I mean if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what Isis is,</v>

1904
01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.960
<v Speaker 2>they are desperately trying to cling to</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ancient religious ideologies that</v>

1905
01:23:59.081 --> 01:24:03.460
<v Speaker 2>were established in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that does not allow for the</v>

1906
01:24:03.461 --> 01:24:07.090
<v Speaker 2>even exchange of ideas and information</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>

1907
01:24:07.091 --> 01:24:11.560
<v Speaker 2>this new way of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is also this new way,</v>

1908
01:24:11.561 --> 01:24:14.200
<v Speaker 2>is also attached of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the military industrial complex.</v>

1909
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:17.670
<v Speaker 2>It's also attached to that the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's hundreds of different,</v>

1910
01:24:17.671 --> 01:24:21.250
<v Speaker 2>some different military bases and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of different countries where</v>

1911
01:24:21.251 --> 01:24:23.170
<v Speaker 2>we're in control of massive,</v>

1912
01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:25.080
<v Speaker 1>the mountains has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been noted.</v>

1913
01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:26.680
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1914
01:24:26.710 --> 01:24:30.990
<v Speaker 1>terrorism by the way of the 70s I</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember being in Rome airport,</v>

1915
01:24:30.991 --> 01:24:33.990
<v Speaker 1>they had plenty of guys with machine</v>
<v Speaker 1>guns because of their red book Grit</v>

1916
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Brigade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was timing as terrorism.</v>

1917
01:24:35.341 --> 01:24:38.640
<v Speaker 1>There was Palestinian terrorists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then when they killed the people,</v>

1918
01:24:38.670 --> 01:24:39.830
<v Speaker 1>the Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Munich,</v>

1919
01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was always terrorist,</v>

1920
01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:45.030
<v Speaker 1>but a much smaller scale than today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much smaller.</v>

1921
01:24:45.031 --> 01:24:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true because</v>

1922
01:24:48.031 --> 01:24:51.540
<v Speaker 1>terrorism was a terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was never anything like isis</v>

1923
01:24:51.541 --> 01:24:53.040
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1924
01:24:53.041 --> 01:24:55.480
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a new thing and I,</v>

1925
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this really powerful,</v>

1926
01:24:58.291 --> 01:25:01.860
<v Speaker 1>but I have to stop you there because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you say there wasn't</v>

1927
01:25:01.861 --> 01:25:02.960
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1928
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:04.560
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for example,</v>

1929
01:25:04.561 --> 01:25:08.250
<v Speaker 1>in Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was essentially an American ally,</v>

1930
01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:10.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Indonesia,</v>

1931
01:25:10.381 --> 01:25:14.820
<v Speaker 1>had I just lost my yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a look at how many people in one</v>

1932
01:25:14.821 --> 01:25:19.821
<v Speaker 1>year died during the communist purge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 1965 by many,</v>

1933
01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.830
<v Speaker 1>many accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1934
01:25:22.831 --> 01:25:25.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were probably 1 million people,</v>

1935
01:25:25.650 --> 01:25:29.430
<v Speaker 1>most of whom were sort of take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>commando oxy,</v>

1936
01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:32.910
<v Speaker 1>they were the sort of civilian</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscripts that the military kind of</v>

1937
01:25:32.911 --> 01:25:37.830
<v Speaker 1>recruited and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find us the communists in your villages.</v>

1938
01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:42.540
<v Speaker 1>And they were marched down to the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had their heads chopped off and by</v>

1939
01:25:42.541 --> 01:25:46.200
<v Speaker 1>many accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost a million quote unquote</v>

1940
01:25:46.201 --> 01:25:51.201
<v Speaker 1>communists in a period of about a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Indonesia were slaughtered.</v>

1941
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are all related,</v>

1942
01:25:53.611 --> 01:25:55.680
<v Speaker 1>but no one's saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that my point is,</v>

1943
01:25:55.681 --> 01:25:56.260
<v Speaker 1>is</v>

1944
01:25:56.260 --> 01:26:01.260
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to get at is I wonder if</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is going on now is almost the same</v>

1945
01:26:01.421 --> 01:26:03.260
<v Speaker 2>thing that's going on with like a two</v>
<v Speaker 2>party system.</v>

1946
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:08.210
<v Speaker 2>It's an US versus them thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's combined with the os which is</v>

1947
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:10.250
<v Speaker 2>this what's going on in the western</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1948
01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:12.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously the Western world has</v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty of problems,</v>

1949
01:26:13.130 --> 01:26:17.480
<v Speaker 2>but one thing the western world has</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty clearly is the even exchange of</v>

1950
01:26:17.481 --> 01:26:20.510
<v Speaker 2>information and ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might not agree with these ideas and</v>

1951
01:26:20.511 --> 01:26:23.300
<v Speaker 2>you might mean and then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a problem with that as well,</v>

1952
01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:25.010
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have access to them,</v>

1953
01:26:25.011 --> 01:26:27.650
<v Speaker 2>you have access to them and this access</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>

1954
01:26:27.651 --> 01:26:30.830
<v Speaker 2>well that's one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on with twitter and I dunno if you</v>

1955
01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:32.660
<v Speaker 2>know about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Milo Yiannopoulos,</v>

1956
01:26:32.661 --> 01:26:33.494
<v Speaker 2>you know what he is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1957
01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:37.460
<v Speaker 2>He got banned from twitter for writing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad review about ghostbusters,</v>

1958
01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:42.320
<v Speaker 2>which essentially confirms what he said</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the regressive left is that</v>

1959
01:26:42.321 --> 01:26:46.070
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to stifle ideas like w</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they're saying that he's</v>

1960
01:26:46.071 --> 01:26:49.770
<v Speaker 2>responsible for the harassment of Leslie</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones.</v>

1961
01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is horrible.</v>

1962
01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:54.260
<v Speaker 2>You know what people did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a fucking comedian.</v>

1963
01:26:54.261 --> 01:26:55.100
<v Speaker 2>She's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1964
01:26:55.101 --> 01:26:56.720
<v Speaker 2>She's not great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's funny shit,</v>

1965
01:26:56.721 --> 01:26:58.240
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1966
01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.960
<v Speaker 2>but also this is just trolls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1967
01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:02.930
<v Speaker 2>You're always going to have trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't do that.</v>

1968
01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:05.390
<v Speaker 2>He didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not responsible for,</v>

1969
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:08.090
<v Speaker 2>he didn't like sending them who wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>the catalyst to the,</v>

1970
01:27:08.091 --> 01:27:11.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what he did was make an incredible</v>

1971
01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:16.040
<v Speaker 2>amount of sense when he was describing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you cannot make fun of this movie.</v>

1972
01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:18.680
<v Speaker 2>You cannot criticize this movie if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1973
01:27:18.681 --> 01:27:21.200
<v Speaker 2>you're labeled a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis and he talked about how</v>

1974
01:27:21.201 --> 01:27:25.150
<v Speaker 2>preposterous this movie is that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are all kicking ass and every man,</v>

1975
01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:28.460
<v Speaker 2>the movie a buffoon and the women don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have any negative traits or qualities at</v>

1976
01:27:28.461 --> 01:27:29.630
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>

1977
01:27:29.631 --> 01:27:32.030
<v Speaker 2>They're super powerful and super awesome</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hilarious.</v>

1978
01:27:32.031 --> 01:27:36.350
<v Speaker 2>And the humor is nonexistent because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put them in this restrictive box.</v>

1979
01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:38.150
<v Speaker 2>He got banned from twitter for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>band,</v>

1980
01:27:38.151 --> 01:27:39.170
<v Speaker 2>for twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this you,</v>

1981
01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:39.990
<v Speaker 2>you what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>

1982
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:44.650
<v Speaker 2>they're blaming him on the harassment</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Leslie experience inside of the</v>

1983
01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:49.760
<v Speaker 2>inside anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made a provocative article about a</v>

1984
01:27:49.761 --> 01:27:52.550
<v Speaker 2>piece of art and that's what that movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a piece of art.</v>

1985
01:27:52.551 --> 01:27:55.130
<v Speaker 2>So they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are guilty of censorship in the,</v>

1986
01:27:55.131 --> 01:27:56.270
<v Speaker 2>in the worst way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1987
01:27:56.271 --> 01:28:00.000
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing is they're stifling</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas they don't agree with and they've,</v>

1988
01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:04.640
<v Speaker 2>they've decided that the twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>established some weird fucking thing</v>

1989
01:28:04.641 --> 01:28:08.180
<v Speaker 2>called the trust and Security Council or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1990
01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:11.060
<v Speaker 2>And they brought all these social dress</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice words.</v>

1991
01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Jamie looked at up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that called?</v>

1992
01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:16.520
<v Speaker 2>That they tried to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they brought on all these people for</v>

1993
01:28:16.521 --> 01:28:17.810
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like mouth China.</v>

1994
01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:20.930
<v Speaker 2>But Chase is Christ very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bizarre.</v>

1995
01:28:21.690 --> 01:28:23.690
<v Speaker 2>It is thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

1996
01:28:23.691 --> 01:28:25.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm against harassment.</v>

1997
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:28.340
<v Speaker 2>If you could stop people from being</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty to people and you say,</v>

1998
01:28:28.341 --> 01:28:30.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's someone who's using twitter and</v>

1999
01:28:30.561 --> 01:28:32.660
<v Speaker 2>they're going after people in a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty way.</v>

2000
01:28:32.661 --> 01:28:37.661
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with that is look at how</v>
<v Speaker 2>many fucking people have made shitty,</v>

2001
01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:42.410
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil comments about police officers.</v>

2002
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:45.680
<v Speaker 2>All police officers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust and safety council.</v>

2003
01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:48.380
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to safety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone plays a role.</v>

2004
01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Please make that larger so I can read</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2005
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:54.890
<v Speaker 2>Powers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twitter empowers every voice to shape</v>

2006
01:28:54.891 --> 01:28:57.650
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't do that unless you feel</v>

2007
01:28:57.651 --> 01:29:01.950
<v Speaker 2>safe and confident enough to express</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself freely and with the world</v>

2008
01:29:01.951 --> 01:29:05.310
<v Speaker 2>around you to help give your voice more</v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

2009
01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.910
<v Speaker 2>Twitter does not tolerate behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>intended to harass,</v>

2010
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:12.420
<v Speaker 2>intimidate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or use fear to silence another user's</v>

2011
01:29:12.421 --> 01:29:13.440
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very general,</v>

2012
01:29:13.441 --> 01:29:14.730
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening in general then,</v>

2013
01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:19.470
<v Speaker 2>so now you have a council that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>deciding whether or not your good enough</v>

2014
01:29:19.471 --> 01:29:20.520
<v Speaker 2>for twitter as well.</v>

2015
01:29:20.530 --> 01:29:22.110
<v Speaker 2>You know what the first thing they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him?</v>

2016
01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:23.370
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't figure out what to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2017
01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:26.220
<v Speaker 2>They took away his verification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2018
01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:26.990
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2019
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:28.200
<v Speaker 2>What does that have to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2020
01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:30.300
<v Speaker 2>what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not verified anymore.</v>

2021
01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:31.890
<v Speaker 2>They took away a little blue chat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2022
01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:34.380
<v Speaker 2>it's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very dangerous,</v>

2023
01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:36.510
<v Speaker 2>slippery slope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we see the scenario.</v>

2024
01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do exactly the same thing.</v>

2025
01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:42.390
<v Speaker 2>When they did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gained 20,000 new followers</v>

2026
01:29:42.391 --> 01:29:45.210
<v Speaker 2>immediately because there was a massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>backlash.</v>

2027
01:29:45.211 --> 01:29:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now they're in a place where there is</v>

2028
01:29:46.741 --> 01:29:51.741
<v Speaker 2>even more backlash because if you look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the actual words that he typed versus</v>

2029
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:54.870
<v Speaker 2>what they're accusing him of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just doesn't stack up,</v>

2030
01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:58.080
<v Speaker 2>it's clear that they don't like him</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's a Republican.</v>

2031
01:29:58.081 --> 01:30:01.950
<v Speaker 2>He's a trump supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and he is a fucking troll.</v>

2032
01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.660
<v Speaker 2>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's hilarious.</v>

2033
01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:07.050
<v Speaker 2>He's a troll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the marketplace of ideas,</v>

2034
01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:11.520
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to combat his</v>
<v Speaker 2>trolling behavior.</v>

2035
01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:16.290
<v Speaker 2>The thing I gag without gagging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without gagging and engage him,</v>

2036
01:30:16.291 --> 01:30:19.980
<v Speaker 2>engage him in a debate and a vigorous</v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit.</v>

2037
01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gag The guy.</v>

2038
01:30:22.410 --> 01:30:24.720
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you really feel like he has done</v>

2039
01:30:24.721 --> 01:30:26.970
<v Speaker 2>something egregious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he's done something that can be</v>

2040
01:30:26.971 --> 01:30:28.290
<v Speaker 2>criticized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticized it.</v>

2041
01:30:28.291 --> 01:30:31.110
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if he's actually harassing people,</v>

2042
01:30:31.230 --> 01:30:33.570
<v Speaker 2>if he's actually saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2043
01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:37.680
<v Speaker 2>go find Leslie Jones and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and throw dog shit at,</v>

2044
01:30:37.690 --> 01:30:40.800
<v Speaker 2>or do something horrible to her or slash</v>
<v Speaker 2>or tires or something like that,</v>

2045
01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:42.850
<v Speaker 2>he's actually doing something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2046
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Then you know that he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the,</v>

2047
01:30:46.381 --> 01:30:49.620
<v Speaker 2>that you don't get up in a crowded movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>theater and scream fire because you'll</v>

2048
01:30:49.621 --> 01:30:50.530
<v Speaker 2>create a stampede.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2049
01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:51.331
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2050
01:30:51.331 --> 01:30:55.170
<v Speaker 2>You know my Angela talked about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she said where the Ku Ku Klux Klan</v>

2051
01:30:55.171 --> 01:30:58.950
<v Speaker 2>was saying we have a freedom of speech</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my Angela said you're a freedom</v>

2052
01:30:58.980 --> 01:30:59.670
<v Speaker 2>ends.</v>

2053
01:30:59.670 --> 01:31:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Your freedom of speech can end when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're literally telling people to hang</v>

2054
01:31:02.731 --> 01:31:06.030
<v Speaker 2>me and you're telling a mob and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing right there that,</v>

2055
01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:07.580
<v Speaker 2>that the inciting them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2056
01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:10.770
<v Speaker 2>that's probably where you know we should</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a look at things.</v>

2057
01:31:10.771 --> 01:31:12.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we all know,</v>

2058
01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:15.780
<v Speaker 2>we all know the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we don't know about what,</v>

2059
01:31:15.781 --> 01:31:16.351
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>

2060
01:31:16.351 --> 01:31:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that that there is something</v>
<v Speaker 2>called common decency and you know</v>

2061
01:31:20.461 --> 01:31:22.620
<v Speaker 2>people like to jump to these extremes</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>

2062
01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:25.710
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't inform the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're saying is so</v>

2063
01:31:25.711 --> 01:31:29.550
<v Speaker 2>important and then the idea that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to create a safe haven for those</v>

2064
01:31:29.551 --> 01:31:34.110
<v Speaker 2>that you agree with and disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disagree with Milo all the time.</v>

2065
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:36.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he and I are friends and I've had him on</v>

2066
01:31:36.241 --> 01:31:38.460
<v Speaker 2>the podcast twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when we talk,</v>

2067
01:31:38.490 --> 01:31:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm mock them when we have fun.</v>

2068
01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:41.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a good guy,</v>

2069
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.500
<v Speaker 2>but he's just really right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think his trolling is so fucking</v>

2070
01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:50.850
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated and he's one of the ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was saying that he believes that</v>

2071
01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:52.260
<v Speaker 2>Melania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you say her name?</v>

2072
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:53.143
<v Speaker 2>Trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why trump?</v>

2073
01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Melania?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that her name?</v>

2074
01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:56.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks that they did it on purpose.</v>

2075
01:31:56.550 --> 01:32:00.520
<v Speaker 2>He thinks trump is a master troll and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks that the plagiarism was on</v>

2076
01:32:00.521 --> 01:32:04.180
<v Speaker 2>purpose because now more people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it and then more people</v>

2077
01:32:04.181 --> 01:32:06.550
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's true,</v>

2078
01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:11.500
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's hilarious that you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that his tweet,</v>

2079
01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:17.100
<v Speaker 2>trump's tweet that he put out to</v>
<v Speaker 2>congratulate his wife for speaking is</v>

2080
01:32:18.401 --> 01:32:23.401
<v Speaker 2>exactly verbatim the same tweet that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama put out to congratulate his wife</v>

2081
01:32:26.130 --> 01:32:27.490
<v Speaker 2>or speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

2082
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2083
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Every single word in the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>

2084
01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2085
01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2086
01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:37.000
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty calculated.</v>

2087
01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he writes his own tweets.</v>

2088
01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:43.650
<v Speaker 2>That apparently wasn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it fake photoshopped?</v>

2089
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:44.583
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker,</v>

2090
01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:46.300
<v Speaker 2>they got me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was the thing they did.</v>

2091
01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:49.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry about that folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that they did with</v>

2092
01:32:49.601 --> 01:32:51.880
<v Speaker 2>the Leslie Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which she was really upset is that</v>

2093
01:32:51.881 --> 01:32:54.860
<v Speaker 2>trolls were taking words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2094
01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:59.590
<v Speaker 2>and putting them like they were taking a</v>
<v Speaker 2>photoshop and making her like her name,</v>

2095
01:32:59.591 --> 01:33:00.510
<v Speaker 2>like what she had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2096
01:33:00.670 --> 01:33:04.690
<v Speaker 2>heard her twitter name and then writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible shit about gay people and then</v>

2097
01:33:04.691 --> 01:33:05.950
<v Speaker 2>putting it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

2098
01:33:06.190 --> 01:33:09.160
<v Speaker 2>But Leslie Jones and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love her.</v>

2099
01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I think she's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said some kind of fucked up things</v>

2100
01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:16.450
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter herself and you know,</v>

2101
01:33:16.451 --> 01:33:20.440
<v Speaker 2>things that can be construed as racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things she said about white</v>

2102
01:33:20.441 --> 01:33:22.600
<v Speaker 2>people being shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck white people,</v>

2103
01:33:22.601 --> 01:33:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like something like that.</v>

2104
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:26.110
<v Speaker 2>It was a on on Breitbart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you could,</v>

2105
01:33:26.170 --> 01:33:27.760
<v Speaker 2>you'd find the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2106
01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.860
<v Speaker 2>things that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were saying that like,</v>

2107
01:33:29.861 --> 01:33:32.290
<v Speaker 2>how could Leslie Jones get away with</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying this?</v>

2108
01:33:32.770 --> 01:33:37.770
<v Speaker 2>But Milo gets banned for writing an</v>
<v Speaker 2>article and I'm not you ma'am.</v>

2109
01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:41.170
<v Speaker 2>But I think what Leslie said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like white people,</v>

2110
01:33:41.171 --> 01:33:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could've been that she was saying</v>

2111
01:33:44.441 --> 01:33:46.930
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone did something and Goddamn white</v>

2112
01:33:46.931 --> 01:33:48.370
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is some white people,</v>

2113
01:33:48.371 --> 01:33:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2114
01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:52.270
<v Speaker 2>like she's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when people climb into a zoo and</v>

2115
01:33:52.271 --> 01:33:54.910
<v Speaker 2>try to fucking hug a tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why people,</v>

2116
01:33:55.210 --> 01:33:56.830
<v Speaker 2>that's why people shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's funny though.</v>

2117
01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:58.530
<v Speaker 2>And let's say anybody who knows let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2118
01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:02.500
<v Speaker 2>she's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's just that fucking Dall Lord have</v>

2119
01:34:02.501 --> 01:34:03.820
<v Speaker 2>mercy white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

2120
01:34:03.850 --> 01:34:06.400
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's white people shit.</v>

2121
01:34:06.401 --> 01:34:07.960
<v Speaker 2>Like they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2122
01:34:07.961 --> 01:34:10.360
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why did she say that?</v>

2123
01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Like what is that about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who imagine a white person,</v>

2124
01:34:12.911 --> 01:34:15.910
<v Speaker 2>but look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine a white person saying that about</v>

2125
01:34:15.911 --> 01:34:17.110
<v Speaker 2>black people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>

2126
01:34:17.111 --> 01:34:18.370
<v Speaker 2>but I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2127
01:34:18.371 --> 01:34:19.740
<v Speaker 2>we've heard this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2128
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:23.760
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leslie Jones is not a racist and Leslie</v>

2129
01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Jones's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it never been anything but really kind</v>

2130
01:34:25.541 --> 01:34:26.740
<v Speaker 2>to people around her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2131
01:34:26.741 --> 01:34:29.890
<v Speaker 2>But hold on a second because sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>people say things that are racist and</v>

2132
01:34:29.891 --> 01:34:31.700
<v Speaker 2>they're not racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to be fun.</v>

2133
01:34:31.701 --> 01:34:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2134
01:34:32.591 --> 01:34:34.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many 2 cents and if sometimes</v>

2135
01:34:34.841 --> 01:34:39.190
<v Speaker 2>the Jeff Ross is hilarious and he says a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of racial stuff when he exerts</v>

2136
01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.480
<v Speaker 2>Silberman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Silverman.</v>

2137
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:44.260
<v Speaker 2>But Jeff Ross in particular because he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at roasting people and a lot</v>

2138
01:34:44.261 --> 01:34:45.910
<v Speaker 2>of the stuff that he says like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2139
01:34:45.911 --> 01:34:49.630
<v Speaker 2>he crosses what some people would say is</v>
<v Speaker 2>align but what is he doing?</v>

2140
01:34:49.631 --> 01:34:51.250
<v Speaker 2>He's being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>

2141
01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.810
<v Speaker 2>there is a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of times if you're Hispanic,</v>

2142
01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:56.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

2143
01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're from</v>

2144
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:02.330
<v Speaker 1>a marginalized group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get away with it because you all</v>

2145
01:35:02.331 --> 01:35:07.331
<v Speaker 1>share in a common experience of</v>
<v Speaker 1>repression,</v>

2146
01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:10.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like gay people can mock straight</v>

2147
01:35:10.161 --> 01:35:11.630
<v Speaker 1>people guide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

2149
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:14.630
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause we don't,</v>

2150
01:35:14.631 --> 01:35:17.570
<v Speaker 1>we've never had to pay a price for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of oppression.</v>

2151
01:35:17.690 --> 01:35:20.000
<v Speaker 1>We haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not physically and not,</v>

2152
01:35:20.001 --> 01:35:24.170
<v Speaker 1>not economically because we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressed for being straight forever.</v>

2153
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:27.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a constant thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were just so mad that we're not</v>

2154
01:35:27.850 --> 01:35:31.460
<v Speaker 1>saying read or fucking breeder out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>making babies.</v>

<v Speaker 1>these bushy eyebrows and the puppet</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say these fucked up things and</v>

2160
01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:49.520
<v Speaker 1>auto would go,</v>

2162
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Like what the Hell Creek?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the puppet would say,</v>

2163

2169
01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:13.490
<v Speaker 1>outrageous thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think prejudice thoughts.</v>

2170
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:18.970
<v Speaker 1>It's part of being a human being man is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine who was dealing with</v>

<v Speaker 1>And this friend of mine was saying like,</v>

2173
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:31.030
<v Speaker 1>how fucking embarrassing is it when</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone just reenact the most disgusting</v>

2174
01:36:32.751 --> 01:36:35.660
<v Speaker 1>stereotype about a race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Chinese guy,</v>

2175
01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:38.480
<v Speaker 1>he just closes his eyes and just drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight into traffic.</v>

2176
01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Like this is fucking horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes that like when you see them,</v>

2177
01:36:45.351 --> 01:36:45.651
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2178
01:36:45.651 --> 01:36:47.930
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was Chinese and I saw someone</v>

2179
01:36:47.931 --> 01:36:48.830
<v Speaker 1>driving like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

2180
01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:52.190
<v Speaker 1>you motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm dealing with here?</v>

2181
01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Just being shy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's an accident and I'm involved,</v>

2182
01:36:54.861 --> 01:36:55.461
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2183
01:36:55.461 --> 01:36:58.310
<v Speaker 1>of course the black and Asian guy go car</v>
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>

2184
01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know,</v>

2185
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.370
<v Speaker 1>do you know what Dunbar's principle is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2186
01:37:01.450 --> 01:37:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

2187
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:05.840
<v Speaker 1>we have a limited number of people we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can keep within our heads.</v>

2188
01:37:05.841 --> 01:37:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2189
01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.320
<v Speaker 1>But that also plays a part and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotyping.</v>

2190
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:12.560
<v Speaker 1>There's a limited amount of information</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can kind of like keeping our</v>

2191
01:37:12.561 --> 01:37:16.040
<v Speaker 1>heads right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually stereotyping was something</v>

2192
01:37:16.041 --> 01:37:18.800
<v Speaker 1>that kept us safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about when you talk about</v>

2193
01:37:18.801 --> 01:37:20.750
<v Speaker 1>stereotyping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're really talking about is</v>

2194
01:37:20.751 --> 01:37:22.910
<v Speaker 1>pattern recognition and chunking</v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

2195
01:37:22.911 --> 01:37:24.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at something because you</v>

2196
01:37:24.891 --> 01:37:25.790
<v Speaker 1>don't have a lot of time.</v>

2197
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:27.560
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Dove,</v>

2198
01:37:27.561 --> 01:37:29.420
<v Speaker 1>David [inaudible] joke about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2199
01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:32.600
<v Speaker 1>he said he was sitting there and he and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy walked up to him,</v>

2200
01:37:32.601 --> 01:37:34.100
<v Speaker 1>he's already done this joke so I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>selling,</v>

2201
01:37:34.101 --> 01:37:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not ruining it.</v>

2202
01:37:35.690 --> 01:37:36.530
<v Speaker 1>But he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2203
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:38.720
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we assume things all the time.</v>

2204
01:37:38.721 --> 01:37:39.471
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

2205
01:37:39.471 --> 01:37:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I saw this guy with teardrop tattoos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a knife and I was like,</v>

2206
01:37:42.621 --> 01:37:44.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want us to hang around here.</v>

2207
01:37:44.241 --> 01:37:46.130
<v Speaker 1>And the girl goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't assume it could be a chef.</v>

2208
01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm like that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could be a chef.</v>

2209
01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:52.100
<v Speaker 1>But if you'll pull your pants down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a bunch of blisters and your</v>

2210
01:37:52.101 --> 01:37:53.870
<v Speaker 1>genitals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to assume you got stung by</v>

2211
01:37:53.871 --> 01:37:55.290
<v Speaker 1>a pack of bees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2212
01:37:55.291 --> 01:37:56.870
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotyped,</v>

2213
01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:59.360
<v Speaker 1>you make choices based on how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2214
01:37:59.361 --> 01:38:02.760
<v Speaker 1>what the information you get and you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it very quickly because sometimes that</v>

2215
01:38:02.761 --> 01:38:04.050
<v Speaker 1>information and keep you safe.</v>

2216
01:38:04.290 --> 01:38:06.870
<v Speaker 1>A cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times when they see they can</v>

2217
01:38:06.871 --> 01:38:09.690
<v Speaker 1>tell if somebody shouldn't be somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they'll look for certain things</v>

2218
01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:12.420
<v Speaker 1>out of state plates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast food wrappers,</v>

2219
01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:15.030
<v Speaker 1>that person's drive and they're on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>way somewhere.</v>

2220
01:38:15.031 --> 01:38:19.620
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of different little</v>
<v Speaker 1>signals that cause you to profile,</v>

2221
01:38:19.650 --> 01:38:21.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause sometimes profiling is what's</v>

2222
01:38:21.631 --> 01:38:23.500
<v Speaker 1>called good police work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2223
01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:25.260
<v Speaker 1>we all do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all,</v>

2224
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:27.990
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm driving and I see a dude in his</v>

2225
01:38:27.991 --> 01:38:31.590
<v Speaker 1>car and I see the back of his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can make a lot of fucking assumptions</v>

2226
01:38:31.710 --> 01:38:34.990
<v Speaker 1>on how he's driving and whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to signal like an old dude</v>

2227
01:38:34.991 --> 01:38:38.180
<v Speaker 1>with a hat do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do it all the time and I got to speak</v>

2228
01:38:38.190 --> 01:38:40.740
<v Speaker 1>by this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a beep my horn before I go by</v>

2229
01:38:40.750 --> 01:38:42.660
<v Speaker 1>cause he might just swerving cause he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fucking dummy.</v>

2230
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:46.410
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of this is just being a human</v>

2231
01:38:46.411 --> 01:38:47.250
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2232
01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:52.550
<v Speaker 1>it's how our minds work and we probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>all share very similar thought patterns</v>

2233
01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:58.380
<v Speaker 1>with even our enemies or even the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't like.</v>

2234
01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But being like,</v>

2235
01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.640
<v Speaker 1>being a Jewish person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really cheap.</v>

2236
01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Like super cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that comes from that's different.</v>

2237
01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:08.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's characteristic.</v>

2238
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:11.550
<v Speaker 1>The way I would look at it as this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd say you'd say a Jew,</v>

2239
01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:12.750
<v Speaker 1>that Jewish person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cheap.</v>

2240
01:39:12.751 --> 01:39:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say what I would look at is</v>

2241
01:39:14.691 --> 01:39:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2242
01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:18.900
<v Speaker 1>hold on for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've been a Jew,</v>

2243
01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:21.930
<v Speaker 1>you have a history and we can go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>3,500 years,</v>

2244
01:39:21.931 --> 01:39:23.220
<v Speaker 1>but let's just go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2245
01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:24.540
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back 2000 years.</v>

2246
01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:28.320
<v Speaker 1>You got a history of a lot of people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their twenties.</v>

2247
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

2248
01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you got a lot of people blaming the</v>

2249
01:39:30.781 --> 01:39:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Jews for killing Christ?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2250
01:39:32.670 --> 01:39:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And so usually if you look at history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially European history,</v>

2251
01:39:35.371 --> 01:39:37.740
<v Speaker 1>they were either kicked out or they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

2252
01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:39.900
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is if you don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeland,</v>

2253
01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a homeland and you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jew.</v>

2254
01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:43.890
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't they have a homeland?</v>

2255
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:45.930
<v Speaker 1>No luck yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's very recent.</v>

2256
01:39:45.931 --> 01:39:48.540
<v Speaker 1>What does that 1948 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2257
01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:51.630
<v Speaker 1>so as a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you actually don't have,</v>

2258
01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:52.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a country,</v>

2259
01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:53.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2260
01:39:53.701 --> 01:39:56.430
<v Speaker 1>as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what your security is.</v>

2261
01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Your fucking security at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day is how thick your wallet is.</v>

2262
01:39:59.311 --> 01:40:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Because money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money is how you survived.</v>

2263
01:40:02.370 --> 01:40:05.550
<v Speaker 1>You know the reason that a lot of Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason Jews were into the jewelry</v>

2264
01:40:05.551 --> 01:40:08.220
<v Speaker 1>trade diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little diamonds or something you could</v>

2265
01:40:08.221 --> 01:40:10.890
<v Speaker 1>pick up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put an a pouch and run the fuck away</v>

2266
01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:11.813
<v Speaker 1>really quickly.</v>

2267
01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:14.310
<v Speaker 1>You could transport your wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were like,</v>

2268
01:40:14.311 --> 01:40:15.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're kept out of banking.</v>

2269
01:40:15.301 --> 01:40:16.260
<v Speaker 1>We kept that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these things,</v>

2270
01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:20.850
<v Speaker 1>but we can make clothing and we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're jewelers and they came to this</v>

2271
01:40:20.851 --> 01:40:22.410
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those immigrants came to this country</v>

2272
01:40:22.411 --> 01:40:24.660
<v Speaker 1>with those two skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish came to this country with,</v>

2273
01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:25.890
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got two hands.</v>

2274
01:40:26.010 --> 01:40:28.080
<v Speaker 1>I can work a farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you need me to do?</v>

2275
01:40:28.230 --> 01:40:29.830
<v Speaker 1>The Jews were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2276
01:40:29.831 --> 01:40:32.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can make fucking really nice clothes</v>

2277
01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:35.370
<v Speaker 1>and I can label them and I can get you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think that they're even nicer.</v>

2278
01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Because I understand a little bit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing.</v>

2279
01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

2280
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I got diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they there,</v>

2281
01:40:40.181 --> 01:40:42.420
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were certain things that they were</v>

2282
01:40:42.421 --> 01:40:45.090
<v Speaker 1>forced into and they came to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country and they had a skill set.</v>

2283
01:40:45.091 --> 01:40:47.280
<v Speaker 1>So I look at that and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2284
01:40:47.281 --> 01:40:50.080
<v Speaker 1>that's just cultural residue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just cultural residential</v>

2285
01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:53.500
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were taught that that's how you get</v>

2286
01:40:53.501 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 1>ahead</v>

2287
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:57.370
<v Speaker 2>and you were taught that keeping hold on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your money is by the way also a way to</v>

2288
01:40:57.371 --> 01:41:00.220
<v Speaker 2>ensure your survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the more you learn about,</v>

2289
01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:02.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you learn about people's</v>

2290
01:41:02.081 --> 01:41:04.930
<v Speaker 2>history and the more you learn about our</v>
<v Speaker 2>biology,</v>

2291
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:09.430
<v Speaker 2>the more we learn about brain science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the more compassionate and makes</v>

2292
01:41:09.431 --> 01:41:11.620
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's also why a lot of people</v>

2293
01:41:11.621 --> 01:41:15.010
<v Speaker 2>feel that some Asian folks are bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>drivers cause they used to mind their</v>

2294
01:41:15.011 --> 01:41:18.130
<v Speaker 2>own business not looking left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they walk they walk straight</v>

2295
01:41:18.131 --> 01:41:20.050
<v Speaker 2>ahead and they bumped into each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

2296
01:41:20.051 --> 01:41:21.700
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking great.</v>

2297
01:41:21.701 --> 01:41:25.180
<v Speaker 2>That's what we will do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine is China was explaining</v>

2298
01:41:25.181 --> 01:41:26.170
<v Speaker 2>this to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2299
01:41:26.171 --> 01:41:28.300
<v Speaker 2>if you go to China and you walked down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the street,</v>

2300
01:41:28.301 --> 01:41:30.220
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just bounce off each other like</v>

2301
01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:31.840
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

2302
01:41:31.841 --> 01:41:32.800
<v Speaker 2>and it's not offensive.</v>

2303
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:34.450
<v Speaker 2>It's just what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing it on purpose.</v>

2304
01:41:34.451 --> 01:41:36.610
<v Speaker 2>It's just like when you're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of people,</v>

2305
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:38.040
<v Speaker 2>like this is how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2306
01:41:38.041 --> 01:41:39.640
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to just got to plow forward.</v>

2307
01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:41.950
<v Speaker 2>If you ever seen intersections in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2308
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:45.570
<v Speaker 2>you've seen videos of intersections is</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking terrified.</v>

2309
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:48.040
<v Speaker 2>It's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking terrifying chaos.</v>

2310
01:41:48.150 --> 01:41:50.110
<v Speaker 2>It's the aunts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it was terrifying.</v>

2311
01:41:50.130 --> 01:41:52.480
<v Speaker 2>It allows the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they drive like fucking savages in</v>

2312
01:41:52.481 --> 01:41:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2313
01:41:53.050 --> 01:41:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's this roundabouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well walking,</v>

2314
01:41:55.190 --> 01:41:58.390
<v Speaker 2>we're driving into the roundabout what</v>
<v Speaker 2>it called Jesus and the driver just like</v>

2315
01:41:58.391 --> 01:42:00.370
<v Speaker 2>skillfully maneuvers around this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

2316
01:42:00.371 --> 01:42:03.910
<v Speaker 2>look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this fucking mad bays.</v>

2317
01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:06.490
<v Speaker 2>But they figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Work they left,</v>

2318
01:42:06.491 --> 01:42:08.740
<v Speaker 2>they write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they zoom around each other.</v>

2319
01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.990
<v Speaker 2>They're driving slowly and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 2>making their own.</v>

2320
01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:13.690
<v Speaker 2>So at 25 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say anything below 25 miles an</v>

2321
01:42:13.691 --> 01:42:13.780
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>

2322
01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Human beings are very good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>navigating.</v>

2323
01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:17.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good example.</v>

2324
01:42:17.561 --> 01:42:19.690
<v Speaker 2>And this is kind of a weird overhead</v>
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>

2325
01:42:20.050 --> 01:42:23.620
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually manageable,</v>

2326
01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:26.650
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen some shit that just does</v>
<v Speaker 2>look manageable.</v>

2327
01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:28.390
<v Speaker 2>You also see people die in those</v>
<v Speaker 2>intersections.</v>

2328
01:42:28.391 --> 01:42:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well how about the people that are</v>

2329
01:42:29.501 --> 01:42:32.830
<v Speaker 2>walking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just walk across the street and</v>

2330
01:42:33.250 --> 01:42:36.110
<v Speaker 2>pray that people avoid them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2331
01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

2332
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:39.250
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2333
01:42:39.251 --> 01:42:44.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of cultures that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have their own little thing that they do</v>

2334
01:42:44.410 --> 01:42:46.990
<v Speaker 2>to sort of deal with the numbers that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dealing with.</v>

2335
01:42:47.530 --> 01:42:49.720
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that in America to one of the</v>

2336
01:42:49.721 --> 01:42:53.320
<v Speaker 2>things that I really like about small</v>
<v Speaker 2>towns when I go to a small,</v>

2337
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:55.240
<v Speaker 2>like I was in Bozeman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Montana recently,</v>

2338
01:42:55.630 --> 01:42:58.120
<v Speaker 2>there's only 35,000 residents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bozeman,</v>

2339
01:42:58.121 --> 01:43:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great town and everybody drives a</v>

2340
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:03.970
<v Speaker 2>really nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like fucking super chill.</v>

2341
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not that many people.</v>

2342
01:43:06.170 --> 01:43:08.590
<v Speaker 2>People like real easy going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let everybody.</v>

2343
01:43:08.591 --> 01:43:12.040
<v Speaker 2>And I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will your dealing with in Los</v>

2344
01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I felt at the moment I got off the</v>

2345
01:43:13.871 --> 01:43:17.260
<v Speaker 2>plane when I went from Montana to here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moment you get here,</v>

2346
01:43:17.261 --> 01:43:19.510
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey gotta go gotta go cut this guy off.</v>

2347
01:43:19.511 --> 01:43:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Get ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get ahead of like there's a feeling in</v>

2348
01:43:22.271 --> 01:43:25.870
<v Speaker 2>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did a study and one of the</v>

2349
01:43:25.871 --> 01:43:30.871
<v Speaker 2>things that they did this study on was</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put up cameras in cities and they</v>

2350
01:43:31.181 --> 01:43:34.960
<v Speaker 2>measured the amount of footsteps that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people take.</v>

2351
01:43:35.170 --> 01:43:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Like how quickly they walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they measured how,</v>

2352
01:43:39.010 --> 01:43:40.900
<v Speaker 2>how many syllables people say in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>minute,</v>

2353
01:43:40.930 --> 01:43:43.930
<v Speaker 2>how quickly they talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And through those two numbers,</v>

2354
01:43:44.110 --> 01:43:49.110
<v Speaker 2>they were able to accurately estimate</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people lived in that city down</v>

2355
01:43:49.211 --> 01:43:50.240
<v Speaker 2>to like a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2356
01:43:50.250 --> 01:43:51.320
<v Speaker 2>I love that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2357
01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:52.173
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

2358
01:43:52.450 --> 01:43:56.060
<v Speaker 1>a shit load of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People walk faster and they talk fast.</v>

2359
01:43:56.450 --> 01:43:59.120
<v Speaker 1>If you have less people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they slow down.</v>

2360
01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gail Collins,</v>

2361
01:44:00.141 --> 01:44:04.760
<v Speaker 1>who is a connoisseur New York Times says</v>
<v Speaker 1>that right wing and left wing people is,</v>

2362
01:44:04.761 --> 01:44:06.050
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about space.</v>

2363
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:07.310
<v Speaker 1>When you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2364
01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:09.650
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become more of a socialist when you</v>

2365
01:44:09.651 --> 01:44:12.380
<v Speaker 1>have to contend with all your neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you live in a building and,</v>

2366
01:44:12.430 --> 01:44:14.210
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires cooperation.</v>

2367
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:17.000
<v Speaker 1>It requires waiting in line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It requires all these things.</v>

2368
01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:21.170
<v Speaker 1>When you live in Bozeman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana and you have all that space,</v>

2369
01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:25.910
<v Speaker 1>you can preach self reliance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sort of talk about the value of,</v>

2370
01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:27.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serenity,</v>

2371
01:44:27.111 --> 01:44:29.060
<v Speaker 1>personal serenity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self reliance and all that stuff.</v>

2372
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:32.540
<v Speaker 1>So it does play a real factor in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

2373
01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:33.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2374
01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:34.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

2375
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:36.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say Malcolm Gladwell in</v>

2376
01:44:36.231 --> 01:44:37.850
<v Speaker 1>his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2377
01:44:37.870 --> 01:44:38.703
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blend,</v>

2378
01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:40.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it was blink where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned,</v>

2379
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people would come to his office and</v>

2380
01:44:43.851 --> 01:44:47.750
<v Speaker 1>if you mentioned Florida raisins and</v>
<v Speaker 1>orange juice,</v>

2381
01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.440
<v Speaker 1>people left the room a lot slower.</v>

2382
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Do you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2383
01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Because they thought of old people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>retirement.</v>

2384
01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it played a factor in their gate.</v>

2385
01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:02.340
<v Speaker 1>They left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they left the fucking all lesson spy</v>

2386
01:45:02.350 --> 01:45:06.860
<v Speaker 1>walked down the aisle where they walked</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the hallway more measured because</v>

2387
01:45:06.861 --> 01:45:07.581
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2388
01:45:07.581 --> 01:45:09.740
<v Speaker 1>you put the idea of an old person in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their brain.</v>

2389
01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was going to say is this</v>

2390
01:45:11.841 --> 01:45:16.841
<v Speaker 1>is where the role of colleges are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because college is sort of</v>

2391
01:45:17.031 --> 01:45:21.080
<v Speaker 1>throw a monkey wrench into that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>college is take a small town and turn it</v>

2392
01:45:21.081 --> 01:45:24.920
<v Speaker 1>very liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ordinarily would not be that way.</v>

2393
01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:27.170
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with small rural</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>

2394
01:45:27.171 --> 01:45:31.250
<v Speaker 1>You usually deal with conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>populations that are Christian and you</v>

2395
01:45:31.251 --> 01:45:33.500
<v Speaker 1>know they're in the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2396
01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Republicans sort of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also something else about</v>

2397
01:45:36.381 --> 01:45:38.510
<v Speaker 1>liberal towns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're little small liberal towns like</v>

2398
01:45:38.511 --> 01:45:39.170
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about.</v>

2399
01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they turn them liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they really do is they take away</v>

2400
01:45:42.411 --> 01:45:44.330
<v Speaker 1>any existential threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the most part,</v>

2401
01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:47.660
<v Speaker 1>they make those towns super safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of rules that would</v>

2402
01:45:47.661 --> 01:45:49.520
<v Speaker 1>penalize anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2403
01:45:49.521 --> 01:45:54.500
<v Speaker 1>young men for misbehaving by punching</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other in the face or imposing their</v>

2404
01:45:54.501 --> 01:45:59.330
<v Speaker 1>aggression on a weaker group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's also what,</v>

2405
01:45:59.390 --> 01:46:02.510
<v Speaker 1>how I characterize a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small academic town.</v>

2406
01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:07.720
<v Speaker 1>They are safe for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe environments for you to figure the</v>

2407
01:46:08.661 --> 01:46:10.630
<v Speaker 1>world out and express yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

2408
01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:12.000
<v Speaker 1>do you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2409
01:46:12.170 --> 01:46:14.570
<v Speaker 1>safe or like boulder is a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2410
01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bull blood sugar sort of,</v>

2411
01:46:16.341 --> 01:46:17.300
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2412
01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:18.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not,</v>

2413
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say low blood sugar because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of like fitness going on</v>

2414
01:46:21.561 --> 01:46:22.460
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boulders.</v>

2415
01:46:22.461 --> 01:46:25.970
<v Speaker 1>One of the fittest towns in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>per capita,</v>

2416
01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:29.760
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of people have low body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're hiking all the time looking</v>

2417
01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:33.540
<v Speaker 1>people and they're in a fantastic</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment like as far as like the,</v>

2418
01:46:33.541 --> 01:46:35.780
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural beauty of the land around</v>

2419
01:46:35.781 --> 01:46:38.390
<v Speaker 1>them and they take advantage of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always hiking and biking and</v>

2420
01:46:38.391 --> 01:46:40.160
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to worry about things</v>

2421
01:46:40.161 --> 01:46:40.994
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2422
01:46:41.810 --> 01:46:46.040
<v Speaker 1>like my friend who grew up in the hood</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that he would,</v>

2423
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 1>he knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew when something was about</v>

2424

<v Speaker 2>to happen and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

2425
01:46:51.511 --> 01:46:54.540
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air changed and your friends might</v>

2426
01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:55.261
<v Speaker 2>be an idiot.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he said he's no,</v>

2429
01:46:56.671 --> 01:46:57.331
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2430

<v Speaker 2>because what happens is it all fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of your friends are idiots.</v>

2431

<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2433
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:04.920

01:47:04.921 --> 01:47:06.660
<v Speaker 2>guy hit a lot of his friends killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2435
01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:11.520
<v Speaker 2>what I would notice and everybody would</v>
<v Speaker 2>notice is that when the shoot I was</v>

2436
01:47:11.521 --> 01:47:13.830
<v Speaker 2>about to happen or a fight was about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>breakout,</v>

2437
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:17.400
<v Speaker 2>he said there was almost like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whatever it was imagined or not,</v>

2438
01:47:17.730 --> 01:47:19.710
<v Speaker 2>there would be this calm before the</v>
<v Speaker 2>storm,</v>

2439
01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:22.200
<v Speaker 2>the air would change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things would settle and then boom,</v>

2440
01:47:22.201 --> 01:47:24.480
<v Speaker 2>something would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said everybody felt that.</v>

2441
01:47:24.481 --> 01:47:26.580
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause we were talking about how my</v>

2442
01:47:26.581 --> 01:47:31.170
<v Speaker 2>friend walked through the Savannah with</v>
<v Speaker 2>his wife who grew up in Kenya and his</v>

2443
01:47:31.171 --> 01:47:33.210
<v Speaker 2>wife knew everything about it.</v>

2444
01:47:33.210 --> 01:47:34.350
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about the lions.</v>

2445
01:47:34.351 --> 01:47:37.140
<v Speaker 2>She knew everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knew animal behavior until she saw</v>

2446
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:41.100
<v Speaker 2>what animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what guess hyenas.</v>

2447
01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Nope people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>

2448
01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Water Buffalo.</v>

2449
01:47:45.150 --> 01:47:46.570
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she looked at her husband,</v>

2450
01:47:46.571 --> 01:47:48.180
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>climb that tree right fucking now.</v>

2451
01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:50.790
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew when she told me to climb the</v>

2452
01:47:50.791 --> 01:47:52.110
<v Speaker 2>tree cause there were lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

2453
01:47:52.111 --> 01:47:54.000
<v Speaker 2>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she's had climbed the tree,</v>

2454
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:55.920
<v Speaker 2>I climbed that fucking tree because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a water buffalo.</v>

2455
01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:58.260
<v Speaker 2>She knew her environment and just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2456
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:59.970
<v Speaker 2>he would walk through the hood and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was safe.</v>

2457
01:47:59.971 --> 01:48:01.350
<v Speaker 2>He knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew how to navigate,</v>

2458
01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.360
<v Speaker 2>but he also knew when something was</v>
<v Speaker 2>about to happen.</v>

2459
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:06.060
<v Speaker 2>There's a great Jim shockey show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim shockey's,</v>

2460
01:48:06.061 --> 01:48:10.000
<v Speaker 2>this really famous conservationist and</v>
<v Speaker 2>big game hunter from Canada.</v>

2461
01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got this great show called</v>

2462
01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:14.370
<v Speaker 2>uncharted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2463
01:48:14.371 --> 01:48:15.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a hunting show,</v>

2464
01:48:15.931 --> 01:48:16.620
<v Speaker 2>but not really.</v>

2465
01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:19.860
<v Speaker 2>It's more of an exploration of culture</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he travels to all these</v>

2466
01:48:19.861 --> 01:48:24.861
<v Speaker 2>different countries and he really gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply embedded in their country and in</v>

2467
01:48:25.021 --> 01:48:27.570
<v Speaker 2>their culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it goes to these strange lands in</v>

2468
01:48:27.571 --> 01:48:30.690
<v Speaker 2>the middle of nowhere in Russia and or</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Soviet Union were former.</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2470
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:33.250
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2471
01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.880
<v Speaker 2>he spent a lot of time in Africa as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2472
01:48:35.881 --> 01:48:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Like he's done a bunch of shows in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa.</v>

2473
01:48:37.891 --> 01:48:38.724
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they would go through this village with</v>

2478
01:48:48.601 --> 01:48:50.550
<v Speaker 2>cameras and people would be showing</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2479
01:48:50.551 --> 01:48:52.740
<v Speaker 2>this guy's missing an arm.</v>

<v Speaker 2>insanely brief.</v>

2516
01:50:22.151 --> 01:50:25.750
<v Speaker 2>They've got a couple of years where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>run the pride and then some new line</v>

2517
01:50:25.751 --> 01:50:27.450
<v Speaker 2>comes along and kills them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2518
01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Even like great bites them so fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have there.</v>

2519
01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.110
<v Speaker 2>They're forced to leave even great</v>
<v Speaker 2>whites,</v>

2520
01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:33.160
<v Speaker 2>great whites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They played.</v>

2521
01:50:33.161 --> 01:50:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had this guy,</v>

2522
01:50:35.651 --> 01:50:37.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul de gelder did our podcast fighter</v>

2523
01:50:37.611 --> 01:50:38.261
<v Speaker 2>and kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

2524
01:50:38.261 --> 01:50:41.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he ended up losing his arm and his hand</v>

2525
01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:44.410
<v Speaker 2>in his leg to a bull shark in Sydney Bay</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Sydney back.</v>

2526
01:50:44.650 --> 01:50:46.430
<v Speaker 2>He goes to punch the sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sharks are brutal.</v>

2527
01:50:46.431 --> 01:50:48.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes to punch the shark and he goes,</v>

2528
01:50:48.130 --> 01:50:50.590
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a hand left and then almost</v>

2529
01:50:50.591 --> 01:50:51.820
<v Speaker 2>died and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2530
01:50:51.821 --> 01:50:53.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was saying having his arm,</v>

2531
01:50:53.411 --> 01:50:55.750
<v Speaker 2>nosy or prestige,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing prosthesis,</v>

2532
01:50:55.751 --> 01:50:57.970
<v Speaker 2>which can close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a carbon fiber one,</v>

2533
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like $90,000.</v>

2534
01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:01.300
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2535
01:51:01.301 --> 01:51:01.931
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2536
01:51:01.931 --> 01:51:04.360
<v Speaker 2>but he was at Australian Navy Seal Jack</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

2537
01:51:04.361 --> 01:51:06.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a handsome guy and just,</v>

2538
01:51:06.191 --> 01:51:06.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2539
01:51:06.791 --> 01:51:08.350
<v Speaker 2>he was lost his arm and leg.</v>

2540
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:09.183
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2541
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:11.740
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about how um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2542
01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:13.780
<v Speaker 2>they played,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>

2543
01:51:14.010 --> 01:51:15.490
<v Speaker 2>there was an area where at least great</v>
<v Speaker 2>whites,</v>

2544
01:51:15.491 --> 01:51:16.690
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bull sharks and stuff.</v>

2545
01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:21.900
<v Speaker 2>And they played the sound of orchids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They played the sound of what they make</v>

2546
01:51:23.081 --> 01:51:24.340
<v Speaker 2>when they're hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Geez.</v>

2547
01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:29.110
<v Speaker 2>And they said that fucking sharks didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>come near that area for six months.</v>

2548
01:51:29.590 --> 01:51:32.140
<v Speaker 2>They were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say I'm Outta here.</v>

2549
01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:35.740
<v Speaker 2>And then what hunts them us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fuck up the orchids.</v>

2550
01:51:36.010 --> 01:51:36.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2551
01:51:36.491 --> 01:51:37.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2552
01:51:37.150 --> 01:51:39.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a constant battle and it always has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

2553
01:51:39.521 --> 01:51:41.740
<v Speaker 2>And I always wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that battle.</v>

2554
01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:45.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of necessary.</v>

2555
01:51:45.041 --> 01:51:49.810
<v Speaker 2>It seems like with the natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously we're striving towards</v>

2556
01:51:49.811 --> 01:51:52.090
<v Speaker 2>some higher state of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is,</v>

2557
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where Buddhist come from</v>

2558
01:51:55.901 --> 01:52:00.100
<v Speaker 2>and meditation comes from and veganism</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from and that doesn't have a</v>

2559
01:52:00.101 --> 01:52:03.550
<v Speaker 2>central nervous shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Utopian ideologies and all these</v>

2560
01:52:03.551 --> 01:52:08.551
<v Speaker 2>thoughts about what we're trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is whether misguided or not,</v>

2561
01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:11.200
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to strive towards</v>

2562
01:52:11.201 --> 01:52:11.830
<v Speaker 2>improvement.</v>

2563
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:15.280
<v Speaker 2>And when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is the state of life and it's</v>

2564
01:52:15.281 --> 01:52:17.410
<v Speaker 2>also the state of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2565
01:52:17.411 --> 01:52:20.170
<v Speaker 2>there has to be some sort of a balance</v>
<v Speaker 2>of power with,</v>

2566
01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:23.410
<v Speaker 2>with animals that are herbivores and</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals that are carnivores.</v>

2567
01:52:23.650 --> 01:52:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Like they're talking about bringing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>cougars on the east coast of the United</v>

2568
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:29.650
<v Speaker 2>States to deal with it because you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>too many deer.</v>

2569
01:52:29.670 --> 01:52:30.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have too many deer,</v>

2570
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:32.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

2571
01:52:32.410 --> 01:52:37.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a really fascinating subject</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a better idea than bringing</v>

2572
01:52:37.791 --> 01:52:39.440
<v Speaker 2>in wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2573
01:52:39.630 --> 01:52:43.090
<v Speaker 2>they're very hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to be wholesale with their</v>

2574
01:52:43.390 --> 01:52:44.830
<v Speaker 2>slaughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

2575
01:52:44.831 --> 01:52:46.730
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of fun killing.</v>

2576
01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.070
<v Speaker 2>They liked the fun kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2577
01:52:49.071 --> 01:52:51.380
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do what they call surplus hunting.</v>

2578
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:53.870
<v Speaker 2>That video I showed you where I shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>that deer in London,</v>

2579
01:52:54.010 --> 01:52:56.240
<v Speaker 2>England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in London.</v>

2580
01:52:56.290 --> 01:52:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I had an hour and a half an hour outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>of London.</v>

2581
01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:00.350
<v Speaker 2>You're hunting in someone's yard.</v>

2582
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my buddy owns this giant.</v>

2583
01:53:02.150 --> 01:53:02.841
<v Speaker 2>My buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2584
01:53:02.841 --> 01:53:03.740
<v Speaker 2>he made a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2585
01:53:03.770 --> 01:53:04.850
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's your property?</v>

2586
01:53:04.851 --> 01:53:05.331
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2587
01:53:05.331 --> 01:53:06.680
<v Speaker 2>can you see down there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2588
01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:07.881
<v Speaker 2>I look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2589
01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:10.240
<v Speaker 2>and can you look that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And basically as far as I looked at it</v>

2590
01:53:10.241 --> 01:53:11.420
<v Speaker 2>was all his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

2591
01:53:11.450 --> 01:53:16.450
<v Speaker 2>by law he needs to kill 21 deer a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his property because the deer are</v>

2592
01:53:17.181 --> 01:53:18.880
<v Speaker 2>such a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2593
01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.460
<v Speaker 2>because there are no natural predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As another thing they,</v>

2594
01:53:21.490 --> 01:53:24.380
<v Speaker 2>they found out today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an article today,</v>

2595
01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:26.310
<v Speaker 2>there was always these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2596
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:30.800
<v Speaker 2>these myths about mountain lions being</v>
<v Speaker 2>loose in England,</v>

2597
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:32.450
<v Speaker 2>in the countryside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2598
01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:36.530
<v Speaker 2>It turns out it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out it came from a zoo that</v>

2599
01:53:36.531 --> 01:53:40.010
<v Speaker 2>just admitted recently that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>released these pumas.</v>

2600
01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They released these fucking mountain</v>

2601
01:53:41.991 --> 01:53:44.630
<v Speaker 2>lions they had in captivity so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people hit like their,</v>

2602
01:53:44.631 --> 01:53:45.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd been ridiculed like,</v>

2603

<v Speaker 2>sheep was motherfuckers drinking.</v>

2605
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.301
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2606
01:53:50.301 --> 01:53:53.030
<v Speaker 2>they were telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These fucking mountain lions were</v>

2607
01:53:53.031 --> 01:53:55.760
<v Speaker 2>released in the 1980s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

2608
01:53:55.761 --> 01:53:57.680
<v Speaker 2>The countryside in England.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

2609
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>here it goes,</v>

2612
01:54:03.590 --> 01:54:06.650
<v Speaker 2>the beasts of Dartmore does high saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>

2613
01:54:06.651 --> 01:54:10.550
<v Speaker 2>more mystery solved as zoo admits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It released pumas into the wild in the</v>

2614
01:54:10.551 --> 01:54:12.800
<v Speaker 2>1980s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was one that was one of those</v>

2615
01:54:12.801 --> 01:54:14.870
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was on that show monster</v>

2616
01:54:14.871 --> 01:54:18.500
<v Speaker 2>quest where they were trying to puting</v>

<v Speaker 2>German shepherd,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I was looking at it and if you look</v>

2622
01:54:30.831 --> 01:54:33.800
<v Speaker 2>at the size of that thing's headed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 75 pounds doesn't look like much</v>

2623

<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2626
01:54:37.190 --> 01:54:41.570
<v Speaker 2>it's horrific how powerful their</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain lions get up to what 150 pounds</v>

2627
01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.520
<v Speaker 2>they can get bigger than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than twice that size.</v>

2628
01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:45.650
<v Speaker 2>It's rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll also,</v>

2629
01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:48.920
<v Speaker 2>their cats and cats are just way more</v>
<v Speaker 2>agile.</v>

<v Speaker 2>lions.</v>

2631
01:54:50.930 --> 01:54:52.410
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2632
01:54:52.570 --> 01:54:55.940
<v Speaker 2>a guide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an elk hunting guide in Colorado and he</v>

2633
01:54:55.941 --> 01:54:59.450
<v Speaker 2>said that they found these tracks of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this mount line.</v>

2634
01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:01.520
<v Speaker 2>They have to kill a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain lions.</v>

2635
01:55:01.521 --> 01:55:05.330
<v Speaker 2>And their property because they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gigantic ranch and you know,</v>

2636
01:55:05.331 --> 01:55:06.220
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2637
01:55:06.250 --> 01:55:09.590
<v Speaker 2>they have a certain amount of tags that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to fill or that they should</v>

2638
01:55:09.591 --> 01:55:11.120
<v Speaker 2>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2639
01:55:11.150 --> 01:55:13.400
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try to control the populations of</v>

2640
01:55:13.401 --> 01:55:15.260
<v Speaker 2>mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were trying to find this</v>

2641
01:55:15.261 --> 01:55:16.920
<v Speaker 2>mountain line attracting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tracking this mountain lion attract</v>

2642
01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:17.893
<v Speaker 2>these tracks.</v>

2643
01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:22.070
<v Speaker 2>And they saw elk tracks and they saw a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain lion tracks and then they saw</v>

2644
01:55:22.071 --> 01:55:24.710
<v Speaker 2>only elk tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

2645
01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Because the mountain lion had jumped on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back of this fucking gigantic 900</v>

2646
01:55:29.271 --> 01:55:34.271
<v Speaker 2>pound bull elk and rode it for 150 yards</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then taking it down.</v>

2647
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:40.580
<v Speaker 2>So this hundred and 50 pound cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wound up killing had killed this,</v>

2648
01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:43.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close to a thousand pound l is unreal</v>

2649
01:55:43.801 --> 01:55:45.330
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when they found it,</v>

2650
01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:49.110
<v Speaker 2>the fucking mountain line was on the elk</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the elk was down and then,</v>

2651
01:55:49.130 --> 01:55:51.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they followed the tracks of this elk</v>

2652
01:55:51.450 --> 01:55:55.560
<v Speaker 2>running with this cat on its back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think just leaped.</v>

2653
01:55:55.561 --> 01:55:58.560
<v Speaker 2>I met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine being something like a person,</v>

2654
01:55:58.590 --> 01:56:00.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weigh 170 pounds.</v>

2655
01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2656
01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:02.670
<v Speaker 2>like a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cat toy,</v>

2657
01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:03.840
<v Speaker 2>and you just decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2658
01:56:03.841 --> 01:56:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to jump on that thousand pound</v>
<v Speaker 2>horse and kill it with my face.</v>

2659
01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:12.360
<v Speaker 2>And their canines have sensors</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently where they can sense where</v>

2660
01:56:12.361 --> 01:56:13.030
<v Speaker 2>the juggler is.</v>

2661
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:15.390
<v Speaker 2>They keep adjusting their grip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

2662
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:17.610
<v Speaker 2>Good God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's nature man?</v>

2663
01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Nature's just so creepy and it's ways of</v>
<v Speaker 2>adjusting to life.</v>

2664
01:56:23.790 --> 01:56:26.140
<v Speaker 2>My friend and dress Antonopoulos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2665
01:56:26.141 --> 01:56:26.851
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend,</v>

2666
01:56:26.851 --> 01:56:28.440
<v Speaker 2>the bitcoin expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain this to me.</v>

2667
01:56:28.441 --> 01:56:33.441
<v Speaker 2>Last weekend in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ducks have three foot long dicks that</v>

2668
01:56:34.801 --> 01:56:39.801
<v Speaker 2>curl and twist because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the female vaginas have adapted to fight</v>

2669
01:56:42.031 --> 01:56:44.100
<v Speaker 2>off rape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>duck rape.</v>

2670
01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:47.990
<v Speaker 2>So they have these pussies that are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fucking labyrinth,</v>

2671
01:56:47.991 --> 01:56:51.180
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these twisty turny a labyrinth,</v>

2672
01:56:51.181 --> 01:56:55.710
<v Speaker 2>pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they can choose to let sperm in or</v>

2673
01:56:55.711 --> 01:56:59.250
<v Speaker 2>not let sperm in with their gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 2>labyrinth,</v>

2674
01:56:59.251 --> 01:57:02.490
<v Speaker 2>pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these three foot long duck dicks,</v>

2675
01:57:02.610 --> 01:57:05.790
<v Speaker 2>when you see a duck's Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you let con that is not real.</v>

2676
01:57:05.850 --> 01:57:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Look at that ducks Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a drawing.</v>

2677
01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:11.580
<v Speaker 2>That's a drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's actual photograph that's an</v>

2678
01:57:11.581 --> 01:57:13.110
<v Speaker 2>actual photograph of a duck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick.</v>

2679
01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:16.260
<v Speaker 2>What in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a person,</v>

2680
01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:18.330
<v Speaker 2>but like a 15 foot long dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2681
01:57:18.450 --> 01:57:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Ducks are tiny man horse to dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a person with a three foot dick is</v>

2682
01:57:22.201 --> 01:57:25.260
<v Speaker 2>a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a duck with a three foot long dick</v>

2683
01:57:25.261 --> 01:57:27.480
<v Speaker 2>is totally standard as a deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a limp.</v>

2684
01:57:27.490 --> 01:57:30.630
<v Speaker 2>One guy's a little little deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets shamed by the other ducks.</v>

2685
01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2686
01:57:31.891 --> 01:57:33.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>duck ducks are ridiculous.</v>

2687
01:57:33.970 --> 01:57:36.300
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking ridiculous animal.</v>

2688
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:41.820
<v Speaker 2>I knew the ducks engaged in rape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gang rape.</v>

2689
01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:42.713
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all they do.</v>

2690
01:57:43.110 --> 01:57:45.180
<v Speaker 2>That's the only one that hung up on one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how,</v>

2691
01:57:45.181 --> 01:57:50.181
<v Speaker 2>look how the female's vagina has sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>adapted to deal with the male raping.</v>

2692
01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:56.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>created these bizarre pathways in their</v>

2693
01:57:56.401 --> 01:57:57.211
<v Speaker 2>pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

2694
01:57:57.211 --> 01:57:59.570
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you listened to Dan Carlin's a</v>

2695
01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:02.130
<v Speaker 2>wrath of the cons are you read history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2696
01:58:02.131 --> 01:58:04.560
<v Speaker 2>and it was always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here we come,</v>

2697
01:58:04.561 --> 01:58:07.180
<v Speaker 2>we're knocking down your walls when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're selling everybody into slavery.</v>

2698
01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:08.730
<v Speaker 2>History is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

2699
01:58:08.731 --> 01:58:10.110
<v Speaker 2>is history of rape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2700
01:58:10.111 --> 01:58:12.690
<v Speaker 2>So most women basically we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got shit.</v>

2701
01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Laws are coming down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're about to,</v>

2702
01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:15.750
<v Speaker 2>our men are going to be killed and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be,</v>

2703
01:58:15.810 --> 01:58:17.970
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be raped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just happened over and over</v>

2704
01:58:17.971 --> 01:58:20.070
<v Speaker 2>and over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that most of history is</v>

2705
01:58:20.071 --> 01:58:21.210
<v Speaker 2>a story like that.</v>

2706
01:58:21.630 --> 01:58:25.440
<v Speaker 2>And women were basically just forced to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be taken by,</v>

2707
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:27.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either group of men or whatever,</v>

2708
01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:29.220
<v Speaker 2>just like most of animal has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2709
01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:30.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

2710
01:58:30.181 --> 01:58:31.590
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just brutal.</v>

2711
01:58:31.591 --> 01:58:33.450
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

2712
01:58:33.451 --> 01:58:36.170
<v Speaker 2>I guess women had to adapt and evolve</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2713
01:58:36.190 --> 01:58:38.550
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this woman wrote an article and I</v>

2714
01:58:38.551 --> 01:58:43.480
<v Speaker 2>came her name cause it was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial and she said that because</v>

2715
01:58:43.810 --> 01:58:45.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much of history,</v>

2716
01:58:45.311 --> 01:58:49.570
<v Speaker 2>women had no choice and they were forced</v>
<v Speaker 2>upon by men.</v>

2717
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:52.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of two things happen.</v>

2718
01:58:52.031 --> 01:58:56.020
<v Speaker 2>First they had to find the man who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most aggressive and strong and who</v>

2719
01:58:56.021 --> 01:59:01.021
<v Speaker 2>could protect them from the other men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for women to be attracted to</v>

2720
01:59:01.421 --> 01:59:06.421
<v Speaker 2>aggression and strength is not so</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncommon.</v>

2721
01:59:07.420 --> 01:59:12.420
<v Speaker 2>But the other really controversial thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said was that there are cases where</v>

2722
01:59:12.911 --> 01:59:16.030
<v Speaker 2>women are turned on by aggressive sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2723
01:59:16.031 --> 01:59:17.470
<v Speaker 2>being held down and all that stuff.</v>

2724
01:59:17.710 --> 01:59:22.150
<v Speaker 2>And it's probably the fact that they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to evolve because otherwise they'd get</v>

2725
01:59:22.151 --> 01:59:24.150
<v Speaker 2>injured if they didn't get lubricated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2726
01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:24.781
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2727
01:59:24.781 --> 01:59:25.511
<v Speaker 2>I read that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2728
01:59:25.511 --> 01:59:26.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck with that.</v>

2729
01:59:26.411 --> 01:59:27.190
<v Speaker 2>But that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2730
01:59:27.190 --> 01:59:29.710
<v Speaker 2>she was a female anthropologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember if fucking name,</v>

2731
01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:31.340
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2732
01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:33.280
<v Speaker 2>only that if can imagine coming out with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that article.</v>

2733
01:59:33.310 --> 01:59:34.720
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's my,</v>

2734
01:59:34.721 --> 01:59:38.170
<v Speaker 2>this is my thesis for a in anthropology</v>
<v Speaker 2>and amherst college,</v>

2735
01:59:38.171 --> 01:59:40.840
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very objective thought</v>

2736
01:59:40.841 --> 01:59:41.920
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

2737
01:59:41.921 --> 01:59:43.780
<v Speaker 2>there's evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just an illusion.</v>

2738
01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called evolving,</v>

2739
01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:48.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in dealing with aggression the way the</v>

2740
01:59:48.311 --> 01:59:51.160
<v Speaker 2>ducks did well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also dealing with the natural world</v>

2741
01:59:51.161 --> 01:59:53.560
<v Speaker 2>that you find yourself in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just filled with danger and</v>

2742
01:59:53.561 --> 01:59:55.900
<v Speaker 2>murder and constant warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2743
01:59:55.901 --> 01:59:57.340
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what people did.</v>

2744
01:59:57.370 --> 01:59:58.090
<v Speaker 2>That's all people do.</v>

2745
01:59:58.090 --> 02:00:00.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was states of peace interrupted by</v>

2746
02:00:00.671 --> 02:00:04.660
<v Speaker 2>war and it states a piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean gingiss con kill in his,</v>

2747
02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:10.020
<v Speaker 2>his children and his armies killed 10%</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the population of the world during</v>

2748
02:00:10.601 --> 02:00:13.630
<v Speaker 2>his lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a New York Times article they</v>

2749
02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:18.520
<v Speaker 2>wrote where they were saying that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>altered the carbon footprint of human</v>

2750
02:00:18.521 --> 02:00:22.150
<v Speaker 2>beings on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a measurable altering of the carbon</v>

2751
02:00:22.151 --> 02:00:24.250
<v Speaker 2>footprint because they had killed so</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people.</v>

2752
02:00:25.150 --> 02:00:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Like you could measure the difference in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of people that were there</v>

2753
02:00:28.661 --> 02:00:32.290
<v Speaker 2>before him and after him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By core samples.</v>

2754
02:00:32.291 --> 02:00:33.124
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2755
02:00:33.610 --> 02:00:34.211
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2756
02:00:34.211 --> 02:00:37.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean Hitler did something similar in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russian countryside.</v>

2757
02:00:37.061 --> 02:00:41.740
<v Speaker 2>He killed entire villages because he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to clear an area for,</v>

2758
02:00:42.010 --> 02:00:44.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the migration of the German</v>

2759
02:00:44.351 --> 02:00:46.540
<v Speaker 2>peoples and the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2760
02:00:46.541 --> 02:00:49.930
<v Speaker 2>let's get rid of these sort of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that think and talk differently and</v>

2761
02:00:49.931 --> 02:00:51.670
<v Speaker 2>let's create a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a utopia.</v>

2762
02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:56.260
<v Speaker 2>We'll what gingiss topcon did that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fucked up as he did it all before</v>

2763
02:00:56.261 --> 02:00:57.970
<v Speaker 2>there was even guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2764
02:00:57.971 --> 02:01:02.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's doing bows and arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They killed [inaudible] hand somewhere</v>

2765
02:01:02.111 --> 02:01:06.820
<v Speaker 2>in the neighborhood of 50 to 70 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>people while he was alive.</v>

2766
02:01:06.850 --> 02:01:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2767
02:01:07.841 --> 02:01:09.220
<v Speaker 2>I think that what he said was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>neat.</v>

2768
02:01:09.221 --> 02:01:10.054
<v Speaker 2>I never forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said there were,</v>

2769
02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:15.070
<v Speaker 2>the Romans would create a wasteland and</v>
<v Speaker 2>call it peace and to an extent the,</v>

2770
02:01:16.210 --> 02:01:17.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2771
02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:19.510
<v Speaker 2>the con,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Gaviscon did the same thing.</v>

2772
02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:20.531
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

2773
02:01:20.531 --> 02:01:22.970
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is how history looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>at them now.</v>

2774
02:01:22.971 --> 02:01:25.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that Dan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carlin was talking about.</v>

2775
02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Colin was talking about how people tend</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look in the future.</v>

2776
02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:34.420
<v Speaker 2>They'll look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was actually using it in,</v>

2777
02:01:34.421 --> 02:01:35.710
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of like,</v>

2778
02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:38.950
<v Speaker 2>would people do this with the Nazis that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

2779
02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 2>when enough</v>

2780
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:41.780
<v Speaker 1>time has passed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

2781
02:01:41.781 --> 02:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he cleared the road for trade to the</v>

2782
02:01:44.331 --> 02:01:45.164
<v Speaker 1>east.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2783
02:01:45.250 --> 02:01:46.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2784
02:01:46.091 --> 02:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the silver lining in,</v>

2785
02:01:47.761 --> 02:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>in massive genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2786
02:01:49.540 --> 02:01:50.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2787
02:01:50.090 --> 02:01:53.350
<v Speaker 1>And that very controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course with everything it would,</v>

2788
02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:55.280
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to exactly what we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

2789
02:01:55.281 --> 02:01:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where when you come up in the ghetto,</v>

2790
02:01:58.101 --> 02:02:01.010
<v Speaker 1>you might just create miles Davis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of heartache and</v>

2791
02:02:01.011 --> 02:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>terrible things and from shit is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brightest flower,</v>

2792
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:07.310
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once there's enough time passed,</v>

2793
02:02:07.330 --> 02:02:11.720
<v Speaker 1>then you can sort of look at it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this distance and you can kind of</v>

2794
02:02:11.721 --> 02:02:13.160
<v Speaker 1>objectively look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2795
02:02:13.161 --> 02:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the benefit of that.</v>

2796
02:02:14.601 --> 02:02:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Here's the silver lining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where that doesn't really hold up though</v>

2797
02:02:17.871 --> 02:02:22.460
<v Speaker 1>is if you look at where the bulk of</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation and uh,</v>

2798
02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>our artistic expression on a high level</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out of it came out of free</v>

2799
02:02:26.541 --> 02:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>

2800
02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:29.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at what Sparta left behind,</v>

2801
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:32.270
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look at what Athens left behind.</v>

2802
02:02:32.630 --> 02:02:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Look at Sparta lift behind a deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of warriors.</v>

2803
02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Mythologize but nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can really hang your hat on.</v>

2804
02:02:39.531 --> 02:02:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Another words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>story and,</v>

2805
02:02:41.331 --> 02:02:45.170
<v Speaker 1>and I talk about hardship and separating</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child from his mother and all that</v>

2806
02:02:45.171 --> 02:02:46.910
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're Ron Butler,</v>

2807
02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:50.600
<v Speaker 1>300 and kicking people into wells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yes,</v>

2808
02:02:50.601 --> 02:02:51.050
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2809
02:02:51.050 --> 02:02:52.550
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

2810
02:02:52.551 --> 02:02:55.160
<v Speaker 1>there's a mythology that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a warrior ethos that you can,</v>

2811
02:02:55.161 --> 02:02:55.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

2812
02:02:55.731 --> 02:02:56.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm a spartan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2813
02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:00.590
<v Speaker 1>but Athens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Acropolis and the writings of all</v>

2814
02:03:00.591 --> 02:03:03.440
<v Speaker 1>the bug cracking and philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the butt fucking,</v>

2815
02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of demos that democracy at</v>

2816
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:07.223
<v Speaker 1>Demos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>

2817
02:03:07.490 --> 02:03:11.390
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are ideas that still live on and</v>

2818
02:03:11.391 --> 02:03:13.010
<v Speaker 1>were built upon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2819
02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>

2820
02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:16.850
<v Speaker 1>look at in today's world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of innovation that's coming</v>

2821
02:03:16.851 --> 02:03:21.851
<v Speaker 1>out of a peaceful society and a society</v>
<v Speaker 1>that respects other peoples' ideas and a</v>

2822
02:03:21.951 --> 02:03:24.590
<v Speaker 1>society that for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2823
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>at least from a historical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives a great deal of freedom and a</v>

2824
02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:32.720
<v Speaker 1>benefit to those that have the guts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with their own ideas.</v>

2825
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the interesting aspect about what</v>

2826
02:03:34.821 --> 02:03:39.821
<v Speaker 1>the United States is as this experiment</v>
<v Speaker 1>in self government and what it is,</v>

2827
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:43.940
<v Speaker 1>what it started off as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it is currently is that this is the</v>

2828
02:03:43.941 --> 02:03:48.560
<v Speaker 1>most recent of countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the one that has</v>

2829
02:03:48.650 --> 02:03:52.580
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly the most innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most artistic,</v>

2830
02:03:52.910 --> 02:03:54.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the contributions,</v>

2831
02:03:54.990 --> 02:03:57.510
<v Speaker 1>the pioneers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much that comes out of here.</v>

2832
02:03:57.530 --> 02:04:00.590
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of comedy film,</v>

2833
02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:03.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously the rest of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>has its contributions.</v>

2834
02:04:03.430 --> 02:04:05.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that United States is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

2835
02:04:05.391 --> 02:04:08.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Beatles came out of England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of amazing works of art</v>

2836
02:04:08.601 --> 02:04:13.601
<v Speaker 1>that come out of all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this country is a hotbed of artistic</v>

2837
02:04:13.761 --> 02:04:18.230
<v Speaker 1>expression by far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by far and away the biggest,</v>

2838
02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:22.400
<v Speaker 1>and it's the most recent now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oldest country that we know of,</v>

2839
02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:24.710
<v Speaker 1>the cradle of civilization is the Middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>East,</v>

2840
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

2841
02:04:26.150 --> 02:04:27.530
<v Speaker 1>those are the townies of the world.</v>

2842
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:30.140
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the thought that I've been</v>

2843
02:04:30.141 --> 02:04:32.990
<v Speaker 1>bounced around for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is the reason why those places</v>

2844
02:04:32.991 --> 02:04:36.740
<v Speaker 1>are so fucked up is cause there's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>echoes of savages.</v>

2845
02:04:36.741 --> 02:04:40.530
<v Speaker 1>The echoes of these ancient people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>still in this area.</v>

2846
02:04:40.531 --> 02:04:42.570
<v Speaker 1>It's so difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to get out of the fucking</v>

2847
02:04:42.571 --> 02:04:43.404
<v Speaker 1>town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2848
02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:46.710
<v Speaker 1>You got to leave the town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well was he the great tragedy is that</v>

2849
02:04:46.770 --> 02:04:47.131
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2850
02:04:47.131 --> 02:04:49.680
<v Speaker 1>and they've done a lot of studies on why</v>
<v Speaker 1>do some nations,</v>

2851
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:53.100
<v Speaker 1>why does some nations fail and why does</v>
<v Speaker 1>some nations,</v>

2852
02:04:53.380 --> 02:04:54.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become prosperous?</v>

2853
02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:58.110
<v Speaker 1>And you can break it down into a number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>

2854
02:04:58.290 --> 02:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>You can see the problem with the Middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>East for a thousand reasons.</v>

2855
02:05:01.411 --> 02:05:01.981
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2856
02:05:01.981 --> 02:05:04.960
<v Speaker 1>two and a lot of it was just a foreign</v>
<v Speaker 1>invasion and,</v>

2857
02:05:04.961 --> 02:05:06.690
<v Speaker 1>and foreign meddling and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2858
02:05:06.691 --> 02:05:08.670
<v Speaker 1>But how about getting his con yes.</v>

2859
02:05:08.670 --> 02:05:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did what he did to bag that in 1260,</v>

2860
02:05:10.861 --> 02:05:13.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that to this day Baghdad maybe</v>

2861
02:05:13.351 --> 02:05:16.680
<v Speaker 1>still hasn't recovered from them</v>
<v Speaker 1>invading and killed.</v>

2862
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:21.830
<v Speaker 1>They said that the rivers ran red with</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood and ink black ink,</v>

2863
02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:25.290
<v Speaker 1>like all the amazing works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like viber is burned and everything</v>

2864
02:05:25.590 --> 02:05:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Islamic scholars throughout history were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like innovators.</v>

2865
02:05:29.341 --> 02:05:33.530
<v Speaker 1>They were like the huge contributions</v>
<v Speaker 1>math philosophy course.</v>

2866
02:05:34.170 --> 02:05:34.781
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2867
02:05:34.781 --> 02:05:37.980
<v Speaker 1>and there are a lot of people say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East has never even</v>

2868
02:05:37.981 --> 02:05:40.170
<v Speaker 1>recovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has never quite recovered from that.</v>

2869
02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:43.410
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are so many important things for</v>

2870
02:05:43.411 --> 02:05:44.790
<v Speaker 1>why a nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2871
02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:48.270
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is that your political parties that</v>

2872
02:05:48.271 --> 02:05:53.271
<v Speaker 1>lose live to see another day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is very important when you lose an</v>

2873
02:05:54.361 --> 02:05:57.390
<v Speaker 1>election and a lot of countries like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard liners,</v>

2874
02:05:57.391 --> 02:05:58.710
<v Speaker 1>and somebody said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2875
02:05:58.711 --> 02:06:00.480
<v Speaker 1>why are the hard liners in Iran such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain in the ass?</v>

2876
02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:01.920
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they lose,</v>

2877
02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:05.130
<v Speaker 1>they will die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very important thing to keep in</v>

2878
02:06:05.131 --> 02:06:08.160
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you have power and your survival</v>

2879
02:06:08.161 --> 02:06:11.430
<v Speaker 1>depends on holding onto power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a secret police</v>

2880
02:06:11.431 --> 02:06:15.030
<v Speaker 1>that basically it's pretty brutal when</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they sniff any kind of</v>

2881
02:06:15.031 --> 02:06:17.490
<v Speaker 1>insurrection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This country is pretty amazing.</v>

2882
02:06:17.491 --> 02:06:20.940
<v Speaker 1>What's so unique about the United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>is after the revolutionary war,</v>

2883
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:25.110
<v Speaker 1>after every revolutionary war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country always breaks into civil war</v>

2884
02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:27.840
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the founding fathers had incredible</v>

2885
02:06:27.841 --> 02:06:32.841
<v Speaker 1>restraint and wisdom to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to allow the election after that war to</v>

2886
02:06:34.201 --> 02:06:37.050
<v Speaker 1>go as it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't resort to violence.</v>

2887
02:06:37.140 --> 02:06:42.140
<v Speaker 1>That's so unique in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our country and the UK and Australia</v>

2888
02:06:42.301 --> 02:06:46.800
<v Speaker 1>and Canada and a couple other countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you lose is that democracy is built</v>

2889
02:06:46.801 --> 02:06:48.840
<v Speaker 1>on the idea that when your political</v>
<v Speaker 1>party loses you,</v>

2890
02:06:48.841 --> 02:06:53.130
<v Speaker 1>you lived to see another day and fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>on very important.</v>

2891
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:56.640
<v Speaker 1>The other is property rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll need property rights.</v>

2892
02:06:56.670 --> 02:06:59.580
<v Speaker 1>The other is courts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means something and the other is</v>

2893
02:06:59.581 --> 02:07:02.370
<v Speaker 1>the scientific method.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to embrace the scientific</v>

2894
02:07:02.371 --> 02:07:05.850
<v Speaker 1>method.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A society has to say that it's not about</v>

2895
02:07:05.851 --> 02:07:08.130
<v Speaker 1>superstition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a theology.</v>

2896
02:07:08.610 --> 02:07:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's base reality on what you can</v>

2897
02:07:11.311 --> 02:07:15.540
<v Speaker 1>measure and what you can see that those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are so fucking important.</v>

2898
02:07:15.541 --> 02:07:20.250
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those central principles as a through</v>

2899
02:07:20.251 --> 02:07:22.710
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's not the scaffolding of your</v>

2900
02:07:22.711 --> 02:07:25.170
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to do,</v>

2901
02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:28.440
<v Speaker 1>you're just not going to do as well as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>country like the United States.</v>

2902
02:07:28.441 --> 02:07:31.860
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to have people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovate because there's no fucking</v>

2903
02:07:31.861 --> 02:07:33.510
<v Speaker 1>incentive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no incentive in it.</v>

2904
02:07:33.570 --> 02:07:36.190
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to benefit from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could get it stolen</v>

2905
02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:40.030
<v Speaker 2>or you could be killed because you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>differently or all those things will</v>

2906
02:07:40.031 --> 02:07:41.790
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not safe enough to innovate.</v>

2907
02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the ability to express</v>

2908
02:07:44.171 --> 02:07:46.090
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the ability to take</v>

2909
02:07:46.091 --> 02:07:47.050
<v Speaker 2>chances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2910
02:07:47.051 --> 02:07:49.060
<v Speaker 2>So the irony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ironic thing is when you're</v>

2911
02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:52.930
<v Speaker 2>sensitive and nice to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're empathetic and when you're</v>

2912
02:07:52.931 --> 02:07:55.720
<v Speaker 2>respectful of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the ones you don't have this you</v>

2913
02:07:55.721 --> 02:07:59.140
<v Speaker 2>disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make a stronger society.</v>

2914
02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:03.160
<v Speaker 2>The society is stronger in every way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including militarily,</v>

2915
02:08:03.370 --> 02:08:05.570
<v Speaker 2>including you have more innovation with</v>
<v Speaker 2>militant,</v>

2916
02:08:05.571 --> 02:08:06.070
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2917
02:08:06.070 --> 02:08:07.840
<v Speaker 2>with weaponry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on that note,</v>

2918
02:08:07.870 --> 02:08:08.800
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm smart guys.</v>

2919
02:08:08.801 --> 02:08:10.660
<v Speaker 2>Did you write that shit down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

2920
02:08:10.661 --> 02:08:12.400
<v Speaker 2>You want to hear more?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have your own podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 2>with a guy named Brendan Schaub.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

02:08:18.550 --> 02:08:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But let's talk about the fight and the</v>

2927
02:08:20.031 --> 02:08:22.150
<v Speaker 2>kid for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause Brennan Brennan will beat me up if</v>

2928

<v Speaker 2>I don't talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>July 29th July till he hits me,</v>

2929
02:08:25.361 --> 02:08:27.070
<v Speaker 2>he strikes me with an open hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

2930
02:08:27.230 --> 02:08:29.080
<v Speaker 2>he pulls my pants down and spanks me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2931
02:08:29.081 --> 02:08:30.640

<v Speaker 2>And I've tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to find him and it bothers me</v>

2933

<v Speaker 2>cause sometimes I get jumpy with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get jumpy and I'll get under hooks on</v>

2934

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2952
02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:09.370
<v Speaker 2>I have blue been talking about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>

2953
02:09:09.371 --> 02:09:14.371
<v Speaker 2>that I think that people have a massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>owes overestimation massive of what they</v>

2954
02:09:14.651 --> 02:09:17.020
<v Speaker 2>can and can't do with their body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's we,</v>

2955
02:09:17.050 --> 02:09:18.730
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hang around for any shop,</v>

2956
02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:19.610
<v Speaker 2>hang around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brennan Shop,</v>

2957
02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:22.480
<v Speaker 2>forget bearing to shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We played this video of these people</v>

2958
02:09:22.481 --> 02:09:27.481
<v Speaker 2>that put on these gigantic balloon suits</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let bowls hit them.</v>

2959
02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:29.320
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't seen this?</v>

2960

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll end on this.</v>

2961
02:09:30.910 --> 02:09:33.700
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking insane that these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say this,</v>

2962
02:09:33.970 --> 02:09:37.210
<v Speaker 2>but I think people have this idea in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their head that all the bolts come in.</v>

2963
02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:39.610

<v Speaker 2>You don't realize like they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they massively overestimate what they</v>

2965
02:09:42.851 --> 02:09:44.920
<v Speaker 2>can and can't do with their body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they move their body.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the legs like say goodbye to your acl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this,</v>

2974
02:10:06.881 --> 02:10:08.740
<v Speaker 2>watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

2975
02:10:09.130 --> 02:10:11.410
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh leak.</v>

2976
02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are massive,</v>

2977
02:10:13.270 --> 02:10:15.670
<v Speaker 2>massive animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bulls are so mean.</v>

2978
02:10:15.671 --> 02:10:18.430
<v Speaker 2>And meanwhile they just eat grass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like he's not hurt.</v>

2979
02:10:18.490 --> 02:10:20.390
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if bulls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be nicer if they had a stake</v>

2980
02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:22.900
<v Speaker 2>wait for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2981
02:10:22.901 --> 02:10:23.860
<v Speaker 2>because he gets worse.</v>

2982
02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2983
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:27.410
<v Speaker 2>oh Jeez man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is good.</v>

2984
02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:30.130
<v Speaker 2>This is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just started.</v>

2985
02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are laughing.</v>

2986
02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:33.620
<v Speaker 2>This is what people in rural</v>
<v Speaker 2>environments do.</v>

2987
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:37.570
<v Speaker 2>They laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they low my hands and I would never do</v>

2988
02:10:37.630 --> 02:10:42.630
<v Speaker 2>that fucking hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy got the air.</v>

2989
02:10:43.101 --> 02:10:45.700
<v Speaker 2>That gentleman got Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2990
02:10:45.710 --> 02:10:47.870
<v Speaker 2>That guy is fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he hit him again while he's out</v>

2991
02:10:47.871 --> 02:10:50.900
<v Speaker 2>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that dude flew through the air</v>

2992
02:10:51.050 --> 02:10:52.580
<v Speaker 2>flu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2993
02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:54.230
<v Speaker 2>what about your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro?</v>

2994
02:10:54.260 --> 02:10:57.290
<v Speaker 2>One more time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2995
02:10:57.320 --> 02:10:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like that bowl doesn't have</v>

2996
02:10:58.581 --> 02:11:00.670
<v Speaker 2>horns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably saw good morning God,</v>

2997
02:11:01.070 --> 02:11:02.490
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not saving anything.</v>

2998
02:11:02.570 --> 02:11:04.580
<v Speaker 2>I might have to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have the gun.</v>

2999
02:11:04.610 --> 02:11:05.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't do that.</v>

3000
02:11:05.451 --> 02:11:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other ones.</v>

3001
02:11:06.411 --> 02:11:09.110
<v Speaker 2>This is one that we looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've figured out a way to do it</v>

3002
02:11:09.111 --> 02:11:09.944
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3003
02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:14.000
<v Speaker 2>And the better one is a much larger ball</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're completely encase,</v>

3004
02:11:14.110 --> 02:11:15.570
<v Speaker 2>then you're late.</v>

3005
02:11:16.010 --> 02:11:19.460
<v Speaker 2>You can't have it from you fucking waste</v>
<v Speaker 2>down because your legs are like super</v>

3006
02:11:19.461 --> 02:11:24.461
<v Speaker 2>flexible or a super weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My knees getting broken by a bull's head</v>

3007
02:11:25.370 --> 02:11:28.790
<v Speaker 2>and they will get Brogan bios.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would find the one,</v>

3008
02:11:28.791 --> 02:11:29.624
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got the other one.</v>

3009
02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:30.650
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

3010
02:11:30.770 --> 02:11:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's,</v>

3011
02:11:31.821 --> 02:11:34.100
<v Speaker 2>there's other videos of them doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they figure,</v>

3012
02:11:34.130 --> 02:11:34.920
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

3013
02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:38.290
<v Speaker 2>is not safe enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to get a much larger bottom.</v>

3014
02:11:38.350 --> 02:11:40.160
<v Speaker 2>It's much harder to hear the people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience.</v>

3015
02:11:40.161 --> 02:11:42.700
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens when you get a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of farmers and they're drunk and they</v>

3016
02:11:42.710 --> 02:11:44.390
<v Speaker 2>just want to fucking each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3017
02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:45.470
<v Speaker 2>On the snake tip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3018
02:11:45.471 --> 02:11:48.590

<v Speaker 2>other like crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's no one around just like fucking</v>

<v Speaker 2>30 people in the town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all fucking each other's wives.</v>
