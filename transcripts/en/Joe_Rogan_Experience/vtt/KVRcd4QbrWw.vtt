80
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.770
<v Speaker 1>experience</v>

81
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a few years back,</v>

82
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.730
<v Speaker 2>my friend Gordon has to,</v>

83
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 1>who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy that I met on the Internet,</v>

84
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

85
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>do you want to have dinner with Hixon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gracie?</v>

86
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah man,</v>

87
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.160
<v Speaker 1>if you are a Jujitsu practitioner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare in a sport.</v>

89
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's a few sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you think bike racing,</v>

90
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think Lance Armstrong,</v>

91
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the name,</v>

92
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.350
<v Speaker 1>but the universal name that gets thrown </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in Jujitsu,</v>

93
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 1>there's the last name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is gracie.</v>

94
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>And then once you get to know Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you understand Jujitsu and you get,</v>

95
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 1>you start training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody always wants to know who's the</v>

96
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the best,</v>

97
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.110
<v Speaker 1>who's the best universally regarded as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the all time best is your father,</v>

98
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.240
<v Speaker 1>your father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hicks,</v>

99
00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:23.241
<v Speaker 1>and Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not much debate amongst Jujitsu </v>

100
00:05:23.241 --> 00:05:26.310
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's debate as to who's the best </v>

101
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.621
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I talked to Henzel about this one </v>

102
00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:32.191
<v Speaker 1>time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Enzo just shook his head and he </v>

103
00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a motherfucker.</v>

104
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a motherfucker.</v>

105
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.310
<v Speaker 1>His is laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's the best.</v>

106
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.340
<v Speaker 1>He's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when a guy like henslow's says </v>

107
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.340
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just listened,</v>

108
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what is it?</v>

109
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.890
<v Speaker 1>That's when I met you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

110
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 1>you were with your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we went and had some dinner and then</v>

111
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:51.130
<v Speaker 1>we went back to your house and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched some fights,</v>

112
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.810
<v Speaker 1>which was amazing to have your dad break</v>
<v Speaker 1>down what,</v>

113
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>what guys are doing wrong and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with their positioning,</v>

114
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with their approach and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what his approach is.</v>

115
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.440
<v Speaker 1>And for me as a student of martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as a fan of martial arts,</v>

116
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.980
<v Speaker 1>it was a huge honor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.230
<v Speaker 1>and you were like 16 or 17 back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

118
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Something like that that you were into </v>
<v Speaker 1>rap music and all kinds of different </v>

119
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so from that,</v>

120
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've run into a few times over the years</v>

122
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:29.681
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when hoists fought Matt Hughes and a </v>

123
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 1>couple other times you've become </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

124
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 1>like one of the most prominent Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters in the world today.</v>

125
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's so cool to see.</v>

126
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.180
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool to see a young kid with </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspirations and then put in the work.</v>

127
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's also cool to see the son of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great man become a great man himself,</v>

128
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 1>which is very difficult and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really happen that often.</v>

129
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times the sign of a great man </v>

130
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 1>lives in the shadow of his father and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of fall short.</v>

131
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.330
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 1>you and your young life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 25 now,</v>

133
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.830
<v Speaker 1>25 and your young life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already carved out a great name </v>

134
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 1>in Jujitsu with your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments.</v>

135
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 1>You're widely considered to be amongst </v>
<v Speaker 1>the very best in the world at Jujitsu.</v>

136
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.610
<v Speaker 1>And how does that feel?</v>

137
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 3>It feels great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

138
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.770
<v Speaker 3>now finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after so long of,</v>

139
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I knew when I was a little kid </v>

140
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.940
<v Speaker 3>that I was going to have to be a fighter</v>
<v Speaker 3>or be a martial artist and have to,</v>

141
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.020
<v Speaker 3>you have to really be as much as my dad </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to make it feel like he didn't put</v>

142
00:07:35.191 --> 00:07:36.120
<v Speaker 3>pressure on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

143
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.100
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>

144
00:07:38.101 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people say he teaches invisible Jujitsu.</v>

145
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk about invisible pressure,</v>

146
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:46.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

147
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:51.150
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like at an early age when first when I'm</v>

148
00:07:51.151 --> 00:07:52.650
<v Speaker 3>a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can kind of always see,</v>

149
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much my dad trains and how much he,</v>

150
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 3>how big he is a part of what he does in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and how much people respect </v>

151
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.170
<v Speaker 3>him and how much recognition you get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from a very early age,</v>

152
00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:09.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to replicate that and you want </v>

153
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:09.171
<v Speaker 3>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

154
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:10.980
<v Speaker 3>what your father does if it feels like </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool to you.</v>

155
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 3>And it's always been really cool to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course when I was a younger up until </v>

156
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.030
<v Speaker 3>like 12 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to skate a lot in Jujitsu is kind</v>

157
00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:23.031
<v Speaker 3>of whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I knew that in the future that that </v>

158
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:23.130
<v Speaker 3>was what I was going to have to do no </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter what.</v>

159
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.810
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

160
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.910
<v Speaker 3>it came to a point where I kind of put </v>
<v Speaker 3>skateboarding aside and uh,</v>

161
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.230
<v Speaker 3>I had gotten hurt skateboarding a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 3>of times and I was like,</v>

162
00:08:31.231 --> 00:08:31.780
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

163
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about skateboarding as much</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I do Jujitsu.</v>

164
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be as good as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>skateboarder as I can be with to which </v>

165
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.340
<v Speaker 3>this kind of all clicked for me a one </v>
<v Speaker 3>day with my brother,</v>

166
00:08:44.341 --> 00:08:44.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

167
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.870
<v Speaker 3>we were talking and everything and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like one of the last conversations </v>

168
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:50.700
<v Speaker 3>we had and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was always like,</v>

169
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

170
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.470
<v Speaker 3>whatever you do in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do it one percent,</v>

171
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

172
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do it the best you can do it.</v>

173
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to be a dentist,</v>

174
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 3>you'd be the best dentist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can be a skateboarder,</v>

175
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 3>you'd be the best skateboarder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the only difference is right here,</v>

176
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 3>you have an opportunity to do Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have the best road.</v>

177
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 3>You have the best dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a coach.</v>

178
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 3>You have the best at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tools you need to really be the best</v>

179
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:19.731
<v Speaker 3>you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it would be stupid for you not to </v>

180
00:09:19.731 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 3>really take advantage of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that kind of happened when I was 12.</v>

181
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:25.791
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after my brother passed I kind of </v>

182
00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:29.331
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really put effort into that and I kind </v>

183
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:32.511
<v Speaker 3>of really made it my mission to make him</v>
<v Speaker 3>proud and to make my dad proud and I </v>

184
00:09:32.511 --> 00:09:36.771
<v Speaker 3>kind of knew what I had in my hands and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at that age you never know how good </v>

185
00:09:36.771 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get and you never know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's gonna happen.</v>

186
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:40.860
<v Speaker 3>So I just kind of dedicated myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dedicated myself.</v>

187
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:41.930
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

188
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we met each other I was still fully</v>

189
00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:47.780
<v Speaker 3>dedicated but I still hadn't achieved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

190
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything really.</v>

191
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.360
<v Speaker 3>And I think like with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

192
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.060
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in life when you,</v>

193
00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

194
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.300
<v Speaker 3>when you try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you try,</v>

195
00:10:00.301 --> 00:10:05.301
<v Speaker 3>when you try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you try is you only get what you </v>

196
00:10:05.301 --> 00:10:05.301
<v Speaker 3>think you're going to get way later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

197
00:10:05.301 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 3>like I put so much dedication into it by</v>
<v Speaker 3>16 years old.</v>

198
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 3>But I hadn't seen any of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the fruits and I hadn't seen any,</v>

199
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.020
<v Speaker 3>any necessarily like big reward from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

200
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:20.050
<v Speaker 3>So it was basically just the passion of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to train Jujitsu and being </v>

201
00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.600
<v Speaker 3>able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do what I knew was my mission.</v>

202
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.170
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

203
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.040
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

204
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.100
<v Speaker 3>I kind of lost my track a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was going to say,</v>

205
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:29.730
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

206
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.390
<v Speaker 3>so basically from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from that age,</v>

207
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

208
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was always like I knew that I had to </v>

209
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 3>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

210
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.100
<v Speaker 3>as much as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as things would always.</v>

211
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:46.130
<v Speaker 3>Like there's always little things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>go in your head that you might want to </v>

212
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.451
<v Speaker 3>like change your or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in my mind it was never an option </v>

213
00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 3>not to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do Jujitsu and never an option not to</v>

214
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:52.920
<v Speaker 3>be the best I can be and to be the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>

215
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:54.630
<v Speaker 3>That was always like where I was going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>

216
00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:56.490
<v Speaker 3>I never had a plan b.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had a,</v>

217
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just going to try this and then if</v>

218
00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:00.930
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never had that from you.</v>

219
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:03.660
<v Speaker 3>As always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was where I put my energy.</v>

220
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.640
<v Speaker 3>And so I kind of just put my energy into</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

221
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:07.930
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

222
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.750
<v Speaker 3>from a very early age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from 12,</v>

223
00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 3>13,</v>
<v Speaker 3>14,</v>

224
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.580
<v Speaker 3>everybody knew me as crone Hixson Hixson</v>
<v Speaker 3>zone or you're hitting.</v>

225
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:19.440
<v Speaker 3>So I already kind of hated that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hated being called Hixon son.</v>

226
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:24.441
<v Speaker 3>I hate it being called Hawkins over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hated being called somebody that I </v>

227
00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:24.441
<v Speaker 3>wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

228
00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:26.190
<v Speaker 3>and like being recognized for something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I didn't do somebody other than who</v>

229
00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:26.910
<v Speaker 3>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

230
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.940
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of always knew that if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to to climb out of this name and </v>

231
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.420
<v Speaker 3>climb out of the shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have to work twice as hard.</v>

232
00:11:33.421 --> 00:11:38.421
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was going to be a real obstacle for </v>

233
00:11:38.421 --> 00:11:38.640
<v Speaker 3>me to get past this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I,</v>

234
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.430
<v Speaker 3>in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was my ending goal no matter what I</v>

235
00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:46.431
<v Speaker 3>want it to be my own man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to be able to represent myself </v>

236
00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:50.691
<v Speaker 3>and my family and everything and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to be able to be remembered as </v>

237
00:11:50.691 --> 00:11:53.160
<v Speaker 3>somebody who kept it going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kept the legacy going.</v>

238
00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.880
<v Speaker 1>For folks who don't have any experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>in martial arts,</v>

239
00:11:56.881 --> 00:11:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to explain this to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

240
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.230
<v Speaker 1>when you really stop and think about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of martial arts,</v>

241
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.240
<v Speaker 1>there's the most important moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion of modern martial arts was</v>

242
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:15.000
<v Speaker 1>hoists gracie entering into the UFC in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1993 when hoists gracie entered into the</v>

243
00:12:15.001 --> 00:12:20.001
<v Speaker 1>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw for the first time in a real </v>

244
00:12:20.001 --> 00:12:23.300
<v Speaker 1>application,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw what we had always wanted to see </v>

245
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.601
<v Speaker 1>in the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A smaller man with technique defeating </v>

246
00:12:26.601 --> 00:12:27.600
<v Speaker 1>larger men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a smaller man.</v>

247
00:12:27.601 --> 00:12:32.601
<v Speaker 1>You're utilizing leverage in utilizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>his skills to defeat everybody in front </v>

248
00:12:33.571 --> 00:12:38.571
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from that we got introduced to the </v>

249
00:12:38.571 --> 00:12:40.530
<v Speaker 1>name Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got introduced to your father.</v>

250
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.620
<v Speaker 1>We got introduced to Leo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your grandfather,</v>

251
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.010
<v Speaker 1>who was the most important figure in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of martial arts.</v>

252
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.500
<v Speaker 1>For folks who don't know martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the longest time,</v>

253
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.280
<v Speaker 1>for thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was all this debate about what was</v>

254
00:12:56.281 --> 00:13:01.281
<v Speaker 1>the best style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was a karate or whether it </v>

255
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:01.281
<v Speaker 1>was Kung Fu.</v>

256
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:05.750
<v Speaker 1>There was all these different people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that swore that their master could </v>

257
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:06.360
<v Speaker 1>defeat a thousand men and unarmed </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat.</v>

258
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:11.690
<v Speaker 1>No one knew what the real deal was until</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC came along and that was when the</v>

259
00:13:13.651 --> 00:13:18.651
<v Speaker 1>world got introduced to the name Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it like growing up in that </v>

260
00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:24.291
<v Speaker 1>environment and when did you realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your family was different than </v>

261
00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:25.050
<v Speaker 1>everybody else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

262
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:30.210
<v Speaker 1>you come from the most important family </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the history of martial arts.</v>

263
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Martial arts is what every man wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to do.</v>

264
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Every man wants to be able to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

265
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Every man wants to be able to kick ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most important family,</v>

266
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.830
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the Gracie family.</v>

267
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.910
<v Speaker 1>There's no comparison.</v>

268
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you don't really,</v>

269
00:13:46.101 --> 00:13:48.560
<v Speaker 3>you don't really think about it like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you're in the gracie family,</v>

270
00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:53.561
<v Speaker 3>you kind of just born into this thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's all about martial arts and </v>

271
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:56.180
<v Speaker 3>it's all about dedication and discipline</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you come from,</v>

272
00:13:56.181 --> 00:13:57.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition.</v>

273
00:13:57.111 --> 00:14:00.500
<v Speaker 3>So you don't really think about from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside point of view.</v>

274
00:14:00.501 --> 00:14:05.501
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it's just been a very normal </v>

275
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:07.571
<v Speaker 3>thing to train Jujitsu in the living </v>
<v Speaker 3>room to talk about how to defend </v>

276
00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:08.120
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk about,</v>

277
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the average and health and all this.</v>

278
00:14:09.951 --> 00:14:13.410
<v Speaker 3>This is just very normal for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was never knew.</v>

279
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.040
<v Speaker 3>He seen somebody get in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more interesting than it is.</v>

280
00:14:16.041 --> 00:14:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shock.</v>

281
00:14:16.941 --> 00:14:20.680
<v Speaker 3>So it's never been nothing big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

282
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.960
<v Speaker 3>the older I get the more I kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized how big what I'm a part of and </v>

283
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.041
<v Speaker 3>how important it is and that only </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivates me more to really step up and </v>

284
00:14:30.041 --> 00:14:31.920
<v Speaker 3>be able to keep this going because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

285
00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:34.600
<v Speaker 3>my grandfather was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a crazy dude,</v>

286
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:39.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would challenge anybody and his goal </v>

287
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.641
<v Speaker 3>was to represent just to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to prove g two is the best and that </v>

288
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:44.930
<v Speaker 3>guy weighed 135 pounds and he was not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>physically fit dude.</v>

289
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.930
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes to show how powerful his spirit </v>

290
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:49.930
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

291
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:50.510
<v Speaker 3>and what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he changed the world.</v>

292
00:14:50.511 --> 00:14:51.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

293
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:56.140
<v Speaker 3>he made it so that a weak person could </v>
<v Speaker 3>defeat a bigger opponent and you know,</v>

294
00:14:56.331 --> 00:15:01.331
<v Speaker 3>with my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with him leading everything and taking </v>

295
00:15:01.331 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 3>charge and trying to spread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

296
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:07.361
<v Speaker 3>he was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very important person in all of our </v>

297
00:15:07.361 --> 00:15:07.361
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

298
00:15:07.361 --> 00:15:08.900
<v Speaker 3>he made it possible for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a weak person to be able to defeat a</v>

299
00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:10.440
<v Speaker 3>bigger opponent to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

300
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.880
<v Speaker 3>have the self confidence to believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>something other than physical form.</v>

301
00:15:16.391 --> 00:15:17.860
<v Speaker 3>You have to believe in the leverage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

302
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.570
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

303
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:22.220
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his theory and his,</v>

304
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:28.270
<v Speaker 3>what he put onto his children is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>gave not only the leverage and the </v>

305
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:33.101
<v Speaker 3>technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also put physical abilities on top </v>

306
00:15:33.101 --> 00:15:35.471
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my dad got all the theory of the </v>

307
00:15:35.471 --> 00:15:35.471
<v Speaker 3>leverage and being a weak person and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to survive if you're weaker.</v>

308
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.310
<v Speaker 3>But my dad wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't weak.</v>

309
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:42.520
<v Speaker 3>He was strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he used the technique and the </v>

310
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:42.980
<v Speaker 3>leverage and the strength on top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which created a monster.</v>

311
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he created,</v>

312
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:49.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who is physically strong but </v>

313
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.001
<v Speaker 3>trains like as if he was a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>lightweight of not a physically strong </v>

314
00:15:52.001 --> 00:15:56.261
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's able to really maximize his </v>

315
00:15:56.261 --> 00:15:58.040
<v Speaker 3>potential and me coming up into this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

316
00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:03.370
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's always just been a fun thing </v>

317
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:05.590
<v Speaker 3>and something to be a part of and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>only kind of really clicked that,</v>

318
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.520
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

319
00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:10.100
<v Speaker 3>the older you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more we realize how part of it.</v>

320
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:14.450
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes I kind of look outside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself and I kind of take,</v>

321
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:15.180
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a,</v>

322
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.420
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

323
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:17.360
<v Speaker 3>this is like a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

324
00:16:17.361 --> 00:16:21.500
<v Speaker 3>like my grandfather was this legend and </v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad is this legend.</v>

325
00:16:21.501 --> 00:16:22.910
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

326
00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:25.370
<v Speaker 3>like I'm the only son and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

327
00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:26.730
<v Speaker 3>it's like a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an hour.</v>

328
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:31.750
<v Speaker 3>Not only am I the only son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also being able to be able to </v>

329
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.700
<v Speaker 3>prove that I did still in the genes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still a powerful thing that we're </v>

330
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.520
<v Speaker 3>dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

331
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.230
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm overwhelmed sometimes.</v>

332
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 3>I kind of looked back and I very </v>
<v Speaker 3>grateful for the situation and obviously</v>

333
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:49.121
<v Speaker 3>God put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put me in this situation and put us in </v>

334
00:16:49.121 --> 00:16:49.121
<v Speaker 3>the situation for a reason.</v>

335
00:16:49.121 --> 00:16:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm most recently you won the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abudabi submission championships,</v>

336
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:59.420
<v Speaker 1>which in the world of grappling is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most prestigious Nogi submission title </v>

337
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.800
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for folks no gooey,</v>

338
00:17:03.801 --> 00:17:07.220
<v Speaker 1>there's two different types of Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu with the Kimono,</v>

339
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:07.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

340
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.590
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a judo uniform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the g,</v>

341
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:15.770
<v Speaker 1>and then there's Jujitsu with no gate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a much like wrestling or the </v>

342
00:17:15.991 --> 00:17:20.991
<v Speaker 1>type of techniques that you would see in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC because they're not grabbing </v>

343
00:17:20.991 --> 00:17:21.900
<v Speaker 1>clothes very different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different.</v>

344
00:17:21.901 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 1>And as far as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

345
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pace of things,</v>

346
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.210
<v Speaker 1>but Abu Dhabi's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

347
00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:27.990
<v Speaker 1>the most prestigious championship in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

348
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.160
<v Speaker 1>So you accomplished like you hit the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the mountain,</v>

349
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

350
00:17:33.211 --> 00:17:38.211
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you became much like the others in the </v>

351
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Gracie family before you became a </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

352
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.140
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that feeling like?</v>

353
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.070
<v Speaker 3>It's a great feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

354
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.020
<v Speaker 3>it's just no complaints about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

355
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.750
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this,</v>

356
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.940
<v Speaker 3>in my perfect world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my dream,</v>

357
00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 3>if you would've asked me if I would have</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted the Abu Dhabi,</v>

358
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:58.131
<v Speaker 3>I would have said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course I would have wanted it </v>

359
00:17:58.131 --> 00:18:00.771
<v Speaker 3>probably much more times by this age if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would ask me when I was 15 years </v>

360
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:01.620
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

361
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in life it's not so easy,</v>

362
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:03.990
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

363
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.980
<v Speaker 3>and for me in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything was easy,</v>

364
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>purple belt was easy,</v>

365
00:18:09.931 --> 00:18:14.931
<v Speaker 3>Brown belt was easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I never had had this obstacle of </v>

366
00:18:14.931 --> 00:18:16.620
<v Speaker 3>challenges and I never really had to dig</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep and figure out what,</v>

367
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>

368
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:22.380
<v Speaker 3>what am I about really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my first one,</v>

369
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:24.810
<v Speaker 3>everything was undefeated as a purple </v>
<v Speaker 3>and brown belt.</v>

370
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:26.880
<v Speaker 3>And then my first match has a black </v>
<v Speaker 3>belt.</v>

371
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:30.270
<v Speaker 3>I lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got my ass whooped and it was a mix of</v>

372
00:18:30.271 --> 00:18:33.060
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of things that I came to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion of why that happened.</v>

373
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.170
<v Speaker 3>But in the end I think that I was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>not mentally ready for that.</v>

374
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 3>And I let all these outside things </v>
<v Speaker 3>affect me.</v>

375
00:18:39.721 --> 00:18:44.721
<v Speaker 3>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost the fight and really dug deep to </v>

376
00:18:44.721 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 3>see what I was going to do with my life </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

377
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.390
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after you,</v>

378
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:53.690
<v Speaker 3>you realize what happens and how you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>prevent it and how you going to get </v>

379
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.861
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you start to really work hard for </v>

380
00:18:57.861 --> 00:18:57.861
<v Speaker 3>what you want to get in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

381
00:18:57.861 --> 00:19:02.690
<v Speaker 3>after that moment I kind of started to </v>
<v Speaker 3>really become a man and really </v>

382
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 3>understand sacrifice and how to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>

383
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:07.851
<v Speaker 3>And if you want something in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't depend on anybody for it and </v>

384
00:19:07.851 --> 00:19:12.440
<v Speaker 3>you can't ask anybody for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to go in and really work hard </v>

385
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.350
<v Speaker 3>to get it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that I think I started to really </v>

386
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:16.530
<v Speaker 3>become a man as a black belt.</v>

387
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.690
<v Speaker 3>And that's when I really put my energy </v>
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>

388
00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:20.220
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

389
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.280
<v Speaker 3>I've lost tournaments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've won lots of tournaments and </v>

390
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:25.750
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I lose because of points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

391
00:19:25.751 --> 00:19:27.660
<v Speaker 3>I've never really been about points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

392
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately I feel like now after so long</v>

393
00:19:31.531 --> 00:19:34.950
<v Speaker 3>of being on this journey of this hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>path,</v>

394
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.280
<v Speaker 3>I finally kind of started to find myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the past couple of years and I'm </v>

395
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.180
<v Speaker 3>finally getting a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting the results that I've,</v>

396
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:46.380
<v Speaker 3>I've wanted a long time ago and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized a lot more about life and about</v>

397
00:19:46.381 --> 00:19:49.320
<v Speaker 3>myself then then if I would have just </v>
<v Speaker 3>won everything.</v>

398
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.190
<v Speaker 3>So that's a great situation to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

399
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.140
<v Speaker 3>I work really hard for this first place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a metal.</v>

400
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:57.180
<v Speaker 3>So it's gonna be hard for somebody to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take it from me.</v>

401
00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:58.930
<v Speaker 1>That is an interesting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

402
00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:03.931
<v Speaker 1>That you need defeat in order to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspire you to the greatness inside of </v>

403
00:20:03.931 --> 00:20:08.131
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to feel adversity to rise to </v>

404
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:10.171
<v Speaker 1>the occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you fought was Sergio Moron </v>

405
00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:13.870
<v Speaker 1>who's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good black belt and he's fighting </v>

406
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.280
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best Jujitsu guys in the UFC.</v>

407
00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Really fantastic technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

408
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.000
<v Speaker 1>that's a guy that you're connected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever now because of that,</v>

409
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I thank</v>

410
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.120
<v Speaker 3>him in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm a lot and I got promoted </v>

411
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.280
<v Speaker 3>like two weeks before the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>championships and my dad's always like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>challenges and he's like,</v>

00:20:39.991 --> 00:20:41.210
<v Speaker 3>I want this challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

416
00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.260
<v Speaker 3>The little did I know it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking shake my world and um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm grateful for and it's great,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

419
00:20:50.391 --> 00:20:52.930
<v Speaker 3>no complaints in our and I wouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed anything.</v>

420
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.530
<v Speaker 1>What is it like growing up being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

421
00:20:56.531 --> 00:21:01.531
<v Speaker 1>you're going into this world of martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts with a guy like that as your </v>

422
00:21:01.531 --> 00:21:03.030
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of advice did he</v>

423
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.400
<v Speaker 3>best advice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

424
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.520
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what made me who I am and</v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to really become my own man at </v>

425
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.840
<v Speaker 3>this age is the advice that my dad gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>me was such a,</v>

426
00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:18.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easy in life to be drifted by </v>

427
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.260
<v Speaker 3>things and to be drifted by what people </v>
<v Speaker 3>say and what you personally think and </v>

428
00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.070
<v Speaker 3>say and feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

429
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always been able to have.</v>

430
00:21:24.721 --> 00:21:29.721
<v Speaker 3>My Dad gave me a good advice and be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be my father and to teach me how to </v>

431
00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:31.010
<v Speaker 3>be a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just Jujitsu,</v>

432
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.660
<v Speaker 3>not just being good at technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but being able to be a good person,</v>

433
00:21:33.661 --> 00:21:37.650
<v Speaker 3>being humble and being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the best that you can.</v>

434
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what,</v>

435
00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:44.660
<v Speaker 3>what allows me to become great at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and what allows me to become </v>

436
00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.900
<v Speaker 3>great at whatever I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

437
00:21:45.901 --> 00:21:50.901
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never really had that much training </v>

438
00:21:50.901 --> 00:21:50.901
<v Speaker 3>sessions with my father.</v>

439
00:21:50.901 --> 00:21:54.140
<v Speaker 3>People think he was there coaching me </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday training on the sidelines with </v>

440
00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.590
<v Speaker 3>water bottles and all this shit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>never existed in.</v>

441
00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:01.370
<v Speaker 3>But one thing I do is I am very grateful</v>
<v Speaker 3>for is when I started to train really </v>

442
00:22:02.281 --> 00:22:07.281
<v Speaker 3>hard at like 12 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad was in training at the academy </v>

443
00:22:07.281 --> 00:22:10.620
<v Speaker 3>and my brother had passed and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just on his own search,</v>

444
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he disappeared from the academy.</v>

445
00:22:13.561 --> 00:22:18.561
<v Speaker 3>But every night I'd come home and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be there and he wouldn't ask me </v>

446
00:22:18.561 --> 00:22:22.131
<v Speaker 3>how was school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would ask me how was training and I </v>

447
00:22:22.131 --> 00:22:22.131
<v Speaker 3>would tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>

448
00:22:22.131 --> 00:22:25.410
<v Speaker 3>I got smashed or this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I got stuck in this position,</v>

449
00:22:25.411 --> 00:22:29.430
<v Speaker 3>so at the dinner table or at the front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the TV,</v>

450
00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:32.940
<v Speaker 3>he would give me an answer to my problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he would give me advice,</v>

451
00:22:32.941 --> 00:22:37.941
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it'd be about Jujitsu technique </v>

452
00:22:37.941 --> 00:22:37.941
<v Speaker 3>or whether it be about what happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>here or how to,</v>

453
00:22:37.941 --> 00:22:42.390
<v Speaker 3>how to react to what this person did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so my learning magic Jitsu really </v>

454
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:47.220
<v Speaker 3>growth happened over food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>

455
00:22:47.221 --> 00:22:48.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching tv,</v>

456
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:54.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where I really learned what I </v>

457
00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.840
<v Speaker 3>learned and then went back and trained </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the academy and practice what I was </v>

458
00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:56.840
<v Speaker 3>taught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

459
00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:01.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of my Jujitsu I learned through </v>

460
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.461
<v Speaker 3>verbal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just like conversations at the </v>

461
00:23:04.461 --> 00:23:05.760
<v Speaker 3>dinner table and being able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

462
00:23:05.761 --> 00:23:08.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from that really</v>

463
00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:13.790
<v Speaker 1>your dad had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that approach which was different than </v>

464
00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.390
<v Speaker 1>voices approach and different than many </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's approach.</v>

465
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:20.660
<v Speaker 1>This approach of mastering the physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as mastering technique.</v>

466
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dad is an accomplished Yogi,</v>

467
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.940
<v Speaker 1>is very physically strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one thing that really separated</v>

468
00:23:26.941 --> 00:23:29.460
<v Speaker 1>him from a lot of the other people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gracie family.</v>

469
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think so.</v>

470
00:23:30.861 --> 00:23:35.861
<v Speaker 3>I think what separates my dad from not </v>
<v Speaker 3>only everybody in the family but from </v>

471
00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:40.010
<v Speaker 3>most fighters is his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only his mental strength,</v>

472
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:43.820
<v Speaker 3>but his spiritual strength and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very spiritual person.</v>

473
00:23:43.821 --> 00:23:46.430
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's huge,</v>

474
00:23:46.431 --> 00:23:48.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially now in my life,</v>

475
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 3>realizing how important that is a part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of me,</v>

476
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:55.660
<v Speaker 3>I think being spiritually connected to </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and connected to whatever is </v>

477
00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:55.910
<v Speaker 3>above us is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

478
00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:01.200
<v Speaker 3>is something that really sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>things you can't explain happen when,</v>

479
00:24:01.591 --> 00:24:06.591
<v Speaker 3>when you're that connected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my dad has always been a very </v>

480
00:24:06.591 --> 00:24:06.591
<v Speaker 3>spiritual person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

481
00:24:06.591 --> 00:24:10.961
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing all the things that he does </v>

482
00:24:10.961 --> 00:24:10.961
<v Speaker 3>for his purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

483
00:24:10.961 --> 00:24:15.011
<v Speaker 3>if you talked to him for about money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>money is just secondary to,</v>

484
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.360
<v Speaker 3>to what his beliefs are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so as opposed to some people who </v>

485
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:25.390
<v Speaker 3>they will go against what they believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>in or they'll go against their </v>

486
00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:25.970
<v Speaker 3>spirituality for a paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my dad,</v>

487
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never,</v>

488
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.240
<v Speaker 3>never did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

489
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.580
<v Speaker 3>he never took,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

490
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 3>sponsors for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for beer or whatever,</v>

491
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:39.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he doesn't believe that that's </v>

492
00:24:39.281 --> 00:24:39.281
<v Speaker 3>necessarily the image that he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go with.</v>

493
00:24:39.281 --> 00:24:42.680
<v Speaker 3>And I think he's a very spiritual person</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he and I still,</v>

494
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 3>even today I'm like surprised with how </v>
<v Speaker 3>much of a,</v>

495
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.770
<v Speaker 3>how much honor and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

496
00:24:48.771 --> 00:24:50.660
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

497
00:24:50.661 --> 00:24:53.020
<v Speaker 3>it's just weird to describe how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

498
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.480
<v Speaker 3>how good he he's done for Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really</v>

499
00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:01.540
<v Speaker 1>the growing up in that atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an incredible role model to have </v>

500
00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:05.530
<v Speaker 1>that as your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy that's got such a high moral </v>

501
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:06.770
<v Speaker 1>standard and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did he get into yoga?</v>

502
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Because that's another thing that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>separated him from a lot of other </v>

503
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.520
<v Speaker 1>martial artists and really opened up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people's eyes to the beneficial </v>

504
00:25:15.561 --> 00:25:16.550
<v Speaker 1>aspects of yoga.</v>

505
00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.180
<v Speaker 3>So he got into yoga with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Orlando Kearney,</v>

506
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:24.240
<v Speaker 3>who is a Brazilian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a yoga guy who basically his whole </v>

507
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.330
<v Speaker 3>theory was breathing with your movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So being able to.</v>

508
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.570
<v Speaker 3>Because Yoga is usually you breathe in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stop and you kind of breathe in.</v>

509
00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.600
<v Speaker 3>You just do your movements and your kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of just static,</v>

510
00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:39.730
<v Speaker 3>but he kind of incorporated breathing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with movement and being able to like,</v>

511
00:25:39.731 --> 00:25:40.300
<v Speaker 3>he would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

512
00:25:40.301 --> 00:25:41.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an animal.</v>

513
00:25:41.291 --> 00:25:46.291
<v Speaker 3>I'm a tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he would walk like a tiger and you </v>

514
00:25:46.291 --> 00:25:48.160
<v Speaker 3>breathe and you look and he would </v>
<v Speaker 3>visualize himself like a tiger.</v>

515
00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.540
<v Speaker 3>So he started to be able to to not only </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that as animal,</v>

516
00:25:52.541 --> 00:25:55.840
<v Speaker 3>but he started to transfer it over to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and being able to.</v>

517
00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:58.570
<v Speaker 3>Because this theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy's theory,</v>

518
00:25:58.571 --> 00:26:02.050
<v Speaker 3>Orlando counties theory was animals are </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect,</v>

519
00:26:02.051 --> 00:26:07.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they move and they breathe and they </v>

520
00:26:07.051 --> 00:26:07.051
<v Speaker 3>don't get tired and everything is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>sync.</v>

521
00:26:07.051 --> 00:26:10.810
<v Speaker 3>So his whole theory was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better you can do that,</v>

522
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:15.960
<v Speaker 3>the more you can replicate that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you're going to be able to be </v>

523
00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:15.960
<v Speaker 3>efficient with your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with whatever you do.</v>

524
00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.660
<v Speaker 3>And the yoga for my data I guess was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge,</v>

525
00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:21.370
<v Speaker 3>huge part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

526
00:26:21.371 --> 00:26:26.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since a little kid he kind of always </v>

527
00:26:26.371 --> 00:26:28.620
<v Speaker 3>told me about breathing and yoga and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>never cared and just kind of brushed it </v>

528
00:26:29.081 --> 00:26:34.081
<v Speaker 3>off until when you get older and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>start really having difficulties when </v>

529
00:26:34.081 --> 00:26:36.190
<v Speaker 3>you really start searching and really </v>
<v Speaker 3>start having problems,</v>

530
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.640
<v Speaker 3>then I started to start to breathe more </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now I think that the breathing is a </v>

531
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:47.840
<v Speaker 3>huge part of my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my myself and it's a huge part of my </v>

532
00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.530
<v Speaker 3>growth and it's a huge part of me being </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to be in,</v>

533
00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:54.910
<v Speaker 3>be in tune with what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wouldn't take away that for </v>

534
00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:58.251
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's probably one of the </v>

535
00:26:58.251 --> 00:26:58.251
<v Speaker 3>biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

536
00:26:58.251 --> 00:26:59.670
<v Speaker 3>additions to my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to myself that I could have added.</v>

537
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Yoga breathing is a thing.</v>

538
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Pranayama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what they call it?</v>

539
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

540
00:27:05.281 --> 00:27:07.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prada Yama is a,</v>

541
00:27:07.831 --> 00:27:09.970
<v Speaker 1>is a huge part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

542
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:15.150
<v Speaker 1>what a lot of people are missing when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to the idea of yoga.</v>

543
00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:20.151
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand that deep </v>

544
00:27:20.151 --> 00:27:20.760
<v Speaker 1>breathing and breathing exercises are </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

545
00:27:20.761 --> 00:27:23.780
<v Speaker 1>They're very difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult.</v>

546
00:27:23.781 --> 00:27:28.160
<v Speaker 1>And it becomes like a factor of motivate</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do this shit to write shitty dad</v>

547
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.790
<v Speaker 1>does with the abdomen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

548
00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do that.</v>

549
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that,</v>

550
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:36.980
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that crazy video if folks who haven't </v>

551
00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.381
<v Speaker 1>seen this is a documentary called choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing documentary and it was </v>

552
00:27:39.381 --> 00:27:42.780
<v Speaker 1>back when Hickson was competing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

553
00:27:42.781 --> 00:27:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Valley Tudos was like 1995 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 94 95.</v>

554
00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:51.860
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a video that really like opened </v>

555
00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:56.621
<v Speaker 1>up a lot of people's eyes of him doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga and moving his stomach around with </v>

556
00:27:56.621 --> 00:27:58.520
<v Speaker 1>these weird stomach exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

557
00:27:58.521 --> 00:28:00.840
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your diaphragm.</v>

558
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:04.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can kind of explained.</v>

559
00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:06.580
<v Speaker 3>But basically your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

560
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.600
<v Speaker 3>your lungs are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

561
00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.320
<v Speaker 3>like bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start screaming at the top and then</v>

562
00:28:11.321 --> 00:28:14.620
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fill up to be big at the bottom.</v>

563
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:19.950
<v Speaker 3>So when you normally breathe you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're only filling up a small portion </v>

564
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.240
<v Speaker 3>of your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you get scared or when you have</v>

565
00:28:22.241 --> 00:28:27.241
<v Speaker 3>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is shortens your breath and </v>

566
00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:27.241
<v Speaker 3>then screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

567
00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:30.040
<v Speaker 3>So that's what normally happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's very normal for humans.</v>

568
00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:34.220
<v Speaker 3>And being able to breathe through your </v>
<v Speaker 3>diaphragm is filling your lungs to the,</v>

569
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:39.250
<v Speaker 3>to the Max and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and being able to control that is so </v>

570
00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:43.610
<v Speaker 3>your diaphragm is a muscle and you need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to train it like a pushup or like </v>

571
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:44.290
<v Speaker 3>anything you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to train your muscles.</v>

572
00:28:44.291 --> 00:28:47.980
<v Speaker 3>So the more you train your muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more control you have over it.</v>

573
00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:53.010
<v Speaker 3>And that is just being able to have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highest control of your diaphragm </v>

574
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.210
<v Speaker 3>muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you have that kind of control,</v>

575
00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:00.480
<v Speaker 3>you can filter your body out easier as </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to like right now,</v>

576
00:29:00.491 --> 00:29:03.640
<v Speaker 3>if you don't train it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't even like use your diaphragm.</v>

577
00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:03.820
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

578
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:04.520
<v Speaker 5>sure</v>

579
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:11.520
<v Speaker 3>that just that simple movement is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it difficult,</v>

580
00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a difficult thing to do.</v>

581
00:29:13.921 --> 00:29:15.930
<v Speaker 3>You have to train to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then being able to do that.</v>

582
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.600
<v Speaker 1>So what you're doing as you're breathing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in deep and then you're pulling your </v>

583
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.210
<v Speaker 1>diaphragm in</v>

584
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.640
<v Speaker 3>that actual exercise that you do is you </v>
<v Speaker 3>exhale,</v>

585
00:29:31.641 --> 00:29:34.490
<v Speaker 3>you have no oxygen in your lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you use your.</v>

586
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Then you just kind of massage your </v>
<v Speaker 3>diaphragm and you kind of just have that</v>

587
00:29:38.841 --> 00:29:43.841
<v Speaker 3>kind of control so you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>practicing like how to move it because </v>

588
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:47.341
<v Speaker 3>when you're training and you're tired </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you have to think about to </v>

589
00:29:47.341 --> 00:29:49.501
<v Speaker 3>breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>its already too much so you should just </v>

590
00:29:49.501 --> 00:29:51.690
<v Speaker 3>have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a one of those things that </v>

591
00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:51.690
<v Speaker 3>start fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you push out,</v>

592
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:55.390
<v Speaker 3>it's when you open it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it fills up naturally,</v>

593
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.760
<v Speaker 3>so if you learn how to breathe through </v>
<v Speaker 3>your diaphragm,</v>

594
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.830
<v Speaker 3>you naturally are going to filter way </v>
<v Speaker 3>more oxygen and you're going to have a.</v>

595
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:06.100
<v Speaker 3>everything's going to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that's the reason why I can train</v>

596
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:08.200
<v Speaker 3>as long as I can train and why I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>stay clear.</v>

597
00:30:08.201 --> 00:30:13.201
<v Speaker 3>And normally a lot of people they they </v>
<v Speaker 3>get cast out or they or they feel like </v>

598
00:30:13.201 --> 00:30:15.550
<v Speaker 3>they're going to pass out or or they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety.</v>

599
00:30:15.551 --> 00:30:20.140
<v Speaker 3>So being able to breathe correctly is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge part of my growth.</v>

600
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:20.680
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

601
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Learn that from your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The diaphragm breathing.</v>

602
00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:24.810
<v Speaker 1>What does he call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it.</v>

603
00:30:24.811 --> 00:30:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Is there a name for it?</v>

604
00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:30.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're not necessarily like yoga </v>

605
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:30.670
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

606
00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:35.980
<v Speaker 3>super into a specific type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I just use yoga for my benefit </v>

607
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.940
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not like a ride or die of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain type of yoga.</v>

608
00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.900
<v Speaker 3>I just kind of use yoga for my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

609
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:46.930
<v Speaker 3>for what I do for Jujitsu and how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become a better person so I don't know </v>

610
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:50.951
<v Speaker 3>exactly what the name is or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just being able to breathe and </v>

611
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:53.561
<v Speaker 3>being able to use my diaphragm and being</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to stay calm and learn how to </v>

612
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:57.910
<v Speaker 3>manage my energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that has helped me not only with </v>

613
00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu but anything new I do or if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to come here on an interview,</v>

614
00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.910
<v Speaker 3>if I start to get nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

615
00:31:01.911 --> 00:31:03.200
<v Speaker 3>I breathe in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes away.</v>

616
00:31:03.201 --> 00:31:08.201
<v Speaker 3>So the breathing has helped me become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is given me an opportunity to do </v>

617
00:31:08.201 --> 00:31:09.020
<v Speaker 3>everything that I can do.</v>

618
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of deep breathing exercises,</v>

619
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sensory deprivation tank.</v>

620
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.920
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I do is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long breathing.</v>

621
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have an inhale that lasts a minute </v>

622
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.420
<v Speaker 1>and then the exhale last a minute and is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

623
00:31:24.421 --> 00:31:29.421
<v Speaker 1>it's a discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have to force yourself to </v>

624
00:31:29.421 --> 00:31:29.800
<v Speaker 1>maintain that pace because you get to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>panic.</v>

625
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:35.070
<v Speaker 1>He just want to fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can stay alive and keep doing </v>

626
00:31:35.711 --> 00:31:40.711
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it and you can still stay </v>

627
00:31:40.711 --> 00:31:40.711
<v Speaker 1>alive and keep doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

628
00:31:40.711 --> 00:31:41.440
<v Speaker 1>it becomes this weird thing where your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body starts freaking out.</v>

629
00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:42.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>

630
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:43.990
<v Speaker 1>stop breathing out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe,</v>

631
00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:44.890
<v Speaker 1>breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe in,</v>

632
00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.010
<v Speaker 1>breathe out for a minute and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe in for a minute.</v>

633
00:31:48.011 --> 00:31:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Breathe out for a minute</v>

634
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:49.470
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

635
00:31:49.471 --> 00:31:51.360
<v Speaker 3>there is different types of exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

636
00:31:51.361 --> 00:31:55.680
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm trying to stay calm,</v>

637
00:31:55.681 --> 00:31:57.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to breathe slower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm trying to get energy,</v>

638
00:31:57.721 --> 00:32:00.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to breathe faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm trying to maintain a high pace,</v>

639
00:32:00.931 --> 00:32:01.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

640
00:32:01.801 --> 00:32:03.870
<v Speaker 3>it's like a car when you drive a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're driving slow,</v>

641
00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:07.070
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

642
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:11.380
<v Speaker 3>but if you drive fast cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you need like when I train,</v>

643
00:32:11.381 --> 00:32:13.510
<v Speaker 3>if I'm in a very intense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll breathe loud.</v>

644
00:32:13.511 --> 00:32:18.280
<v Speaker 3>Like so to make sure I'm getting enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>oxygen to,</v>

645
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.680
<v Speaker 3>to keep up with what I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>physically.</v>

646
00:32:20.681 --> 00:32:25.681
<v Speaker 3>So I definitely am very grateful for </v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to have that a part of my </v>

647
00:32:26.441 --> 00:32:28.210
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's cool,</v>

648
00:32:28.211 --> 00:32:29.080
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>

649
00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:34.240
<v Speaker 1>I only experienced that breathing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time in Jujitsu after a </v>

650
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.631
<v Speaker 1>lifelong martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never heard anybody breathe like </v>

651
00:32:37.631 --> 00:32:41.531
<v Speaker 1>that until I started training and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at John jocks academy and hearing </v>

652
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:42.830
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

653
00:32:42.831 --> 00:32:47.831
<v Speaker 1>hearing like black belts roll here guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really what the fuck are they doing it?</v>

654
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.190
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a white belt.</v>

655
00:32:49.191 --> 00:32:51.060
<v Speaker 1>I was walking around with everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it was,</v>

656
00:32:51.061 --> 00:32:54.950
<v Speaker 1>it was such a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And John Jack explained to me that,</v>

657
00:32:54.951 --> 00:32:55.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

658
00:32:55.411 --> 00:32:57.830
<v Speaker 1>when you breathe out you will definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe in,</v>

659
00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.970
<v Speaker 1>force yourself to breathe out and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of all the car.</v>

660
00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bad air in your body and breathe in </v>

661
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:06.590
<v Speaker 1>fresh oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that the forcing it out is something</v>

662
00:33:06.591 --> 00:33:08.090
<v Speaker 1>that people don't concentrate enough on.</v>

663
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you normally want to breathe,</v>

664
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.150
<v Speaker 3>you breathe in and then that only fills </v>
<v Speaker 3>up that top part,</v>

665
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.080
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>

666
00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:20.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean is there a lot about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's definitely a huge part </v>

667
00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:23.240
<v Speaker 3>of my success today and it's also a huge</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of my dad's.</v>

668
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend to anybody who is </v>

669
00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:29.830
<v Speaker 1>interested in this to go and just look </v>
<v Speaker 1>up various yoga,</v>

670
00:33:29.831 --> 00:33:34.831
<v Speaker 1>breathing videos on youtube and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow along with them and you'd get a </v>

671
00:33:34.831 --> 00:33:37.030
<v Speaker 1>great benefit from that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that people don't really think</v>

672
00:33:37.031 --> 00:33:39.880
<v Speaker 1>too much about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about concentrating and controlling your</v>

673
00:33:39.881 --> 00:33:44.881
<v Speaker 1>breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also a great meditative </v>

674
00:33:44.881 --> 00:33:46.450
<v Speaker 1>quality to that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the first breathing exercises</v>

675
00:33:46.451 --> 00:33:49.960
<v Speaker 1>I ever did when I was really young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many told me that you can meditate by</v>

676
00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.530
<v Speaker 1>just concentrating only on your breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not,</v>

677
00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:58.090
<v Speaker 1>not even a breathing exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just breathe in good and out bad and</v>

678
00:33:58.091 --> 00:34:01.690
<v Speaker 1>think of nothing but those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as you're breathing in,</v>

679
00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.530
<v Speaker 1>you're taking in oxygen and as you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing out,</v>

680
00:34:04.531 --> 00:34:06.750
<v Speaker 1>you're just pumping out in with the good</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the bad.</v>

681
00:34:06.751 --> 00:34:11.751
<v Speaker 1>I just think of those things and think </v>
<v Speaker 1>only of your breath and by forcing </v>

682
00:34:11.751 --> 00:34:14.941
<v Speaker 1>yourself to concentrate on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of filters out everything in </v>

683
00:34:14.941 --> 00:34:14.941
<v Speaker 1>your life and it all becomes like </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

684
00:34:14.941 --> 00:34:19.741
<v Speaker 1>Everything else sort of calms down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get this feeling after you're done </v>

685
00:34:19.741 --> 00:34:20.860
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do that for an hour,</v>

686
00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:26.490
<v Speaker 1>everything else sort of like the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The importance of things that you </v>

687
00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:28.700
<v Speaker 1>thought was so big and so crazy in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and all this is fucked up,</v>

688
00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:32.020
<v Speaker 1>but what am I going to do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems less important after that.</v>

689
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:37.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the breathing keeps me in touch </v>

690
00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:37.280
<v Speaker 3>with my spirituality and being able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathe.</v>

691
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.750
<v Speaker 3>Like I've gotten into some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some super gnarly trances where I'm,</v>

692
00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:46.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really connected to whatever is above us</v>

693
00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:51.290
<v Speaker 3>and that's through the breathing so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>like being able to breathe and like </v>

694
00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.510
<v Speaker 3>after your training or during your </v>
<v Speaker 3>training or however you like to do.</v>

695
00:34:56.511 --> 00:35:00.710
<v Speaker 3>It has given me like a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge benefits and I,</v>

696
00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.910
<v Speaker 3>I connect myself too when I'm training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like being able to breathe puts me in a,</v>

697
00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:10.340
<v Speaker 3>in a very animal like state where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like me against you.</v>

698
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:15.400
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not thinking about what you're </v>

699
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:15.400
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not thinking about,</v>

700
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:15.680
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am thinking about what you're doing,</v>

701
00:35:15.681 --> 00:35:20.681
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not thinking about things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more of like a feeling and that </v>

702
00:35:20.681 --> 00:35:21.770
<v Speaker 3>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The closer you are to that feeling,</v>

703
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:27.130
<v Speaker 3>it gives you almost above your mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>above you can actually think it's more </v>

704
00:35:27.411 --> 00:35:32.411
<v Speaker 3>like a of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a animal instinct and that like since</v>

705
00:35:33.021 --> 00:35:38.021
<v Speaker 3>I started to really incorporate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing and the connecting it to my </v>

706
00:35:38.021 --> 00:35:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's given me way more.</v>

707
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

708
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.870
<v Speaker 1>a whole group of people that use </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing.</v>

709
00:35:42.871 --> 00:35:47.871
<v Speaker 1>It's called holotropic breathing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they use it to achieve psychedelic </v>

710
00:35:47.871 --> 00:35:52.821
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have achieved psychedelic states </v>

711
00:35:52.821 --> 00:35:55.401
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the most intense state </v>

712
00:35:55.401 --> 00:35:55.401
<v Speaker 1>you've ever achieved while breathing?</v>

713
00:35:55.401 --> 00:35:59.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think a couple of times after </v>

714
00:35:59.010 --> 00:35:59.010
<v Speaker 3>training when I'm really exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm very,</v>

715
00:35:59.010 --> 00:35:59.450
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

716
00:35:59.451 --> 00:36:03.350
<v Speaker 3>very exhausted to a point where you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>me to stop training like 30,</v>

717
00:36:03.351 --> 00:36:08.240
<v Speaker 3>40 minutes before and then after I'll do</v>
<v Speaker 3>a breathing,</v>

718
00:36:08.241 --> 00:36:11.010
<v Speaker 3>breathing in and out and I'll just keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>going into the breathing and as I,</v>

719
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:14.900
<v Speaker 3>as I start to breathe and start to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>more in tune,</v>

720
00:36:14.901 --> 00:36:19.901
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing exists and it's just me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can almost see the particles in </v>

721
00:36:19.901 --> 00:36:22.430
<v Speaker 3>the air and I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like a sensation that,</v>

722
00:36:22.431 --> 00:36:27.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only felt a couple of times but I </v>

723
00:36:27.431 --> 00:36:27.530
<v Speaker 3>definitely have gotten in touch with </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

724
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.250
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very intense to like to get to that</v>

725
00:36:31.251 --> 00:36:34.640
<v Speaker 3>point where you just feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like you can see the air.</v>

726
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like you can see and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these little things and it's pretty </v>

727
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.370
<v Speaker 3>intense.</v>

728
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:44.140
<v Speaker 3>So I've gotten to that point a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>times or three or four points were where</v>

729
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:46.790
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

730
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.620
<v Speaker 3>I can actually feel the energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was a great thing,</v>

731
00:36:51.621 --> 00:36:52.590
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

732
00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.680
<v Speaker 3>after if you feel high and you smile and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

733
00:36:54.681 --> 00:36:58.160
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy and crazy that you can,</v>

734
00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:03.340
<v Speaker 3>how much we're capable of as humans and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how much will do is so big and you know,</v>

735
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:09.080
<v Speaker 3>you think about the actual world and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual world is,</v>

736
00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 3>is like this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should be in touch with something </v>

737
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 3>above,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

738
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:18.730
<v Speaker 3>we should be able to in touch with how </v>
<v Speaker 3>this got to this or how there's </v>

739
00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Waterhouse Salami.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these things that we today are like,</v>

740
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.350
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's this,</v>

741
00:37:21.351 --> 00:37:24.290
<v Speaker 3>that's this or this is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so much more.</v>

742
00:37:24.291 --> 00:37:25.490
<v Speaker 3>You can explain shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

743
00:37:25.491 --> 00:37:30.491
<v Speaker 3>So it's like really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go a lot more about my feelings these </v>

744
00:37:30.491 --> 00:37:31.390
<v Speaker 3>days than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

745
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:34.910
<v Speaker 3>over my rational decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of try to feel how things are.</v>

746
00:37:34.911 --> 00:37:38.120
<v Speaker 3>I feel how people are feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how I feel,</v>

747
00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:43.420
<v Speaker 3>how I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how I feel about this training session </v>

748
00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.631
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of try to go more about feeling </v>

749
00:37:45.631 --> 00:37:45.631
<v Speaker 3>because that's never failed me before.</v>

750
00:37:45.631 --> 00:37:48.510
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these breathing techniques and he states</v>

751
00:37:48.511 --> 00:37:53.511
<v Speaker 1>that you achieve the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you a sort of a fresh </v>

752
00:37:53.511 --> 00:37:56.421
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give you a perspective of </v>

753
00:37:56.421 --> 00:37:59.400
<v Speaker 1>recognizing the greatness and the beauty</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the magnitude of life that sometimes</v>

754
00:37:59.401 --> 00:38:04.401
<v Speaker 1>escapes us and our normal everyday path </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you just sort of take for granted </v>

755
00:38:04.401 --> 00:38:06.360
<v Speaker 1>that that's a door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the house go outside,</v>

756
00:38:06.361 --> 00:38:08.400
<v Speaker 1>that's the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes normal,</v>

757
00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:13.401
<v Speaker 1>but these breathing techniques and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>just the psychedelic states that you </v>

758
00:38:13.401 --> 00:38:16.800
<v Speaker 1>achieve from them allow you to almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a reset button.</v>

759
00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty cool,</v>

760
00:38:18.621 --> 00:38:23.621
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really recommend breathing in for </v>

761
00:38:23.621 --> 00:38:25.160
<v Speaker 3>anybody who is doing anything in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

762
00:38:25.161 --> 00:38:30.161
<v Speaker 3>whether it'd be something you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you're trying to get through a </v>

763
00:38:30.161 --> 00:38:33.371
<v Speaker 3>tough situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you're arguing with your </v>

764
00:38:33.371 --> 00:38:33.371
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend or whether you're stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 3>traffic or whether you're trying to stay</v>

765
00:38:33.371 --> 00:38:34.730
<v Speaker 3>calm while somebody was trying to choke </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

766
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.570
<v Speaker 3>The breathing has given me and it took a</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

767
00:38:37.571 --> 00:38:38.350
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh boom.</v>

768
00:38:38.351 --> 00:38:39.730
<v Speaker 3>I started breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>

769
00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:45.180
<v Speaker 3>It's actually took a long time before </v>
<v Speaker 3>you really value it because when my dad </v>

770
00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:49.381
<v Speaker 3>started telling me this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of didn't care and I was just </v>

771
00:38:49.381 --> 00:38:49.381
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

772
00:38:49.381 --> 00:38:49.381
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got all kinds of.</v>

773
00:38:49.381 --> 00:38:50.220
<v Speaker 3>She's always telling me Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

774
00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.430
<v Speaker 3>but after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

775
00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:00.480
<v Speaker 3>the older I got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more I kind of started to have </v>

776
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.150
<v Speaker 3>stress and have to deal with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure and then I kind of started to </v>

777
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:06.040
<v Speaker 3>do it every once in a while and then now</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's at a point where the past few years</v>

778
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:10.070
<v Speaker 3>I've really stepped it up a lot and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>really a big part of my,</v>

779
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.640
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my training and my and everything.</v>

780
00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:14.320
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even when I skateboard now,</v>

781
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm like trying to breathe and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to like,</v>

782
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:23.100
<v Speaker 3>keep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep everything in tune so I can do the </v>

783
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:23.100
<v Speaker 3>best I can do</v>

784
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:23.910
<v Speaker 1>the last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

785
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.370
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we had a dinner together,</v>

786
00:39:26.371 --> 00:39:28.860
<v Speaker 1>your dad was still talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>competing.</v>

787
00:39:28.861 --> 00:39:30.810
<v Speaker 1>He had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had stopped,</v>

788
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.510
<v Speaker 1>but he was still thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

789
00:39:33.511 --> 00:39:35.400
<v Speaker 1>He was still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was people,</v>

790
00:39:35.401 --> 00:39:40.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always a threat on the </v>

791
00:39:40.401 --> 00:39:40.460
<v Speaker 1>underground is one of the big themes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the underground is Hixon by Armbar.</v>

792
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.560
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would joke around about anything,</v>

793
00:39:43.561 --> 00:39:48.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who'd win Godzilla versus King Kong </v>

794
00:39:48.561 --> 00:39:48.561
<v Speaker 1>kicks in by arm bar was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

795
00:39:48.561 --> 00:39:52.020
<v Speaker 1>it was just an inside joke when someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something could be answered.</v>

796
00:39:52.021 --> 00:39:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Someone just right Hixon via arm bar.</v>

797
00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:54.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

798
00:39:55.510 --> 00:40:00.510
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he have any regrets that he didn't </v>

799
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:01.210
<v Speaker 1>fight any of the big name guys that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't continue?</v>

800
00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.170
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about him fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>fader.</v>

801
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:04.570
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

802

<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

803
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:10.620
<v Speaker 1>he was saying that if he did fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who would want to fight fate or </v>

804
00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:10.620
<v Speaker 1>who is the champion of pride at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

805
00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

806
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if there's any regrets or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

807
00:40:14.601 --> 00:40:16.710
<v Speaker 3>I think it was just a time in my dad's </v>
<v Speaker 3>life where,</v>

808
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right after my brother passed,</v>

809
00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:20.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

810
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.680
<v Speaker 3>he got offered to fight Sakharova and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a big,</v>

811
00:40:24.681 --> 00:40:26.690
<v Speaker 3>big payday and it was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big fight.</v>

812
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.690
<v Speaker 3>And of course my dad being the man he </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

813
00:40:29.691 --> 00:40:34.691
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't going to just leave the family</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go train for a fight and take his </v>

814
00:40:35.661 --> 00:40:40.520
<v Speaker 3>selfish needs into consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he kind of just took her,</v>

815
00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:44.570
<v Speaker 3>which turned away the fight and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gave his energy to the family and try to</v>

816
00:40:44.571 --> 00:40:49.370
<v Speaker 3>do what he could to help everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And after that time passes,</v>

817
00:40:49.371 --> 00:40:54.371
<v Speaker 3>there's still like some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people wanting to have them fired </v>

818
00:40:54.371 --> 00:40:54.371
<v Speaker 3>and he was maybe five Fado and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this.</v>

819
00:40:54.371 --> 00:40:56.900
<v Speaker 3>But I think after that moment he kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

820
00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.210
<v Speaker 3>the time passed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

821
00:40:59.211 --> 00:41:01.970
<v Speaker 3>his fighting that time had passed for </v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

822
00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.700
<v Speaker 3>even though he was still possibility for</v>
<v Speaker 3>him to fight,</v>

823
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:06.950
<v Speaker 3>I think that he necessarily.</v>

824
00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.460
<v Speaker 3>He was ready to fight and as a man he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was ready to die.</v>

825
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.850
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think that necessarily it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

826
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad that he didn't fight after </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

827
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

828
00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Speaker 3>it happened the way it did and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>retired the way he did and he still has </v>

829
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.780
<v Speaker 3>the greatest image.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that it's,</v>

830
00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.320
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a great thing that it went </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

831
00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Did you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

832
00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:36.610
<v Speaker 3>my dad is a great fighter and he's great</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind and that separates him from </v>

833
00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:40.031
<v Speaker 3>everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that everything went fine </v>

834
00:41:40.031 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 3>even though whatever happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that he didn't need to fight.</v>

835
00:41:42.411 --> 00:41:44.330
<v Speaker 3>He didn't need to prove anything to </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody else.</v>

836
00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:47.120
<v Speaker 3>And even if he did fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>win or lose,</v>

837
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:50.510
<v Speaker 3>that would have been his hammer his </v>
<v Speaker 3>best,</v>

838
00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:51.350
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

839
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:56.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think my dad did enough from when he </v>

840
00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:56.890
<v Speaker 3>was 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was 40.</v>

841
00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:58.700
<v Speaker 3>He proved enough people wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did what he had to do.</v>

842
00:41:58.701 --> 00:42:00.490
<v Speaker 3>He was ready,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

843
00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.570
<v Speaker 3>you don't know where.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like nobody knows what it's like to</v>

844
00:42:02.571 --> 00:42:05.360
<v Speaker 3>be having to be ready to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to die at any moment.</v>

845
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:08.390
<v Speaker 3>Motherfuckers come in your academy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they challenge you.</v>

846
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:11.270
<v Speaker 3>You got this guy telling him that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't believe in Jujitsu.</v>

847
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:14.150
<v Speaker 3>So nobody knows what that feels like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be ready.</v>

848
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.080
<v Speaker 3>Everybody now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

849
00:42:15.081 --> 00:42:15.950
<v Speaker 3>you want a fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

850
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:18.620
<v Speaker 3>give me three months or six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to train for my fighter,</v>

851
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.870
<v Speaker 3>but to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be ready at any time,</v>

852
00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:23.210
<v Speaker 3>any moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what.</v>

853
00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:24.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where my dad lives,</v>

854
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 3>like from 15 years old to 40 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he needed to retire,</v>

855
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:33.731
<v Speaker 3>he needed to be able to not be ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He needed to be able to release and I </v>

856
00:42:33.771 --> 00:42:36.200
<v Speaker 3>think that was the best thing for him </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was the best thing for his life.</v>

857
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.970
<v Speaker 3>And now I think it's all good and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a very tough situation,</v>

858
00:42:40.971 --> 00:42:45.971
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lot of people don't know how serious </v>

859
00:42:45.971 --> 00:42:47.651
<v Speaker 3>my dad took.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course people know how serious but </v>

860
00:42:47.651 --> 00:42:47.651
<v Speaker 3>you only see the glory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

861
00:42:47.651 --> 00:42:50.540
<v Speaker 3>you don't see how he really is as a man </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how,</v>

862
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.270
<v Speaker 3>how you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really make it your life,</v>

863
00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:58.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fighting is a big thing is probably </v>

864
00:42:58.290 --> 00:42:58.580
<v Speaker 3>the hardest thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

865
00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:02.110
<v Speaker 3>that guy was ready anytime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere where approved,</v>

866
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.470
<v Speaker 3>very approved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The family was,</v>

867
00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:07.490
<v Speaker 3>was better ready to prove that he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>better and you know,</v>

868
00:43:07.491 --> 00:43:10.430
<v Speaker 3>that's what gives me inspiration to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to wake up in the mornings and do what I</v>

869
00:43:10.431 --> 00:43:15.431
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I only really do it because of him </v>

870
00:43:15.431 --> 00:43:16.220
<v Speaker 3>and my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only really compete because of him and</v>

871
00:43:16.221 --> 00:43:16.940
<v Speaker 3>my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only,</v>

872
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:22.510
<v Speaker 3>the more my motivation is to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep him happy and to keep this family </v>

873
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:26.360
<v Speaker 3>remember instead of just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

874
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:28.790
<v Speaker 3>the gracies work good when nobody knew </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

875
00:43:28.791 --> 00:43:29.810
<v Speaker 3>but now everybody doesn't.</v>

876
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:31.930
<v Speaker 3>They're not the nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

877
00:43:31.931 --> 00:43:36.931
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important for my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've already kind of am willing to </v>

878
00:43:36.931 --> 00:43:39.620
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice my life and willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice whatever I feel and how I like</v>

879
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:44.650
<v Speaker 3>things to be for the bigger objective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to keep my father and my </v>

880
00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:45.540
<v Speaker 3>grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

881
00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:51.070
<v Speaker 3>alive and well in their legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you there for any of those </v>

882
00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:53.480
<v Speaker 3>challenge matches?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Anjo came to the,</v>

883
00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:54.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

884
00:43:54.441 --> 00:43:56.690
<v Speaker 3>So Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a little kid at that time.</v>

885
00:43:56.691 --> 00:43:59.610
<v Speaker 3>I was like maybe four or five years old </v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

886
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.270
<v Speaker 3>I remember the days happening and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

887
00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.840
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't there at the specific advice </v>
<v Speaker 3>because not even my dad was at the time </v>

888
00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.460
<v Speaker 3>and my dad was at home in breakfast and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys came and called them.</v>

889
00:44:10.461 --> 00:44:11.060
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

890
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.760
<v Speaker 3>because in Japan were invading the </v>
<v Speaker 3>academy.</v>

891
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:19.120
<v Speaker 3>So my dad got up and like got ready to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the academy and that was like </v>

892
00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.691
<v Speaker 3>another thing like you just waked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was going to be another day for </v>

893
00:44:22.691 --> 00:44:25.631
<v Speaker 3>him to go on a bike ride and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers outside the academy ready </v>

894
00:44:25.631 --> 00:44:26.870
<v Speaker 3>to challenge you with all this press and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

895
00:44:26.871 --> 00:44:30.020
<v Speaker 3>if you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just as like a real fight,</v>

896
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for folks don't know.</v>

897
00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:31.990
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

898
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:37.400
<v Speaker 1>one historical match that apparently a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gordon has just said he seen is a Yogi </v>

899
00:44:38.581 --> 00:44:43.581
<v Speaker 1>and Joe who is a pro wrestler and MMA </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter in Japan just showed up at the </v>

900
00:44:43.651 --> 00:44:48.651
<v Speaker 1>academy and Hixon took him into a back </v>
<v Speaker 1>room and beat the fucking shit out of </v>

901
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:50.340
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Your Dad,</v>

902
00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:51.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

903
00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.320
<v Speaker 1>he came out and Yohji Andrew's face </v>
<v Speaker 1>faces,</v>

904
00:44:55.321 --> 00:44:58.700
<v Speaker 1>photos of his face online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see what your dad did to him.</v>

905
00:44:58.701 --> 00:45:03.701
<v Speaker 1>But I've heard all sorts of stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the way he choked him and all </v>

906
00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:04.830
<v Speaker 1>sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

907
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

908
00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.000
<v Speaker 3>True story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>true story.</v>

909
00:45:07.001 --> 00:45:12.001
<v Speaker 3>I seen the video many times and I used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to bring my friends over when I was a </v>

910
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:14.851
<v Speaker 3>kid and show them the fights and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is in Joe's face up on that </v>

911
00:45:14.851 --> 00:45:15.690
<v Speaker 3>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the story behind that as he came into</v>

912
00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.280
<v Speaker 3>the academy and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a long story,</v>

913
00:45:18.281 --> 00:45:23.281
<v Speaker 3>but I'll kind of sum it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but basically came in to challenge my </v>

914
00:45:23.281 --> 00:45:23.281
<v Speaker 3>dad and my dad was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

915
00:45:23.281 --> 00:45:26.941
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he shows up at the academy and they </v>

916
00:45:26.941 --> 00:45:29.851
<v Speaker 3>kicked all the press out because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't want them to film in case </v>

917
00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:33.060
<v Speaker 3>whatever happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he kicked all the press out and then </v>

918
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.670
<v Speaker 3>just the guy on Joe and his manager were</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

919
00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:39.720
<v Speaker 3>in the academy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad was having a car or my dad's </v>

920
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.531
<v Speaker 3>black belt was having a class where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a bunch of students there and </v>

921
00:45:43.531 --> 00:45:43.660
<v Speaker 3>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like everybody says,</v>

922
00:45:43.661 --> 00:45:45.100
<v Speaker 3>my dad beat the shit out of this guy.</v>

923
00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.290
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy came in and my dad </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantly took them down,</v>

924
00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.720
<v Speaker 3>mounted him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the beginning of the fight,</v>

925
00:45:49.721 --> 00:45:54.721
<v Speaker 3>the guy turned his back to try to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>put to sleep because he realized he was </v>

926
00:45:54.721 --> 00:45:58.951
<v Speaker 3>going to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he gave him his back to get to sleep </v>

927
00:45:58.951 --> 00:45:58.951
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad was like,</v>

928
00:45:58.951 --> 00:45:58.951
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to take more punishment,</v>

929
00:45:58.951 --> 00:45:59.830
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get put to sleep so </v>
<v Speaker 3>easily,</v>

930
00:45:59.831 --> 00:46:04.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he kept beating them bad and it was </v>

931
00:46:04.831 --> 00:46:04.831
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was hard to see,</v>

932
00:46:04.831 --> 00:46:05.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as even as a kid and he broke his nose,</v>

933
00:46:05.411 --> 00:46:08.470
<v Speaker 3>you can hear his nose break and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty big beating.</v>

934
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:11.920
<v Speaker 3>And then after he fought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put them to sleep,</v>

935
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:15.730
<v Speaker 3>he called the press and the press came </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and took pictures and everything.</v>

936
00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:19.840
<v Speaker 3>Andrea went back to Japan saying that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>got jumped by the academy,</v>

937
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:24.520
<v Speaker 3>that we all jumped him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then my dad had filmed it,</v>

938
00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.070
<v Speaker 3>brought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brought the video to Japan,</v>

939
00:46:27.071 --> 00:46:27.670
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

940
00:46:27.671 --> 00:46:29.500
<v Speaker 3>this is the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Showed all the press.</v>

941
00:46:29.501 --> 00:46:31.630
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

942
00:46:31.631 --> 00:46:32.740
<v Speaker 3>they all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

943
00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:37.890
<v Speaker 3>thought it was very bad that he had lied</v>
<v Speaker 3>and said that he got jumped in front of </v>

944
00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:38.740
<v Speaker 3>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

945
00:46:38.741 --> 00:46:41.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fight is true and what isn't it put</v>

946
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:42.580
<v Speaker 3>that online?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

947
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:45.280
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he just because it's martial</v>

948
00:46:45.281 --> 00:46:46.420
<v Speaker 3>arts history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

949
00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:47.320
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk to them.</v>

950
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Itunes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably make 100 grand,</v>

951
00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell that thing on itunes for a buck and</v>

952
00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.530
<v Speaker 1>you probably make $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

953
00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

954
00:46:58.331 --> 00:47:01.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe I'll promote it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me know man,</v>

955
00:47:01.931 --> 00:47:03.760
<v Speaker 1>let me know when it's up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it on twitter.</v>

956
00:47:03.761 --> 00:47:08.761
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let people know I pay a buck to </v>

957
00:47:08.761 --> 00:47:08.761
<v Speaker 1>watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

958
00:47:08.761 --> 00:47:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll pick 20 bucks to watch that Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me,</v>

959
00:47:10.241 --> 00:47:14.260
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the great challenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>matches in martial arts history.</v>

960
00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:19.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's your dad versus a Hugo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Duarte on the beach in Rio.</v>

961
00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:22.090
<v Speaker 1>There's like a few of those that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

962
00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:24.820
<v Speaker 1>You know there's a few of those which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>

963
00:47:24.821 --> 00:47:29.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were duking it out on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beach in sand know pretty,</v>

964
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 1>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty wild.</v>

965
00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:36.340
<v Speaker 1>You could see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't the prolonged beating.</v>

966
00:47:36.341 --> 00:47:38.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he let him up after he kicked his ass.</v>

967
00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:43.380
<v Speaker 3>I think my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there were so many videos of </v>

968
00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:43.720
<v Speaker 3>everybody fighting the gracie in action </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos had came out,</v>

969
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:48.750
<v Speaker 3>all these videos were out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think my dad just wanted to keep </v>

970
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:51.660
<v Speaker 3>something for himself and wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have some kind of power because </v>

971
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:54.730
<v Speaker 3>everybody had taken all the footage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything was used in whichever way,</v>

972
00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:59.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad probably never got paid a cent </v>

973
00:47:59.760 --> 00:47:59.760
<v Speaker 3>for the gracie in action videos are or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

974
00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.910
<v Speaker 3>So I think he was just wanting to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that he had power and,</v>

975
00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:04.360
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was good,</v>

976
00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:07.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this moment he has no value to that.</v>

977
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A dollar 99,</v>

978
00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:15.450
<v Speaker 1>50 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was also from the outside,</v>

979
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:18.480
<v Speaker 1>there was always the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the talk was always,</v>

980
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.200
<v Speaker 1>especially because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

981
00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:25.220
<v Speaker 1>I've been working for the UFC since 97,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the people that I was working with </v>

982
00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:25.590
<v Speaker 1>like Campbell Mclaren and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

983
00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:29.190
<v Speaker 1>they had been there from ufc one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

984
00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:32.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd said that the reason why I'm your</v>

985
00:48:32.941 --> 00:48:37.941
<v Speaker 1>uncle didn't put your brother in our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't put your father and instead put </v>

986
00:48:37.941 --> 00:48:42.351
<v Speaker 1>hoists in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why he did that was because </v>

987
00:48:42.351 --> 00:48:43.680
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't control Hickson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hickson was just,</v>

988
00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:45.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the best of the family.</v>

989
00:48:45.841 --> 00:48:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew he was the best of </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

990
00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:52.590
<v Speaker 1>but that Horian knew that if he put </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hixson Hixson wasn't gonna,</v>

991
00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:57.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hickson was going to do whatever you </v>

992
00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:57.660
<v Speaker 1>want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

993
00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:59.601
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't going to listen to him and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be able to control him the way </v>

994
00:48:59.601 --> 00:49:03.291
<v Speaker 1>he possibly controlled everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any truth to that or what is </v>

995
00:49:03.291 --> 00:49:03.291
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

996
00:49:03.291 --> 00:49:07.860
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of different things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happened in that kind of time and </v>

997
00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:07.860
<v Speaker 3>Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

998
00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:12.240
<v Speaker 3>one reason why he's fought in the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

999
00:49:12.241 --> 00:49:13.480
<v Speaker 3>my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because my dad was the best,</v>

1000
00:49:13.481 --> 00:49:18.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad would tap out hoists with one </v>

1001
00:49:18.481 --> 00:49:19.870
<v Speaker 3>hand and in his belt before his fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was no doubt of that.</v>

1002
00:49:19.871 --> 00:49:24.130
<v Speaker 3>One excuse I think was that Horian </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked or hoist look more frail.</v>

1003
00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:27.430
<v Speaker 3>He looked like a more of a normal guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they wanted to make him.</v>

1004
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:30.490
<v Speaker 3>They wanted that to be able to prove </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you do to is better.</v>

1005
00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:34.930
<v Speaker 3>But ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true or not and I</v>

1006
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:38.230
<v Speaker 3>don't know the exact reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but basically before that situation,</v>

1007
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:41.490
<v Speaker 3>a Horian and my dad had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a,</v>

1008
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of started to separate.</v>

1009
00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:45.340
<v Speaker 3>They kind of started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1010
00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:46.720
<v Speaker 3>to go their own ways.</v>

1011
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.490
<v Speaker 3>And I think in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1012
00:49:48.491 --> 00:49:49.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent,</v>

1013
00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:55.170
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I kind of thing happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure horry and felt more control</v>

1014
00:49:55.691 --> 00:49:56.710
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>

1015
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:59.080
<v Speaker 3>over hoist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he did it with my father.</v>

1016
00:49:59.081 --> 00:50:02.200
<v Speaker 3>My Dad was kind of already starting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find his own way and do his own thing.</v>

1017
00:50:02.201 --> 00:50:04.750
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1018
00:50:04.751 --> 00:50:09.751
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know too much about it because </v>

1019
00:50:09.751 --> 00:50:09.751
<v Speaker 3>we never really talked about that far </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

1020
00:50:09.751 --> 00:50:11.590
<v Speaker 3>But even I think I have talked to my dad</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

1021
00:50:11.591 --> 00:50:14.500
<v Speaker 3>but I forget because that's not really </v>
<v Speaker 3>that important these days for me.</v>

1022
00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1023
00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Horian gets a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>

1024
00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Whoring gets a lot of grief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean he was such a great promoter </v>

1025
00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:24.780
<v Speaker 1>of Jujitsu and if it wasn't for him </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>

1026
00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:29.150
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't for him putting on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>gracie in videos and promoting them.</v>

1027
00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:31.970
<v Speaker 1>And promoting Jujitsu and promoting </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gracie Jujitsu.</v>

1028
00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:32.610
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1029
00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:36.880
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably has a huge part of what Jujitsu</v>

1030
00:50:36.881 --> 00:50:41.881
<v Speaker 3>and MMA is today that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he definitely made his value huge </v>

1031
00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:45.850
<v Speaker 3>because not only did he create the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

1032
00:50:45.851 --> 00:50:47.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came to America,</v>

1033
00:50:47.531 --> 00:50:48.680
<v Speaker 3>he spread it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1034
00:50:48.681 --> 00:50:53.681
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the one challenge doing all the </v>

1035
00:50:53.681 --> 00:50:54.040
<v Speaker 3>challenges in doing everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was the reason really.</v>

1036
00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:59.280
<v Speaker 3>And my dad was just a soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the guy that one representing and </v>

1037
00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.230
<v Speaker 3>ready to do what he had to do and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1038
00:51:02.231 --> 00:51:07.231
<v Speaker 3>it's like Carlos and Leo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leo was the representative and Carlos </v>

1039
00:51:07.231 --> 00:51:09.820
<v Speaker 3>was the guy who kind of took care of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>academy and it was the theory behind the</v>

1040
00:51:09.821 --> 00:51:12.790
<v Speaker 3>diets and the theory behind the names </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff.</v>

1041
00:51:12.791 --> 00:51:16.840
<v Speaker 3>So I think neither one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're both responsible for,</v>

1042
00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:19.930
<v Speaker 3>for the movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

1043
00:51:19.931 --> 00:51:21.910
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horian,</v>

1044
00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:24.160
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did like even as academy,</v>

1045
00:51:24.161 --> 00:51:25.990
<v Speaker 3>look at his academy day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a museum,</v>

1046
00:51:25.991 --> 00:51:26.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has,</v>

1047
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:30.430
<v Speaker 3>it's like a five star hotel with shower </v>
<v Speaker 3>head look at my academy and it's nothing</v>

1048
00:51:30.431 --> 00:51:30.940
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1049
00:51:30.941 --> 00:51:33.460
<v Speaker 3>my academy is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has some pictures and stuff,</v>

1050
00:51:33.461 --> 00:51:35.410
<v Speaker 3>but it's not focused on that.</v>

1051
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:38.590
<v Speaker 3>My focusing is on the match,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will retrain what I teach.</v>

1052
00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:43.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm not focused on promoting and being </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to sell Jujitsu and being able to </v>

1053
00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:46.330
<v Speaker 3>expand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why the gracies you know,</v>

1054
00:51:46.331 --> 00:51:48.100
<v Speaker 3>like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come in,</v>

1055
00:51:48.101 --> 00:51:53.101
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna come to me and telling me </v>

1056
00:51:53.101 --> 00:51:53.440
<v Speaker 3>if you know and you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And horian was,</v>

1057
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:57.430
<v Speaker 3>he did a great job in expanding and </v>
<v Speaker 3>showing the world in your face.</v>

1058
00:51:57.431 --> 00:51:57.790
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1059
00:51:57.791 --> 00:52:02.791
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what happens when this happens </v>

1060
00:52:02.791 --> 00:52:04.831
<v Speaker 3>and this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was a great tool for the family </v>

1061
00:52:04.831 --> 00:52:04.860
<v Speaker 3>and a great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1062
00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.820
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made it happen.</v>

1063
00:52:06.821 --> 00:52:07.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1064
00:52:07.181 --> 00:52:08.170
<v Speaker 3>he created a lot.</v>

1065
00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of us fans of Jujitsu or Horian </v>

1066
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge debt of gratitude without a </v>

1067
00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:18.571
<v Speaker 1>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also because he produced his sons </v>

1068
00:52:18.571 --> 00:52:22.350
<v Speaker 1>that are also great promoters of Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the great the Gracie breakdowns I </v>

1069
00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:24.350
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite things about after </v>
<v Speaker 1>submissions after this,</v>

1070
00:52:24.351 --> 00:52:29.351
<v Speaker 1>a submission in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Henna here on will get together and </v>

1071
00:52:29.351 --> 00:52:34.020
<v Speaker 1>discuss with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with great technical explanation all the</v>

1072
00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.220
<v Speaker 1>various aspects of where someone went </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

1073
00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:39.040
<v Speaker 1>where things went right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the proper adjustment,</v>

1074
00:52:39.041 --> 00:52:41.740
<v Speaker 1>what they did to get out of a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

1075
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Really very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very educational.</v>

1076
00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And if you watch that show a UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate insider,</v>

1077
00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:52.120
<v Speaker 1>it's on UFC ultimate insider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so great because first of all,</v>

1078
00:52:52.121 --> 00:52:55.300
<v Speaker 1>henry is so good at explaining these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1079
00:52:55.301 --> 00:53:00.301
<v Speaker 1>He's so articulate and so charismatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to these breakdowns of </v>

1080
00:53:00.851 --> 00:53:03.700
<v Speaker 1>positions is so much enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1081
00:53:03.701 --> 00:53:06.730
<v Speaker 1>you watch these guys talk about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and it makes you want to train.</v>

1082
00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really does.</v>

1083
00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:11.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really good stuff and it just shows</v>

1084
00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:15.100
<v Speaker 1>how much is going on with Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For folks who don't know,</v>

1085
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:18.530
<v Speaker 1>there's so much going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1086
00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:19.950
<v Speaker 1>for people don't know they're looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

1087
00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:20.860
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1088
00:53:20.861 --> 00:53:23.320
<v Speaker 1>this guy's trying to choke that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's trying to stop it,</v>

1089
00:53:23.321 --> 00:53:28.321
<v Speaker 1>but it's all about the and the intricate</v>
<v Speaker 1>details of leverage and movement.</v>

1090
00:53:28.501 --> 00:53:30.960
<v Speaker 1>And these guys do a real good job </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking that down.</v>

1091
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do do a great job breaking it down.</v>

1092
00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:38.280
<v Speaker 3>And personally for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been one to teach online or </v>

1093
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:42.520
<v Speaker 3>through magazines or through stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I believe the Jujitsu is a lot </v>

1094
00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.510
<v Speaker 3>more about feel and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1095
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:48.790
<v Speaker 3>I kind of don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of disagree with myself teaching </v>

1096
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:50.630
<v Speaker 3>online or through videos and all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1097
00:53:50.631 --> 00:53:55.631
<v Speaker 3>I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be able to feel and look </v>

1098
00:53:55.631 --> 00:53:55.760
<v Speaker 3>somebody in the eyes if I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>teach them Jujitsu.</v>

1099
00:53:56.390 --> 00:54:00.110
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my philosophy behind that,</v>

1100
00:54:00.111 --> 00:54:05.111
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing a great job of spreading </v>

1101
00:54:05.111 --> 00:54:06.920
<v Speaker 3>it to all those people who can't get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and they do what they do.</v>

1102
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:10.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really a to in control of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they do or how they do it.</v>

1103
00:54:10.431 --> 00:54:12.150
<v Speaker 3>But I know for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1104
00:54:12.151 --> 00:54:17.151
<v Speaker 3>I kind of don't do that and I kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stick to my academy and where I teach </v>

1105
00:54:18.411 --> 00:54:20.420
<v Speaker 3>and I focused on that kind of stuff.</v>

1106
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm talking about is their </v>

1107
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:26.610
<v Speaker 1>explanations of those guys are in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who rate</v>

1108
00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:27.790
<v Speaker 3>for the native,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1109
00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:28.420
<v Speaker 3>those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1110
00:54:28.421 --> 00:54:32.060
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they explained to the T.</v>

1111
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:37.190
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the more difficult aspects </v>
<v Speaker 1>of doing commentary is explaining not </v>

1112
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:38.340
<v Speaker 1>just recognizing positions and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen,</v>

1113
00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:43.341
<v Speaker 1>but explaining to people positions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining what were the defenses were </v>

1114
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:48.410
<v Speaker 1>the offenders and doing it all in real </v>
<v Speaker 1>time while the mat scrambles are going </v>

1115
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.820
<v Speaker 1>on and trying to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1116
00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:54.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what arms and Japanese at the left arm </v>

1117
00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.991
<v Speaker 1>with his left arm and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to process all this stuff and </v>

1118
00:54:56.991 --> 00:54:56.991
<v Speaker 1>you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does he have his hand,</v>

1119
00:54:56.991 --> 00:54:57.210
<v Speaker 1>his hands locked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see.</v>

1120
00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:01.760
<v Speaker 1>And try to put it all into together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then explain it to the layman to explain</v>

1121
00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:05.280
<v Speaker 1>to the person who doesn't train at home </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's just a massive bodies.</v>

1122
00:55:05.281 --> 00:55:10.281
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I just focused on competing </v>

1123
00:55:10.281 --> 00:55:11.400
<v Speaker 1>and training better for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Competing training and teaching.</v>

1124
00:55:11.401 --> 00:55:16.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I like that philosophy of looking </v>

1125
00:55:16.401 --> 00:55:18.561
<v Speaker 1>someone in the eye and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and training because there is that </v>

1126
00:55:18.561 --> 00:55:21.360
<v Speaker 1>aspect of if you put a video out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know who's learning your shit,</v>

1127
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:22.290
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1128
00:55:22.291 --> 00:55:23.370
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very personal,</v>

1129
00:55:23.371 --> 00:55:25.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and it's very personal.</v>

1130
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:26.340
<v Speaker 3>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1131
00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:31.350
<v Speaker 3>and while I'm still competing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last thing I want is my enemies to be </v>

1132
00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:32.310
<v Speaker 3>able to see what I do and see how I do </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1133
00:55:32.311 --> 00:55:35.010
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way I would do that.</v>

1134
00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:39.190
<v Speaker 1>One of the interesting aspects about you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your Jujitsu career too,</v>

1135
00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:44.220
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a lot of variation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and Jujitsu styles.</v>

1136
00:55:44.591 --> 00:55:47.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of new stuff that's come </v>
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>

1137
00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:49.360
<v Speaker 1>a lot of new techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of new strategies,</v>

1138
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:53.080
<v Speaker 1>but your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your attacks and your Jujitsu,</v>

1139
00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:57.160
<v Speaker 1>very much like your father's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very much traditional Jujitsu,</v>

1140
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:58.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a,</v>

1141
00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:03.630
<v Speaker 1>there was a time when Vinny Magalhaes </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on the ultimate fighter with a </v>

1142
00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Minotauro Nogueira and he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about minotauro.</v>

1143
00:56:06.971 --> 00:56:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Nogueira is Jujitsu and he said it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very basic,</v>

1144
00:56:09.101 --> 00:56:11.560
<v Speaker 1>very basic features are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's all got really mad at him,</v>

1145
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:14.890
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he didn't mean it in a bad way.</v>

1146
00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:20.160
<v Speaker 1>What he meant by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the basics but honed to a laser </v>

1147
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.750
<v Speaker 1>sharp edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's nothing wrong with the,</v>

1148
00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:27.460
<v Speaker 1>they're the foundation of Jujitsu and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I watch you compete,</v>

1149
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:31.900
<v Speaker 1>you're using the real traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques of Jujitsu.</v>

1150
00:56:31.901 --> 00:56:36.901
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing like a tricky that </v>

1151
00:56:36.901 --> 00:56:41.851
<v Speaker 1>people haven't seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just Jujitsu that's done to </v>

1152
00:56:41.851 --> 00:56:41.851
<v Speaker 1>perfection.</v>

1153
00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:47.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the tricks they work </v>

1154
00:56:47.790 --> 00:56:50.640
<v Speaker 3>sometimes and they work if it's some </v>
<v Speaker 3>good moment,</v>

1155
00:56:50.641 --> 00:56:51.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these,</v>

1156
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:54.600
<v Speaker 3>these new things that happen in these </v>
<v Speaker 3>new ways to defeat your opponent.</v>

1157
00:56:54.601 --> 00:56:59.601
<v Speaker 3>So I'm always looking for a situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to work all the time,</v>

1158
00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so these tricks,</v>

1159
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:07.590
<v Speaker 3>the good positions or stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they demand a lot out of you and they </v>

1160
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:11.541
<v Speaker 3>only work if that situation happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not concerned with trapping </v>

1161
00:57:11.671 --> 00:57:16.671
<v Speaker 3>myself into a position that's good for </v>
<v Speaker 3>me because I count on not being in good </v>

1162
00:57:16.671 --> 00:57:17.760
<v Speaker 3>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I count on being in a bad position.</v>

1163
00:57:17.761 --> 00:57:20.590
<v Speaker 3>I count on being in another position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for me I'm,</v>

1164
00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm leaving my training sessions open </v>

1165
00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:28.521
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to what may happen and I don't like try </v>

1166
00:57:28.521 --> 00:57:31.320
<v Speaker 3>to get to a certain position and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>began my training.</v>

1167
00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.810
<v Speaker 3>That's what I feel like happens most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1168
00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:36.160
<v Speaker 3>It's due to these days as you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to this grip,</v>

1169
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.750
<v Speaker 3>this grip and then from here you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to start training.</v>

1170
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.800
<v Speaker 3>So to get to that position where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have your special grips and everything,</v>

1171
00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:49.070
<v Speaker 3>it takes a lot of energy and it takes a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of strength and I kind of based my </v>

1172
00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:51.510
<v Speaker 3>attitude so on leverage and techniques </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that it'll work when I'm fresh,</v>

1173
00:57:51.511 --> 00:57:56.511
<v Speaker 3>when I'm tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm fighting a guy who's bigger than </v>

1174
00:57:56.511 --> 00:57:56.511
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't depend on physical strength.</v>

1175
00:57:56.511 --> 00:58:01.281
<v Speaker 3>So that's where kind of my dad kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>forced me because I didn't always think </v>

1176
00:58:01.281 --> 00:58:05.050
<v Speaker 3>like this and you kind of given me the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only the,</v>

1177
00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:10.480
<v Speaker 3>the technique and the leverage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but showing me that it's possible </v>

1178
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:14.570
<v Speaker 3>proving to me firsthand that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible for you to beat your opponents </v>

1179
00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:15.570
<v Speaker 3>with leverage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To not use dream to say,</v>

1180
00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:17.070
<v Speaker 3>so my like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1181
00:58:17.071 --> 00:58:22.071
<v Speaker 3>been been promoting this like little </v>
<v Speaker 3>mini warrior in my mind for a long time </v>

1182
00:58:22.411 --> 00:58:27.411
<v Speaker 3>of how to be not only mentally but </v>
<v Speaker 3>physically in training wise and </v>

1183
00:58:27.411 --> 00:58:31.220
<v Speaker 3>spiritually and it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all helped me in and he's a great,</v>

1184
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:32.460
<v Speaker 3>huge part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1185
00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:33.870
<v Speaker 3>of my success.</v>

1186
00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:36.380
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I took from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with your dad,</v>

1187
00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.080
<v Speaker 1>we was talking about the various aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you did too,</v>

1188
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:42.380
<v Speaker 1>but he was saying that first and </v>
<v Speaker 1>foremost,</v>

1189
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:45.530
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important weapons that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he has is his defense.</v>

1190
00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:47.420
<v Speaker 1>That is always safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1191
00:58:47.421 --> 00:58:48.740
<v Speaker 1>at any position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always safe.</v>

1192
00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.430
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He concentrates on that.</v>

1193
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:56.530
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing was that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he moved from one position,</v>

1194
00:58:56.531 --> 00:58:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I never forget this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1195
00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:03.400
<v Speaker 1>we all started point zero from zero in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the neutral point I moved to one and </v>

1196
00:59:03.801 --> 00:59:05.920
<v Speaker 1>when I get to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going back to zero.</v>

1197
00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:12.340
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like he said he's a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting person,</v>

1198
00:59:12.341 --> 00:59:12.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1199
00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:14.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watch his fights,</v>

1200
00:59:14.411 --> 00:59:17.920
<v Speaker 1>he rarely loses positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no sloppy scrambles know.</v>

1201
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:20.860
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that I criticize </v>
<v Speaker 1>people sometimes about an MMA,</v>

1202
00:59:20.861 --> 00:59:25.861
<v Speaker 1>like guys leave too much space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go for things in a way they're not </v>

1203
00:59:25.861 --> 00:59:29.570
<v Speaker 1>in control of the position and he never </v>
<v Speaker 1>did that when when he would mount a god,</v>

1204
00:59:29.571 --> 00:59:34.571
<v Speaker 1>that motherfucker would stay mounted </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he mounted the guy was just a </v>

1205
00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:35.090
<v Speaker 1>matter of time before we got an arm bar </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever he got for you.</v>

1206
00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty cool to see that the,</v>

1207
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:42.470
<v Speaker 3>I guess like everything in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything goes back to the basics and I</v>

1208
00:59:42.471 --> 00:59:46.370
<v Speaker 3>didn't like plan to have a certain type </v>
<v Speaker 3>of style.</v>

1209
00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:47.240
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1210
00:59:47.241 --> 00:59:48.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>

1211
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:51.260
<v Speaker 3>Just try to train this style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just submissions only.</v>

1212
00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:52.850
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't plan that.</v>

1213
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:58.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm planning and it's not like I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to start a fight and I'm just going to </v>

1214
00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:01.901
<v Speaker 3>go for an arm rocker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go for a crazy submission </v>

1215
01:00:01.901 --> 01:00:01.901
<v Speaker 3>from nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like that either.</v>

1216
01:00:01.901 --> 01:00:05.620
<v Speaker 3>You're not gonna get that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my training sessions are to like </v>

1217
01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:09.611
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad says to get to the next better </v>

1218
01:00:09.611 --> 01:00:09.611
<v Speaker 3>position to get to the next better </v>
<v Speaker 3>position to get to the submission.</v>

1219
01:00:09.611 --> 01:00:12.860
<v Speaker 3>So I'm never stopping my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never stopped in my training,</v>

1220
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't stop in a place and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1221
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to breathe here for a second </v>
<v Speaker 3>or I don't do that.</v>

1222
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:23.650
<v Speaker 3>I kind of always am looking for the next</v>
<v Speaker 3>place to get to the finish line and </v>

1223
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:29.290
<v Speaker 3>that's created a very aggressive style </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm always looking for the next </v>

1224
01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:31.520
<v Speaker 3>place to be and it's not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1225
01:00:31.521 --> 01:00:33.110
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just go for submissions from anywhere.</v>

1226
01:00:33.111 --> 01:00:34.420
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going for.</v>

1227
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it may be to pass the guard or</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe to do to get his leg off my hip or</v>

1228
01:00:39.591 --> 01:00:43.700
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is that may happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like I'm just thinking about</v>

1229
01:00:43.701 --> 01:00:46.370
<v Speaker 3>submissions or I'm not thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing crazy.</v>

1230
01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:52.280
<v Speaker 3>The tricky stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just that those stuff may not fall </v>

1231
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.260
<v Speaker 3>into what I'm mentally trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your objective,</v>

1232
01:00:54.261 --> 01:00:56.480
<v Speaker 3>my objective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's the biggest thing.</v>

1233
01:00:56.481 --> 01:00:59.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't think too much about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think about how am I going to get</v>

1234
01:00:59.241 --> 01:01:02.390
<v Speaker 3>to a next better place?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How am I going to put him here?</v>

1235
01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.540
<v Speaker 3>So it just comes kind of naturally at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this point.</v>

1236
01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:10.541
<v Speaker 3>I can't even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not trained that way if I try to train </v>

1237
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:15.550
<v Speaker 3>any different way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my Jujitsu sucks so it's become A.</v>

1238
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:20.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very grateful that it's become like </v>

1239
01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:23.381
<v Speaker 3>this and I have this type of style and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had gotten as good as I got with the </v>

1240
01:01:23.381 --> 01:01:25.550
<v Speaker 3>basics and with what I with the tools </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I had.</v>

1241
01:01:25.551 --> 01:01:26.750
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm super stoked.</v>

1242
01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:31.850
<v Speaker 1>That became an issue in Abu Dhabi with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of wrestlers that wrestlers would </v>

1243
01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>take guys down and just hold them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions and not go for submissions.</v>

1244
01:01:34.921 --> 01:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Just try to go for points and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people would get furious.</v>

1245
01:01:39.061 --> 01:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this isn't Jujitsu,</v>

1246
01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>but some people felt like the only way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to compete with these guys is to do what</v>

1247
01:01:44.311 --> 01:01:47.650
<v Speaker 1>they're doing is to fight smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way you can win is to,</v>

1248
01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight on points.</v>

1249
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Would you rather lose on points then </v>
<v Speaker 1>when?</v>

1250
01:01:54.151 --> 01:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>By holding a guy down?</v>

1251
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have lost like,</v>

1252
01:01:57.291 --> 01:01:59.990
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't bother you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

1253
01:01:59.991 --> 01:02:01.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You show me a good loser.</v>

1254
01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:06.851
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you a loser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know.</v>

1255
01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:11.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I rather lose on points with keeping my </v>

1256
01:02:12.021 --> 01:02:17.021
<v Speaker 3>mentality always with the objective to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get into a better place then to stop my </v>

1257
01:02:17.841 --> 01:02:22.841
<v Speaker 3>game and to find out how I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>win this match while using the time on </v>

1258
01:02:22.841 --> 01:02:27.141
<v Speaker 3>my side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have fought matches where I lost </v>

1259
01:02:27.141 --> 01:02:31.010
<v Speaker 3>when I could won,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was winning on points and then I went </v>

1260
01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:31.180
<v Speaker 3>for something or I try to advance the </v>
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>

1261
01:02:31.181 --> 01:02:33.180
<v Speaker 3>then I lost it and then doing and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1262
01:02:33.181 --> 01:02:35.160
<v Speaker 3>The guy swept me and then I lost because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the time right now.</v>

1263
01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:39.930
<v Speaker 3>So I have lost matches like that and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>served as a good learning experience and</v>

1264
01:02:39.931 --> 01:02:42.270
<v Speaker 3>everything and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1265
01:02:42.271 --> 01:02:46.380
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather lose on points then to sit </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and stop the game and wait for the</v>

1266
01:02:46.381 --> 01:02:47.640
<v Speaker 3>time to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1267
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:51.930
<v Speaker 3>to run out because I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I would feel like shit,</v>

1268
01:02:51.931 --> 01:02:56.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like deep inside me I have a </v>

1269
01:02:56.931 --> 01:02:59.220
<v Speaker 3>thing that I feel like really bad if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't try to go for the next position.</v>

1270
01:02:59.221 --> 01:03:01.770
<v Speaker 3>I feel guilty almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like my grandfather's.</v>

1271
01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>So you were your Jujitsu and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1272
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:14.190
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your path is clearly a work in progress </v>

1273
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:16.861
<v Speaker 1>and even though you've achieved the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great heights of being an Abu Dhabi </v>

1274
01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>world champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're training and fighting,</v>

1275
01:03:18.101 --> 01:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>you're always competing with that very </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific mindset.</v>

1276
01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>So any setbacks are just going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>educational experiences.</v>

1277
01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>You learn from those setbacks and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>next time you even greater,</v>

1278
01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>which is why when you came in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it second place in 2011?</v>

1279
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:32.430
<v Speaker 1>A third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>third place,</v>

1280
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:37.450
<v Speaker 1>2011.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came back and fucking dominated in </v>

1281
01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>2013.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a big leap man.</v>

1282
01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was good one.</v>

1283
01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:41.980
<v Speaker 3>It was a good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think honestly,</v>

1284
01:03:41.981 --> 01:03:45.850
<v Speaker 3>I think I was ready for it and maybe if </v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've won in 2011,</v>

1285
01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.730
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't have been the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if I went in 2009,</v>

1286
01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:51.040
<v Speaker 3>who knows what would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1287
01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:55.420
<v Speaker 3>I feel like now I'm ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't make more excuses about anything</v>

1288
01:03:55.421 --> 01:03:57.160
<v Speaker 3>and if I don't win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's my fault.</v>

1289
01:03:57.161 --> 01:04:02.161
<v Speaker 3>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the guy was good enough to stall me </v>

1290
01:04:02.161 --> 01:04:02.161
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was good enough to start me out.</v>

1291
01:04:02.161 --> 01:04:06.820
<v Speaker 3>So I have to come up with some thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to be better than he is,</v>

1292
01:04:06.821 --> 01:04:09.400
<v Speaker 3>so I don't really take it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>criticize them anymore.</v>

1293
01:04:09.401 --> 01:04:14.401
<v Speaker 3>If the guy just stalls on me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I expect that the guys are not going to </v>

1294
01:04:14.401 --> 01:04:17.731
<v Speaker 3>want to fight me into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to want to start and get </v>

1295
01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:17.731
<v Speaker 3>some points in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel good.</v>

1296
01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:19.390
<v Speaker 3>I expect that and I trained that </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation and I'm ready for that.</v>

1297
01:04:19.391 --> 01:04:22.030
<v Speaker 3>And so far so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1298
01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:23.240
<v Speaker 3>I've been on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a good,</v>

1299
01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:24.280
<v Speaker 3>good run lately.</v>

1300
01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen the video where Eddie</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bravo and I were talking about your </v>

1301
01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.930
<v Speaker 1>magic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dad was great for folks who don't know </v>

1302
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:36.350
<v Speaker 1>in the finals that dude was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stall crawling out and starts making </v>

1303
01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:40.340
<v Speaker 1>chicken noises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gone.</v>

1304
01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And for a Jujitsu Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1305
01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>do you want to talk about the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind?</v>

1306
01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not just fighting against the son</v>

1307
01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:56.330
<v Speaker 1>of the greatest ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the greatest ever is making chicken </v>

1308
01:04:56.330 --> 01:04:56.330
<v Speaker 1>noises that you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1309
01:04:56.330 --> 01:04:56.880
<v Speaker 1>that was fucked up</v>

1310
01:04:56.910 --> 01:05:00.050
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it started.</v>

1311
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:02.090
<v Speaker 3>When he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1312
01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.730
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I can't let this get to me too.</v>

1313
01:05:04.731 --> 01:05:06.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because my dad is over here,</v>

1314
01:05:06.801 --> 01:05:11.180
<v Speaker 3>like of course I have to kind of try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep in the final match.</v>

1315
01:05:11.181 --> 01:05:13.490
<v Speaker 3>I fought a guy who I had beaten many </v>
<v Speaker 3>times before,</v>

1316
01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.070
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1317
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:21.910
<v Speaker 3>I knew that I could win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I were to start letting myself </v>

1318
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:22.360
<v Speaker 3>believe that I was gonna win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1319
01:05:22.361 --> 01:05:23.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to win because I had already </v>
<v Speaker 3>won.</v>

1320
01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.140
<v Speaker 3>It was going to completely mess up my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

1321
01:05:26.141 --> 01:05:29.290
<v Speaker 3>So I went into the fight like he was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most difficult fight of my life.</v>

1322
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:33.310
<v Speaker 3>And when my dad started to get Fred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew he was going to back away.</v>

1323
01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:36.190
<v Speaker 3>I knew he was gonna start me out and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was not getting to me.</v>

1324
01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:37.990
<v Speaker 3>I was just like trying to do what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do.</v>

1325
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:41.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to go crazy because he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not wanting to fight me.</v>

1326
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:46.980
<v Speaker 3>I was expecting that the reps were gonna</v>
<v Speaker 3>warn him and take away points and I was </v>

1327
01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.280
<v Speaker 3>going to let that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah,</v>

1328
01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:52.960
<v Speaker 3>when my dad was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you did that,</v>

1329
01:05:52.961 --> 01:05:54.450
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1330
01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:55.320
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kicked chrome.</v>

1331
01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:58.000
<v Speaker 3>Don't let it get it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't let that shit get to you,</v>

1332
01:05:58.001 --> 01:05:58.590
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't think,</v>

1333
01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:01.930
<v Speaker 3>don't let him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to make it so that me.</v>

1334
01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:04.450
<v Speaker 3>So you and your dad are fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

1335
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:09.750
<v Speaker 3>Not against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to let him where he said </v>

1336
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:11.731
<v Speaker 3>like affect my train of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put more pressure on me to have to do </v>

1337
01:06:11.731 --> 01:06:15.181
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I kinda kept my cool and thank God </v>

1338
01:06:15.181 --> 01:06:18.391
<v Speaker 3>like shortly after that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got a point taken away for crystal </v>

1339
01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:21.580
<v Speaker 3>clean and then he went for the take down</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got him in a good guillotine.</v>

1340
01:06:21.581 --> 01:06:24.910
<v Speaker 3>So it all worked out as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that victory right there,</v>

1341
01:06:24.911 --> 01:06:26.950
<v Speaker 3>right there is like the happiest moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>of my life.</v>

1342
01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:32.730
<v Speaker 3>That's the greatest feeling ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think my dad still still so happy.</v>

1343
01:06:32.891 --> 01:06:35.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean I haven't seen my dad that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody that comes up and talks to me,</v>

1344
01:06:35.261 --> 01:06:40.261
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dad hasn't been this happy in so </v>

1345
01:06:40.261 --> 01:06:42.271
<v Speaker 3>long and to see him so proud and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so stoked to finally achieve that number</v>

1346
01:06:43.181 --> 01:06:45.190
<v Speaker 3>one place is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a good thing.</v>

1347
01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.350
<v Speaker 1>It was such a beautiful poetic moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1348
01:06:47.351 --> 01:06:52.351
<v Speaker 1>When the guy shoots for the take down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you immediately lock it up like this is </v>

1349
01:06:52.351 --> 01:06:52.351
<v Speaker 1>why this guy was</v>

1350
01:06:52.351 --> 01:06:52.351
<v Speaker 3>stolen</v>

1351
01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:56.950
<v Speaker 1>right into the jaws of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lock that thing on.</v>

1352
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Perfect too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was beautiful.</v>

1353
01:06:58.490 --> 01:07:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean he tapped out within like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of seconds.</v>

1354
01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:01.070
<v Speaker 1>It was over.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're swinging like here's the video he</v>

1379
01:08:12.091 --> 01:08:12.420
<v Speaker 1>climbed.</v>

1380
01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:15.200
<v Speaker 3>How often do you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1381
01:08:15.201 --> 01:08:17.930
<v Speaker 3>I live in Santa Monica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I go there all the time and I kind of</v>

1382
01:08:17.931 --> 01:08:22.931
<v Speaker 3>always do just like some workouts and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to be at the beach and in the </v>

1383
01:08:22.931 --> 01:08:22.931
<v Speaker 3>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is just like a joke,</v>

1384
01:08:22.931 --> 01:08:25.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it just kind of a little trick,</v>

01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:26.210
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1386
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this little trick,</v>

1387
01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:33.360
<v Speaker 1>he's jumping nine feet from one bar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next swinging and then catching with</v>

1388
01:08:33.981 --> 01:08:37.220
<v Speaker 1>his arms like a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is some wild shit.</v>

1389
01:08:37.221 --> 01:08:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is on the chimpanzee shit</v>

1390
01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:42.410
<v Speaker 3>that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nate was the one filming that and he was</v>

1391
01:08:42.411 --> 01:08:44.900
<v Speaker 3>super stoked on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how often do you do that?</v>

1392
01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:48.680
<v Speaker 3>I go down to the bars or at least like </v>
<v Speaker 3>once or twice a week just to kind of,</v>

1393
01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:50.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do the ropes or climb the ropes for my</v>

1394
01:08:50.781 --> 01:08:53.570
<v Speaker 3>forearms and I do some of his stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1395
01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:58.740
<v Speaker 3>that's never like the biggest part of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>training or it's never the most </v>

1396
01:08:58.740 --> 01:08:58.940
<v Speaker 3>important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always come secondary to training,</v>

1397
01:08:58.941 --> 01:09:01.670
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and my specific stuff I got </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

1398
01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:06.671
<v Speaker 3>But when you train all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday you got to find ways to keep </v>

1399
01:09:06.671 --> 01:09:08.720
<v Speaker 3>yourself entertained and keep yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoying what you're doing.</v>

1400
01:09:08.721 --> 01:09:11.390
<v Speaker 3>And I hate being in a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had been in a gym.</v>

1401
01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:12.950
<v Speaker 3>Weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gym.</v>

1402
01:09:12.951 --> 01:09:13.440
<v Speaker 3>Human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1403
01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:18.520
<v Speaker 3>weightlifting gym and I hate being in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there like working out and so if I'm </v>

1404
01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:18.760
<v Speaker 3>going to go on a bike ride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go outside.</v>

1405
01:09:18.761 --> 01:09:20.000
<v Speaker 3>If I'm going to run out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go outside,</v>

1406
01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:25.010
<v Speaker 3>I like to feel the fresh air and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy myself while I'm in this kind of </v>

1407
01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:26.510
<v Speaker 3>hill that I live in.</v>

1408
01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.080
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of held perpetual training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean?</v>

1409
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much physical training do you do </v>

1410
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.110
<v Speaker 1>besides the Jujitsu?</v>

1411
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:38.800
<v Speaker 3>I do a lot of energy too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a lot of everything I run,</v>

1412
01:09:38.801 --> 01:09:40.420
<v Speaker 3>I bike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swim,</v>

1413
01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1414
01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.150
<v Speaker 1>And when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what are the objectives?</v>

1415
01:09:44.151 --> 01:09:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do you're running,</v>

1416
01:09:45.771 --> 01:09:48.230
<v Speaker 1>are you monitoring your heart rate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doing sprints,</v>

1417
01:09:48.231 --> 01:09:50.290
<v Speaker 1>eat tabata intervals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you,</v>

1418
01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:52.280
<v Speaker 1>how do you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do all the different types,</v>

1419
01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:57.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I do just a long distance run </v>

1420
01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:59.660
<v Speaker 3>while run an hour and 10 or 20 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight and then the goal would be for </v>

1421
01:10:00.351 --> 01:10:05.351
<v Speaker 3>that would be endurance and then I'll do</v>
<v Speaker 3>some days where I'll just do sprints </v>

1422
01:10:05.351 --> 01:10:09.500
<v Speaker 3>upstairs or some days I'll just do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bike long bike rides or you know,</v>

1423
01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:11.150
<v Speaker 3>all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of just,</v>

1424
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:16.270
<v Speaker 3>some days it's more explosive and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>days it's more long distance and I just </v>

1425
01:10:16.461 --> 01:10:21.461
<v Speaker 3>use it as a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an addition to two other things I do </v>

1426
01:10:21.461 --> 01:10:24.320
<v Speaker 3>and I felt like since I really started </v>
<v Speaker 3>to put my energy into other things,</v>

1427
01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:29.740
<v Speaker 3>it's made my Jujitsu better because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>more in life when you sacrifice in one </v>

1428
01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:30.650
<v Speaker 3>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what it is,</v>

1429
01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:32.450
<v Speaker 3>it gives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you better.</v>

1430
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:37.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it's like something </v>

1431
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:37.570
<v Speaker 3>with the universe where no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you say,</v>

1432
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:42.371
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to wake up at six in the </v>

1433
01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:43.250
<v Speaker 3>morning to go do 20 pushups and then go </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to sleep.</v>

1434
01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.940
<v Speaker 3>That is gonna make you better at what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do because you are going to start to</v>

1435
01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:50.920
<v Speaker 3>create this energy to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to achieve your goals.</v>

1436
01:10:50.921 --> 01:10:53.840
<v Speaker 3>So once I started to really dedicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>

1437
01:10:53.841 --> 01:10:56.200
<v Speaker 3>not only with Jujitsu but with breathing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1438
01:10:56.201 --> 01:11:01.201
<v Speaker 3>and physical strength and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and technical strength and mental </v>

1439
01:11:01.201 --> 01:11:02.360
<v Speaker 3>strength and all these different ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I can build myself as a,</v>

1440
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:05.180
<v Speaker 3>as the best I can be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really went to show,</v>

1441
01:11:05.181 --> 01:11:07.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really made a big improvement.</v>

1442
01:11:07.461 --> 01:11:08.150
<v Speaker 3>Since that moment.</v>

1443
01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you find that the physical training </v>
<v Speaker 1>helps prevent injuries?</v>

1444
01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you find?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1445
01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:19.770
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think physical is training should be </v>

1446
01:11:20.521 --> 01:11:25.521
<v Speaker 3>done at a right time because if you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>a white belt and you start telling them </v>

1447
01:11:25.521 --> 01:11:29.900
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to be physically strong and you </v>

1448
01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:30.900
<v Speaker 3>tell them to start working out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>running and then he's going to create.</v>

1449
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:33.180
<v Speaker 3>His training is going to be based on his</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical strength.</v>

1450
01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:37.230
<v Speaker 3>So my advice is the physical strength is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1451
01:11:37.231 --> 01:11:39.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to add to your technical ability.</v>

1452
01:11:39.421 --> 01:11:44.421
<v Speaker 3>It's not to take away from your </v>
<v Speaker 3>technical ability and make you rely on </v>

1453
01:11:44.421 --> 01:11:46.590
<v Speaker 3>your strength and really make you rely </v>
<v Speaker 3>on your physical attributes.</v>

1454
01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:51.920
<v Speaker 3>So I always kind of don't push for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for guys in my academy to work out until</v>

1455
01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:54.850
<v Speaker 3>they reach a brown or black belt level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there they can,</v>

1456
01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:57.990
<v Speaker 3>they can start adding to their technique</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you get too strong,</v>

1457
01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:03.260
<v Speaker 3>I've seen happen many times where guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>will take steroids and then they'll get </v>

1458
01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:03.260
<v Speaker 3>so strong and they'll lose their </v>
<v Speaker 3>technique.</v>

1459
01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:08.060
<v Speaker 3>So I never wanted that to happen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that the strength was always </v>

1460
01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:08.280
<v Speaker 3>gonna be there if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I worked on it.</v>

1461
01:12:08.281 --> 01:12:13.281
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's important for you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>build your technique and then secondary,</v>

1462
01:12:13.591 --> 01:12:14.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your strength can keep,</v>

1463
01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:20.210
<v Speaker 3>keep your technique going because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course if you don't have any physical </v>

1464
01:12:20.210 --> 01:12:20.210
<v Speaker 3>strain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your technique will,</v>

1465
01:12:20.210 --> 01:12:21.120
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will fade,</v>

1466
01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:26.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you gotta have enough strength to </v>

1467
01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:26.180
<v Speaker 3>keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep it going.</v>

1468
01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a trainer that helps you </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your physical strength workouts or </v>

1469
01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.600
<v Speaker 3>do you just know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got myself,</v>

1470
01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:35.920
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how I count on all that you've </v>

1471
01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:36.270
<v Speaker 3>learned over all the years of martial </v>
<v Speaker 3>arts.</v>

1472
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I said,</v>

1473
01:12:37.351 --> 01:12:38.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it,</v>

1474
01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:39.960
<v Speaker 3>it took,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1475
01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:42.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>

1476
01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.010
<v Speaker 3>when you're training for fights and when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1477
01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.640
<v Speaker 3>when you're getting ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad left to Brazil when like,</v>

1478
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.540
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was 18,</v>

1479
01:12:48.541 --> 01:12:51.360
<v Speaker 3>so I didn't have a coach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have nobody.</v>

1480
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:54.060
<v Speaker 3>My Dad was in another country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a coach,</v>

1481
01:12:54.061 --> 01:12:57.720
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a strength trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have nobody to give me any kind</v>

1482
01:12:57.721 --> 01:13:02.400
<v Speaker 3>of advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for a long time I was kind of like,</v>

1483
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:03.810
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sucks.</v>

1484
01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody should be helping me.</v>

1485
01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:09.210
<v Speaker 3>My Dad should be helping me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should have a trainer,</v>

1486
01:13:09.211 --> 01:13:12.840
<v Speaker 3>I should have fucking somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1487
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:17.320
<v Speaker 3>write my stuff down and I should have </v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff and you know,</v>

1488
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:19.260
<v Speaker 3>I should be sponsored by Nike and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>should have,</v>

1489
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all these things that like,</v>

1490
01:13:21.541 --> 01:13:24.870
<v Speaker 3>I compared myself to Colby Ryan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1491
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:30.320
<v Speaker 3>as you get better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize that stuff's not going to </v>

1492
01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:30.320
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1493
01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.260
<v Speaker 3>and I kind of got to a point where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of stopped making excuses and I </v>

1494
01:13:33.841 --> 01:13:36.240
<v Speaker 3>kind of started to blame myself for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1495
01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:39.000
<v Speaker 3>for my own success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not blaming other reasons,</v>

1496
01:13:39.001 --> 01:13:42.060
<v Speaker 3>not blaming because I didn't have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>or because I didn't have this or because</v>

1497
01:13:42.061 --> 01:13:47.061
<v Speaker 3>my dad wasn't here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm grateful for my dad taught me as </v>

1498
01:13:47.061 --> 01:13:50.301
<v Speaker 3>much as you can for as much as he did </v>
<v Speaker 3>and got to a certain point where I </v>

1499
01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:50.301
<v Speaker 3>stopped blaming.</v>

1500
01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:54.800
<v Speaker 3>I stopped blaming anybody for anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I kind of just put all everything </v>

1501
01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.120
<v Speaker 3>into my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was my,</v>

1502
01:13:57.121 --> 01:14:02.121
<v Speaker 3>what I do now and how my schedule is now</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a result of a lot of years of being </v>

1503
01:14:02.121 --> 01:14:03.780
<v Speaker 3>on my own and being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course I've had help here and there,</v>

1504
01:14:03.781 --> 01:14:08.781
<v Speaker 3>but nobody fully embraced being my help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So of course I picked.</v>

1505
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:14.270
<v Speaker 3>I picked from the help from I can get </v>
<v Speaker 3>from wherever I can get all this guy </v>

1506
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.500
<v Speaker 3>taught me this one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it.</v>

1507
01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:20.130
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of go around and using my </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience to make the best training </v>

1508
01:14:20.130 --> 01:14:23.851
<v Speaker 3>that fits for me and I've kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>finally got to that point where I know </v>

1509
01:14:23.851 --> 01:14:26.140
<v Speaker 3>how to train hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't overtrain to where I know I'm in</v>

1510
01:14:26.141 --> 01:14:31.141
<v Speaker 3>shape to where I know a mental.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that stuff was kind of starting to </v>

1511
01:14:31.141 --> 01:14:34.711
<v Speaker 3>really combine well based on what I feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>and based on how I have lived my life </v>

1512
01:14:35.321 --> 01:14:37.600
<v Speaker 3>and how I've competed in how I've put my</v>
<v Speaker 3>body in stress,</v>

1513
01:14:37.601 --> 01:14:41.080
<v Speaker 3>so I'm able to kind of get a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of where I'm at.</v>

1514
01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:43.270
<v Speaker 3>When your dad went to Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was he,</v>

1515
01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:48.300
<v Speaker 3>was he teaching in Brazil?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents got split up and then my dad </v>

1516
01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:51.880
<v Speaker 3>went to Brazil to go recharge his </v>
<v Speaker 3>battery just to hang out.</v>

1517
01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:52.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go.</v>

1518
01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:55.930
<v Speaker 3>He just his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His analogy is,</v>

1519
01:14:57.010 --> 01:14:58.840
<v Speaker 3>his explanation is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1520
01:14:58.841 --> 01:15:02.920
<v Speaker 3>you put a coconut tree in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't grow,</v>

1521
01:15:02.921 --> 01:15:07.921
<v Speaker 3>Cook and you put a cup in Brazil in </v>
<v Speaker 3>coconut grove.</v>

1522
01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:13.200
<v Speaker 3>I cannot explain why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he was just to make some coconuts.</v>

1523
01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:19.640
<v Speaker 3>So I think he just wanted to feel good </v>
<v Speaker 3>and kind of be his on his little retreat</v>

1524
01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.800
<v Speaker 3>and it worked well and now he just moved</v>
<v Speaker 3>back actually a couple months ago.</v>

1525
01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:28.890
<v Speaker 3>He's moved back here and now he's kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of after eight years of living in </v>

1526
01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:32.581
<v Speaker 3>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of got more motivation to be </v>

1527
01:15:32.581 --> 01:15:32.581
<v Speaker 3>here in America and be a part of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1528
01:15:32.581 --> 01:15:34.180
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's always been a part of my life,</v>

1529
01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:36.400
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't,</v>

1530
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:41.550
<v Speaker 3>it's not like my dad didn't help me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he helped me up until I was like 18,</v>

1531
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:45.040
<v Speaker 3>gave me everything he could and then he </v>
<v Speaker 3>let me be my own man.</v>

1532
01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:45.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1533
01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.070
<v Speaker 3>he let me do everything on my own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make my own decisions.</v>

1534
01:15:48.071 --> 01:15:50.080
<v Speaker 3>If I wanted to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could do it if I wanted to do that,</v>

1535
01:15:50.081 --> 01:15:52.230
<v Speaker 3>if I wanted to wake up at 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the afternoon I was going,</v>

1536
01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:56.080
<v Speaker 3>I was my own man and had the freedom to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do everything.</v>

1537
01:15:56.081 --> 01:16:00.640
<v Speaker 3>So he gave me the option to do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted and think,</v>

1538
01:16:00.641 --> 01:16:05.641
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was able to really embrace that and </v>

1539
01:16:05.641 --> 01:16:07.831
<v Speaker 3>use it to my benefit and it'd be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do what I did with that kind of on my </v>

1540
01:16:09.041 --> 01:16:09.610
<v Speaker 3>own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

1541
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.820
<v Speaker 3>Does your dad still train?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1542
01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.880
<v Speaker 3>my dad teaches when he doesn't train so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much where he actually goes and tries to</v>

1543
01:16:18.251 --> 01:16:20.690
<v Speaker 3>get better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>

1544
01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:25.740
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of physically can't do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's got like 800 years in his </v>

1545
01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:26.350
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks like a,</v>

1546
01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:27.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1547
01:16:27.650 --> 01:16:29.410
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's physically burn out,</v>

1548
01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1549
01:16:30.001 --> 01:16:35.001
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you train at the highest level for her </v>

1550
01:16:35.001 --> 01:16:35.001
<v Speaker 3>whole life with no.</v>

1551
01:16:35.001 --> 01:16:35.001
<v Speaker 3>When you say Hernias,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean herniated disc?</v>

1552
01:16:35.001 --> 01:16:36.940
<v Speaker 3>Herniated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>herniated discs.</v>

1553
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:39.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's got his back's a mess.</v>

1554
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:40.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1555
01:16:40.521 --> 01:16:42.430
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his doctor said he shouldn't be walking,</v>

1556
01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:47.431
<v Speaker 3>but he walks so he can't train as much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he does put a gear on and he'll show</v>

1557
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:49.540
<v Speaker 3>move here and there and he'll do what he</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to do.</v>

1558
01:16:50.050 --> 01:16:53.440
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think he's happy with it.</v>

1559
01:16:53.441 --> 01:16:55.870
<v Speaker 3>I think he's now he's gotten to a place </v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

1560
01:16:56.950 --> 01:17:01.950
<v Speaker 3>where he is okay with being retired and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's okay with not being the frontline </v>

1561
01:17:03.650 --> 01:17:06.250
<v Speaker 3>and he's okay with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with being at the stage where,</v>

1562
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:09.250
<v Speaker 3>where he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1563
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:11.690
<v Speaker 3>he knew that the time that he had to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>physically,</v>

1564
01:17:11.691 --> 01:17:15.030
<v Speaker 3>it was up into this age and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess when you start to,</v>

1565
01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:20.250
<v Speaker 3>to fall out of your physical shape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to fight it and you want to </v>

1566
01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:20.250
<v Speaker 3>know I can still do it.</v>

1567
01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:24.640
<v Speaker 3>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think now he's very happy being </v>

1568
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:24.640
<v Speaker 3>the icon that he is in being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1569
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.501
<v Speaker 3>he helps me with what he can help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He trains with what he can do and he's </v>

1570
01:17:29.501 --> 01:17:31.450
<v Speaker 3>still the man like w when he comes with </v>
<v Speaker 3>me with theories and,</v>

1571
01:17:31.451 --> 01:17:32.750
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and training stuff.</v>

1572
01:17:32.751 --> 01:17:33.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1573
01:17:33.351 --> 01:17:36.770
<v Speaker 3>it's like nobody else has the mind that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he has.</v>

1574
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:39.980
<v Speaker 3>Even if you put his brain on anybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>

1575
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:42.860
<v Speaker 3>there will be a champion for sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he has a,</v>

1576
01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:48.340
<v Speaker 3>an old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a very great sense of how do I </v>

1577
01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:50.330
<v Speaker 3>adapt to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes I'll come up with a move or</v>

1578
01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:51.560
<v Speaker 3>I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>

1579
01:17:51.561 --> 01:17:56.561
<v Speaker 3>this has been giving me problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even if him not training for 10 </v>

1580
01:17:56.561 --> 01:17:59.291
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll still feel how to defend it or </v>

1581
01:17:59.291 --> 01:18:01.871
<v Speaker 3>feel how to deal with that or to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>greater understanding of how to be.</v>

1582
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:06.680
<v Speaker 3>So I think he's just better now this </v>
<v Speaker 3>time of his life,</v>

1583
01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:11.681
<v Speaker 3>he's incorporating different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not focused on training hard that </v>

1584
01:18:11.681 --> 01:18:14.321
<v Speaker 3>time for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's past the time for him to fight his </v>

1585
01:18:14.321 --> 01:18:14.360
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's time for him to watch me fight.</v>

1586
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Now it's time for him to watch himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1587
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:20.930
<v Speaker 3>teach or watching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being an icon,</v>

1588
01:18:20.931 --> 01:18:21.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start,</v>

1589
01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does he do for exercises?</v>

1590
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:26.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he serves and he and he doesn't exercise</v>

1591
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:29.060
<v Speaker 3>and he'll do his little workouts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and he's still,</v>

1592
01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:34.420
<v Speaker 3>he's still very active but he's just not</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to go and train rounds after </v>

1593
01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:38.621
<v Speaker 3>rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's definitely very healthy and </v>

1594
01:18:38.621 --> 01:18:43.571
<v Speaker 3>physical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A person and I mean if I have eight </v>

1595
01:18:43.571 --> 01:18:46.400
<v Speaker 3>hurting your despite his age and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to do what he did,</v>

1596
01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:47.870
<v Speaker 3>I'll take that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>

1597
01:18:48.210 --> 01:18:51.170
<v Speaker 3>I'll take the eight and he has to be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best in the world.</v>

1598
01:18:51.170 --> 01:18:52.790
<v Speaker 3>Note any day of the week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1599
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:55.760
<v Speaker 3>Well they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can do a lot for those things now.</v>

1600
01:18:55.870 --> 01:19:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's going to doctors and if you </v>

1601
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.870
<v Speaker 3>have any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any advice?</v>

1602
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:01.220
<v Speaker 3>He definitely certainly do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1603
01:19:01.221 --> 01:19:06.221
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Regina King that I had done was because </v>

1604
01:19:06.221 --> 01:19:07.160
<v Speaker 3>of a bulging disc and made a huge impact</v>
<v Speaker 3>on me.</v>

1605
01:19:07.161 --> 01:19:10.670
<v Speaker 3>And it's also the same thing that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of football players have done.</v>

1606
01:19:10.671 --> 01:19:14.510
<v Speaker 3>Like Peyton manning had done on his neck</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had two operations on his neck,</v>

1607
01:19:14.511 --> 01:19:16.610
<v Speaker 3>was ready to retire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to Germany,</v>

1608
01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:21.640
<v Speaker 3>had the blood spinning procedure done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now I was playing football than </v>

1609
01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:21.640
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

1610
01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:24.080
<v Speaker 3>Massive a antiinflammatory properties of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1611
01:19:24.081 --> 01:19:29.081
<v Speaker 3>And the good thing about it is it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>using your own blood so it's not like </v>

1612
01:19:29.081 --> 01:19:32.501
<v Speaker 3>you're introducing a steroid or any </v>
<v Speaker 3>unnatural a substance into your body </v>

1613
01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:33.110
<v Speaker 3>that's going to cause an adverse side </v>
<v Speaker 3>effects.</v>

1614
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:38.110
<v Speaker 3>It's actually actually your own blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing to see with his body how </v>

1615
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:39.800
<v Speaker 3>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how well he lives in,</v>

1616
01:19:39.801 --> 01:19:42.680
<v Speaker 3>how he's happy to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

1617
01:19:42.681 --> 01:19:47.681
<v Speaker 3>if I can serve and I can do the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I can train once a week and do the </v>

1618
01:19:47.681 --> 01:19:48.320
<v Speaker 3>little moves here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay with that.</v>

1619
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:53.510
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know how far he's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>step into actually being feeling like 20</v>

1620
01:19:53.511 --> 01:19:58.511
<v Speaker 3>years old again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure he'd be interested to hear </v>

1621
01:19:58.511 --> 01:19:58.511
<v Speaker 3>what you have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1622
01:19:58.511 --> 01:19:59.660
<v Speaker 3>just pain relief and just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1623
01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:04.661
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>replenishing of his body's ability to </v>

1624
01:20:04.661 --> 01:20:05.780
<v Speaker 3>move correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be a huge impact.</v>

1625
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of guys that</v>

1626
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.040
<v Speaker 1>are getting towards his age though that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have done Jujitsu for a long time,</v>

1627
01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:14.380
<v Speaker 1>have similar issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ricardo Laborio told me he has seven,</v>

1628
01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.540
<v Speaker 1>seven desks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1629
01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.720
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like standing next to Ricardo he's Kinda</v>

1630
01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:21.900
<v Speaker 1>like hunched over and leaned down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were describing it,</v>

1631
01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:26.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see like he has like a </v>

1632
01:20:26.901 --> 01:20:26.901
<v Speaker 1>winston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his face,</v>

1633
01:20:26.901 --> 01:20:29.161
<v Speaker 1>he's just thinking about the pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still trains still goes out there </v>

1634
01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:31.410
<v Speaker 1>every now and then roles and just loves </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and can't help it.</v>

1635
01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:34.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem is Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fun.</v>

1636
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:37.110
<v Speaker 1>It's too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body's not indestructable to patty.</v>

1637
01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Can't tap out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your bodies,</v>

1638
01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber indestructable.</v>

1639
01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:44.240
<v Speaker 1>He created like that for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

1640
01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad was still be mopping floors have,</v>

1641
01:20:47.230 --> 01:20:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my time now.</v>

1642
01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:54.720
<v Speaker 1>They give me a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the last time your dad like </v>

1643
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.520
<v Speaker 1>really seriously rolled?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long ago was it?</v>

1644
01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

1645
01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:01.030
<v Speaker 3>All I know is the last time we seriously</v>
<v Speaker 3>rolled.</v>

1646
01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:06.690
<v Speaker 3>I got fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is bad because I just got my black </v>

1647
01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:07.120
<v Speaker 3>belt and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right dad,</v>

1648
01:21:07.121 --> 01:21:09.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this time he was still kind of not.</v>

1649
01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's had hernia disk for a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1650
01:21:11.321 --> 01:21:16.321
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he probably had her $800 disc when he </v>

1651
01:21:16.321 --> 01:21:16.321
<v Speaker 3>was fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really know.</v>

1652
01:21:16.321 --> 01:21:16.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1653
01:21:16.321 --> 01:21:17.980
<v Speaker 3>he's probably had it for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just dealt with the pain.</v>

1654
01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's dealt with pain his whole life.</v>

1655
01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.950
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly what,</v>

1656
01:21:21.970 --> 01:21:24.520
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the exact he has or doesn't have.</v>

1657
01:21:24.521 --> 01:21:27.250
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1658
01:21:27.251 --> 01:21:29.230
<v Speaker 3>like when I was 21 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>

1659
01:21:29.231 --> 01:21:31.780
<v Speaker 3>I just got my black belt and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right dad,</v>

1660
01:21:31.781 --> 01:21:33.700
<v Speaker 3>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since you're out of shape,</v>

1661
01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:39.540
<v Speaker 3>let give me three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three minutes and we'll go as hard as we</v>

1662
01:21:39.681 --> 01:21:44.681
<v Speaker 3>can for three minutes and let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because after three minutes then of </v>

1663
01:21:44.681 --> 01:21:46.870
<v Speaker 3>course I'm in better shape and you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>not training so much.</v>

1664
01:21:46.871 --> 01:21:50.170
<v Speaker 3>So I don't want that to be an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1665
01:21:50.230 --> 01:21:55.230
<v Speaker 3>when we train man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got me in like a minute and a half </v>

1666
01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:56.470
<v Speaker 3>and I was so pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come in with a foot lock and I was like,</v>

1667
01:21:56.471 --> 01:21:57.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

1668
01:21:57.101 --> 01:21:57.790
<v Speaker 3>He's still the man</v>

1669
01:21:59.170 --> 01:21:59.790
<v Speaker 1>that was the last</v>

1670
01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:01.050
<v Speaker 3>family we really rolled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1671
01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:02.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1672
01:22:02.941 --> 01:22:04.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a very.</v>

1673
01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:10.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's just a real Samurai.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean you didn't know where they put </v>

1674
01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:10.120
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just all around.</v>

1675
01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:10.980
<v Speaker 3>It's not an act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1676
01:22:10.981 --> 01:22:14.760
<v Speaker 3>he's definitely in his bones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's ready to die today.</v>

1677
01:22:14.761 --> 01:22:19.761
<v Speaker 3>If something happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be ready to die for what he </v>

1678
01:22:19.761 --> 01:22:19.761
<v Speaker 3>believes in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's why I,</v>

1679
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:24.240
<v Speaker 3>I believe in what he says and I believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>in what I do and why I do what I do with</v>

1680
01:22:24.241 --> 01:22:24.930
<v Speaker 3>so much passion.</v>

1681
01:22:25.210 --> 01:22:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the real deal.</v>

1682
01:22:26.291 --> 01:22:28.840
<v Speaker 1>And for folks who you want to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of it immediately,</v>

1683
01:22:28.841 --> 01:22:31.120
<v Speaker 1>even if you're not a martial artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie choke,</v>

1684
01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:33.300
<v Speaker 1>go watch the movie choke because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1685
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Hixon when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean essentially not quite as prime </v>

1686
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:39.080
<v Speaker 1>because he was in his late thirties at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

1687
01:22:39.081 --> 01:22:44.081
<v Speaker 1>It was probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was better when he was even younger </v>

1688
01:22:44.081 --> 01:22:45.400
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you get a chance to see the physical</v>

1689
01:22:45.401 --> 01:22:50.401
<v Speaker 1>preparation when he's sitting up to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck in an ice glacial river and </v>

1690
01:22:50.801 --> 01:22:55.801
<v Speaker 1>meditating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean fucking freezing cold water and </v>

1691
01:22:55.801 --> 01:22:57.110
<v Speaker 1>he's just breathing and concentrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ace Hoyle,</v>

1692
01:22:57.130 --> 01:22:59.050
<v Speaker 1>he gets in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets his foot and he's like,</v>

1693
01:22:59.051 --> 01:23:04.051
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else is like touching the </v>

1694
01:23:04.051 --> 01:23:04.051
<v Speaker 1>water and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1695
01:23:04.051 --> 01:23:07.450
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Dad's in there up to his head.</v>

1696
01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:08.800
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1697
01:23:08.801 --> 01:23:10.860
<v Speaker 3>it's nothing like he's in the Jacuzzi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1698
01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That inspires me,</v>

1699
01:23:12.581 --> 01:23:13.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I.</v>

1700

1702
01:23:20.150 --> 01:23:24.340
<v Speaker 1>The know he embraces the challenge of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the braces.</v>

1703
01:23:24.341 --> 01:23:29.341
<v Speaker 1>Just the wildness of being in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a glacier river and Japan and the </v>

1704
01:23:29.501 --> 01:23:30.400
<v Speaker 1>whole deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1705
01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really does it.</v>

1706
01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are starting to,</v>

1707
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:38.870
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a lot of training with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Gilbert Melendez,</v>

1708
01:23:38.871 --> 01:23:43.871
<v Speaker 1>he's a good friend of yours who </v>
<v Speaker 1>thankfully just got reassigned to a new </v>

1709
01:23:43.871 --> 01:23:46.060
<v Speaker 1>deal where he's going to compete against</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Pettis,</v>

1710
01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:49.810
<v Speaker 1>who's the lightweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna fight after they coach the</v>

1711
01:23:49.811 --> 01:23:51.970
<v Speaker 1>ultimate fighter together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge thing.</v>

1712
01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're training with a lot of the </v>

1713
01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:58.440
<v Speaker 1>other oil or get out outta you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had enough ever folks who don't know,</v>

1714
01:23:58.441 --> 01:23:59.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toilet Gracie,</v>

1715
01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:02.890
<v Speaker 1>so one of the greatest submission </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists of all time to and very,</v>

1716
01:24:02.891 --> 01:24:05.980
<v Speaker 1>very successful in competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1717
01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:11.250
<v Speaker 1>when you see the difference between how </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Hixon deals with it and how heuler </v>

1718
01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:14.490
<v Speaker 1>deals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's when you really get a sense </v>

1719
01:24:14.490 --> 01:24:15.340
<v Speaker 1>of what a special person he has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

1720
01:24:15.341 --> 01:24:20.341
<v Speaker 1>no one's telling him to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all his idea in your mom's </v>

1721
01:24:20.341 --> 01:24:20.341
<v Speaker 1>calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

1722
01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my dad never had it</v>

1723
01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:22.840
<v Speaker 3>coach either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1724
01:24:22.930 --> 01:24:24.910
<v Speaker 3>he never really had nobody there all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1725
01:24:24.911 --> 01:24:27.730
<v Speaker 3>Time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that gave me more motivation to.</v>

1726
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.880
<v Speaker 3>And also it gave him the confidence that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could let me be on my own and,</v>

1727
01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:35.020
<v Speaker 3>and I was still going to be all right if</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to be all right.</v>

1728
01:24:35.790 --> 01:24:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Now what I was going to say is you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done quite a bit of training with</v>

1729
01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:44.241
<v Speaker 1>Nick and Nick Diaz and Ronda Rousey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you do some training with her as </v>

1730
01:24:44.241 --> 01:24:45.070
<v Speaker 1>well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never trained with Rhonda actually.</v>

1731
01:24:45.071 --> 01:24:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1732
01:24:45.170 --> 01:24:50.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've trained with Nick and nate a lot </v>

1733
01:24:50.170 --> 01:24:50.170
<v Speaker 3>and Gilbert and jake quite a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1734
01:24:50.170 --> 01:24:54.710
<v Speaker 3>so those guys are a big part of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>training and I've helped him out all out</v>

1735
01:24:54.711 --> 01:24:55.520
<v Speaker 3>with fights and</v>

1736
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda trends with those guys on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly regular basis.</v>

1737
01:24:58.551 --> 01:24:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's trained with them a few times.</v>

1738
01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.480
<v Speaker 1>She definitely was up there more before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1739
01:25:02.481 --> 01:25:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much she goes up there </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1740
01:25:03.981 --> 01:25:06.320
<v Speaker 1>But are you planning on fighting and MMA</v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

1741
01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1742
01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.340
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I actually,</v>

1743
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:14.430
<v Speaker 3>after the ADCC I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of starting to focus more on </v>

1744
01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:19.351
<v Speaker 3>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of want my energy to be driven </v>

1745
01:25:19.351 --> 01:25:19.590
<v Speaker 3>towards fighting professionally and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1746
01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where my energy is going these </v>

1747
01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:28.350
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what motivates you to want to do </v>

1748
01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:28.350
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said before,</v>

1749
01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:31.531
<v Speaker 3>this has been my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew I was going to get to this point </v>

1750
01:25:31.531 --> 01:25:34.171
<v Speaker 3>when I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never saw Jujitsu is my final mission </v>

1751
01:25:34.241 --> 01:25:39.241
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just waiting for a right time and </v>

1752
01:25:39.241 --> 01:25:42.161
<v Speaker 3>reading for myself to be ready for </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever obstacles I can get to on this </v>

1753
01:25:42.850 --> 01:25:47.850
<v Speaker 3>specific situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now I feel mentally ready and now I </v>

1754
01:25:47.850 --> 01:25:49.810
<v Speaker 3>feel the motivation and now if you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask me when I was 20 years old,</v>

1755
01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:50.740
<v Speaker 3>if I was ready to fire me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1756
01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:53.590
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not physically,</v>

1757
01:25:53.591 --> 01:25:58.591
<v Speaker 3>not technically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just mentally ready to do something </v>

1758
01:25:58.591 --> 01:25:58.591
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1759
01:25:58.591 --> 01:26:00.700
<v Speaker 3>So the last thing I wanted was to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>traumatized.</v>

1760
01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.650
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I feel like no matter what happens,</v>

1761
01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:04.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1762
01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.060
<v Speaker 3>to embrace whatever it happens and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>ready to fight.</v>

1763
01:26:08.061 --> 01:26:12.300
<v Speaker 3>So negotiating scene with the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation for me to,</v>

1764
01:26:12.850 --> 01:26:15.090
<v Speaker 3>to take advantage of this moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1765
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:17.960
<v Speaker 3>how have you adjusted your training to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prepare for mixed martial arts?</v>

1766
01:26:18.570 --> 01:26:20.960
<v Speaker 3>Some minor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some minor adjustments.</v>

1767
01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Nothing too crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think of course you go.</v>

1768
01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:30.300
<v Speaker 3>There's different obstacles and </v>
<v Speaker 3>different things that you got to worry </v>

1769
01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:30.300
<v Speaker 3>about when you're just dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>rigid soon when you're just dealing with</v>

1770
01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.460
<v Speaker 3>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1771
01:26:31.461 --> 01:26:34.980
<v Speaker 3>of course you can hit and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think generally my fights,</v>

1772
01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.140
<v Speaker 3>the way I fight is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is more of a fight and I,</v>

1773
01:26:38.141 --> 01:26:39.870
<v Speaker 3>I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a sport,</v>

1774
01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to be sporty with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

1775
01:26:42.291 --> 01:26:47.090
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think the transfer over will </v>
<v Speaker 3>be that big of a jump as it could be for</v>

1776
01:26:47.091 --> 01:26:49.640
<v Speaker 3>some other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who more points oriented,</v>

1777
01:26:49.810 --> 01:26:51.810
<v Speaker 3>people who are kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to stay in their columns.</v>

1778
01:26:52.130 --> 01:26:55.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm very comfortable in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the storm.</v>

1779
01:26:55.371 --> 01:26:57.260
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1780
01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.600
<v Speaker 3>I think that'll help me when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I fight.</v>

1781
01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:04.840
<v Speaker 1>That's something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most important attitudes to </v>

1782
01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.491
<v Speaker 1>have in life is to embrace the storm </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're comfortable in the store and try </v>

1783
01:27:06.491 --> 01:27:08.480
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how to make yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable all the time.</v>

1784
01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.280
<v Speaker 1>There's always time for relaxation after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1785
01:27:11.290 --> 01:27:13.490
<v Speaker 1>It's all over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't avoid the storm</v>

1786
01:27:14.170 --> 01:27:19.170
<v Speaker 3>that's going to make you really asking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're going to see who you are </v>

1787
01:27:19.170 --> 01:27:19.720
<v Speaker 3>when you can deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you react in those situations.</v>

1788
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you embrace it,</v>

1789
01:27:21.810 --> 01:27:26.000
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a part of who you are as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being that you do that,</v>

1790
01:27:26.001 --> 01:27:28.930
<v Speaker 1>that you take on those challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about striking?</v>

1791
01:27:28.931 --> 01:27:30.370
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing as far as striking?</v>

1792
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:32.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm working on and a little bit here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1793
01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1794
01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.210
<v Speaker 3>don't want to give up too much of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>

1795
01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.210
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1796
01:27:39.211 --> 01:27:41.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Jujitsu has striking,</v>

1797
01:27:41.551 --> 01:27:42.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is,</v>

1798
01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:45.960
<v Speaker 3>it's just Jujitsu strikes when it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial for you.</v>

1799
01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:49.680
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't teach you to sit there in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pocket and just bang out with anybody.</v>

1800
01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:55.280
<v Speaker 3>But if a striking is definitely a part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Jujitsu and I think it's going to be </v>

1801
01:27:55.771 --> 01:27:57.800
<v Speaker 3>interesting to see what I can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1802
01:27:57.870 --> 01:27:59.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

1803
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:02.320
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see what,</v>

1804
01:28:02.321 --> 01:28:03.060
<v Speaker 3>what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1805
01:28:03.061 --> 01:28:08.061
<v Speaker 3>so just like anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very curious to see how much you do </v>

1806
01:28:08.061 --> 01:28:09.150
<v Speaker 3>digital is going to play in fighting and</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

1807
01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:15.340
<v Speaker 3>what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the Jujitsu going to be enough or is </v>

1808
01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:16.290
<v Speaker 3>he going to have to do this certain type</v>
<v Speaker 3>of training?</v>

1809
01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:18.270
<v Speaker 3>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1810
01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:20.030
<v Speaker 3>my training with nick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nate and,</v>

1811
01:28:20.031 --> 01:28:24.300
<v Speaker 3>and Jake and Gilbert is sufficient to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to really put me wherever I want to be.</v>

1812
01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Now your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1813
01:28:25.731 --> 01:28:29.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your uncle who is said recently,</v>

1814
01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:34.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't need anything other than </v>

1815
01:28:34.170 --> 01:28:36.180
<v Speaker 1>introducer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it all these different people that </v>

1816
01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:38.430
<v Speaker 1>the train wrestling and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different aspects of striking that you </v>

1817
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:39.630
<v Speaker 1>really don't need it just trained </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

1818
01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you agree with that or do you think </v>

1819
01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:45.830
<v Speaker 1>that in modern mixed martial arts it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>important that you cross train?</v>

1820
01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:50.840
<v Speaker 1>It is important that you prepare for </v>
<v Speaker 1>full mixed martial arts competition or </v>

1821
01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.910
<v Speaker 1>do you think that the highest level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is still sufficient fish</v>

1822
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:55.220
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Jujitsu is sufficient.</v>

1823
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:59.840
<v Speaker 3>I think it's sufficient to be the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts.</v>

1824
01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:04.200
<v Speaker 3>I just think that rule is make it so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's not necessarily possible.</v>

1825
01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:06.480
<v Speaker 3>So the rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gloves,</v>

1826
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:08.280
<v Speaker 3>the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1827
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:12.180
<v Speaker 3>those things all change the sport and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>changes the situation.</v>

1828
01:29:12.181 --> 01:29:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Standups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1829
01:29:13.381 --> 01:29:18.381
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have no gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody's going to be throwing those </v>

1830
01:29:18.381 --> 01:29:22.080
<v Speaker 3>punches that guys throw these days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to break your hand first</v>

1831
01:29:22.081 --> 01:29:22.800
<v Speaker 3>punch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you throw the guy,</v>

1832
01:29:22.801 --> 01:29:23.960
<v Speaker 3>ducks his head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to break your hands.</v>

1833
01:29:23.961 --> 01:29:28.190
<v Speaker 3>So I think that all those things change </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and when it changes,</v>

1834
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:31.320
<v Speaker 3>you have to be ready to adapt to what </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes personally.</v>

1835
01:29:31.321 --> 01:29:35.370
<v Speaker 3>If you put two guys in a cage in Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 3>is enough,</v>

1836
01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:40.400
<v Speaker 3>but when you put on the gloves and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>put the time and you put the rounds and </v>

1837
01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:40.400
<v Speaker 3>you put the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1838
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:43.020
<v Speaker 3>all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the steroids,</v>

1839
01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:48.120
<v Speaker 3>so it changes the situation and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1840
01:29:48.810 --> 01:29:53.810
<v Speaker 3>guys are more willing to just throw the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hardest punches and knock you out </v>

1841
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:57.830
<v Speaker 3>because they know that the round is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to end because they know that </v>

1842
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.830
<v Speaker 3>their hands not necessarily going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>break.</v>

1843
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:59.730
<v Speaker 3>So if you asked me what's the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts,</v>

1844
01:29:59.731 --> 01:30:00.840
<v Speaker 3>I think judy who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1845
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:04.200
<v Speaker 3>if you ask me what is digital enough?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1846
01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:05.760
<v Speaker 3>It just depends on the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you tell me,</v>

1847
01:30:05.761 --> 01:30:10.761
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a two minute round and the guy is </v>

1848
01:30:10.761 --> 01:30:10.761
<v Speaker 3>gonna stand you up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or do you know?</v>

1849
01:30:10.761 --> 01:30:12.780
<v Speaker 3>Of course then you have to learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>box.</v>

1850
01:30:12.781 --> 01:30:17.781
<v Speaker 3>You have to learn how to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and personally I'm deflection of punches</v>

1851
01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:22.110
<v Speaker 3>is always been a part of Jew to be not </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily being able to strike.</v>

1852
01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:24.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know necessarily if I'm gonna be</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocking guys out,</v>

1853
01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:28.810
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to be able to defend my </v>
<v Speaker 3>goal into the Jujitsu.</v>

1854
01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Go in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The principle is to be able to defend </v>

1855
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.830
<v Speaker 3>whatever the guy's gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the guy's going to punch you,</v>

1856
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:38.571
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to defend the punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be so I don't necessarily </v>

1857
01:30:38.571 --> 01:30:41.481
<v Speaker 3>think that you have to be a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>striker to to win mma and to be a champ,</v>

1858
01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:44.700
<v Speaker 3>but you have to be able to defend </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

1859
01:30:44.701 --> 01:30:47.040
<v Speaker 3>You have to be able to know where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>punch is coming from.</v>

1860
01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:48.540
<v Speaker 3>You have to be able to know what's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1861
01:30:48.541 --> 01:30:50.820
<v Speaker 3>You have to know about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>

1862
01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:55.850
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy Trained Jujitsu for 20 years and </v>

1863
01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:55.850
<v Speaker 3>then he goes into a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to get,</v>

1864
01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:56.160
<v Speaker 3>he's going to get beat up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1865
01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:01.220
<v Speaker 3>so it depends how you train and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>your worry is and how well you adapt to</v>

1866
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:04.910
<v Speaker 1>whatever's going on in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Dad always said that,</v>

1867
01:31:04.911 --> 01:31:09.911
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't train kickboxing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a kickboxer transit to know what </v>

1868
01:31:09.911 --> 01:31:09.911
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1869
01:31:09.911 --> 01:31:11.810
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I feel comfortable.</v>

1870
01:31:11.811 --> 01:31:15.770
<v Speaker 1>So who were you talking to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking to organizations?</v>

1871
01:31:15.771 --> 01:31:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Can you tell me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1872
01:31:16.761 --> 01:31:17.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1873
01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:21.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm negotiating with Japan.</v>

1874
01:31:21.141 --> 01:31:26.141
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's looking good and I'm trying to </v>

1875
01:31:26.141 --> 01:31:28.130
<v Speaker 1>see if I can get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an opportunity for me in Japan.</v>

1876
01:31:28.131 --> 01:31:30.500
<v Speaker 1>So what organizations are left in Japan </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

1877
01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:33.500
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't really say too much right now,</v>

1878
01:31:33.501 --> 01:31:37.230
<v Speaker 3>but basically it's very shortly we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll know going</v>

1879
01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:38.880
<v Speaker 1>on with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1880
01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:40.630
<v Speaker 1>well for folks who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1881
01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.990
<v Speaker 1>your dad was a huge star in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1882
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:48.030
<v Speaker 1>they had a comic book based on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a lot of fanfare and </v>

1883
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:50.370
<v Speaker 1>publicity and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they embraced him,</v>

1884
01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:52.950
<v Speaker 1>especially when he won the Japan valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tudos,</v>

1885
01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dad was an enormous star over there</v>

1886
01:31:57.030 --> 01:32:02.030
<v Speaker 1>and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sense that you would want to </v>

1887
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:03.100
<v Speaker 1>compete over there because they would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interested to see.</v>

1888
01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of benefits for me </v>

1889
01:32:08.410 --> 01:32:08.410
<v Speaker 3>starting off in Japan and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1890
01:32:08.410 --> 01:32:13.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the just a lot better for me at this </v>

1891
01:32:13.090 --> 01:32:14.690
<v Speaker 3>moment in my career to start off in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan into,</v>

1892
01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:19.720
<v Speaker 3>to really build myself the best I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I personally like fighting in front </v>

1893
01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.550
<v Speaker 3>of Japanese culture because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1894
01:32:22.551 --> 01:32:23.210
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1895
01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:25.940
<v Speaker 3>they're a little bit more martial </v>
<v Speaker 3>artists.</v>

1896
01:32:25.941 --> 01:32:27.330
<v Speaker 3>They come from like a Samurai </v>
<v Speaker 3>background,</v>

1897
01:32:27.331 --> 01:32:32.331
<v Speaker 3>so they really care about what you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they really care about what you stand </v>

1898
01:32:32.331 --> 01:32:32.331
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they really care about,</v>

1899
01:32:32.331 --> 01:32:34.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you sweep somebody in the middle of a</v>

1900
01:32:34.730 --> 01:32:35.510
<v Speaker 3>tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to clap,</v>

1901
01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:37.100
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So personally for me,</v>

1902
01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:40.670
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate that and I liked that about</v>

1903
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:46.870
<v Speaker 3>Japan and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just a time in my life and </v>

1904
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:49.570
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Japan were to ever like,</v>

1905
01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:51.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a movement of,</v>

1906
01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:56.760
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of being able to bring mma back to </v>

1907
01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:58.661
<v Speaker 3>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a possibility will be with </v>

1908
01:32:58.661 --> 01:33:01.270
<v Speaker 3>bringing me to it because that's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's of replicate what my dad did.</v>

1909
01:33:02.630 --> 01:33:04.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how he brought it to Japan.</v>

1910
01:33:04.041 --> 01:33:06.770
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me in this situation,</v>

1911
01:33:06.771 --> 01:33:11.771
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great opportunity and I'm trying </v>

1912
01:33:11.771 --> 01:33:11.771
<v Speaker 3>to go for that.</v>

1913
01:33:11.771 --> 01:33:11.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For people who don't know,</v>

1914
01:33:11.771 --> 01:33:15.860
<v Speaker 1>your dad was the star of pride one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what got pride kicked off.</v>

1915
01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:16.940
<v Speaker 1>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1916
01:33:16.941 --> 01:33:21.520
<v Speaker 1>the big launching pad after he had won </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japan Valley Tudo.</v>

1917
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:25.600
<v Speaker 1>And then of course pride came close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1918
01:33:25.670 --> 01:33:30.670
<v Speaker 1>It was an enormous event in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they had put on 90,000</v>

1919
01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:32.990
<v Speaker 1>seat shows several times</v>

1920
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:35.970
<v Speaker 3>60,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tokyo dome sold out huge.</v>

1921
01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:41.210
<v Speaker 1>And somehow or another it stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the great mysteries of </v>

1922
01:33:41.881 --> 01:33:45.690
<v Speaker 1>martial arts and I don't totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand Japanese culture.</v>

1923
01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I guess they get really into things </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes and then the things fade away.</v>

1924
01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:55.640
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were there and we did the UFC </v>

1925
01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:57.891
<v Speaker 1>there a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was my first time in Japan and I was </v>

1926
01:33:57.891 --> 01:33:57.891
<v Speaker 1>amazed that the audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were awesome.</v>

1927
01:33:57.891 --> 01:33:59.490
<v Speaker 1>They are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when the fights going on,</v>

1928
01:33:59.491 --> 01:34:04.491
<v Speaker 1>they're so polite and then when </v>
<v Speaker 1>something happens like a transition or </v>

1929
01:34:04.491 --> 01:34:04.670
<v Speaker 1>sweep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody applauds.</v>

1930
01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1931
01:34:06.290 --> 01:34:08.370
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really cool.</v>

1932
01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:13.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate how much they love </v>

1933
01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:17.520
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technique and the martial arts </v>

1934
01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:17.520
<v Speaker 1>aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as far as like a crazy crowd,</v>

1935
01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:21.000
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing like Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is nothing like Brazil.</v>

1936
01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:23.970
<v Speaker 1>This last event when Machida fought most</v>
<v Speaker 1>saucy,</v>

1937
01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I watched it at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1938
01:34:26.190 --> 01:34:31.190
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Bruce Buffer says it's time to </v>

1939
01:34:31.190 --> 01:34:32.700
<v Speaker 1>whole audience does it with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's like 18,000</v>

1940
01:34:32.701 --> 01:34:33.120
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1941
01:34:36.730 --> 01:34:38.670
<v Speaker 1>No one cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a Brazilian crowd.</v>

1942
01:34:38.671 --> 01:34:43.671
<v Speaker 1>No one cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're there at the very first </v>

1943
01:34:43.671 --> 01:34:43.671
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That place is packed,</v>

1944
01:34:43.671 --> 01:34:45.420
<v Speaker 1>packed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting their money's worth.</v>

1945
01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1946
01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Fucking fired up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1947
01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:53.420
<v Speaker 1>We got there early and there was already</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a giant line around the block to </v>

1948
01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:54.750
<v Speaker 1>the arena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when we got in it,</v>

1949
01:34:54.751 --> 01:34:56.940
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy in the air was it,</v>

1950
01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.460
<v Speaker 1>it was a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>

1951
01:34:58.461 --> 01:35:03.461
<v Speaker 1>huge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the last one that I was at in </v>

1952
01:35:03.461 --> 01:35:03.461
<v Speaker 1>Rio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1953
01:35:03.461 --> 01:35:05.720
<v Speaker 1>there's no crowds like Brazilian crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese soccer,</v>

1954
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:09.110
<v Speaker 1>they come from the soccer backgrounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're really into that.</v>

1955
01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Japanese crowds are just different in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own way.</v>

1956
01:35:13.130 --> 01:35:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

1957
01:35:15.111 --> 01:35:16.640
<v Speaker 1>very different from the Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowds,</v>

1958
01:35:16.641 --> 01:35:20.440
<v Speaker 1>but different in their own unique way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So does.</v>

1959
01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Is there a timeline on when this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen?</v>

1960
01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:25.180
<v Speaker 3>Basically we're going to know very soon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1961
01:35:25.181 --> 01:35:29.250
<v Speaker 3>very soon in the next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably the next time I see you.</v>

1962
01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:34.960
<v Speaker 3>It will be you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have an answer and so I'm just </v>

1963
01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:38.301
<v Speaker 3>waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to give up a date or a </v>

1964
01:35:38.301 --> 01:35:39.621
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to put too much energy </v>

1965
01:35:39.621 --> 01:35:41.091
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that because I hope it happens so </v>

1966
01:35:41.091 --> 01:35:41.460
<v Speaker 3>much that I don't want to spoil </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1967
01:35:41.461 --> 01:35:44.070
<v Speaker 3>So see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's going to happen very soon.</v>

1968
01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:45.720
<v Speaker 3>So I'll let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll let you know.</v>

1969
01:35:45.721 --> 01:35:46.860
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to.</v>

1970
01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Did you watch the UFC this weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not.</v>

1971
01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:52.380
<v Speaker 3>I just missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damian Maya,</v>

1972
01:35:52.410 --> 01:35:56.100
<v Speaker 1>who is a very excellent representative </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Jujitsu,</v>

1973
01:35:56.130 --> 01:36:00.260
<v Speaker 1>fought Rory Macdonald and got beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>

1974
01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.130
<v Speaker 1>what happened in the fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1975
01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Damien took them down the first round of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mounted him,</v>

1976
01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:07.370
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't submit them.</v>

1977
01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:10.800
<v Speaker 1>And Rory defended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got back up to his feet and then started</v>

1978
01:36:10.801 --> 01:36:13.280
<v Speaker 1>kicking the shit out really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And was Damien just trying to</v>

1979
01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:14.180
<v Speaker 3>stand up with him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1980
01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:16.960
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there you go.</v>

1981
01:36:19.050 --> 01:36:20.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like Damien.</v>

1982
01:36:20.141 --> 01:36:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Damien is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good guy,</v>

1983
01:36:22.001 --> 01:36:22.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

1984
01:36:22.851 --> 01:36:27.851
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always had respect for him and </v>

1985
01:36:27.851 --> 01:36:27.851
<v Speaker 3>we've always had a good time </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>

1986
01:36:27.851 --> 01:36:29.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's always been a representative of</v>

1987
01:36:29.861 --> 01:36:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu in a great way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1988
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.270
<v Speaker 3>so I think the more he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he focuses on that and the more he tries</v>

1989
01:36:37.271 --> 01:36:39.850
<v Speaker 3>to really use the J to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better he's going to be because he's</v>

1990
01:36:39.930 --> 01:36:42.370
<v Speaker 3>a specialist in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not a specialist in striking.</v>

1991
01:36:42.371 --> 01:36:47.371
<v Speaker 3>So it's tough to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try to be an excellent person in a </v>

1992
01:36:47.371 --> 01:36:50.160
<v Speaker 3>different sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he should try to focus in on,</v>

1993
01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:55.240
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on being the greatest Jujitsu fighter </v>

1994
01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.680
<v Speaker 3>and an iron man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that'll be beneficial for him.</v>

1995
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to do that.</v>

1996
01:36:58.881 --> 01:37:01.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was trying down but he </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't take them down.</v>

1997
01:37:01.670 --> 01:37:03.560
<v Speaker 1>So then they're getting his take down </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuffed.</v>

1998
01:37:03.561 --> 01:37:06.080
<v Speaker 1>And then he was forced to stand with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and rory kept kicking him.</v>

1999
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:07.610
<v Speaker 1>He was just kicking the shit out of him.</v>

2000
01:37:07.650 --> 01:37:08.880
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2001
01:37:08.881 --> 01:37:12.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious to see for myself how it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2002
01:37:12.090 --> 01:37:17.090
<v Speaker 3>fighting with guys who don't want to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the ground and see how I'm going to </v>

2003
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:17.090
<v Speaker 3>be able to deal with it and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

2004
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:19.920
<v Speaker 3>I have zero experience in mma so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>curious.</v>

2005
01:37:19.921 --> 01:37:24.921
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious to see what happens and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>curious to see how really difficult it </v>

2006
01:37:24.921 --> 01:37:28.071
<v Speaker 3>can be and where my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where my technique is going to play a </v>

2007
01:37:28.071 --> 01:37:28.510
<v Speaker 3>role in how it's going to be because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>never know.</v>

2008
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:31.840
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really open for the,</v>

2009
01:37:32.050 --> 01:37:33.960
<v Speaker 3>for the challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2010
01:37:33.961 --> 01:37:34.470
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2011
01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:36.250
<v Speaker 3>my blessings for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Damien,</v>

2012
01:37:37.290 --> 01:37:42.290
<v Speaker 3>hopefully he can find a great tactic to </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat his opponents and be guys who are </v>

2013
01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:42.290
<v Speaker 3>trying to do that.</v>

2014
01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you look at him as sort of A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a very high level Jujitsu </v>

2015
01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:47.540
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at him and as,</v>

2016
01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:52.040
<v Speaker 1>as an example of what can be possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not the pitfalls and the </v>

2017
01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:52.290
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>

2018
01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:57.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think if somebody can defend </v>

2019
01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.990
<v Speaker 3>his takedowns to something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's definitely a technical </v>

2020
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:02.361
<v Speaker 3>reason why that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that like personally I </v>

2021
01:38:03.091 --> 01:38:04.050
<v Speaker 3>admire the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy's a,</v>

2022
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:06.690
<v Speaker 3>an exceptional athlete and he's a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter and hear everything,</v>

2023
01:38:06.691 --> 01:38:11.691
<v Speaker 3>but I don't look up to his Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't look up to anybody that you did </v>

2024
01:38:12.541 --> 01:38:15.540
<v Speaker 3>to that is fighting these days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2025
01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:19.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't like seeing anything that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is exceptional,</v>

2026
01:38:19.710 --> 01:38:21.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see guys that are good,</v>

2027
01:38:21.121 --> 01:38:25.470
<v Speaker 3>tough and guys who make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm impressed with my dad's Jujitsu.</v>

2028
01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:29.100
<v Speaker 3>That's where I feel like I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to replicate.</v>

2029
01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:33.930
<v Speaker 3>So as much as I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fan and admired and all these guys</v>

2030
01:38:33.931 --> 01:38:34.740
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they made,</v>

2031
01:38:34.741 --> 01:38:37.080
<v Speaker 3>they got to where they got with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tools that they were given,</v>

2032
01:38:37.410 --> 01:38:39.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are all given certain amount of tools</v>

2033
01:38:39.511 --> 01:38:44.511
<v Speaker 3>and how will you use them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I can't take anything away from the </v>

2034
01:38:44.511 --> 01:38:45.990
<v Speaker 3>guys who got far with the Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>striking or with whatever.</v>

2035
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:49.530
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2036
01:38:49.531 --> 01:38:53.400
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely like you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to see,</v>

2037
01:38:53.401 --> 01:38:53.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2038
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.000

<v Speaker 1>representative of Jujitsu right now in </v>

2039
01:38:59.000 --> 01:38:59.000
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts?</v>

2040
01:38:59.330 --> 01:39:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2041
01:39:00.361 --> 01:39:01.590
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of good guys,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2043

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the classics,</v>

2044
01:39:03.661 --> 01:39:03.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2045
01:39:03.991 --> 01:39:05.410
<v Speaker 3>Damien's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2046
01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Jack is very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys are guys who,</v>

2047
01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:12.441
<v Speaker 3>I have friends with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys who have been competing in </v>

2048
01:39:12.441 --> 01:39:12.441
<v Speaker 3>tournaments in</v>

2049
01:39:12.441 --> 01:39:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Sergio Mariah's to his Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2050
01:39:13.531 --> 01:39:15.340
<v Speaker 1>he hasn't gotten to that level yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2051
01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:16.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2052
01:39:16.111 --> 01:39:21.111
<v Speaker 1>the level of opposition yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his Jujitsu has been very effective </v>

2053
01:39:21.111 --> 01:39:21.111
<v Speaker 1>in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

2054
01:39:21.111 --> 01:39:22.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his submissions or uh,</v>

2055
01:39:22.371 --> 01:39:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2056
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:25.850
<v Speaker 3>I actually haven't seen him fight really</v>
<v Speaker 3>in MMA,</v>

2057
01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:30.880
<v Speaker 3>so I don't really know too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But his Jujitsu and Jujitsu tournament </v>

2058
01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:30.880
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2059
01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:31.520
<v Speaker 3>is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2060
01:39:31.521 --> 01:39:34.670
<v Speaker 3>he's a tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a specific type of style.</v>

2061
01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.240
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not impressed with his Jujitsu,</v>

2062
01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:40.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm impressed with him as a,</v>

2063
01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:41.250
<v Speaker 3>as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2064
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.990
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2065
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.030
<v Speaker 3>the guy can make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can defend.</v>

2066
01:39:44.031 --> 01:39:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an exceptional athlete.</v>

2067
01:39:46.221 --> 01:39:48.800
<v Speaker 3>The guy is very strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very explosive,</v>

2068
01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:54.520
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see him as an exceptional </v>

2069
01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:57.520
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's missing for him personally?</v>

2070
01:39:57.710 --> 01:39:58.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2071
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.960
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2072
01:39:59.961 --> 01:40:00.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2073
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:01.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you say,</v>

2074
01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean you look at a guy who was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>high level world champion caliber </v>

2075
01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:09.011
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you say you're not impressed with </v>

2076
01:40:09.011 --> 01:40:09.011
<v Speaker 1>his Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is not impressive about it?</v>

2077
01:40:09.011 --> 01:40:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2078
01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:14.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know because I had never seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>him fighting MMA,</v>

2079
01:40:14.851 --> 01:40:17.460
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know what he's doing in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I fight him,</v>

2080
01:40:17.461 --> 01:40:22.461
<v Speaker 3>I fought him once he beat my ass and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I fought him the next time and it </v>

2081
01:40:22.461 --> 01:40:24.930
<v Speaker 3>was a very even match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I won that match and I got.</v>

2082
01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.110
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I got gypped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

2083
01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:32.220
<v Speaker 1>did they give him an advantage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gave them an advantage of the last </v>

2084
01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:33.370
<v Speaker 1>five seconds is so squirrely for folks </v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't know.</v>

2085
01:40:33.371 --> 01:40:37.210
<v Speaker 1>There's weird scoring and Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is zero to zero.</v>

2086
01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:41.470
<v Speaker 1>One guy can get what they call an </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage and it's very subjective.</v>

2087
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:42.940
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2088
01:40:42.941 --> 01:40:47.800
<v Speaker 1>people I've seen fucking bench clearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>brawls because of a advantage scoring.</v>

2089
01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:52.900
<v Speaker 3>What I feel about impressive Jujitsu is </v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I so impressed with my dad's got </v>

2090
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.020
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because he outsmarts me.</v>

2091
01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:01.380
<v Speaker 3>He technically beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If somebody is stronger than me and they</v>

2092
01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:06.720
<v Speaker 3>pass my guard or they submit me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am not impressed because of that.</v>

2093
01:41:07.150 --> 01:41:10.950
<v Speaker 3>I think that the guy used this tool to </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat me or did whatever too.</v>

2094
01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:13.210
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't mean he's a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu.</v>

2095
01:41:13.211 --> 01:41:16.930
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't technically a impressed me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2096
01:41:17.370 --> 01:41:19.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to impress me.</v>

2097
01:41:19.271 --> 01:41:24.271
<v Speaker 3>I come from my father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad has been technically outsmarting </v>

2098
01:41:24.271 --> 01:41:27.001
<v Speaker 3>me for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's hard for me to be impressed </v>

2099
01:41:27.001 --> 01:41:29.071
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Jujitsu these days and that's what </v>

2100
01:41:29.071 --> 01:41:31.951
<v Speaker 3>I am trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to do that is technical and </v>

2101
01:41:31.951 --> 01:41:36.330
<v Speaker 3>it's way harder for you to technically </v>
<v Speaker 3>outsmart somebody then for you to just </v>

2102
01:41:36.330 --> 01:41:37.690
<v Speaker 3>know I'm going to get it and just take </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and the guy defends and then you just</v>

2103
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:38.470
<v Speaker 3>rip right through it.</v>

2104
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:42.220
<v Speaker 3>So it's a different approach to what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe digital is about.</v>

2105
01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:46.750
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I feel like I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>impressed as much as other people or how</v>

2106
01:41:46.751 --> 01:41:48.820
<v Speaker 3>they see he got that arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2107
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:53.990
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he got an arm bar because he's much </v>

2108
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:53.990
<v Speaker 3>stronger than the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy has no defense.</v>

2109
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:56.950
<v Speaker 3>And so I feel like it's a mind game and </v>
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>

2110
01:41:56.951 --> 01:41:59.470
<v Speaker 3>well you use your chest pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2111
01:41:59.810 --> 01:42:02.290
<v Speaker 3>that's what's gonna make you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>results.</v>

2112
01:42:02.291 --> 01:42:04.080
<v Speaker 3>But I don't take anything away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>

2113
01:42:04.110 --> 01:42:04.750
<v Speaker 3>Mariah's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

2114
01:42:04.810 --> 01:42:08.740
<v Speaker 3>he's a great fighter and he's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>exceptionally healthy,</v>

2115
01:42:08.741 --> 01:42:13.741
<v Speaker 3>strong person and he's able to use the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tools and he's able to use Jujitsu for </v>

2116
01:42:13.741 --> 01:42:17.251
<v Speaker 3>his benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean he's not good at </v>

2117
01:42:17.251 --> 01:42:19.591
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That just means that if you speak </v>

2118
01:42:19.591 --> 01:42:19.690
<v Speaker 3>specifically for Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he,</v>

2119
01:42:20.110 --> 01:42:25.110
<v Speaker 3>is he using his strength or is he using </v>
<v Speaker 3>his technical ability to,</v>

2120
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:28.810
<v Speaker 3>to beat your opponent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where I say that.</v>

2121
01:42:28.811 --> 01:42:32.430
<v Speaker 3>That's why I say that Mark Coleman wants</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly share this.</v>

2122
01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:35.710
<v Speaker 3>That was the match that I draw with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2123
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:37.300
<v Speaker 3>He was like four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four.</v>

2124
01:42:37.301 --> 01:42:38.550
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2125
01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:41.020
<v Speaker 3>I lost on an advantage at the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>

2126
01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:43.210
<v Speaker 7>You were rocking the Old School Samurai </v>
<v Speaker 7>ponytail.</v>

2127
01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:47.660
<v Speaker 7>Just try that out for a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nobody told me it was really gay,</v>

2128
01:42:47.661 --> 01:42:52.430
<v Speaker 7>so he kept going for a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Your Dad had that back in the day,</v>

2129
01:42:52.431 --> 01:42:53.450
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a tribute.</v>

2130
01:42:53.451 --> 01:42:55.760
<v Speaker 7>That's attributed haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You'd get a pass.</v>

2131
01:42:56.070 --> 01:43:00.430
<v Speaker 7>You get a gay pass.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When I realized it was really,</v>

2132
01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:03.200
<v Speaker 3>so I kinda cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But did he get in the way?</v>

2133
01:43:03.230 --> 01:43:08.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got in the way and it just kind </v>

2134
01:43:08.230 --> 01:43:08.230
<v Speaker 3>of wasn't really my style for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was for awhile.</v>

2135
01:43:08.230 --> 01:43:12.880
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to do with it and then that was </v>

2136
01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:14.741
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was gonna say that Mark Coleman wants </v>

2137
01:43:14.741 --> 01:43:14.960
<v Speaker 3>told me strength is technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strength,</v>

2138
01:43:14.961 --> 01:43:17.660
<v Speaker 3>two technique for some people and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>for some people they.</v>

2139
01:43:17.661 --> 01:43:19.160
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their belief,</v>

2140
01:43:19.161 --> 01:43:20.600
<v Speaker 3>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other digital guys.</v>

2141
01:43:20.601 --> 01:43:21.920
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2142
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:25.370
<v Speaker 3>if the movie doesn't work then use more </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength.</v>

2143
01:43:25.730 --> 01:43:30.730
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the moves don't work because you're </v>

2144
01:43:30.730 --> 01:43:30.730
<v Speaker 3>not using enough strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not.</v>

2145
01:43:30.730 --> 01:43:33.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't come from that theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't come from that belief and I come</v>

2146
01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:35.420
<v Speaker 3>from a leverage and technique </v>
<v Speaker 3>background.</v>

2147
01:43:35.421 --> 01:43:40.421
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I feel the way I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not because I feel against anybody </v>

2148
01:43:40.421 --> 01:43:44.741
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not trying to point fingers or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or try to say that I'm better than </v>

2149
01:43:44.741 --> 01:43:44.741
<v Speaker 3>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing like that.</v>

2150
01:43:44.741 --> 01:43:49.420
<v Speaker 3>I still have a lot to prove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you honestly ask me if I'm </v>

2151
01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 3>impressed with the Jujitsu I come from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm picking son,</v>

2152
01:43:52.011 --> 01:43:52.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2153
01:43:52.431 --> 01:43:56.060
<v Speaker 3>I come from the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm easily impressed,</v>

2154
01:43:56.061 --> 01:43:57.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a good sign.</v>

2155
01:43:57.590 --> 01:44:00.730
<v Speaker 3>Who impresses you in Jujitsu today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2156
01:44:02.010 --> 01:44:04.820
<v Speaker 3>what really impresses me is guys who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller,</v>

2157
01:44:04.821 --> 01:44:07.790
<v Speaker 3>being able to really defeat bigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>opponents like Marcella Garcia.</v>

2158
01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:11.330
<v Speaker 3>My celebration is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's definitely a great fighter.</v>

2159
01:44:11.331 --> 01:44:16.331
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fought him twice and he's one guy who </v>

2160
01:44:16.331 --> 01:44:16.460
<v Speaker 3>technically is great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2161
01:44:16.461 --> 01:44:19.100
<v Speaker 3>like I have nothing to say about his </v>
<v Speaker 3>technical abilities and he's,</v>

2162
01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:22.010
<v Speaker 3>he's technically in the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2163
01:44:22.011 --> 01:44:27.011
<v Speaker 3>he's not overpower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not using his physical attributes </v>

2164
01:44:27.011 --> 01:44:27.410
<v Speaker 3>to beat his opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm impressed with that.</v>

2165
01:44:27.411 --> 01:44:29.060
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a great thing that he has.</v>

2166
01:44:29.061 --> 01:44:31.730
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2167
01:44:31.731 --> 01:44:35.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean the technical ability is where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like is the line for,</v>

2168
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:36.710
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for greatness.</v>

2169
01:44:36.711 --> 01:44:38.780
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2170
01:44:38.781 --> 01:44:39.720
<v Speaker 3>Marcella Garcia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2171
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:40.850
<v Speaker 3>he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2172
01:44:40.990 --> 01:44:42.710
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love fighting him,</v>

2173
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:47.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one guy who I will fight any day </v>

2174
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:50.550
<v Speaker 3>that it's great to be meshing with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of talent.</v>

2175
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:53.520
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2176
01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:56.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a great example and he fought,</v>

2177
01:44:56.651 --> 01:45:00.200
<v Speaker 3>guys were really big and right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost got him,</v>

2178
01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:05.590
<v Speaker 3>Marcella had him in a guillotine for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for good minute until my forums cramped </v>

2179
01:45:06.351 --> 01:45:06.500
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2180
01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.400
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2181
01:45:09.630 --> 01:45:14.630
<v Speaker 1>if there was a professional avenue for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu of Jujitsu was like golf or </v>

2182
01:45:14.630 --> 01:45:16.640
<v Speaker 1>baseball or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on television all the time.</v>

2183
01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Would you be motivated at all to enter </v>
<v Speaker 1>into MMA?</v>

2184
01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:22.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2185
01:45:22.991 --> 01:45:27.820
<v Speaker 3>I think so too because I think it's more</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a real fight and I think it's more of</v>

2186
01:45:27.821 --> 01:45:30.680
<v Speaker 3>a challenge and I like challenges and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to,</v>

2187
01:45:33.090 --> 01:45:36.400
<v Speaker 3>I like to challenge and I like to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going to happen.</v>

2188
01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:41.640
<v Speaker 3>And personally I think that Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes away a little bit from the full </v>

2189
01:45:41.681 --> 01:45:46.681
<v Speaker 3>fighting for fighting because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>punching because there's no punching in </v>

2190
01:45:48.791 --> 01:45:51.160
<v Speaker 3>because there's other tools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the less rules you have,</v>

2191
01:45:51.790 --> 01:45:56.790
<v Speaker 3>the more you can actually present </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself in and use the stuff that you </v>

2192
01:45:57.641 --> 01:45:58.390
<v Speaker 3>have within,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2193
01:45:58.391 --> 01:46:03.391
<v Speaker 3>the fighting spirit and find out ways to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay safe and in personally digits,</v>

2194
01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:07.180
<v Speaker 3>who most of the Jujitsu these days are </v>
<v Speaker 3>very boring matches and they're very,</v>

2195
01:46:07.181 --> 01:46:09.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point oriented and they,</v>

2196
01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:11.650
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of,</v>

2197
01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:12.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2198
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:16.600
<v Speaker 3>it's not as interesting to watch because</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys are not really,</v>

2199
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:21.150
<v Speaker 3>they're there for the wind for the point</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

2200
01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:23.070
<v Speaker 3>it's not motivating for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2201
01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:26.620
<v Speaker 3>it's not motivating for me to compete in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fight like that.</v>

2202
01:46:27.190 --> 01:46:32.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm motivated to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to embark on this new journey of MMA </v>

2203
01:46:32.190 --> 01:46:32.820
<v Speaker 3>motivated to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to see what happened,</v>

2204
01:46:32.821 --> 01:46:37.821
<v Speaker 3>to see how the fight fight goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I need to do with what happens if </v>

2205
01:46:37.821 --> 01:46:39.370
<v Speaker 3>this happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's a great thing.</v>

2206
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Now when you see guys like Jocko,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2207
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:45.610
<v Speaker 1>who were great Jujitsu artists and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>entering into mma and just drunk arrays,</v>

2208
01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:47.390
<v Speaker 1>winning a lot of his fights with </v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing.</v>

2209
01:46:47.490 --> 01:46:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of guys that he's fighting,</v>

2210
01:46:49.441 --> 01:46:54.441
<v Speaker 1>he's not able to take down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some sort of forced to stay on this </v>

2211
01:46:54.441 --> 01:46:55.260
<v Speaker 1>track with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you take away anything from that?</v>

2212
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Do you learn anything from that?</v>

2213
01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:58.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to learn.</v>

2214
01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:03.560
<v Speaker 3>I think Jakarta is great and I really </v>
<v Speaker 3>like him a lot as a human being and as </v>

2215
01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:06.580
<v Speaker 3>an athlete I've been his fans and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>was before,</v>

2216
01:47:06.581 --> 01:47:07.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Jujitsu,</v>

2217
01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.130
<v Speaker 3>he was always a kind of a real cool guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2218
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:14.010
<v Speaker 3>to watch and he's a warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2219
01:47:14.011 --> 01:47:19.011
<v Speaker 3>that guy has a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a strong spirit and he's a very </v>

2220
01:47:19.011 --> 01:47:19.110
<v Speaker 3>strong hearted person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2221
01:47:19.970 --> 01:47:22.050
<v Speaker 3>so whatever he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be good at.</v>

2222
01:47:22.051 --> 01:47:23.600
<v Speaker 3>And however he does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna be,</v>

2223
01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:28.020
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna make it happen and he charged</v>
<v Speaker 3>her courage is use the tools that he was</v>

2224
01:47:28.021 --> 01:47:31.080
<v Speaker 3>given to to get the best results that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>can get.</v>

2225
01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:32.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't take anything away from him.</v>

2226
01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Darn it mean by tech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you personally get something from </v>

2227
01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:38.580
<v Speaker 1>watching him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2228
01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:40.460
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn something from his.</v>

2229
01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:42.390
<v Speaker 1>His approach?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2230
01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:47.460
<v Speaker 3>Me Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of trying to always analyze in </v>

2231
01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:50.640
<v Speaker 3>more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to see where I fit in on </v>

2232
01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:50.640
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2233
01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:53.760
<v Speaker 3>I want to see if it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if how I'm gonna deal with somebody </v>

2234
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.440
<v Speaker 3>who's not letting me take them down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am I going to get them down,</v>

2235
01:47:55.441 --> 01:47:57.520
<v Speaker 3>how am I going to find the way to win </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight?</v>

2236
01:47:57.521 --> 01:48:02.521
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's all in the air and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to see what happens and I can't </v>

2237
01:48:02.521 --> 01:48:06.811
<v Speaker 3>wait to start to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to test myself in these waters and get </v>

2238
01:48:06.811 --> 01:48:09.220
<v Speaker 3>these challenges and find out ways to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find out ways to win.</v>

2239
01:48:09.410 --> 01:48:11.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than Gill and Jake,</v>

2240
01:48:12.410 --> 01:48:13.360
<v Speaker 1>how many wrestlers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2241
01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:13.440
<v Speaker 1>as you're</v>

2242
01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:14.760
<v Speaker 3>working with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2243
01:48:14.770 --> 01:48:19.770
<v Speaker 3>in my academy there's always been great </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestlers and great judo guys and great </v>

2244
01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:22.060
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all come in and out of my academy.</v>

2245
01:48:22.061 --> 01:48:26.610
<v Speaker 3>So I've wrestled with the best wrestlers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've wrestled with uh,</v>

2246
01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:29.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been in the mix with a lot of great</v>

2247
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:32.980
<v Speaker 3>athletes and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2248
01:48:32.981 --> 01:48:36.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2249
01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.870
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a part of the training,</v>

2250
01:48:37.871 --> 01:48:42.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come in and when I go up to train </v>

2251
01:48:42.871 --> 01:48:42.871
<v Speaker 3>with nate or Gilbert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's lot of wrestlers.</v>

2252
01:48:42.871 --> 01:48:44.230
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's just one more tool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One more,</v>

2253
01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:46.790
<v Speaker 3>one more training session.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One different types of train,</v>

2254
01:48:46.791 --> 01:48:48.350
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you train just tonight you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking.</v>

2255
01:48:48.351 --> 01:48:49.990
<v Speaker 3>Now sometimes you train to take somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

2256
01:48:50.530 --> 01:48:53.650
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you just trained Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you just train defense.</v>

2257
01:48:53.651 --> 01:48:58.651
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you just train one position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you try to build yourself as a </v>

2258
01:48:58.661 --> 01:49:00.260
<v Speaker 3>complete as much as you can.</v>

2259
01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:03.430
<v Speaker 3>And of course my specialty will never be</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling.</v>

2260
01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:06.820
<v Speaker 3>My specialty will never be boxing or </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing.</v>

2261
01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:11.050
<v Speaker 3>It's never going to be my specialty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm just like,</v>

2262
01:49:11.051 --> 01:49:16.051
<v Speaker 3>Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his specialty is not going to be stand </v>

2263
01:49:16.051 --> 01:49:16.051
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's great at standup,</v>

2264
01:49:16.051 --> 01:49:17.560
<v Speaker 3>he's knocking guys out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing great,</v>

2265
01:49:18.130 --> 01:49:20.410
<v Speaker 3>but that's not his specialty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you ask him where he feels the best</v>

2266
01:49:20.411 --> 01:49:25.411
<v Speaker 3>is going to be Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I feel like my best is always going </v>

2267
01:49:25.411 --> 01:49:29.720
<v Speaker 3>to be Jujitsu as much as I trained the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other stuff and as much as I feel </v>

2268
01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:33.150
<v Speaker 3>comfortable in the other place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to bring the fight to where I'm </v>

2269
01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:36.540
<v Speaker 3>where I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why Anderson Silva was champion </v>

2270
01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:40.381
<v Speaker 3>for so long was because he was able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep the fight where he felt </v>

2271
01:49:40.381 --> 01:49:43.891
<v Speaker 3>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was able to keep the fight on his </v>

2272
01:49:43.891 --> 01:49:43.891
<v Speaker 3>feet and in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2273
01:49:43.891 --> 01:49:46.480
<v Speaker 3>elusiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was able to win if he was like,</v>

2274
01:49:46.481 --> 01:49:51.481
<v Speaker 3>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get taken down and let the guys </v>

2275
01:49:51.481 --> 01:49:51.481
<v Speaker 3>mountain and do this stuff.</v>

2276
01:49:51.481 --> 01:49:55.080
<v Speaker 3>And then they didn't fight to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he would have lost a long time </v>

2277
01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:56.050
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But because he was so well at being able</v>

2278
01:49:56.051 --> 01:50:01.051
<v Speaker 3>to stay in his where he's comfortable at</v>
<v Speaker 3>and keep the fight where he wants to </v>

2279
01:50:01.051 --> 01:50:03.100
<v Speaker 3>keep it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an exceptional legend,</v>

2280
01:50:03.101 --> 01:50:03.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

2281
01:50:03.481 --> 01:50:06.200
<v Speaker 3>for so long and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's something to admire.</v>

2282
01:50:06.201 --> 01:50:07.490
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2283
01:50:07.491 --> 01:50:10.960
<v Speaker 3>I see guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of guys are just just general.</v>

2284
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:12.760
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guys are just really good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2285
01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Nobody is a special ed specialist in </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything and suffer some here and there.</v>

2286
01:50:18.011 --> 01:50:21.790
<v Speaker 3>But generally mma is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just good at everything.</v>

2287
01:50:21.791 --> 01:50:25.690
<v Speaker 3>You're not specialized in something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think for me,</v>

2288
01:50:25.691 --> 01:50:28.780
<v Speaker 3>coming from a martial arts background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not coming from an MMA background,</v>

2289
01:50:28.781 --> 01:50:32.170
<v Speaker 3>not coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't just start doing this because I</v>

2290
01:50:32.171 --> 01:50:37.171
<v Speaker 3>saw her on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I come from a tradition in my tradition </v>

2291
01:50:37.171 --> 01:50:41.761
<v Speaker 3>is due to my tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is his technique and leverage and that's</v>

2292
01:50:41.801 --> 01:50:44.920
<v Speaker 3>what I based my whole life on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I'm going to fight,</v>

2293
01:50:44.921 --> 01:50:46.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to use that to my benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2294
01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:50.090
<v Speaker 1>there's one pattern that we do see in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mma all the time,</v>

2295
01:50:50.091 --> 01:50:54.260
<v Speaker 1>is that when a guy gets truly excellent </v>
<v Speaker 1>at any one aspect of fighting,</v>

2296
01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:59.050
<v Speaker 1>that will always be that advantage when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets into the octagon that it.</v>

2297
01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:04.380
<v Speaker 1>It always is a significant advantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>over people that have never competed in </v>

2298
01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:06.270
<v Speaker 1>that individual form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2299
01:51:06.271 --> 01:51:11.271
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you take a guy like Anderson </v>

2300
01:51:11.271 --> 01:51:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Silva is a total specialists to stand up</v>
<v Speaker 1>striking specialist being his whole </v>

2301
01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:19.301
<v Speaker 1>career as a standup striking specialists</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order for you to get that good as he </v>

2302
01:51:19.301 --> 01:51:20.900
<v Speaker 1>was at a whole lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole lifetime.</v>

2303
01:51:21.010 --> 01:51:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>

2304
01:51:22.371 --> 01:51:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't got to live</v>

2305
01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:27.950
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do what I got going on.</v>

2306
01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:29.150
<v Speaker 3>Where's your academy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where?</v>

2307
01:51:29.170 --> 01:51:34.170
<v Speaker 3>Where do you teach?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I teach in Culver City right next to </v>

2308
01:51:34.170 --> 01:51:34.170
<v Speaker 3>apply to the way a Jefferson and </v>
<v Speaker 3>centinela.</v>

2309
01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:37.380
<v Speaker 1>It was called the chrome grace home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2310
01:51:37.410 --> 01:51:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you find that teaching makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at your too?</v>

2311
01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been teaching since I was 15,</v>

2312
01:51:42.801 --> 01:51:47.801
<v Speaker 3>so everyday I teach even till today I </v>
<v Speaker 3>still get better and I realized </v>

2313
01:51:47.801 --> 01:51:52.211
<v Speaker 3>something that could be better or </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize how I can explain something </v>

2314
01:51:52.211 --> 01:51:54.821
<v Speaker 3>better or realize how I can see a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different side and teaching for me has </v>

2315
01:51:54.821 --> 01:51:58.871
<v Speaker 3>definitely been a huge part of my growth</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Jujitsu and I see people who just </v>

2316
01:51:58.871 --> 01:52:03.551
<v Speaker 3>trained and don't teach and I see a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference in the people who do cheat </v>

2317
01:52:03.551 --> 01:52:07.391
<v Speaker 3>and how much more knowledgeable they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how much better they can be from </v>

2318
01:52:07.391 --> 01:52:07.391
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2319
01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting,</v>

2320
01:52:08.591 --> 01:52:13.591
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that teaching someone who doesn't know </v>

2321
01:52:13.591 --> 01:52:14.980
<v Speaker 1>something forces you to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost every single aspect of it,</v>

2322
01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:19.000
<v Speaker 1>including parts of it that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of take for granted and it seems to</v>

2323
01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:21.970
<v Speaker 1>translate not just what you do too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but kind of any.</v>

2324
01:52:21.971 --> 01:52:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Anything that you teach people?</v>

2325
01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:23.900
<v Speaker 3>Course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2326
01:52:23.901 --> 01:52:28.901
<v Speaker 3>If sometimes you do something naturally </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it just feels right and then when </v>

2327
01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:30.320
<v Speaker 3>somebody asks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2328
01:52:30.330 --> 01:52:31.850
<v Speaker 3>how'd you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or how'd you get out?</v>

2329
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:36.710
<v Speaker 3>Then you have to like sit and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to program your mind to do and know what</v>

2330
01:52:36.711 --> 01:52:39.680
<v Speaker 3>you're doing instead of just reacting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2331
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:41.260
<v Speaker 3>you have to know like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2332
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:43.490
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew I did that and I know.</v>

2333
01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:48.650
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's a teaching for me has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been huge and I really,</v>

2334
01:52:48.651 --> 01:52:51.140
<v Speaker 3>really enjoy teaching much more now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2335
01:52:51.141 --> 01:52:54.050
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoyed teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoy making people better.</v>

2336
01:52:54.051 --> 01:52:56.210
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2337
01:52:56.211 --> 01:53:00.630
<v Speaker 3>as a teacher I am able to see what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person needs and see where,</v>

2338
01:53:00.631 --> 01:53:05.631
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he's weak and try to make it </v>

2339
01:53:05.631 --> 01:53:07.130
<v Speaker 3>better instead of coming in with a class</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in my mind,</v>

2340
01:53:07.131 --> 01:53:08.560
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just teach this class,</v>

2341
01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:10.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just teach this move.</v>

2342
01:53:10.510 --> 01:53:15.510
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm looking specifically to see what</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person is lacking in and how it's </v>

2343
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:16.940
<v Speaker 3>going to benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guys are too hyper,</v>

2344
01:53:17.210 --> 01:53:18.500
<v Speaker 3>you have to calm down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>breathe.</v>

2345
01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:20.780
<v Speaker 3>Some guys are too slow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wake up buddy.</v>

2346
01:53:20.781 --> 01:53:21.890
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get it going.</v>

2347
01:53:21.891 --> 01:53:24.220
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think the,</v>

2348
01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:29.510
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the good teacher is the one who kind of </v>

2349
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:30.590
<v Speaker 3>adapt to the needs of the student for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2350
01:53:31.370 --> 01:53:33.590
<v Speaker 3>for the goal of being better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2351
01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:35.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not necessarily trying to make you </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel good.</v>

2352
01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:39.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm not necessarily trying to make you </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe something.</v>

2353
01:53:39.710 --> 01:53:43.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to make you better at g two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to get better,</v>

2354
01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:45.860
<v Speaker 3>you have to be a little bit better every</v>
<v Speaker 3>time you leave me,</v>

2355
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.970
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2356
01:53:47.740 --> 01:53:52.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really believe that the more I teach </v>

2357
01:53:52.740 --> 01:53:55.880
<v Speaker 3>and especially for me personally because</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad left when I was 18,</v>

2358
01:53:56.210 --> 01:53:57.920
<v Speaker 3>so I had all these students at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>academy,</v>

2359
01:53:57.921 --> 01:54:00.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these were all my training partners.</v>

2360
01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:05.020
<v Speaker 3>So I had to teach these people to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>better so that I could have good </v>

2361
01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:07.200
<v Speaker 3>training because if I didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was,</v>

2362
01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:08.060
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2363
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:09.680
<v Speaker 3>just do that move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2364
01:54:09.681 --> 01:54:10.940
<v Speaker 3>keep going guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep going.</v>

2365
01:54:10.941 --> 01:54:11.790
<v Speaker 3>Open training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2366
01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:15.470
<v Speaker 3>But then I will not have great training </v>
<v Speaker 3>partners the way I do now.</v>

2367
01:54:15.590 --> 01:54:17.600
<v Speaker 3>I have great training partner now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was like,</v>

2368
01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:22.660
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is this guy to beat me or don't let </v>

2369
01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:25.991
<v Speaker 3>me get to this position and I'm very </v>
<v Speaker 3>passionate on letting these guys get </v>

2370
01:54:25.991 --> 01:54:26.780
<v Speaker 3>better to tell him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell him,</v>

2371
01:54:26.781 --> 01:54:27.260
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2372
01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:32.580
<v Speaker 3>the way you're going to pay me to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this and I'm making these guys </v>

2373
01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:34.190
<v Speaker 3>better to try to beat me so that one </v>
<v Speaker 3>they stay motivated and to.</v>

2374
01:54:34.191 --> 01:54:39.191
<v Speaker 3>So they gave me great training because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can train now in my academy for four or </v>

2375
01:54:39.841 --> 01:54:44.841
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to go to train with these </v>

2376
01:54:44.841 --> 01:54:46.721
<v Speaker 3>other because I have guys who know </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly what I do and I tell them </v>

2377
01:54:46.721 --> 01:54:49.751
<v Speaker 3>exactly how to defend it and I'm working</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and the better I make them the </v>

2378
01:54:49.751 --> 01:54:51.080
<v Speaker 3>better they're gonna make me.</v>

2379
01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:56.140
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you were teaching at Your Dad's </v>

2380
01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:56.390
<v Speaker 3>academy when you were 18?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were basically 15,</v>

2381
01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:57.590
<v Speaker 3>15.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started teaching,</v>

2382
01:54:57.591 --> 01:55:01.520
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't running the academy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't teaching the classes at 16.</v>

2383
01:55:01.521 --> 01:55:05.210
<v Speaker 3>I taught like once a week 17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started teaching a couple more times a</v>

2384
01:55:05.211 --> 01:55:10.211
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By 18 I was fully teaching everything </v>

2385
01:55:10.211 --> 01:55:10.490
<v Speaker 3>and running the whole academy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2386
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:12.740
<v Speaker 3>So that's what you've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially for a living?</v>

2387
01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

2388
01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:20.440
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for the past seven years that's been </v>

2389
01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:23.120
<v Speaker 3>what you do will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since I was 18,</v>

2390
01:55:23.121 --> 01:55:24.660
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since I was 15,</v>

2391
01:55:24.670 --> 01:55:26.810
<v Speaker 3>I had been all the money I make is from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu.</v>

2392
01:55:26.811 --> 01:55:28.010
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

2393
01:55:28.011 --> 01:55:33.011
<v Speaker 3>that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now when you teach 'em how many days </v>

2394
01:55:33.011 --> 01:55:34.310
<v Speaker 3>a week you teaching?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I teach once a day.</v>

2395
01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:35.610
<v Speaker 3>Once a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2396
01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:37.910
<v Speaker 3>Do you have daytime classes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's someone else teaches.</v>

2397
01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:42.850
<v Speaker 3>I teach once a day and then some days I </v>
<v Speaker 3>teach twice and then some days I,</v>

2398
01:55:42.851 --> 01:55:47.851
<v Speaker 3>I the afternoon class and so I kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>scatter it out to where I can get to </v>

2399
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:52.020
<v Speaker 3>every teach two days in the afternoon </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll teach every night and then</v>

2400
01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:55.770
<v Speaker 3>so some days on Tuesdays I teach twice a</v>
<v Speaker 3>day but.</v>

2401
01:55:56.340 --> 01:56:01.340
<v Speaker 3>But yeah I teach a lot and I also teach </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to where I don't over teaching </v>

2402
01:56:01.981 --> 01:56:04.710
<v Speaker 3>get kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I've taught before where I teach</v>

2403
01:56:04.711 --> 01:56:06.780
<v Speaker 3>every class and that's training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2404
01:56:06.781 --> 01:56:08.550
<v Speaker 3>you give a lot of your energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you teach it,</v>

2405
01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:10.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give,</v>

2406
01:56:10.351 --> 01:56:15.351
<v Speaker 3>give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give and then you have nothing for </v>

2407
01:56:15.351 --> 01:56:17.061
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've found my kind of remedy of how </v>

2408
01:56:17.061 --> 01:56:19.851
<v Speaker 3>much I can teach to where I still feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>good about myself and still have enough </v>

2409
01:56:19.851 --> 01:56:22.020
<v Speaker 3>to do the things I need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I teach,</v>

2410
01:56:22.021 --> 01:56:27.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monday through Thursday nights and then </v>

2411
01:56:27.021 --> 01:56:27.480
<v Speaker 3>I teach Tuesday and Friday mornings and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then salaries,</v>

2412
01:56:27.481 --> 01:56:32.481
<v Speaker 3>open training and so I kind of give </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself a time to not have those </v>

2413
01:56:32.481 --> 01:56:32.481
<v Speaker 3>responsibilities</v>

2414
01:56:32.770 --> 01:56:34.510
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you structure a class?</v>

2415
01:56:34.511 --> 01:56:39.511
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you sit down and write out what your </v>

2416
01:56:39.511 --> 01:56:41.860
<v Speaker 1>objectives are for each class?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you structure them in on the fly?</v>

2417
01:56:41.861 --> 01:56:46.861
<v Speaker 1>Like as you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have specific things that you </v>

2418
01:56:46.861 --> 01:56:49.471
<v Speaker 1>want to work on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain drills that you think that </v>

2419
01:56:49.471 --> 01:56:49.471
<v Speaker 1>people are lacking in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

2420
01:56:49.471 --> 01:56:52.860
<v Speaker 3>everyday is different and it depends a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot on my mood to a.</v>

2421
01:56:53.470 --> 01:56:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Some days I want to do a specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>training for me,</v>

2422
01:56:55.810 --> 01:56:57.280
<v Speaker 3>so I'll do like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2423
01:56:57.340 --> 01:56:59.200
<v Speaker 3>something that I feel like I need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>work on,</v>

2424
01:56:59.770 --> 01:57:04.770
<v Speaker 3>so then I'll teach that move and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>have something I know I'm not the </v>

2425
01:57:04.770 --> 01:57:09.361
<v Speaker 3>greatest asset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'll teach that move and didn't try </v>

2426
01:57:09.361 --> 01:57:11.521
<v Speaker 3>to really research and see how I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it better and then work on that </v>

2427
01:57:11.521 --> 01:57:11.530
<v Speaker 3>move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I see what the class needs and</v>

2428
01:57:11.531 --> 01:57:12.820
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the,</v>

2429
01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:15.880
<v Speaker 3>what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like those people who are in that</v>

2430
01:57:15.881 --> 01:57:20.881
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are they going to get the most out </v>

2431
01:57:20.881 --> 01:57:20.881
<v Speaker 3>of that class?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some days it's,</v>

2432
01:57:20.881 --> 01:57:22.160
<v Speaker 3>it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some days it's not.</v>

2433
01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:23.800
<v Speaker 3>Some days I come up with stuff on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>

2434
01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:25.840
<v Speaker 3>some days I'm kind of like thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about something all day.</v>

2435
01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:29.440
<v Speaker 3>Everyday is different and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are basically.</v>

2436
01:57:29.441 --> 01:57:33.640
<v Speaker 3>I never write anything down before I </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of just do everything on the spot.</v>

2437
01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:38.640
<v Speaker 3>And basically my goal when I'm teaching </v>
<v Speaker 3>is to make my students better and to </v>

2438
01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:41.620
<v Speaker 3>make them a gain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2439
01:57:41.621 --> 01:57:43.810
<v Speaker 3>So how I'm going to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2440
01:57:43.870 --> 01:57:46.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to kind of see and feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

2441
01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:47.350
<v Speaker 3>where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2442
01:57:47.351 --> 01:57:52.351
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I have a lot more beginners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to teach a fancy or </v>

2443
01:57:52.351 --> 01:57:54.460
<v Speaker 3>something that took me 20 years to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out.</v>

2444
01:57:54.461 --> 01:57:55.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna teach it to somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginners,</v>

2445
01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:58.210
<v Speaker 3>so if there's a class in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly beginners,</v>

2446
01:57:58.211 --> 01:57:59.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to teach him mostly beginner </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2447
01:58:00.490 --> 01:58:02.670
<v Speaker 3>There's a class in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's these guys want to all train,</v>

2448
01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:05.410
<v Speaker 3>then we will do all these trends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it depends.</v>

2449
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:10.870
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting aspect about Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>that most people that have never </v>

2450
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:14.861
<v Speaker 1>trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very difficult for them to </v>

2451
01:58:14.861 --> 01:58:15.920
<v Speaker 1>grasp the depth of technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different techniques and</v>

2452
01:58:15.921 --> 01:58:18.950
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different techniques </v>
<v Speaker 1>that transitioned into other techniques.</v>

2453
01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:21.950
<v Speaker 1>It's for the lay person to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it.</v>

2454
01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:25.040
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

2455
01:58:25.490 --> 01:58:30.490
<v Speaker 1>when you see someone like yourself that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a deep knowledge of it and then </v>

2456
01:58:30.490 --> 01:58:34.481
<v Speaker 1>teaches and trains and competes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to kind of pay attention to it </v>

2457
01:58:34.481 --> 01:58:34.481
<v Speaker 1>for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2458
01:58:34.481 --> 01:58:37.040
<v Speaker 1>many hours before you even see how deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>the water is.</v>

2459
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the more you learn,</v>

2460
01:58:41.410 --> 01:58:43.390
<v Speaker 3>the more you realize you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2461
01:58:43.391 --> 01:58:45.610
<v Speaker 3>and it can always be easier for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2462
01:58:45.611 --> 01:58:48.250
<v Speaker 3>like if you're training and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>having trouble,</v>

2463
01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:50.620
<v Speaker 3>if it's difficult for you to beat your </v>
<v Speaker 3>opponent,</v>

2464
01:58:51.070 --> 01:58:52.750
<v Speaker 3>then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing something wrong,</v>

2465
01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:54.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be easy.</v>

2466
01:58:54.011 --> 01:58:59.011
<v Speaker 3>You should be able to outsmart your </v>
<v Speaker 3>opponent and it should be easy.</v>

2467
01:58:59.051 --> 01:59:04.051
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu is easy really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're having a struggle with any </v>

2468
01:59:04.051 --> 01:59:08.821
<v Speaker 3>kind of training session or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that means you need to improve on </v>

2469
01:59:08.821 --> 01:59:11.461
<v Speaker 3>something else to make your life easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I really don't think that there is </v>

2470
01:59:11.461 --> 01:59:11.940
<v Speaker 3>ever like a cap where you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2471
01:59:11.950 --> 01:59:13.190
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know everything and I,</v>

2472
01:59:13.191 --> 01:59:18.191
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets to such a small detail and then </v>

2473
01:59:18.191 --> 01:59:21.151
<v Speaker 3>it gets to like the timing of not only </v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to know and to do what you </v>

2474
01:59:21.151 --> 01:59:21.670
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do it at the right time.</v>

2475
01:59:21.671 --> 01:59:24.460
<v Speaker 3>So it's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So complicated.</v>

2476
01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:26.320
<v Speaker 3>I've cried so many times trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure it out.</v>

2477
01:59:28.110 --> 01:59:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>identity still to this day I feel like,</v>

2478
01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:37.560
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm only like maybe even halfway of </v>

2479
01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:37.560
<v Speaker 3>where I want to be.</v>

2480
01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a very brilliant guy,</v>

2481
01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:41.640
<v Speaker 1>an interesting expression when it came </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learning things,</v>

2482
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:46.910
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brighter the bonfire of </v>

2483
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:49.371
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more surface area of ignorance is </v>

2484
01:59:49.371 --> 01:59:49.371
<v Speaker 1>revealed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the more you know,</v>

2485
01:59:49.371 --> 01:59:51.690
<v Speaker 1>the more you realize God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much shit to.</v>

2486
01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:56.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true and it sort of applies to </v>

2487
01:59:56.860 --> 02:00:00.291
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think one of the unique things </v>

2488
02:00:00.291 --> 02:00:00.420
<v Speaker 1>about Jujitsu and one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten,</v>

2489
02:00:00.421 --> 02:00:05.421
<v Speaker 1>not just for myself but from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that I've inspired to begin </v>

2490
02:00:05.421 --> 02:00:09.231
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and start training Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they say that it makes </v>

2491
02:00:09.231 --> 02:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>everything else in their life better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That they say that the,</v>

2492
02:00:11.001 --> 02:00:16.001
<v Speaker 1>the Jujitsu training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difficulty of it and the learning </v>

2493
02:00:16.001 --> 02:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>about themselves has helped them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually everything they do.</v>

2494
02:00:18.500 --> 02:00:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely agree.</v>

2495
02:00:19.821 --> 02:00:24.821
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't give me a billion dollars </v>

2496
02:00:24.821 --> 02:00:24.821
<v Speaker 3>today to take away the Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2497
02:00:24.821 --> 02:00:26.040
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

2498
02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:28.220
<v Speaker 3>There's no way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2499
02:00:28.221 --> 02:00:31.400
<v Speaker 3>like how I feel as a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how I talk and how I am.</v>

2500
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:36.790
<v Speaker 3>He's 100 percent because of Jujitsu and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just something that I'm very </v>

2501
02:00:36.891 --> 02:00:41.891
<v Speaker 3>grateful to be to have landed where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>landed in the footsteps of following my </v>

2502
02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:47.680
<v Speaker 3>father's footsteps and it's just a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu will for sure.</v>

2503
02:00:48.561 --> 02:00:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Save your ass it one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily a physical fight,</v>

2504
02:00:52.731 --> 02:00:55.310
<v Speaker 3>but also being able to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

2505
02:00:55.340 --> 02:01:00.340
<v Speaker 3>know about yourself and and it really </v>
<v Speaker 3>improve yourself as a whole because it's</v>

2506
02:01:00.801 --> 02:01:05.801
<v Speaker 3>very easy to get trapped into like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>daily life schedule and you kind of </v>

2507
02:01:05.811 --> 02:01:10.811
<v Speaker 3>don't even tap to your potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even tap into discovering </v>

2508
02:01:10.811 --> 02:01:11.060
<v Speaker 3>yourself and realizing all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings.</v>

2509
02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:16.600
<v Speaker 3>I feel alive when I could compete and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I trained for a fight and when I </v>

2510
02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:19.160
<v Speaker 3>know I got to fight in this deadline and</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you on this day,</v>

2511
02:01:19.550 --> 02:01:24.550
<v Speaker 3>you're going to show up whether you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be ready or not or whether </v>

2512
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:25.490
<v Speaker 3>you're sick or hurt or this day this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to happen.</v>

2513
02:01:25.491 --> 02:01:30.491
<v Speaker 3>So to know that that is going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to be nervous and to train for that </v>

2514
02:01:30.491 --> 02:01:34.961
<v Speaker 3>and to put so much energy and wake up </v>
<v Speaker 3>early and do a and drink this special </v>

2515
02:01:34.961 --> 02:01:36.680
<v Speaker 3>juice and do this and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2516
02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:41.770
<v Speaker 3>eat healthy and all this stuff that only</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes you know more sure of yourself.</v>

2517
02:01:45.141 --> 02:01:46.530
<v Speaker 3>And when the day happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2518
02:01:46.531 --> 02:01:48.950
<v Speaker 3>like then after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it makes me feel alive.</v>

2519
02:01:48.951 --> 02:01:53.951
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these feelings that you get before </v>

2520
02:01:53.951 --> 02:01:53.951
<v Speaker 3>you fight or when you're fighting or </v>
<v Speaker 3>training for a fight.</v>

2521
02:01:53.951 --> 02:01:56.180
<v Speaker 3>It makes me feel alive and I love that </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling.</v>

2522
02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:59.750
<v Speaker 3>Now if you take away competition from my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

2523
02:01:59.751 --> 02:02:02.150
<v Speaker 3>I will go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go,</v>

2524
02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:03.530
<v Speaker 3>I'll go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just wouldn't know.</v>

2525
02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:06.080
<v Speaker 3>What days would you seem like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Repetitive.</v>

2526
02:02:06.081 --> 02:02:08.570
<v Speaker 3>I have no passion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lose my drive.</v>

2527
02:02:09.290 --> 02:02:11.840
<v Speaker 3>I kind of just start going down a dark </v>
<v Speaker 3>hole.</v>

2528
02:02:11.841 --> 02:02:16.841
<v Speaker 3>So I think that Jujitsu competitions </v>
<v Speaker 3>really makes me feel alive and every </v>

2529
02:02:16.841 --> 02:02:19.790
<v Speaker 3>time before I feel nervous and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>after when I win or lose it,</v>

2530
02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:22.790
<v Speaker 3>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you only gain.</v>

2531
02:02:22.791 --> 02:02:24.530
<v Speaker 3>And when you know that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a fight,</v>

2532
02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:30.070
<v Speaker 3>you gained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know that you've got to be </v>

2533
02:02:30.070 --> 02:02:30.070
<v Speaker 3>at your best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you always like,</v>

2534
02:02:30.070 --> 02:02:31.490
<v Speaker 3>how am I going to get my better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're never good enough,</v>

2535
02:02:31.491 --> 02:02:35.090
<v Speaker 3>and then it's just so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes me feel real good.</v>

2536
02:02:35.550 --> 02:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I feel is missing</v>

2537
02:02:38.401 --> 02:02:43.401
<v Speaker 1>in today's society is that people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get by really easily.</v>

2538
02:02:44.070 --> 02:02:46.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is show up for work,</v>

2539
02:02:46.381 --> 02:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>do your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go home,</v>

2540
02:02:47.820 --> 02:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>eat food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to sleep.</v>

2541
02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to struggle to acquire </v>
<v Speaker 1>that food.</v>

2542
02:02:51.991 --> 02:02:56.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to really go through life</v>
<v Speaker 1>or death scenarios on a daily basis.</v>

2543
02:02:56.971 --> 02:03:00.030
<v Speaker 1>For most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a life or death scenario is incredibly,</v>

2544
02:03:00.031 --> 02:03:05.031
<v Speaker 1>incredibly rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those scenarios are sort of </v>

2545
02:03:05.031 --> 02:03:06.240
<v Speaker 1>replicated inside the gym on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

2546
02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:11.720
<v Speaker 1>When somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Jujitsu black belt is mounting you </v>

2547
02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:13.470
<v Speaker 1>and he's choking the shit out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Survival is the key thing.</v>

2548
02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:15.990
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

2549
02:03:15.991 --> 02:03:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2550
02:03:17.041 --> 02:03:17.490
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2551
02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:22.820
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm rolling and you know John Jocks </v>

2552
02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:24.150
<v Speaker 1>on top of me and he's got an arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>triangle and I might black out,</v>

2553
02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:26.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100 percent certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to kill me.</v>

2554
02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:28.200
<v Speaker 1>He'll tap me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2555
02:03:28.230 --> 02:03:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if he chokes me up and go to sleep,</v>

2556
02:03:30.091 --> 02:03:34.470
<v Speaker 1>I know that I'm going to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't feel that at the time when</v>

2557
02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:36.390
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you are getting choked,</v>

2558
02:03:36.391 --> 02:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>that is life or death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>

2559
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:39.570
<v Speaker 1>truly is.</v>

2560
02:03:40.190 --> 02:03:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Can't fake those feelings that you feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're training and you put </v>

2561
02:03:45.190 --> 02:03:45.860
<v Speaker 3>yourself through all these situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've been put to sleep many times in</v>

2562
02:03:45.861 --> 02:03:46.550
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2563
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:49.940
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a crazy feeling.</v>

2564
02:03:49.941 --> 02:03:51.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a crazy feeling to like</v>

2565
02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:53.490
<v Speaker 8>I don't want it to have been.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't want.</v>

2566
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:56.000
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to almost get out and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 8>going to own more than.</v>

2567
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:59.380
<v Speaker 3>And then you just wake up and you mother</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuckers are laughing at.</v>

2568
02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:02.220
<v Speaker 8>So</v>

2569
02:04:03.530 --> 02:04:04.640
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's feeling</v>

2570
02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:09.640
<v Speaker 3>that you cannot replace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no other way that you're going </v>

2571
02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:11.981
<v Speaker 3>to be able to feel that unless you </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally are like living in that </v>

2572
02:04:11.981 --> 02:04:16.811
<v Speaker 3>moment and no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing more intense than </v>

2573
02:04:16.811 --> 02:04:16.850
<v Speaker 3>somebody trying to choke you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2574
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:19.060
<v Speaker 3>your natural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>

2575
02:04:19.061 --> 02:04:22.580
<v Speaker 3>you feel those feelings and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how you deal with those feelings are</v>

2576
02:04:22.581 --> 02:04:27.581
<v Speaker 3>going to really dedicate your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I kind of am able to read</v>

2577
02:04:28.041 --> 02:04:29.540
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is how they deal.</v>

2578
02:04:29.570 --> 02:04:31.370
<v Speaker 3>How do they deal when they're under </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress?</v>

2579
02:04:32.350 --> 02:04:35.210
<v Speaker 3>How do they deal when they're winning?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are they deal when their.</v>

2580
02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:40.600
<v Speaker 3>Everything's going good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they the same person when they're </v>

2581
02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:40.600
<v Speaker 3>losing them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're winning?</v>

2582
02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:41.670
<v Speaker 3>How do they deal with when somebody out </v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow?</v>

2583
02:04:41.671 --> 02:04:46.671
<v Speaker 3>So I've kind of always been really </v>
<v Speaker 3>curious to see how people are and how </v>

2584
02:04:49.411 --> 02:04:51.330
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they react,</v>

2585
02:04:51.331 --> 02:04:53.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to react when somebody</v>

2586
02:04:53.150 --> 02:04:54.770
<v Speaker 3>beating you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you interact with somebody who's,</v>

2587
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:56.250
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're winning,</v>

2588
02:04:56.251 --> 02:04:58.680
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're stronger or how are going to</v>

2589
02:04:58.681 --> 02:05:00.990
<v Speaker 3>rack when somebody is weaker and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just trying to help.</v>

2590
02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:03.700
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's a kind of a great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2591
02:05:04.290 --> 02:05:06.270
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu reveals character.</v>

2592
02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no more about my students,</v>

2593
02:05:09.331 --> 02:05:11.760
<v Speaker 3>didn't they know about themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2594
02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I will tell them exactly where they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2595
02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:19.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know everything about them because </v>

2596
02:05:19.340 --> 02:05:19.340
<v Speaker 3>I've trained with them and I know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they feel,</v>

2597
02:05:19.340 --> 02:05:20.820
<v Speaker 3>how they feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're feeling great,</v>

2598
02:05:20.821 --> 02:05:22.920
<v Speaker 3>how they feel when they're feeling weak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they,</v>

2599
02:05:23.580 --> 02:05:24.930
<v Speaker 3>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're winning,</v>

2600
02:05:25.210 --> 02:05:27.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know how to feel if you're a coward or</v>

2601
02:05:27.391 --> 02:05:28.090
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

2602
02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:30.360
<v Speaker 3>if you have hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've patients,</v>

2603
02:05:30.361 --> 02:05:33.630
<v Speaker 3>if you have dignity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these things are,</v>

2604
02:05:33.690 --> 02:05:36.180
<v Speaker 3>are things that I can feel when I train </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>

2605
02:05:36.210 --> 02:05:38.320
<v Speaker 3>Just give me five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes to train with you and I don't</v>

2606
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:41.340
<v Speaker 3>know more about you than probably you </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

2607
02:05:41.341 --> 02:05:43.710
<v Speaker 3>unless you're very experienced person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who is yourself.</v>

2608
02:05:43.711 --> 02:05:45.600
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2609
02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:50.070
<v Speaker 3>and that's what I kind of judged my </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole basis on is how I feel,</v>

2610
02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:55.940
<v Speaker 3>how I judge somebody on how they train.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't judge somebody by how they talk </v>

2611
02:05:55.940 --> 02:05:55.940
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2612
02:05:55.940 --> 02:06:00.920
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'll get people who the super </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice and they're super and super </v>

2613
02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:03.720
<v Speaker 3>respectful in person and they were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>the perfect person.</v>

2614
02:06:03.721 --> 02:06:04.870
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when they train,</v>

2615
02:06:04.871 --> 02:06:07.180
<v Speaker 3>they just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this malaise from them.</v>

2616
02:06:08.190 --> 02:06:08.910
<v Speaker 3>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2617
02:06:08.911 --> 02:06:09.510
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2618
02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:11.340
<v Speaker 3>that malice is for real</v>

2619
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>malice towards other people or</v>

2620
02:06:14.150 --> 02:06:16.610
<v Speaker 3>just not how they were when they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal,</v>

2621
02:06:17.210 --> 02:06:20.270
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they're able to act,</v>

2622
02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:22.220
<v Speaker 3>they're able to put this show on for </v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever,</v>

2623
02:06:22.221 --> 02:06:27.221
<v Speaker 3>but when they're training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way you can hide your </v>

2624
02:06:27.221 --> 02:06:27.221
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2625
02:06:27.221 --> 02:06:27.221
<v Speaker 3>And it goes the other way too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes other people,</v>

2626
02:06:27.221 --> 02:06:30.250
<v Speaker 3>sometimes people are very cold and rude </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2627
02:06:30.251 --> 02:06:30.630
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2628
02:06:30.810 --> 02:06:35.810
<v Speaker 3>and that's not necessarily them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just don't feel necessarily when </v>

2629
02:06:35.810 --> 02:06:37.360
<v Speaker 3>they train their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're respectful and they and they,</v>

2630
02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:39.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to get better.</v>

2631
02:06:39.621 --> 02:06:42.620
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of different ways that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of feel people out.</v>

2632
02:06:42.621 --> 02:06:45.260
<v Speaker 3>And I just kind of do my judgment on </v>
<v Speaker 3>their training.</v>

2633
02:06:45.650 --> 02:06:47.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't really care what people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course I care,</v>

2634
02:06:47.781 --> 02:06:51.350
<v Speaker 3>but I don't judge too much on what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>say and how you are.</v>

2635
02:06:51.351 --> 02:06:54.530
<v Speaker 3>Of course I feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I train with you,</v>

2636
02:06:54.531 --> 02:06:56.030
<v Speaker 3>I'll make my final decision.</v>

2637
02:06:57.820 --> 02:07:00.610
<v Speaker 1>And on that note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a beautiful way to describe it.</v>

2638
02:07:00.850 --> 02:07:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that statement.</v>

2639
02:07:02.531 --> 02:07:04.450
<v Speaker 1>When I train with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make my final decision.</v>

2640
02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:06.970
<v Speaker 1>That's so true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2641
02:07:06.971 --> 02:07:11.971
<v Speaker 1>That's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn so much about someone when </v>

2642
02:07:11.971 --> 02:07:11.971
<v Speaker 1>they train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2643
02:07:11.971 --> 02:07:16.130
<v Speaker 1>as far as your goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've achieved world championship </v>

2644
02:07:16.130 --> 02:07:18.490
<v Speaker 1>status in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your goals from now?</v>

2645
02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my goal now is to focus on MMA and,</v>

2646
02:07:21.141 --> 02:07:25.510
<v Speaker 3>and to be the best I can be in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's my new mission.</v>

2647
02:07:25.511 --> 02:07:27.510
<v Speaker 3>And so you have aspirations to fight in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC?</v>

2648
02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:32.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean right now I think the Japan is </v>

2649
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:33.340
<v Speaker 3>the bed is the better opportunity for </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

2650
02:07:33.370 --> 02:07:34.690
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2651
02:07:34.691 --> 02:07:39.691
<v Speaker 3>if it's UFC or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to fight in the UFC has the </v>

2652
02:07:39.691 --> 02:07:43.660
<v Speaker 3>best fighters in the best organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So of course I would like to test myself</v>

2653
02:07:43.661 --> 02:07:44.560
<v Speaker 3>against those guys.</v>

2654
02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:46.950
<v Speaker 1>So you want to try other organizations </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

2655
02:07:46.980 --> 02:07:49.590
<v Speaker 1>get your feet wet and mma and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually jump in.</v>

2656
02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:52.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all I know is right now I have Japan</v>

2657
02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:56.740
<v Speaker 3>to negotiate with and I know that of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course wherever the best fighters are,</v>

2658
02:07:56.741 --> 02:07:57.790
<v Speaker 3>that's where all want to be.</v>

2659
02:07:58.440 --> 02:08:00.400
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about guys like,</v>

2660
02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:02.200
<v Speaker 1>like [inaudible] grace here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2661
02:08:02.230 --> 02:08:07.230
<v Speaker 1>he's a perfect example of a guy's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very high level Jujitsu guy who just </v>

2662
02:08:07.230 --> 02:08:09.910
<v Speaker 1>hasn't really been able to get that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>going in mma.</v>

2663
02:08:10.580 --> 02:08:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't train with him so I don't really</v>

2664
02:08:12.741 --> 02:08:13.550
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2665
02:08:13.650 --> 02:08:18.650
<v Speaker 3>I know that he's a legend in Jujitsu and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been able to really excel energy </v>

2666
02:08:18.650 --> 02:08:20.000
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2667
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:23.600
<v Speaker 3>but I don't train with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know necessarily how well he,</v>

2668
02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:26.420
<v Speaker 3>what he does or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2669
02:08:27.610 --> 02:08:29.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really hope that he's able to excel in</v>

2670
02:08:29.961 --> 02:08:32.720
<v Speaker 3>mma and I really hope that he's able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2671
02:08:33.650 --> 02:08:36.200
<v Speaker 3>show what he's about and bringing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game to his game.</v>

2672
02:08:36.860 --> 02:08:40.400
<v Speaker 3>And I saw a fight with him with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy,</v>

2673
02:08:40.401 --> 02:08:45.401
<v Speaker 3>I think it was and I just felt like he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't able to find his place and he </v>

2674
02:08:45.401 --> 02:08:45.680
<v Speaker 3>wasn't able to find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2675
02:08:47.150 --> 02:08:52.150
<v Speaker 3>find himself in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if that's lack of </v>

2676
02:08:52.150 --> 02:08:53.240
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of advice,</v>

2677
02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:56.990
<v Speaker 3>lack of knowing what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is really.</v>

2678
02:08:56.991 --> 02:08:59.730
<v Speaker 3>And I'm curious to see if that's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to happen with me too,</v>

2679
02:08:59.790 --> 02:09:04.790
<v Speaker 3>because it gets also Tim Kennedy to Tim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenny Kenny's really good verizon </v>

2680
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.790
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very good.</v>

2681
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.930
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

2682
02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>he's really a dangerous guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2683
02:09:07.710 --> 02:09:09.790
<v Speaker 3>a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way cuts and this,</v>

2684
02:09:09.791 --> 02:09:13.240
<v Speaker 3>that's how they start to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no real,</v>

2685
02:09:13.241 --> 02:09:15.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not the owner of the truth to be</v>

2686
02:09:15.671 --> 02:09:18.370
<v Speaker 3>able to tell you what he's doing or why </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not or what.</v>

2687
02:09:18.970 --> 02:09:21.130
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's different than me.</v>

2688
02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:24.130
<v Speaker 3>He's a different sides of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a huge guy.</v>

2689
02:09:24.710 --> 02:09:27.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to see him just whoop ass,</v>

2690
02:09:27.151 --> 02:09:28.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to see them do really well,</v>

2691
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:31.150
<v Speaker 3>but his thought was a little different </v>
<v Speaker 3>than mine.</v>

2692
02:09:31.151 --> 02:09:31.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is bigger.</v>

2693
02:09:31.901 --> 02:09:33.370
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

2694
02:09:33.371 --> 02:09:37.180
<v Speaker 3>I have to 100 rely 100 percent rely on </v>
<v Speaker 3>my technique and my leverage.</v>

2695
02:09:37.190 --> 02:09:38.840
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2696
02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:40.360
<v Speaker 3>we'll see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really curious.</v>

2697
02:09:40.361 --> 02:09:44.710
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm in this is to see and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prove to the people what I'm about.</v>

2698
02:09:44.711 --> 02:09:49.711
<v Speaker 3>So I hope harsher winds and I hope he </v>
<v Speaker 3>does well and I'm hoping he's able to </v>

2699
02:09:49.711 --> 02:09:52.780
<v Speaker 3>find himself and really be able to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he's at,</v>

2700
02:09:52.781 --> 02:09:54.120
<v Speaker 3>which is the number one place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2701
02:09:54.121 --> 02:09:55.390
<v Speaker 3>that's where he deserves to be.</v>

2702
02:09:55.550 --> 02:09:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Were you there for any of horrors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMA fights?</v>

2703
02:09:58.400 --> 02:09:59.960
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2704
02:09:59.961 --> 02:10:02.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had some disastrous,</v>

2705
02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:06.740
<v Speaker 1>disastrous results in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get some really high level guys were,</v>

2706
02:10:06.741 --> 02:10:11.741
<v Speaker 1>it seems like maybe he took some fights </v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe wasn't quite prepared for.</v>

2707
02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you learn from anything like that </v>

2708
02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:18.860
<v Speaker 1>when you see him fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys like he fucked kid Yamamoto.</v>

2709
02:10:18.861 --> 02:10:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And kinky,</v>

2710
02:10:19.941 --> 02:10:22.400
<v Speaker 1>pseudo and real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real high level guys.</v>

2711
02:10:23.250 --> 02:10:24.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2712
02:10:24.151 --> 02:10:24.960
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2713
02:10:24.961 --> 02:10:25.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2714
02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:29.710
<v Speaker 1>but he's another example of a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>technical Jujitsu guy.</v>

2715
02:10:29.711 --> 02:10:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Very high level.</v>

2716
02:10:31.050 --> 02:10:32.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2717
02:10:32.131 --> 02:10:37.131
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious to see.</v>
