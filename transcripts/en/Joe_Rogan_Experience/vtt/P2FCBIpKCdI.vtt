1
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.733
<v Speaker 1>All we'll live.</v>

2
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.063
<v Speaker 1>You called that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get that bar and your teeth are you </v>

3
00:00:14.141 --> 00:00:19.141
<v Speaker 1>good thing stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stick those green belly meal bars.</v>

4
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.243
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

6
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.950
<v Speaker 1>your documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Icarus is a,</v>

7
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I see I say that wrong all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say a chorus,</v>

8
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's ICARUS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ICARUS,</v>

9
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.823
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy with the wings that flew </v>

10
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:32.740
<v Speaker 1>too close to the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking amazing.</v>

12
00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:36.130
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had contacted you,</v>

14
00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:38.464
<v Speaker 1>we'd gone back and forth a little bit on</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter and then I finally sat down and </v>

15
00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:43.570
<v Speaker 1>watched it the other day and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

16
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>The extent of the coverup and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first of all for,</v>

17
00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:51.940
<v Speaker 1>for folks who don't know what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

18
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.360
<v Speaker 1>the documentary started off just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>about doping.</v>

19
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.283
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it became about the state </v>

20
00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:02.980
<v Speaker 1>sponsored Russian doping program and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it all imploded.</v>

21
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.390
<v Speaker 1>While you were doing the documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the documentary,</v>

22
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.860
<v Speaker 1>how long did it take you to put this </v>
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>

23
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.163
<v Speaker 1>A three and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what was the initial idea behind </v>

24
00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

25
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 2>So the initial idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

26
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

27
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll say it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's streaming on Netflix right now.</v>

28
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.433
<v Speaker 2>They've released it a month ago and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the initial idea had come to me </v>

29
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.773
<v Speaker 2>essentially when Armstrong confessed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd been a lifelong cycling fan and I </v>

30
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 2>had followed him for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my whole journey with him.</v>

32
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.973
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what struck me the most about his </v>

33
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 2>confession was that if you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody outside of the sport,</v>

34
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 2>they all thought that he got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is,</v>

35
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:47.400
<v Speaker 2>is he actually never got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 2>to this day this guy is passed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 anti-doping controls clean.</v>

37
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

38
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.713
<v Speaker 2>not what's wrong with Armstrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with this global </v>

39
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:03.561
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping system that they can't catch</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most tested athlete on planet earth?</v>

40
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

41
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 2>he's tested clean 500 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who should we be mad at?</v>

42
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:14.841
<v Speaker 2>Should we be mad at Armstrong or should </v>
<v Speaker 2>we be upset at this system?</v>

43
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.803
<v Speaker 2>That is essentially making an athlete </v>
<v Speaker 2>not have a choice as to what they do or </v>

44
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:20.664
<v Speaker 2>not do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they actually want to have a </v>

45
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.913
<v Speaker 2>possibility of winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the system itself is not able to </v>

46
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 2>catch them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's a big</v>

47
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.231
<v Speaker 1>factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is really an important thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about it in the high level world</v>

49
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.114
<v Speaker 1>of cycling when they took away </v>
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong's victories in the Tour de </v>

50
00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:36.774
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the person who got who did not </v>

51
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 1>test positive in any tests before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like 18th place.</v>

52
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone I don't</v>

53
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.980
<v Speaker 2>remember exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

54
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:53.480
<v Speaker 2>but there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no one and then even after a,</v>

55
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.763
<v Speaker 2>his confession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you remember how they get them to </v>

56
00:02:56.391 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 2>confess as essentially the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feds come in on</v>

57
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.933
<v Speaker 3>a criminal investigation and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically go to all of his teammates </v>

58
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:04.774
<v Speaker 3>over the years that he had raised some </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically point guns at their head and </v>

59
00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:08.684
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

60
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you dope or did you not dope?</v>

61
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Now if you tell us that you doped and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Armstrong doped,</v>

62
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 3>you go free and we weren't going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>punish you,</v>

63
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 3>but if you lie to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna be a price to pay.</v>

64
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.743
<v Speaker 3>And in doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of his teammates who did the exact </v>

65
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 3>same thing that he did ratted him out in</v>
<v Speaker 3>exchange for their own immunity.</v>

66
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the rest is history,</v>

67
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.771
<v Speaker 1>do it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

68
00:03:33.771 --> 00:03:34.604
<v Speaker 1>Like he was actually suing people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying that he was doping and he </v>

69
00:03:38.181 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>was going after them and threatening </v>
<v Speaker 1>them with lawsuits and which,</v>

70
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:43.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.783
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know why before I ever picked up a </v>

72
00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 3>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

73
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 3>I had named the film Icarus and I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>named it icarus because of what I deemed</v>

74
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 3>the Armstrong story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a story of a guy who just kept</v>

75
00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:03.434
<v Speaker 3>pushing the boundaries and pushing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>boundaries and pushing the boundaries </v>

76
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.733
<v Speaker 3>until he flew too close to the sun and </v>
<v Speaker 3>his wings burn and he plummeted to the </v>

77
00:04:10.761 --> 00:04:14.390
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that to me was the story of,</v>

78
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

79
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 3>ambition that wouldn't stop and having </v>
<v Speaker 3>no filter on how far you went to win and</v>

80
00:04:24.021 --> 00:04:24.854
<v Speaker 3>what you were willing to do and who you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were willing to destroy in that process </v>

81
00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:29.240
<v Speaker 3>to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to me,</v>

82
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

83
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.070
<v Speaker 3>when you take the doping out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

84
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

85
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.890
<v Speaker 3>the problem that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

86
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.740
<v Speaker 3>I would have on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a,</v>

87
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.340
<v Speaker 3>on a personal kind of level with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lance of it that,</v>

88
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one thing if you're doing something</v>

89
00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:46.304
<v Speaker 3>that everybody else is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's another thing when you </v>

90
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 3>literally are going out and destroying </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people's lives to,</v>

91
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try to protect your own lies.</v>

92
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

93
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I kind of see his position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see how he got caught up in it and the</v>

94
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 1>momentum of it all just sort of brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to this place where it was almost.</v>

95
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way to do it either,</v>

96
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go after these people and try to </v>

97
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:07.684
<v Speaker 1>silence them or you come clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And eventually he was forced to come </v>

98
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:11.680
<v Speaker 1>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You knew though.</v>

99
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.993
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most people did that he was doing </v>

100
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

101
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:16.294
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had</v>

102
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.040
<v Speaker 3>always felt that he was doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

103
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.883
<v Speaker 3>but I also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having been kind of deeply involved in </v>

104
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:23.764
<v Speaker 3>the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believed that everybody else was doing </v>

105
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:26.224
<v Speaker 3>something also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So his confession to me wasn't really </v>

106
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 3>the shocker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was,</v>

107
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.913
<v Speaker 3>what was the shocker and what set me out</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this journey was like in the Public </v>

108
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.543
<v Speaker 3>Court of opinion and what you saw going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on in the news was it was essentially </v>

109
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

110
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 3>we've got Gadi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got Al Capone,</v>

111
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:50.560
<v Speaker 3>we've got the ringleader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got the,</v>

112
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.603
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest criminal and the history of </v>

113
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:54.004
<v Speaker 3>sport essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we finally got him and to me it was </v>

114
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 3>getting Al Capone</v>

115
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.053
<v Speaker 2>on tax evasion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't get him because the system </v>

116
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 2>didn't work to get him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I started looking at,</v>

117
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.783
<v Speaker 2>forget about cycling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at what does this mean in </v>

118
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.433
<v Speaker 2>all sports?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does this mean in terms of the </v>

119
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.343
<v Speaker 2>Olympics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does this mean in terms of </v>

120
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 2>basketball and football and baseball </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

121
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.963
<v Speaker 2>and all these other sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the most tested athlete on planet </v>

122
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 2>earth can't be caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

123
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.553
<v Speaker 2>and that's what set me out on a to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>the film initially was to explore using </v>

124
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:36.800
<v Speaker 2>kind of just the Armstrong story as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>framework,</v>

125
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:37.634
<v Speaker 2>but to explore what was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was wrong with the Anti doping </v>

126
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 2>system in sport and essentially use </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself as a,</v>

127
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:46.783
<v Speaker 2>as a human Guinea pig to explore that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then along that way kind of show </v>

128
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.143
<v Speaker 2>whether or not this system worked and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then essentially present hypothetical's </v>

129
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:59.900
<v Speaker 2>about what could be done or what </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be done.</v>

130
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whether or not we as a society care,</v>

131
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

132
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug use in sport and,</v>

133
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.520
<v Speaker 2>and that was the original concept and </v>
<v Speaker 2>construct of the film.</v>

134
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.293
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug use in sport is very complicated </v>

135
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:17.054
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so prevalent and it's almost </v>

136
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 2>impossible to separate the two when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it,</v>

137
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.680
<v Speaker 2>particularly the Tour de France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

138
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 2>And professional cycling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

139
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:28.640
<v Speaker 2>it is just a dirty sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

140
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

141
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:30.434
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what I know is over the last </v>

142
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Speaker 2>several years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really cleaned up quite a bit,</v>

143
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.190
<v Speaker 2>quite a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

144
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.560
<v Speaker 2>and if you start looking at the times </v>
<v Speaker 2>also they've,</v>

145
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.230
<v Speaker 2>they've started to come down and slow </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

146
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that we're probably in a,</v>

147
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would call it,</v>

148
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a glory period,</v>

149
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:52.763
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the science kind of catching up </v>

150
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 2>to the cheaters in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the cheaters basically figuring</v>

151
00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:02.210
<v Speaker 2>out how to out science the science </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

152
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 2>so they're in like a holding pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like in the world of cycling,</v>

153
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least that's going on to some extent.</v>

154
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.900
<v Speaker 2>You just get caught just a couple days </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago with a,</v>

155
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 2>an engine in his bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

156
00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:15.700
<v Speaker 2>that's the new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

157
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're putting engines and bikes.</v>

158
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read that a,</v>

159
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 2>they're now figuring out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>replicate a epo,</v>

160
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:24.644
<v Speaker 2>withrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poblete and at the genetic level </v>

161
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:30.460
<v Speaker 2>basically how to make yourselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally create more withrow po eaten.</v>

162
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:35.470
<v Speaker 2>So there's always going to be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>on that cusp of,</v>

163
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 2>of medical technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

164
00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:39.524
<v Speaker 2>and human evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to outsmart the system and </v>

165
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:46.360
<v Speaker 2>the testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you contacted the,</v>

166
00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:47.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russian gentleman,</v>

167
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 2>what was his name again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gregory.</v>

168
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:54.041
<v Speaker 2>Rich Chenko and Gregory is the guy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's right now in the witness protection</v>

169
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Protective protective</v>

170
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>custody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now how did you get ahold of him and how</v>

171
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>did you set that up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it was fascinating.</v>

172
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Once you shoot your ass full with like </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 different kinds of steroids.</v>

173
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many different things did you take?</v>

174
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 2>It took a lot</v>

175
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.160
<v Speaker 2>over how much of a period of about nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

176
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.040
<v Speaker 2>About nine months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in what had,</v>

177
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.780
<v Speaker 2>what had happened is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

178
00:09:23.781 --> 00:09:24.614
<v Speaker 2>So I decided that I was gonna go on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>supersize me as journey into the world </v>

179
00:09:29.781 --> 00:09:30.614
<v Speaker 2>of performance enhancing drugs and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend about a year doing all this </v>

180
00:09:35.001 --> 00:09:36.110
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

181
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.290
<v Speaker 2>shortly after Armstrong confesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is 2013,</v>

182
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.670
<v Speaker 2>early 2013 and I actually picked up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera in May of 2014.</v>

183
00:09:43.671 --> 00:09:44.504
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and over this year I start talking to </v>

184
00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:51.551
<v Speaker 2>all these scientists and I'm contacting </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on a global level and Switzerland</v>

185
00:09:51.801 --> 00:09:54.530
<v Speaker 2>and Germany and the UK and all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>US.</v>

186
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.740
<v Speaker 2>And essentially each one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists I'm asking,</v>

187
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm essentially the same questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>

188
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.143
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you believe they anti-doping system </v>

189
00:10:05.151 --> 00:10:09.260
<v Speaker 2>in sport works?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every single one of them said no,</v>

190
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.173
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you believe that you can catch an </v>

191
00:10:14.871 --> 00:10:17.060
<v Speaker 2>athlete who is doping?</v>

192
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.620
<v Speaker 2>And every single one of them told me no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

193
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:22.454
<v Speaker 2>do you believe that you could still </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially do what Lance Armstrong did </v>

194
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.210
<v Speaker 2>and get away with it with the proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>advisors?</v>

195
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.060
<v Speaker 2>And every one of them said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

196
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.510
<v Speaker 2>and then I would pose the question to </v>
<v Speaker 2>each one of these guys.</v>

197
00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:38.000
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you able,</v>

198
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.223
<v Speaker 2>would you have this knowledge to advise </v>
<v Speaker 2>me how to essentially a evade positive </v>

199
00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:48.950
<v Speaker 2>detection?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the vast majority of them said yes,</v>

200
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.590
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but will you do that?</v>

201
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:52.693
<v Speaker 2>And they said no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said the biggest variable was </v>

202
00:10:56.901 --> 00:11:00.320
<v Speaker 2>it you've got to get your samples into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>water lab,</v>

203
00:11:00.321 --> 00:11:01.154
<v Speaker 2>a World Anti Doping Agency lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that becomes very difficult because </v>

204
00:11:05.991 --> 00:11:08.150
<v Speaker 2>if you can just get your samples into </v>
<v Speaker 2>water lab,</v>

205
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.890
<v Speaker 2>amateur professional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody,</v>

206
00:11:09.891 --> 00:11:14.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you can start figuring out all the,</v>

207
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loopholes and what you can do and what </v>

208
00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:17.504
<v Speaker 2>you can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can essentially know how to be </v>

209
00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:19.874
<v Speaker 2>tested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the variable was how is going to get </v>

210
00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:23.114
<v Speaker 2>my samples into a Wada lab and I start </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to a scientist here by the name </v>

211
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:29.624
<v Speaker 2>of Don Catlin and Los Angeles and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered the grandfather of </v>

212
00:11:33.531 --> 00:11:34.364
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He created all the tests for the first </v>

213
00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:41.660
<v Speaker 2>test for steroid detection and sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he actually,</v>

214
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the first guy who did the testing for</v>

215
00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:45.644
<v Speaker 2>the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the first time they ever did </v>

216
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.170
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>testing and sport.</v>

217
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 2>So caitlin has developed all these tests</v>

218
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.993
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I get in touch with Catlin and he's </v>

219
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:59.920
<v Speaker 3>retired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's still alive,</v>

220
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:03.310
<v Speaker 3>I think he's about 80 years old and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>retired,</v>

221
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

222
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:05.704
<v Speaker 3>six years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I quickly realized in talking to </v>

223
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 3>Kaitlin that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's very frustrated.</v>

224
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:12.003
<v Speaker 3>He basically is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>felt that he spent his entire life and </v>

225
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:15.304
<v Speaker 3>career in a system that he was never </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to win at and that no matter what </v>

226
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:22.384
<v Speaker 3>he did and he would develop one </v>
<v Speaker 3>methodology to catch somebody the very </v>

227
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:28.120
<v Speaker 3>next day there'd be another way around </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

228
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.223
<v Speaker 3>And then he would develop another </v>
<v Speaker 3>methodology and then the very next day </v>

229
00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:31.984
<v Speaker 3>there'd be someone around it or he would</v>
<v Speaker 3>propose that the league or the NFL or </v>

230
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.360
<v Speaker 3>baseball or wherever he wants say should</v>
<v Speaker 3>use this test to catch,</v>

231
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.673
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of substance abuse and the </v>

232
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:51.781
<v Speaker 3>leagues would not use that test </v>
<v Speaker 3>intentionally or he would find positives</v>

233
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.760
<v Speaker 3>and report the positives and then be </v>
<v Speaker 3>told basically to,</v>

234
00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretend that there wasn't a positive </v>

235
00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:03.730
<v Speaker 3>because his job was simply to report not</v>
<v Speaker 3>to police.</v>

236
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.210
<v Speaker 3>And he had spent an entire career with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

237
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.600
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so he has a,</v>

238
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.533
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of frustrations with the </v>

239
00:13:14.051 --> 00:13:14.884
<v Speaker 3>anti-doping system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said that he wouldn't help me do </v>

240
00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:19.564
<v Speaker 3>it because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would've had to prescribe me drugs </v>

241
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't want to be liable for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

242
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.753
<v Speaker 3>B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't know how he was going to get </v>

243
00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:29.470
<v Speaker 3>my samples into a water lab because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have access to that anymore.</v>

244
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.760
<v Speaker 3>And he was worried about his legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to,</v>

245
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.120
<v Speaker 3>as much as he felt all the fallacies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the system,</v>

246
00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:39.360
<v Speaker 3>he didn't want to be out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

247
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.730
<v Speaker 3>basically almost in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making a mockery of,</v>

248
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.400
<v Speaker 3>of all of his work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>

249
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this scientists in Russia,</v>

250
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Gregory Rick Cheng cough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he runs the water lab,</v>

251
00:13:51.401 --> 00:13:52.234
<v Speaker 3>the World Anti Doping Agency lab for all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Russia and I think he might help you </v>

252
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.753
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially you said that because he </v>

253
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.740
<v Speaker 3>knew that the Russians had always been </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of trying to,</v>

254
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.300
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

255
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.820
<v Speaker 3>to figure out ways to game the system.</v>

256
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.400
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had met Gregory,</v>

257
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.293
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in like 1983 and that's a whole other </v>

258
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:19.870
<v Speaker 3>story because Gregory had basically come</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the United States as a spy,</v>

259
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:21.243
<v Speaker 3>a to figure out what the Americans were </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to beat them against in the 1984 </v>

260
00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:28.120
<v Speaker 3>Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I can talk about later.</v>

261
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.313
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

262
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get in touch with gregory,</v>

263
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:32.554
<v Speaker 3>connects us through email and I start </v>
<v Speaker 3>emailing gregory and we spend about </v>

264
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.330
<v Speaker 3>eight months back and forth on emails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>calls.</v>

265
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.120
<v Speaker 3>At the time he had just done the Sochi </v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympics.</v>

266
00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:43.954
<v Speaker 3>So he was doing all the testing for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sochi Olympics and he invites me out to </v>

267
00:14:47.531 --> 00:14:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is July of 2014 to go meet him.</v>

268
00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 3>He's lecturing at this</v>

269
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.720
<v Speaker 2>symposium and he doesn't know at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time that I want a dope.</v>

270
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.920
<v Speaker 2>He just thinks that I'm an American </v>
<v Speaker 2>filmmaker making a documentary,</v>

271
00:15:00.921 --> 00:15:02.960
<v Speaker 2>exploring the anti-doping system in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport.</v>

272
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:04.483
<v Speaker 2>So I go out to Oregon and I make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision that I'm not going to bring my </v>

273
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.133
<v Speaker 2>camera crews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do anything other than </v>

274
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:14.420
<v Speaker 2>to just meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

275
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.583
<v Speaker 2>and we start talking and I say to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gregory and he had just finished the </v>

276
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Sochi Games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

277
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.103
<v Speaker 2>do you believe that a medal in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympics can be one without performance </v>

278
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:30.260
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

279
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.380
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>

280
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.150
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

281
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should believe I tried to believe,</v>

282
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:39.763
<v Speaker 2>but I don't believe a medal in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympics can be one without performance </v>

283
00:15:43.791 --> 00:15:46.130
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he takes this pause,</v>

284
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.350
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

285
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm a bad man.</v>

286
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.460
<v Speaker 2>And he says to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

287
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.820
<v Speaker 2>and that was this moment where I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

288
00:15:58.821 --> 00:16:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Clearly there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a deeper story here that the,</v>

289
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.440
<v Speaker 2>the head of the anti-doping laboratory </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Russia's telling me that a,</v>

290
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:12.250
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't think you can win an Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 2>medal cleanly and be,</v>

291
00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.493
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't know whether or not he's a </v>

292
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:17.190
<v Speaker 2>bad man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

293
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.460
<v Speaker 2>what was going through your head?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a,</v>

294
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.490
<v Speaker 2>I think I just hit the motherload for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

295
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.353
<v Speaker 2>for uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will be a riveting film and not </v>

296
00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:35.810
<v Speaker 2>just Manhattan changes mobile story and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

297
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:42.080
<v Speaker 2>and I say to him and we really bonded </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I really liked the guy,</v>

298
00:16:42.081 --> 00:16:42.770
<v Speaker 2>like just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

299
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.900
<v Speaker 2>he's as you see in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's impossible not to like,</v>

300
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I liked him to.</v>

301
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I liken him Kinda like Bryan Cranston </v>
<v Speaker 2>and breaking bad.</v>

302
00:16:52.101 --> 00:16:54.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's this guy who's living </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

303
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.813
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you love him and at the same time he's </v>

304
00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.170
<v Speaker 2>doing things that he shouldn't be doing.</v>

305
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:01.483
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he'd been living this double life </v>

306
00:17:03.171 --> 00:17:05.450
<v Speaker 2>his entire life was living a double </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

307
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.250
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is insane.</v>

308
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.520
<v Speaker 2>And he agrees that he is going to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

309
00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:15.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm dope and avoid detection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But before this,</v>

310
00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.650
<v Speaker 2>he agrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not admitting to anything.</v>

311
00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:20.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not admitting to anything.</v>

312
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.340
<v Speaker 2>It's just showing you how it just says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>

313
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:23.450
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he says,</v>

314
00:17:23.451 --> 00:17:24.170
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

315
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.830
<v Speaker 2>you're an amateur cyclist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

316
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:29.810
<v Speaker 2>you're not a professional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in his mind,</v>

317
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.540
<v Speaker 2>even though I was quote unquote </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheating,</v>

318
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.990
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't cheating anyone out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

319
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.540
<v Speaker 2>And you were doing it very openly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

320
00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:42.800
<v Speaker 2>And I was doing it very openly and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so he viewed it as kind of like,</v>

321
00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:43.730
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

322
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.760
<v Speaker 2>this is a cool project to get involved </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

323
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.320
<v Speaker 2>And in his mind I think he also looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>at it as,</v>

324
00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

325
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.873
<v Speaker 3>what's the big deal if I expose the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fallacies and the anti doping system </v>

326
00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:59.631
<v Speaker 3>because maybe they'll actually do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about it if I show a,</v>

327
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially how it doesn't work.</v>

328
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.473
<v Speaker 3>So he agrees that he's going to be my </v>
<v Speaker 3>doping advisor and this is now July </v>

329
00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:11.100
<v Speaker 3>2014.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I had to do the race clean first.</v>

330
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.400
<v Speaker 3>I then had to go and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through this whole thing.</v>

331
00:18:14.401 --> 00:18:15.234
<v Speaker 3>And I wasn't going to actually start </v>
<v Speaker 3>doping until essentially the beginning </v>

332
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:21.990
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the next year and beginning of 2015.</v>

333
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.180
<v Speaker 3>So you got to do the race clean to get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>base.</v>

334
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To do.</v>

335
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.940
<v Speaker 3>And because my whole premise was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

336
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:30.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this race twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna go in and do an clean,</v>

337
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.253
<v Speaker 3>see how good I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the next year I'm going to go </v>

338
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:36.900
<v Speaker 3>in just dope to the gills with the hope </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm going to win it.</v>

339
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:37.853
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much cycling had you done before </v>

340
00:18:38.731 --> 00:18:39.564
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot.</v>

341
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.570
<v Speaker 3>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up racing when I was 13,</v>

342
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.040
<v Speaker 3>a race seriously ties 19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I moved out to La at,</v>

343
00:18:48.771 --> 00:18:50.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in a huge,</v>

344
00:18:50.701 --> 00:18:55.440
<v Speaker 3>like a horrific bike crash and as 19 and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a race and that essentially,</v>

345
00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.720
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

346
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.130
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have the balls after that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>went back and race to not happen here,</v>

347
00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.361
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last,</v>

348
00:19:03.361 --> 00:19:04.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight teeth.</v>

349
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.583
<v Speaker 3>All of these were shattered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one was knocked out entirely and </v>

350
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was like,</v>

351
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 3>it was a bad wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

352
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.650
<v Speaker 3>I was 19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

353
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.493
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my freshman year in college and some </v>

354
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.660
<v Speaker 3>went through college basically with </v>
<v Speaker 3>plastic teeth in my mouth as I was going</v>

355
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.330
<v Speaker 3>through essentially reconstructive </v>
<v Speaker 3>dental work,</v>

356
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:25.643
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it made me really think twice about </v>

357
00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:30.360
<v Speaker 3>being a professional athlete or pursuing</v>
<v Speaker 3>cycling.</v>

358
00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:35.361
<v Speaker 3>And I came back to it the following year</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as you know,</v>

359
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.060
<v Speaker 3>in any sort of competitive realm in </v>
<v Speaker 3>sport,</v>

360
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 3>you can't be thinking about whether or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not you're going to get injured.</v>

361
00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.730
<v Speaker 3>You can't be thinking about what those </v>
<v Speaker 3>risks are.</v>

362
00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:45.564
<v Speaker 3>You have to be fully committed or you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to lose or you're going to get </v>

363
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:49.104
<v Speaker 3>dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

364
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.150
<v Speaker 3>and I found myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

365
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.580
<v Speaker 3>not following the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll close enough.</v>

366
00:19:53.581 --> 00:19:55.470
<v Speaker 3>I found myself holding back on </v>
<v Speaker 3>descendants.</v>

367
00:19:55.471 --> 00:19:57.660
<v Speaker 3>I found myself like in my mind of Oh my </v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

368
00:19:57.661 --> 00:19:58.494
<v Speaker 3>what if this crash happens again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I decided to stop racing and </v>

369
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:06.130
<v Speaker 3>moved out to la.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got into the entertainment business is</v>

370
00:20:06.131 --> 00:20:09.630
<v Speaker 3>doing standup comedy originally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

371
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.810
<v Speaker 3>but cycling remained like my passion in </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

372
00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:15.630
<v Speaker 3>So it's just like my life's therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

373
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm stressed out,</v>

374
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:20.640
<v Speaker 3>I go on the bike and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I've always rode.</v>

375
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.590
<v Speaker 3>But I stopped racing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

376
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go back and do this,</v>

377
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.490
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

378
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.730
<v Speaker 3>it was a part of me where I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of go relive my,</v>

379
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.500
<v Speaker 3>my youth or the idea of how good I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly be.</v>

380
00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.530
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the bigger element was it is.</v>

381
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.220
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>compelling film and something that would</v>

382
00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:44.670
<v Speaker 3>be very interesting not for cycling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

383
00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:49.000
<v Speaker 3>people that were into cycling but into </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports and curious about,</v>

384
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:50.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug use in sport and performance </v>

385
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:53.860
<v Speaker 3>enhancing drugs and what they do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they don't do.</v>

386
00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.680
<v Speaker 1>So the first run at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had been off cycling for how long?</v>

387
00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.193
<v Speaker 3>I had been a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had still been training and writing </v>

388
00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:03.370
<v Speaker 3>and writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the first ride out at,</v>

389
00:21:03.371 --> 00:21:04.204
<v Speaker 3>I mean I like radically amped up my </v>
<v Speaker 3>training program for like six months </v>

390
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:09.874
<v Speaker 3>ahead of time because I was going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this thousand mile race through the </v>

391
00:21:12.551 --> 00:21:14.890
<v Speaker 3>French Alps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in Europe the race called,</v>

392
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.970
<v Speaker 3>called the Haute route.</v>

393
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.270
<v Speaker 1>So you get ready for this now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say clean,</v>

394
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.580
<v Speaker 1>are you taking any supplements?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Multivitamins,</v>

395
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:22.750
<v Speaker 1>do anything?</v>

396
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:27.780
<v Speaker 3>Let's say can vitamins has taken the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Korea team,</v>

397
00:21:27.781 --> 00:21:30.720
<v Speaker 3>but I was always doing protein shakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing,</v>

398
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:33.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

399
00:21:33.421 --> 00:21:37.020
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of recovery drinks and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

400
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.880
<v Speaker 3>essentially training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

401
00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:39.743
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting my blood monitored and eating </v>

402
00:21:41.851 --> 00:21:43.900
<v Speaker 3>super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super healthy and you know,</v>

403
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:49.020
<v Speaker 3>essentially training is as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as scientifically as I could,</v>

404
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.063
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without using any sort of illegal </v>

405
00:21:53.491 --> 00:21:54.324
<v Speaker 3>substances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what kind of results did you get </v>

406
00:21:57.271 --> 00:22:01.200
<v Speaker 3>the first race?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got 14 out of 440 guys.</v>

407
00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.760
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty good.</v>

408
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.460
<v Speaker 3>I was destroyed after it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was pretty good.</v>

409
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.040
<v Speaker 1>So then the race is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long after that do you start doping?</v>

410
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six months.</v>

411
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.700
<v Speaker 3>So you wait six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six months.</v>

412
00:22:14.701 --> 00:22:15.534
<v Speaker 3>I wait six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you training at all during the </v>

413
00:22:16.651 --> 00:22:17.500
<v Speaker 3>interview?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just really.</v>

414
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm training,</v>

415
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.393
<v Speaker 3>but I'm filming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm filming interviews because I was </v>

416
00:22:22.561 --> 00:22:26.130
<v Speaker 3>filming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably had 50,</v>

417
00:22:26.131 --> 00:22:26.964
<v Speaker 3>60 interviews that never made it into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the film because the film took this </v>

418
00:22:30.541 --> 00:22:31.374
<v Speaker 3>pivot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you thought about releasing those </v>

419
00:22:33.181 --> 00:22:36.620
<v Speaker 3>in some way or something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

420
00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:37.530
<v Speaker 3>I've thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

421
00:22:37.531 --> 00:22:38.364
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Netflix technically would have the </v>

422
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.310
<v Speaker 3>rights to that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

423
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.350
<v Speaker 3>at least the first right to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

424
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.091
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

425
00:22:45.091 --> 00:22:48.210
<v Speaker 3>perhaps I would do like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a side series.</v>

426
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.103
<v Speaker 3>I'm behind decorous right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you roll out all these various </v>

427
00:22:53.161 --> 00:22:55.500
<v Speaker 3>interviews because I interviewed so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting people.</v>

428
00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was so compelled by the end of</v>

429
00:22:57.741 --> 00:22:58.011
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

430
00:22:58.011 --> 00:22:59.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could have been a series,</v>

431
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.190
<v Speaker 1>I could have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have kept going with it.</v>

432
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so six months after then you,</v>

433
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.130
<v Speaker 1>you get back together with Gregory.</v>

434
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I get that exactly.</v>

435
00:23:09.541 --> 00:23:14.541
<v Speaker 3>So I get back to Greg Gregory and in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>film you see this skype call and um,</v>

436
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.640
<v Speaker 3>so in a creative filmmaking process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>editorially,</v>

437
00:23:20.641 --> 00:23:22.860
<v Speaker 3>you're always faced with decisions of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

438
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.113
<v Speaker 3>do I spend 10 minutes of this film on </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these emails back and forth to </v>

439
00:23:28.351 --> 00:23:31.500
<v Speaker 3>Gregory before we see him on skype?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

440
00:23:31.501 --> 00:23:33.960
<v Speaker 3>that's not as dynamic is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

441
00:23:33.961 --> 00:23:35.280
<v Speaker 3>you see I'm on skype.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

442
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:36.520
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

443
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.353
<v Speaker 3>that very first call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the very first time I had had </v>

444
00:23:39.661 --> 00:23:40.494
<v Speaker 3>him on skype and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was the first time that I'd seen </v>

445
00:23:43.081 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 3>him since Oregon in July,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2014 and now on beginning</v>

446
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:51.250
<v Speaker 2>my protocol and there he is shirtless </v>
<v Speaker 2>and willing to help me.</v>

447
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:56.830
<v Speaker 2>And at almost that very moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this German television,</v>

448
00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 2>a show comes out like a 60 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece.</v>

449
00:24:01.221 --> 00:24:02.054
<v Speaker 2>I'm called a ard as the station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this German investigative reporter </v>

450
00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Hio separate who unbenounced to me at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

451
00:24:10.261 --> 00:24:11.094
<v Speaker 2>It had been following the story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially the possibility of Russia </v>

452
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:18.920
<v Speaker 2>having a state sponsored doping program </v>
<v Speaker 2>had already interviewed Gregory.</v>

453
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.460
<v Speaker 2>And he puts together this like 30 minute</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive,</v>

454
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:23.294
<v Speaker 2>like 60 minutes show alleging that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia has a state sponsored doping </v>

455
00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:27.674
<v Speaker 2>program and that he's working with these</v>
<v Speaker 2>two whistleblowers that basically fled </v>

456
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Russia to go work with him in Germany </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tell their story.</v>

457
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.890
<v Speaker 2>And these two whistleblowers and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>like enemies of the state.</v>

458
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.060
<v Speaker 2>And they're worried about their lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's threats to their lives.</v>

459
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.373
<v Speaker 2>And they essentially start bringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward information about a state </v>

460
00:24:49.161 --> 00:24:50.060
<v Speaker 2>sponsor program.</v>

461
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:55.630
<v Speaker 2>And the information is so compelling </v>
<v Speaker 2>that water,</v>

462
00:24:56.121 --> 00:24:56.954
<v Speaker 2>the world antidoping agency launches and</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation into the claims behind </v>

463
00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:06.350
<v Speaker 2>this German television show and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a backstory to that,</v>

464
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.633
<v Speaker 2>which is the water had had this </v>
<v Speaker 2>information for four years and they sat </v>

465
00:25:12.981 --> 00:25:17.570
<v Speaker 2>on it because they're essentially embed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the IOC and the Olympics.</v>

466
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.793
<v Speaker 2>So the only reason why they finally </v>
<v Speaker 2>acted on this information out of Russia </v>

467
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:23.023
<v Speaker 2>was they were forced to because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>now in public and this German show had </v>

468
00:25:28.191 --> 00:25:29.024
<v Speaker 2>done kind of the equivalent of putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>it on the front page of a New York </v>

469
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they had to take action.</v>

470
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:34.933
<v Speaker 2>So water launches this investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's now January 2015 and I'm just </v>

471
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.910
<v Speaker 2>working with Gregory and Gregory shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

472
00:25:43.911 --> 00:25:44.571
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

473
00:25:44.571 --> 00:25:46.940
<v Speaker 2>have you seen this television show on </v>
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>

474
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.360
<v Speaker 2>And at the time I hadn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've watched this show.</v>

475
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.340
<v Speaker 2>And there it is.</v>

476
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.433
<v Speaker 2>Areas being alleged as essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who was doping all the Russian </v>

477
00:25:58.011 --> 00:25:58.844
<v Speaker 2>athletes that he knows everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's athletes on camera saying that </v>

478
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Dr [inaudible] is the guy you go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

479
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.023
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was a major pivot point in the </v>

480
00:26:10.941 --> 00:26:14.750
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for me at the time,</v>

481
00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.170
<v Speaker 2>I made a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

482
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>succinct decision which was I'm going to</v>

483
00:26:19.971 --> 00:26:23.000
<v Speaker 2>continue behind the scenes to follow </v>
<v Speaker 2>this story,</v>

484
00:26:23.001 --> 00:26:25.240
<v Speaker 2>this investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't know where it was going</v>

485
00:26:25.241 --> 00:26:27.530
<v Speaker 2>to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the meantime,</v>

486
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:31.550
<v Speaker 2>I have gregory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Moscow scientist,</v>

487
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:36.850
<v Speaker 2>he's helping me to avoid detection and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the movie that I set out to me.</v>

488
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:42.020
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm going to stick on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>journey wall wall,</v>

489
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.153
<v Speaker 2>doubling down on the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story should this side of the story </v>

490
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:52.340
<v Speaker 2>ended up truly being something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is essentially a year.</v>

491
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:58.730
<v Speaker 2>And so he's doping me this entire year </v>
<v Speaker 2>while he's under investigation wall.</v>

492
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm literally going to guys like Dick </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pound,</v>

493
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.420
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who founded water and Richard Mclaren,</v>

494
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:07.283
<v Speaker 2>who's investigating him and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the guys within water and different </v>

495
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.140
<v Speaker 2>guys in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in global anti-doping.</v>

496
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.400
<v Speaker 2>And I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

497
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:15.563
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you know about this Russia </v>

498
00:27:17.231 --> 00:27:20.250
<v Speaker 2>investigation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of this proves true?</v>

499
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think Gregory [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved?</v>

500
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.773
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and none of these people that I'm </v>

501
00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:29.400
<v Speaker 2>interviewing know that I'm working with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gregory,</v>

502
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.263
<v Speaker 2>they have no idea that I'm doping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have no idea that I know Gregory </v>

503
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.490
<v Speaker 2>and so I'm getting these very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very candid,</v>

504
00:27:35.491 --> 00:27:40.491
<v Speaker 2>honest responses and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we cut to November 2015,</v>

505
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:47.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this 335 page report breaks and it's</v>

506
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:48.624
<v Speaker 2>alleging that he's the mastermind of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>state sponsored doping program in </v>

507
00:27:52.531 --> 00:27:54.120
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

508
00:27:54.121 --> 00:27:57.810
<v Speaker 2>it's all smoke and mirrors and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>mandated to track and field.</v>

509
00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.753
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's when things got incredibly </v>

510
00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:05.940
<v Speaker 2>serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putin gets on state television.</v>

511
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge worldwide story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denies that any of this is true,</v>

512
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:16.440
<v Speaker 2>but he makes a statement stating that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of this is true,</v>

513
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.453
<v Speaker 2>that it will be the individuals that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>held accountable and that punishment </v>

514
00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:26.601
<v Speaker 2>will be absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was essentially Gregory's death</v>

515
00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:27.504
<v Speaker 2>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were skyping and we were talking </v>

516
00:28:30.511 --> 00:28:31.344
<v Speaker 2>during this entire period as this crisis</v>
<v Speaker 2>is unfolding in Russia and he's forced </v>

517
00:28:35.341 --> 00:28:38.640
<v Speaker 2>to resign from the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lab is shut down.</v>

518
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's let go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia is suspended from world track and</v>

519
00:28:42.691 --> 00:28:46.770
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gregory tells me that the KGB,</v>

520
00:28:46.771 --> 00:28:50.070
<v Speaker 2>the FSB,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have plotted a suicide,</v>

521
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a plan to make it look like he's,</v>

522
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.700
<v Speaker 2>that he's killed himself and that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to get out of Russia.</v>

523
00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.950
<v Speaker 2>And how did he know that they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>planned that?</v>

524
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.290
<v Speaker 2>So Gregory had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

525
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:06.410
<v Speaker 2>FSB clearance because he was essentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>fsp,</v>

526
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.213
<v Speaker 2>he was part of a secret operation by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia to essentially dope all of its </v>

527
00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:16.320
<v Speaker 2>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have them avoid detection,</v>

528
00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:17.760
<v Speaker 2>swap urine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

529
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.600
<v Speaker 2>And so gregory was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

530
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.453
<v Speaker 2>had high clearance and other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the fsb that liked him basically </v>

531
00:29:24.931 --> 00:29:25.764
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

532
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.610
<v Speaker 2>you got to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

533
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.310
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

534
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.410
<v Speaker 2>I got him a plane ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put them,</v>

535
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.050
<v Speaker 2>I put it on my credit card and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrives in los angeles.</v>

536
00:29:37.051 --> 00:29:38.790
<v Speaker 2>This is November,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2015 years,</v>

537
00:29:38.791 --> 00:29:41.680
<v Speaker 2>let him fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

538
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:46.740
<v Speaker 2>I am sure a to putin and the russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>ministry officials.</v>

539
00:29:46.901 --> 00:29:49.430
<v Speaker 2>This has probably been the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

540
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.650
<v Speaker 2>behind closed doors screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouting matches.</v>

541
00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to cut your head off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you allow this to happen?</v>

542
00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:57.813
<v Speaker 2>Conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he gets out of Russia five days </v>

543
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.390
<v Speaker 2>after this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

544
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.253
<v Speaker 2>335 page report breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had been working with the </v>

545
00:30:08.651 --> 00:30:09.730
<v Speaker 2>ministry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a,</v>

546
00:30:09.731 --> 00:30:11.920
<v Speaker 2>they didn't consider him a flight with </v>
<v Speaker 2>b,</v>

547
00:30:11.921 --> 00:30:12.754
<v Speaker 2>he was still going to the lab every day </v>
<v Speaker 2>to clean up the mess and see he had a </v>

548
00:30:18.371 --> 00:30:21.130
<v Speaker 2>visa to come to the United States to </v>
<v Speaker 2>lecture,</v>

549
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:24.370
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't thinking that he had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>visa at that moment.</v>

550
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.233
<v Speaker 2>They weren't viewing him as a flight </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk even though they put to fsb agents </v>

551
00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:33.340
<v Speaker 2>living in his home to guard him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

552
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.500
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was a blip,</v>

553
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.140
<v Speaker 2>was a blip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hadn't tagged.</v>

554
00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:41.900
<v Speaker 2>his passport had happened so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had this visa and he,</v>

555
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.730
<v Speaker 2>and you bought the ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't.</v>

556
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:44.583
<v Speaker 2>They knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know that he had a ticket </v>

557
00:30:45.971 --> 00:30:46.870
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

558
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he gets out and he gets out.</v>

559
00:30:50.981 --> 00:30:52.200
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

560
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.073
<v Speaker 2>there's</v>

561
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.400
<v Speaker 3>probably been endless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

562
00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:56.963
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

563
00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people getting their,</v>

564
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs lost in Russia because this guy was</v>

565
00:31:02.671 --> 00:31:05.460
<v Speaker 3>able to get out at the least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

566
00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.060
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

567
00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:11.090
<v Speaker 2>and that's at the least is a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important point because at least one guy</v>

568
00:31:11.091 --> 00:31:13.580
<v Speaker 2>wound up dead to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what,</v>

569
00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.830
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what was the circumstances like very</v>

570
00:31:15.831 --> 00:31:17.360
<v Speaker 2>suspicious circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

571
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.180
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

572
00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.013
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so gregory arrives to a los angeles and </v>

573
00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.093
<v Speaker 3>he brings with him a three hard drives </v>
<v Speaker 3>and on these hard drives essentially is </v>

574
00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:37.150
<v Speaker 3>the irrefutable evidence of essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>russia's state sponsored doping program.</v>

575
00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.460
<v Speaker 3>And this system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

576
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:45.650
<v Speaker 3>when I began to truly understand what </v>
<v Speaker 3>this was,</v>

577
00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.053
<v Speaker 3>I mean this upends all of world sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this changes whether the olympics want </v>

578
00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:57.710
<v Speaker 3>to acknowledge it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This changes all oF olympic hiStory.</v>

579
00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:02.750
<v Speaker 3>It changes the last 40 years of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>olympics Because it basically shows that</v>

580
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:08.590
<v Speaker 3>pretty much every metal ever won by </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia in olympic competition was,</v>

581
00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.093
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was one through a illicit means that </v>

582
00:32:15.561 --> 00:32:16.394
<v Speaker 3>gregory was behind a state sponsored </v>
<v Speaker 3>doping program where essentially pretty </v>

583
00:32:21.111 --> 00:32:26.111
<v Speaker 3>much every athlete on the russian </v>
<v Speaker 3>national team was a,</v>

584
00:32:26.241 --> 00:32:27.074
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an employee of the russian state and </v>

585
00:32:28.971 --> 00:32:31.870
<v Speaker 3>that Russia had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

586
00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:32.983
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went into each one of these olympic </v>

587
00:32:34.551 --> 00:32:37.550
<v Speaker 3>games and world competition cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

588
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:42.610
<v Speaker 3>to use sport as a way to assert itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>geopolitically and as a way to,</v>

589
00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 3>to show itself as a strong country.</v>

590
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.590
<v Speaker 3>And we forget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

591
00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 3>I think in the us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a,</v>

592
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:53.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean a sport is what people care about</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this planet.</v>

593
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.153
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>orwell said it best at sport is war </v>

594
00:32:58.911 --> 00:32:59.744
<v Speaker 3>without the weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at what these olympic </v>

595
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:04.640
<v Speaker 3>games are every two years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

596
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:05.474
<v Speaker 3>it's every country on planet earth </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming together under the illusion of </v>

597
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:10.933
<v Speaker 3>peace and goodwill and harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While the governments are looking at </v>

598
00:33:15.771 --> 00:33:20.120
<v Speaker 3>this as a way to assert geo political </v>
<v Speaker 3>power and strength.</v>

599
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.373
<v Speaker 3>So if you're China coming into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>olympics like they did in those beijing </v>

600
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:29.291
<v Speaker 3>olympics and they swept those beijing </v>
<v Speaker 3>olympics and from the information that I</v>

601
00:33:29.511 --> 00:33:30.344
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the essentially did the same thing that </v>

602
00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Russia did in the sochi olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're looking,</v>

603
00:33:35.001 --> 00:33:38.390
<v Speaker 3>let's say at China in those 20 2008 </v>
<v Speaker 3>beijing games,</v>

604
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:39.643
<v Speaker 3>they spend billions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world has never seen an olympic </v>

605
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:43.814
<v Speaker 3>games like those beijing games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the opening ceremonies and closing </v>

606
00:33:45.741 --> 00:33:46.490
<v Speaker 3>ceremonies.</v>

607
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:50.540
<v Speaker 3>What that was was that was China showing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world war first world power.</v>

608
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:54.110
<v Speaker 3>We can kick your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are have nukes.</v>

609
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.213
<v Speaker 3>We are a global economic force and look </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we can do world because the entire </v>

610
00:34:00.351 --> 00:34:04.700
<v Speaker 3>world's eyes are on the olympics being </v>
<v Speaker 3>watched by billions of people.</v>

611
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.080
<v Speaker 3>You think thAt china's a great country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look what we're able to do.</v>

612
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:10.303
<v Speaker 3>And on top of that they needed to win </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's not enough just to show </v>

613
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:20.390
<v Speaker 3>this infrastructure they can build.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also we can,</v>

614
00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:21.224
<v Speaker 3>when we are superior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is what countries have been </v>

615
00:34:24.321 --> 00:34:26.870
<v Speaker 3>doing for the last 40 years in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>olympic games,</v>

616
00:34:26.871 --> 00:34:31.871
<v Speaker 3>just like hitler did in the 1936 games </v>
<v Speaker 3>that helped unify his power and help,</v>

617
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring Germany together.</v>

618
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:35.923
<v Speaker 3>And so this is what the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>olympic games have been shrouding under </v>

619
00:34:40.101 --> 00:34:44.540
<v Speaker 3>this mask of peace and goodwill and </v>
<v Speaker 3>unity and handshakes.</v>

620
00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:45.703
<v Speaker 3>This is countries around the world going</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and showing the rest of the world </v>

621
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:52.620
<v Speaker 3>their strength and power and Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

622
00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:55.790
<v Speaker 3>certaInly has viewed that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

623
00:34:56.090 --> 00:35:00.620
<v Speaker 3>every two years as a platform for Russia</v>
<v Speaker 3>to assert itself geopolitically.</v>

624
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.900
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in so doing,</v>

625
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.520
<v Speaker 3>they put together a state sponsored </v>
<v Speaker 3>doping program to help you know,</v>

626
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:10.890
<v Speaker 3>a advance russia's geopolitical goals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

627
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.033
<v Speaker 3>and show itself as a world power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any evidence that china's done </v>

628
00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:15.944
<v Speaker 3>the same thing or it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>speculation that they've got a state </v>

629
00:35:18.381 --> 00:35:20.540
<v Speaker 3>sponsored program as well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

630
00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:21.573
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I personally don't have the evidence </v>

631
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:28.030
<v Speaker 3>according to gregory and I have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason to doubt gregory,</v>

632
00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:28.903
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in light of everything that </v>

633
00:35:30.081 --> 00:35:32.780
<v Speaker 3>he has said has proven to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

634
00:35:32.781 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 3>he was at the 2008 patient games and </v>
<v Speaker 3>according to him,</v>

635
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 3>what would happen different than what </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia did in sochi,</v>

636
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:42.264
<v Speaker 3>but according to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would happen is that the chinese </v>

637
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:44.394
<v Speaker 3>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you look at the metal count out </v>

638
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 3>of beijing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>China swept,</v>

639
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:52.110
<v Speaker 3>swept those olympics just like Russia </v>
<v Speaker 3>swept their own olympics.</v>

640
00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

641
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.350
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

642
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:56.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>accordIng to gregory,</v>

643
00:35:56.491 --> 00:35:57.440
<v Speaker 3>what the russian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

644
00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.770
<v Speaker 3>what the chinese athletes would do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would show up for their,</v>

645
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:02.993
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their doping test and certain </v>

646
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.920
<v Speaker 3>collectors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning when the athlete shows up,</v>

647
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.560
<v Speaker 3>they have to be chaperoned and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically chaperoned.</v>

648
00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Nat chaperone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watches them pee into,</v>

649
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:16.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a contaIner.</v>

650
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:20.610
<v Speaker 3>And then they put the p in these two </v>
<v Speaker 3>different bottles.</v>

651
00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:23.400
<v Speaker 3>And this is the whole safeguard system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>According to gregory,</v>

652
00:36:23.401 --> 00:36:24.234
<v Speaker 3>what was happening in China is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the collectors were actually chinese </v>

653
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:33.420
<v Speaker 3>government agents essentially like </v>
<v Speaker 3>secret service for China.</v>

654
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:38.370
<v Speaker 3>And that the athlete would go in to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>his urine collected and this agent would</v>

655
00:36:38.371 --> 00:36:41.910
<v Speaker 3>give the athlete a bag of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of his clean urine,</v>

656
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:47.010
<v Speaker 3>and the athlete would put that urine </v>
<v Speaker 3>under his armpit and then collect,</v>

657
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.140
<v Speaker 3>collect the urine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

658
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:50.463
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's apparently what China did in </v>

659
00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:53.544
<v Speaker 3>the beijing olympics according to </v>
<v Speaker 3>gregory and he had knowledge of a hat </v>

660
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.000
<v Speaker 3>and that is where the idea started to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come,</v>

661
00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.293
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for how to put into place what they </v>

662
00:37:03.361 --> 00:37:06.070
<v Speaker 3>ultimately did in sochi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

663
00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:09.090
<v Speaker 3>where they swapped out clean urine for </v>
<v Speaker 3>dirty urine.</v>

664
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.650
<v Speaker 3>But they did it in a much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated matter because of the camera</v>

665
00:37:13.651 --> 00:37:14.484
<v Speaker 3>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of all the technology that was </v>

666
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:17.460
<v Speaker 3>in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

667
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:20.130
<v Speaker 3>Russia took it to a whole other step </v>
<v Speaker 3>further.</v>

668
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.113
<v Speaker 1>Those lids that they had used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those supposedly unbreakable lids or </v>

669
00:37:24.561 --> 00:37:26.300
<v Speaker 1>anon removable lids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

670
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had they been in pLace before sochi?</v>

671
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.030
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

672
00:37:30.031 --> 00:37:30.750
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

673
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:31.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

674
00:37:31.891 --> 00:37:35.100
<v Speaker 3>whAt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're talking about is in the um,</v>

675
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:40.230
<v Speaker 3>in when an athlete reports for a drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>test in sport,</v>

676
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pinned a one like,</v>

677
00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:43.801
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

678
00:37:43.801 --> 00:37:44.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

679
00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cup and then they separate their urine</v>

680
00:37:47.761 --> 00:37:49.650
<v Speaker 3>between an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sample and a b sample.</v>

681
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:51.143
<v Speaker 3>And These two bottles are made by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>swiss company called berlinger and they </v>

682
00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:58.350
<v Speaker 3>are kind of the fort knox of urine </v>
<v Speaker 3>collection bottles.</v>

683
00:37:58.351 --> 00:37:59.184
<v Speaker 3>They've created this tamper proof top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seals like it's a vault aNd this has </v>

684
00:38:04.021 --> 00:38:04.854
<v Speaker 3>been considered the global standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is right there we can see on </v>

685
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.070
<v Speaker 3>the screen and these are considered the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

686
00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:16.100
<v Speaker 3>the global standard in world sport and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're unpenetrable.</v>

687
00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:18.930
<v Speaker 3>And if you see here on these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on these bottles,</v>

688
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.960
<v Speaker 3>the a be a sample is allowed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>opened by the lab,</v>

689
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have the machine,</v>

690
00:38:26.581 --> 00:38:30.660
<v Speaker 3>it's this special machine and it cracks </v>
<v Speaker 3>the top and then you can test it.</v>

691
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 3>The beast sample is sealed forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only to be opened</v>

692
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.143
<v Speaker 2>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sample turns positive and that b </v>

693
00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 2>sample was put into longterm storage for</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years.</v>

694
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Basically should testing evolve or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever or something come up,</v>

695
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:47.943
<v Speaker 2>they have this b sample to go back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>test that athlete urine of up to 10 </v>

696
00:38:51.821 --> 00:38:55.000
<v Speaker 2>years in the olympic vault in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>olympic,</v>

697
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

698
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.750
<v Speaker 2>labs where they've whole holding these </v>
<v Speaker 2>samples.</v>

699
00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:04.740
<v Speaker 2>So basically what Russia figured out is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they needed to swap out both the,</v>

700
00:39:05.171 --> 00:39:06.004
<v Speaker 2>a urine and the urine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in order to get into those be </v>

701
00:39:09.731 --> 00:39:12.940
<v Speaker 2>samples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to break into these bottles.</v>

702
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:14.163
<v Speaker 2>So through a couple of years of testing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fsb got involved in a program </v>

703
00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.120
<v Speaker 2>where they figured out using these </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools,</v>

704
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:26.080
<v Speaker 2>how to essentially break into these </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottles undetected,</v>

705
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.930
<v Speaker 2>dump out the dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dirty piss,</v>

706
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.930
<v Speaker 2>put in clean piss and reseal these </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottles.</v>

707
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.063
<v Speaker 2>So both the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sample would be negative because that </v>

708
00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:35.944
<v Speaker 2>was swapped and the beast sample had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been swapped and it was in longterm </v>

709
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:39.730
<v Speaker 2>storage.</v>

710
00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:40.563
<v Speaker 2>So be a sample because if so if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>removed the top of the bc and they swap </v>

711
00:39:44.471 --> 00:39:45.304
<v Speaker 2>that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they do with the sample while </v>

712
00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:47.600
<v Speaker 2>the a sample they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

713
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:52.770
<v Speaker 2>they were legally able to open it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>teSting but it was supposed to be tested</v>

714
00:39:53.621 --> 00:39:54.730
<v Speaker 2>under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

715
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.690
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of other people watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what they would do,</v>

716
00:39:58.691 --> 00:40:01.390
<v Speaker 2>and thIs gets into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into detail into the film,</v>

717
00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:06.280
<v Speaker 2>is that they would take basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sample that was already in this room.</v>

718
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:11.080
<v Speaker 2>They'd smuggle in the samPle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sample shouldn't even been there and</v>

719
00:40:11.081 --> 00:40:15.220
<v Speaker 2>they would crack open the a sample,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they were allowed to crack open for</v>

720
00:40:15.221 --> 00:40:17.440
<v Speaker 2>testing but they would do this at like </v>
<v Speaker 2>2:00</v>

721
00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:22.270
<v Speaker 2>in the morning and they would bRing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sample and the sample through a secret</v>

722
00:40:22.271 --> 00:40:23.104
<v Speaker 2>hole in the wall of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were there or were they were allocating </v>

723
00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:28.060
<v Speaker 2>the urine.</v>

724
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:28.893
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the holes in the wall and they </v>

725
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:33.550
<v Speaker 2>would pass these bottles through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hole in the wall.</v>

726
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:37.690
<v Speaker 2>And once they got through the hole in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wall on the other side,</v>

727
00:40:37.691 --> 00:40:38.524
<v Speaker 2>in this makeshift room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a looked like a storage </v>

728
00:40:41.171 --> 00:40:42.004
<v Speaker 2>closet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were no cameras in there and </v>

729
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:44.740
<v Speaker 2>they had designed the whole lab for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

730
00:40:44.741 --> 00:40:45.574
<v Speaker 2>I mean this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of thinking that went </v>

731
00:40:47.231 --> 00:40:48.610
<v Speaker 2>into this blueprint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

732
00:40:48.611 --> 00:40:50.740
<v Speaker 2>gregory showed me the blueprints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this was,</v>

733
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.590
<v Speaker 2>this was thought out years ahead of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to do this.</v>

734
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:54.993
<v Speaker 2>And they would swap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd bring the bottles into the </v>

735
00:40:56.841 --> 00:40:57.674
<v Speaker 2>storage room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would dump out the dirty urine of </v>

736
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:02.134
<v Speaker 2>the a sample because that was open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would put in the clean urine at </v>

737
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:09.100
<v Speaker 2>that same athlete that they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>collected about a year earlier.</v>

738
00:41:09.101 --> 00:41:09.934
<v Speaker 2>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took all the athletes off the drug </v>

739
00:41:11.261 --> 00:41:13.210
<v Speaker 2>and what had them collect clean samples.</v>

740
00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:18.810
<v Speaker 2>And Then the b bottle would go out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>secretly to a kgb building,</v>

741
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:20.883
<v Speaker 2>an fsb building that was about 100 yards</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the street from where the lab </v>

742
00:41:23.741 --> 00:41:24.820
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a secret building.</v>

743
00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.330
<v Speaker 2>And there they would open up this b </v>
<v Speaker 2>sample.</v>

744
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.860
<v Speaker 2>They would dump out the urine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it back to gregory sitting in this</v>

745
00:41:32.861 --> 00:41:33.694
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gregory would then put that same clean </v>

746
00:41:35.331 --> 00:41:38.660
<v Speaker 2>urine into that be bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reseal the be bottle,</v>

747
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:40.850
<v Speaker 2>put the tuba holes through the hole in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lab.</v>

748
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:43.670
<v Speaker 2>They then take the sample,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smuggle it into,</v>

749
00:41:43.671 --> 00:41:45.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into where it was supposed to be,</v>

750
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.690
<v Speaker 2>the longterm storage container and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the athletes says it negative.</v>

751
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.370
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what do they do in the past?</v>

752
00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.160
<v Speaker 2>If they did that in sochi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did they do in beijing?</v>

753
00:41:58.161 --> 00:42:00.200
<v Speaker 2>What do they do in all the previous </v>
<v Speaker 2>olympics also?</v>

754
00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.110
<v Speaker 2>That's where it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

755
00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:05.690
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is kinda the,</v>

756
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.553
<v Speaker 2>the lance armstrong of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you want to call a v anti-doping </v>

757
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:12.440
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evasion of it.</v>

758
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Where in the past it was always about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the science,</v>

759
00:42:16.761 --> 00:42:17.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>

760
00:42:17.631 --> 00:42:18.770
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can you take?</v>

761
00:42:18.771 --> 00:42:20.990
<v Speaker 2>What can you not take?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long will you wash out?</v>

762
00:42:20.991 --> 00:42:22.360
<v Speaker 2>How long were you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

763
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.760
<v Speaker 2>what can you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

764
00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:26.450
<v Speaker 2>and at what time would you be positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and negative?</v>

765
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:28.580
<v Speaker 2>And that goes into the weeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

766
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hgh is hard to detect after 12 hours if </v>

767
00:42:32.001 --> 00:42:35.330
<v Speaker 2>you take micro doses of epo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all these,</v>

768
00:42:35.331 --> 00:42:37.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways around it.</v>

769
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:38.563
<v Speaker 2>And they were essentially doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were doing it on a higher </v>

770
00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:46.610
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gregory and this is just again,</v>

771
00:42:46.611 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 2>the incredible to lives that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>leading his.</v>

772
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.350
<v Speaker 2>So he's the head of the anti-doping lab </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Russia.</v>

773
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.333
<v Speaker 2>So he's responsible for testing all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>russian athletes and international </v>

774
00:42:59.151 --> 00:43:00.970
<v Speaker 2>athletes coming into Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

775
00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:01.903
<v Speaker 2>for competition at the same time he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing test to catch these athletes </v>

776
00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.390
<v Speaker 2>and he develops a test called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm metabolite test.</v>

777
00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:12.603
<v Speaker 2>And what this test does is it increases </v>
<v Speaker 2>the detection window to detect steroids </v>

778
00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:18.494
<v Speaker 2>in the blood of athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So prior they could essentially detect </v>

779
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.660
<v Speaker 2>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use a about,</v>

780
00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:29.450
<v Speaker 2>it was about a six week window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something about that,</v>

781
00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:29.841
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

782
00:43:29.841 --> 00:43:32.390
<v Speaker 2>once you hadn't been taken steroids for </v>
<v Speaker 2>about six weeks,</v>

783
00:43:32.391 --> 00:43:33.224
<v Speaker 2>you weren't going to test positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He develops this test that is able to </v>

784
00:43:36.621 --> 00:43:41.000
<v Speaker 2>detect steroid use up to like seven or </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight months in the system.</v>

785
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:43.010
<v Speaker 2>and this is different types of steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

786
00:43:43.011 --> 00:43:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Because some steroids have a long life </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the body,</v>

787
00:43:46.431 --> 00:43:48.080
<v Speaker 2>they're fat soluble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

788
00:43:48.081 --> 00:43:48.914
<v Speaker 2>So he's able to determIne a to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to develop a test that the longterm </v>

789
00:43:51.621 --> 00:43:55.490
<v Speaker 2>metabolites that to basically see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you took these drugs,</v>

790
00:43:55.491 --> 00:43:56.324
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you hadn't taken them for six </v>

791
00:43:57.561 --> 00:43:58.394
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time that he develops </v>

792
00:44:00.321 --> 00:44:01.154
<v Speaker 2>this test and this has now been adopted </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a global level and specifically at </v>

793
00:44:07.101 --> 00:44:09.560
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the london olympics of 2012.</v>

794
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:10.671
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

795
00:44:10.671 --> 00:44:12.620
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't quote me on this.</v>

796
00:44:12.621 --> 00:44:16.700
<v Speaker 2>I think this test really got approved in</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 2011,</v>

797
00:44:16.701 --> 00:44:17.534
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he puts out this longterm </v>

798
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:20.803
<v Speaker 2>metabolite tests that's catching all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these athletes from all over the world </v>

799
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.640
<v Speaker 2>because now they can catch them up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

800
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:26.503
<v Speaker 2>seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He figures out the antivenom to his own </v>

801
00:44:29.991 --> 00:44:30.824
<v Speaker 2>tests and what he develops as a three </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug cocktail where he is able to </v>

802
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:40.110
<v Speaker 2>dissolve the steroids in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a solution of either vermouth,</v>

803
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.720
<v Speaker 2>martini for the women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the men,</v>

804
00:44:42.721 --> 00:44:46.650
<v Speaker 2>whiskey for the men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He would give the athletes basically</v>

805
00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:50.190
<v Speaker 2>the steroids in like a shot in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution of alcohol.</v>

806
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:51.383
<v Speaker 2>And what he figured out through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sciences that if the steroids were </v>

807
00:44:54.241 --> 00:44:57.360
<v Speaker 2>taking with alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't actually go into the blood</v>

808
00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:59.970
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would get all the benefits of the</v>

809
00:44:59.971 --> 00:45:02.580
<v Speaker 2>steroid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your body would pass it out.</v>

810
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.840
<v Speaker 2>And I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very quick time.</v>

811
00:45:03.841 --> 00:45:05.540
<v Speaker 2>And so you were undetectable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

812
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

813
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:11.880
<v Speaker 2>How did he figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's a genius.</v>

814
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.620
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

815
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:15.510
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

816
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.730
<v Speaker 2>so this guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

817
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:19.770
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

818
00:45:19.771 --> 00:45:21.010
<v Speaker 2>at one time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

819
00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:21.853
<v Speaker 2>so he's figuring out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all the russian athletes are </v>

820
00:45:24.601 --> 00:45:27.790
<v Speaker 2>basically knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

821
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.643
<v Speaker 2>they're on his system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's taken steroids while the </v>

822
00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:32.874
<v Speaker 2>other athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were doing the same thing on a </v>

823
00:45:34.171 --> 00:45:35.004
<v Speaker 2>global level or getting caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the world system is using the </v>

824
00:45:39.031 --> 00:45:42.210
<v Speaker 2>methodology the gregory developed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

825
00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

826
00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:49.310
<v Speaker 2>so this was the cat and mouse game going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on for very long time.</v>

827
00:45:49.901 --> 00:45:51.600
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

828
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:53.250
<v Speaker 2>before that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

829
00:45:53.251 --> 00:45:55.440
<v Speaker 2>it's the microdosing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the lance of it,</v>

830
00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:56.730
<v Speaker 2>it's all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

831
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.500
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you get away with it?</v>

832
00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they did for sochi is they just</v>

833
00:46:03.571 --> 00:46:04.051
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

834
00:46:04.051 --> 00:46:05.610
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screw that,</v>

835
00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to take any chances.</v>

836
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:13.560
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have our athlete dope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full tilt so they can be at their very,</v>

837
00:46:13.561 --> 00:46:18.210
<v Speaker 2>very best and they're going to be dirty </v>
<v Speaker 2>as hell,</v>

838
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.360
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to swap out their urine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no,</v>

839
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:25.110
<v Speaker 2>because in sochi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia controlled the lab,</v>

840
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.600
<v Speaker 2>they basically own the keys to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vault.</v>

841
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.010
<v Speaker 2>They were the policemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

842
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.610
<v Speaker 2>they were the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the jury and the executioner.</v>

843
00:46:32.611 --> 00:46:35.510
<v Speaker 2>They had full control and they had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>record number of goals,</v>

844
00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:36.353
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a reCord number that they won </v>

845
00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:39.960
<v Speaker 2>13 goals in sochi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>33 overall metals,</v>

846
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.810
<v Speaker 2>which was the highest of any country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

847
00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.970
<v Speaker 2>and for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for putin and Russia.</v>

848
00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when you go into,</v>

849
00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:50.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in the us and Russia is,</v>

850
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:53.370
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cold war is never really ended.</v>

851
00:46:53.371 --> 00:46:58.371
<v Speaker 2>It's the illusion of a cold war ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you're seeing is,</v>

852
00:46:58.830 --> 00:46:59.990
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

853
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.950
<v Speaker 2>a country where economically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

854
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:06.220
<v Speaker 2>it's always Been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

855
00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:09.150
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of wealth in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very small number of hands,</v>

856
00:47:09.151 --> 00:47:12.720
<v Speaker 2>but the rest of the country is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>much living in second world conditions,</v>

857
00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:13.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get out of moscow and st </v>

858
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.400
<v Speaker 2>peteRsburg and where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the main money is.</v>

859
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:21.660
<v Speaker 2>But rush on a global level is always </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to assert itself as a,</v>

860
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:24.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a world geo political power.</v>

861
00:47:24.211 --> 00:47:25.830
<v Speaker 2>They have nukes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of,</v>

862
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

863
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.460
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>

864
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:32.830
<v Speaker 3>And in the case of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of sochi,</v>

865
00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:37.890
<v Speaker 3>this was a way for essentially putin to </v>
<v Speaker 3>show like China did on a global level.</v>

866
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Look what we're able to pull off in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these olympics.</v>

867
00:47:43.271 --> 00:47:45.940
<v Speaker 3>They spent $50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion dollars on those olympics.</v>

868
00:47:45.941 --> 00:47:46.774
<v Speaker 3>Nobody had ever done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His approval rating had been on the </v>

869
00:47:49.331 --> 00:47:52.690
<v Speaker 3>decline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if he could win the olympics,</v>

870
00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:57.640
<v Speaker 3>he could unify Russia just like Germany </v>
<v Speaker 3>winning the world cup or any,</v>

871
00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:58.474
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is because this is what sports is </v>

872
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:01.930
<v Speaker 3>on a global level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>

873
00:48:01.931 --> 00:48:03.660
<v Speaker 3>the denver broncos winning the </v>
<v Speaker 3>superbowl.</v>

874
00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:07.510
<v Speaker 3>The patriots winning the super bowl and </v>
<v Speaker 3>every single person in new england shows</v>

875
00:48:07.511 --> 00:48:09.280
<v Speaker 3>up for a parade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people care,</v>

876
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:14.850
<v Speaker 3>and so the olympics were putin's way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically show the world that Russia was</v>

877
00:48:15.161 --> 00:48:17.360
<v Speaker 3>an economic power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>superpower,</v>

878
00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:20.440
<v Speaker 3>geopolitical power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if those russian athletes could win,</v>

879
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:23.260
<v Speaker 3>that's the same thing of going to war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That showing that,</v>

880
00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:24.401
<v Speaker 3>that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

881
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:29.200
<v Speaker 3>that Russia is strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the mandate was win at all costs.</v>

882
00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:30.483
<v Speaker 3>Gregory was the mastermind behind that </v>
<v Speaker 3>program and right after they win those </v>

883
00:48:34.801 --> 00:48:35.634
<v Speaker 3>sochi olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putin's approval rating sores to 95 </v>

884
00:48:38.681 --> 00:48:43.681
<v Speaker 3>percent and he uses that approval rating</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go into the Ukraine and to,</v>

885
00:48:44.791 --> 00:48:46.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to go into war with Ukraine.</v>

886
00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:49.970
<v Speaker 1>I'd never connected those together until</v>
<v Speaker 1>your documentary,</v>

887
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.983
<v Speaker 1>when you were talking about them </v>
<v Speaker 1>invading crimea instantaneously made me </v>

888
00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:57.733
<v Speaker 1>reconsider the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the impact of sports like geo </v>

889
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.600
<v Speaker 1>politically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I really didn't think about it that</v>

890
00:49:02.601 --> 00:49:07.601
<v Speaker 1>way before that movie and a after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie was what stuck with me the most.</v>

891
00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:09.043
<v Speaker 1>And one of the most disturbing things is</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the news where they were </v>

892
00:49:11.361 --> 00:49:12.194
<v Speaker 1>talking about kicking them out of Brazil</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were saying that the </v>

893
00:49:15.441 --> 00:49:19.550
<v Speaker 1>international olympic committee was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to remove all the russian athletes</v>

894
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.593
<v Speaker 1>from competing in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saw the story and I think we </v>

895
00:49:23.871 --> 00:49:25.760
<v Speaker 1>probably even talked about it on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

896
00:49:25.761 --> 00:49:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is insane.</v>

897
00:49:26.991 --> 00:49:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is unprecedented.</v>

898
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:29.503
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

899
00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:31.800
<v Speaker 3>it went away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it went away.</v>

900
00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:32.963
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what you see in the film and what's </v>

901
00:49:34.801 --> 00:49:35.634
<v Speaker 3>going on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is so upsetting in the state of </v>

902
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.273
<v Speaker 3>the world that we're in right now is his</v>
<v Speaker 3>first is in the film from this </v>

903
00:49:47.611 --> 00:49:51.270
<v Speaker 3>investigation that gets launched from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gregory,</v>

904
00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.193
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to the New York times and us </v>

905
00:49:53.551 --> 00:49:54.384
<v Speaker 3>presenting all this evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They launched this a three months </v>

906
00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:59.310
<v Speaker 3>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

907
00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:00.623
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm essentially behind the scenes kind </v>

908
00:50:02.461 --> 00:50:05.310
<v Speaker 3>of as a puppet master because gregory </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't talk.</v>

909
00:50:05.311 --> 00:50:06.144
<v Speaker 3>He's in protective custody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm the guy with his lawyers </v>

910
00:50:09.151 --> 00:50:13.470
<v Speaker 3>helping facilitate all the evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>helping to decipher all the documents.</v>

911
00:50:13.471 --> 00:50:16.650
<v Speaker 3>And we had hired on a whole team of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to do this.</v>

912
00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:21.330
<v Speaker 3>And that's that scene in the movie where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see where I'm sitting at the table,</v>

913
00:50:21.331 --> 00:50:24.210
<v Speaker 3>but the leaders of water basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

914
00:50:24.211 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 3>telling them that the easter bunny and </v>
<v Speaker 3>claus and the tooth</v>

915
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:32.150
<v Speaker 2>fairy don't exist all at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

916
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.553
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so this investigation goes on for </v>

917
00:50:35.751 --> 00:50:39.530
<v Speaker 2>two and a half months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And during this investigation,</v>

918
00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.393
<v Speaker 2>richard mclaren gets the samples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sochi samples out of the longterm </v>

919
00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:47.720
<v Speaker 2>storage from the olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ioc and luzon.</v>

920
00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:53.030
<v Speaker 2>They do forensics on these bottles and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they see the scratches on the bottles.</v>

921
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:56.390
<v Speaker 2>They see how the bottles were open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they bring in,</v>

922
00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.313
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpol and other agencies and they </v>

923
00:50:58.911 --> 00:50:59.744
<v Speaker 2>figure out the tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how Russia gets into the bottles and </v>

924
00:51:02.391 --> 00:51:04.970
<v Speaker 2>they see all the evidence on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottles.</v>

925
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.910
<v Speaker 2>And then they also find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

926
00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:08.880
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

927
00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.713
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an extraordinary amount of salt content </v>

928
00:51:11.241 --> 00:51:13.190
<v Speaker 2>in the urine because what gregory was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

929
00:51:13.191 --> 00:51:14.024
<v Speaker 2>which we don't get into the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in order to make the clean urine </v>

930
00:51:16.641 --> 00:51:19.910
<v Speaker 2>match,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he also had to adjust the gravity of the</v>

931
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:20.744
<v Speaker 2>urine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he would use human table salt to do </v>

932
00:51:22.971 --> 00:51:23.750
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

933
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:25.310
<v Speaker 2>And so when they went back and they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

934
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:26.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

935
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.260
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

936
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:29.600
<v Speaker 2>when you pee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on how hydrated you are,</v>

937
00:51:29.601 --> 00:51:31.910
<v Speaker 2>dehydrated you are what you ate that </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

938
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.133
<v Speaker 2>The gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially the weight of your urine </v>

939
00:51:34.911 --> 00:51:38.330
<v Speaker 2>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically what the content of what,</v>

940
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.450
<v Speaker 2>what's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what your body is dehydrated.</v>

941
00:51:41.451 --> 00:51:43.060
<v Speaker 2>People have dark urine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact.</v>

942
00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Is that a thicker urine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what exactly?</v>

943
00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like a heavier urine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

944
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.670
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so every athlete,</v>

945
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:52.640
<v Speaker 2>when they would give their sample part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the doping control forms,</v>

946
00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 2>they mark the specific gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially the weight,</v>

947
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.650
<v Speaker 2>the biologic of the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a part of it?</v>

948
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:58.603
<v Speaker 2>A different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the biological passport is </v>

949
00:51:59.901 --> 00:52:01.290
<v Speaker 2>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

950
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:02.930
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's measuring blood,</v>

951
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:04.183
<v Speaker 2>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're just measuring the weight of </v>

952
00:52:05.331 --> 00:52:06.200
<v Speaker 2>the urine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

953
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:07.103
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're measuring part of when they do </v>

954
00:52:09.321 --> 00:52:11.990
<v Speaker 2>the intake form on the urine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they way,</v>

955
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.800
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see a eloquent.</v>

956
00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:14.683
<v Speaker 2>And so that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that it's also another thing against </v>

957
00:52:16.701 --> 00:52:17.534
<v Speaker 2>fraud because okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so your specific gravity as I'm making </v>

958
00:52:21.051 --> 00:52:24.980
<v Speaker 2>this up point o two o.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's in that sample will.</v>

959
00:52:24.981 --> 00:52:29.720
<v Speaker 2>So if they were to go back and retest </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sample and the specific gravity was</v>

960
00:52:29.721 --> 00:52:30.554
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will they know that something was </v>

961
00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:35.290
<v Speaker 2>something was up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So part of swapping the uranus,</v>

962
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.870
<v Speaker 2>he would also adjust the specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity with table salt.</v>

963
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:43.700
<v Speaker 2>He figured out that salt salt would </v>
<v Speaker 2>would change the gravity of urine.</v>

964
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:48.230
<v Speaker 2>So because he's trying to match on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>doping control forms.</v>

965
00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:50.900
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what's in these bottles,</v>

966
00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:54.620
<v Speaker 2>he puts in table salt and when they go </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and test these samples,</v>

967
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:58.670
<v Speaker 2>sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 100 percent of the samples they test,</v>

968
00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:02.600
<v Speaker 2>they find evidence of the scratches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find evidence of tampering and they</v>

969
00:53:02.601 --> 00:53:07.601
<v Speaker 2>find the table salt in the urine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

970
00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:13.010
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is beyond a reasonable doubt</v>

971
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:18.160
<v Speaker 2>that this system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a slam dunk and it's now the rio</v>

972
00:53:18.431 --> 00:53:20.780
<v Speaker 2>olympic games and we're sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and going,</v>

973
00:53:20.781 --> 00:53:21.614
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every country in the world is calling </v>

974
00:53:23.631 --> 00:53:24.860
<v Speaker 2>for Russia to be band.</v>

975
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Every antidoping agency around the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>is calling for Russia to be band.</v>

976
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Every op-ed and New York times and paper</v>
<v Speaker 2>from around the world is saying you have</v>

977
00:53:34.231 --> 00:53:38.940
<v Speaker 2>to ban Russia from rio and thomas bach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president of the olympics,</v>

978
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:44.510
<v Speaker 2>essentially a has the aUdacity to call </v>
<v Speaker 2>these findings and all this evidence,</v>

979
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:49.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

980
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:54.830
<v Speaker 2>allegationS and does not banned Russia </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the rio olympics,</v>

981
00:53:55.831 --> 00:53:56.664
<v Speaker 2>allows them in so 281,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think number 390 athletes go to rio </v>

982
00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:02.843
<v Speaker 2>and the only athletes that are banned or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world track and field team because </v>

983
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:10.680
<v Speaker 2>he kicked the buck down to the sports </v>
<v Speaker 2>federations to decide what to do.</v>

984
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:11.963
<v Speaker 2>And because this investigation had </v>
<v Speaker 2>started in track and field track and </v>

985
00:54:15.631 --> 00:54:19.830
<v Speaker 2>field and sebastian coe upheld the ban </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the rio games.</v>

986
00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.293
<v Speaker 2>And here we are now a year and a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>months later and now the olympics are </v>

987
00:54:28.951 --> 00:54:29.784
<v Speaker 2>trying to decide whether or not to allow</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia into the next winter olympic </v>

988
00:54:33.481 --> 00:54:34.314
<v Speaker 2>games.</v>

989
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:35.873
<v Speaker 2>And not only have they essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>removed richard mclaren from this </v>

990
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:43.463
<v Speaker 2>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was able to continue the work </v>

991
00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:49.440
<v Speaker 2>through december.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in december of,</v>

992
00:54:49.441 --> 00:54:51.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of last year,</v>

993
00:54:51.001 --> 00:54:54.240
<v Speaker 2>2016,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is able to release his full findings.</v>

994
00:54:54.241 --> 00:54:55.074
<v Speaker 2>And these full findings have 1200 </v>
<v Speaker 2>documents of evidence of emails between </v>

995
00:55:00.931 --> 00:55:04.780
<v Speaker 2>gregory and the ministry emails between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

996
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:05.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and on that had been forensically </v>

997
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:10.350
<v Speaker 2>proven using medidata where these emails</v>
<v Speaker 2>were coming from,</v>

998
00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:15.060
<v Speaker 2>the spreadsheets of what every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete was taking when they were taking</v>

999
00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:16.440
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bottle collection numbers,</v>

1000
00:55:16.441 --> 00:55:17.274
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking because I've seen the </v>

1001
00:55:18.631 --> 00:55:19.500
<v Speaker 2>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1002
00:55:19.501 --> 00:55:21.330
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a graveyard,</v>

1003
00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.233
<v Speaker 2>it's mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And richard mclaren concludes that over </v>

1004
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:27.624
<v Speaker 2>1000 athletes across all sports were </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in this state sponsored doping </v>

1005
00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:38.300
<v Speaker 2>operation and the olympics until a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple weeks ago,</v>

1006
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:43.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had done essentially nothing,</v>

1007
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:45.263
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this information they have only </v>

1008
00:55:48.241 --> 00:55:49.074
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out essentially how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>push it under the carpet and pretend </v>

1009
00:55:53.791 --> 00:55:54.990
<v Speaker 2>that this didn't happen.</v>

1010
00:55:55.410 --> 00:56:00.410
<v Speaker 2>How to allow Russia into the next winter</v>
<v Speaker 2>olympics by finding loopholes.</v>

1011
00:56:00.511 --> 00:56:02.520
<v Speaker 2>By saying that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1012
00:56:02.521 --> 00:56:03.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1013
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:05.250
<v Speaker 2>that it should be the individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes,</v>

1014
00:56:05.251 --> 00:56:06.084
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1015
00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:06.933
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have an investigation going on </v>

1016
00:56:10.681 --> 00:56:12.170
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1017
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:13.013
<v Speaker 2>which is the investigation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigate richard mclaren's </v>

1018
00:56:15.361 --> 00:56:18.840
<v Speaker 2>investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was already forensically proven.</v>

1019
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Everything was already shown bond a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable doubt.</v>

1020
00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:24.170
<v Speaker 2>But to essentially figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1021
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:29.410
<v Speaker 2>whether or not they are going to allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia into the winter olympics,</v>

1022
00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:30.623
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are finally reaching out to </v>

1023
00:56:33.161 --> 00:56:35.470
<v Speaker 2>gregory even though he has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>available,</v>

1024
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:36.543
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a year and three months to speak to </v>

1025
00:56:39.701 --> 00:56:42.220
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are finally reaching out to him,</v>

1026
00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:43.493
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have him provide the same evidence </v>

1027
00:56:46.751 --> 00:56:49.290
<v Speaker 2>that he provided to richard mclaren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1028
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:50.163
<v Speaker 2>and the investigators on that team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're very reluctantly pursuing </v>

1029
00:56:54.101 --> 00:56:59.101
<v Speaker 2>this or very reluctantly even </v>
<v Speaker 2>contemplating banning Russia.</v>

1030
00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.830
<v Speaker 2>I think what we're seeing is we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing,</v>

1031
00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:04.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1032
00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I set out making a movie,</v>

1033
00:57:07.121 --> 00:57:10.000
<v Speaker 2>exploring the anti-doping system and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport and,</v>

1034
00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:15.740
<v Speaker 2>and I uncovered essentially the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>scandal in sport history,</v>

1035
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.823
<v Speaker 2>but behind that scandal is I'm seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially the geopolitics and the </v>

1036
00:57:22.541 --> 00:57:23.374
<v Speaker 2>business interests of all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations that basically stand for </v>

1037
00:57:27.461 --> 00:57:28.294
<v Speaker 2>one thing.</v>

1038
00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:33.130
<v Speaker 2>They say that they're for something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're doing everything to protect</v>

1039
00:57:33.131 --> 00:57:33.964
<v Speaker 2>their own business interests and do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exact opposite of what they say that </v>

1040
00:57:36.971 --> 00:57:37.804
<v Speaker 2>they stand for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it calls into question that if the </v>

1041
00:57:40.961 --> 00:57:43.450
<v Speaker 2>olympics are up there going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play clean,</v>

1042
00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.310
<v Speaker 2>be true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be fair,</v>

1043
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.350
<v Speaker 2>don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Play by the rules,</v>

1044
00:57:47.351 --> 00:57:49.810
<v Speaker 2>come into this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to these competitions,</v>

1045
00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:50.953
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1046
00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:51.751
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1047
00:57:51.751 --> 00:57:56.751
<v Speaker 2>and respect fellow athletes and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're presented with a scandal on epic</v>

1048
00:57:57.401 --> 00:57:58.234
<v Speaker 2>proportions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a scandal that changes its entire </v>

1049
00:58:00.821 --> 00:58:05.821
<v Speaker 2>history that has been forensically </v>
<v Speaker 2>proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</v>

1050
00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:06.993
<v Speaker 2>And then they don't uphold their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules and they don't act or have a </v>

1051
00:58:10.031 --> 00:58:11.800
<v Speaker 2>punishment for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1052
00:58:11.801 --> 00:58:13.930
<v Speaker 2>you have to ask what's the point of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>olympics?</v>

1053
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Why even had the olympics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1054
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:17.134
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why should any athlete on planet earth </v>

1055
00:58:19.151 --> 00:58:19.984
<v Speaker 2>who is competing cleanly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's training their whole lives to go </v>

1056
00:58:22.631 --> 00:58:23.464
<v Speaker 2>into these games with the belief that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are on at least a level playing </v>

1057
00:58:27.731 --> 00:58:29.380
<v Speaker 2>field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1058
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.550
<v Speaker 2>theoretically.</v>

1059
00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:31.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have the organization </v>

1060
00:58:33.881 --> 00:58:38.800
<v Speaker 2>itself not protecting the rights of </v>
<v Speaker 2>clean athletes.</v>

1061
00:58:38.801 --> 00:58:41.080
<v Speaker 2>You have to call into question why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

1062
00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:43.090
<v Speaker 2>why have the olympics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1063
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:44.980
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the point of it if,</v>

1064
00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:48.050
<v Speaker 2>if this kind of behavior is allowed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1065
00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:51.070
<v Speaker 2>and it's an punishable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think is going on?</v>

1066
00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:53.283
<v Speaker 2>I think that you have billions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>billions and billions of dollars at </v>

1067
00:58:56.801 --> 00:58:58.620

<v Speaker 2>scope and scale and an organization that</v>

1095
01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:24.314
<v Speaker 2>is basically like unable to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to act in any sort of ethical or moral </v>

1096
01:00:30.681 --> 01:00:31.514
<v Speaker 2>capacity to implement any sort of </v>

<v Speaker 2>from them.</v>

1103

<v Speaker 2>That's how I see it.</v>

1106
01:01:13.281 --> 01:01:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that he's provided a,</v>

1113
01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:45.580
<v Speaker 2>the ios sees lack of interest in doing </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his opinion on russia's cover up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>responsibility for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1117
01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.430
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've denied that this ever happened.</v>

1118
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:06.260
<v Speaker 2>They're continuing to blame gregory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is like a solo act.</v>

1119
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:10.520
<v Speaker 2>How could this man have pulled off this </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

1120
01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:12.970
<v Speaker 2>this huge elaborate system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1121
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:16.100
<v Speaker 2>by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in so doing,</v>

1122
01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 2>after the New York times op ed Russia </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues</v>

1123
01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:24.000
<v Speaker 3>an arrest warrant for gregory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1124
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:28.230
<v Speaker 3>and there's already been criminal </v>
<v Speaker 3>charges against him in Russia.</v>

1125
01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:31.860
<v Speaker 3>they've seized all of his property and </v>
<v Speaker 3>assets in Russia.</v>

1126
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:35.330
<v Speaker 3>They've taken a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the process of taking a,</v>

1127
01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.460
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1128
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:37.303
<v Speaker 3>a home that he bought for his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to take his wife's </v>

1129
01:02:40.261 --> 01:02:41.094
<v Speaker 3>property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took his dacha and this is all a </v>

1130
01:02:43.651 --> 01:02:44.484
<v Speaker 3>man who was working for the russian </v>
<v Speaker 3>ministry who had the backbone to become </v>

1131
01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:55.190
<v Speaker 3>a whistleblower and we're still in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>cycle of fake news and denial and I,</v>

1132
01:02:55.541 --> 01:02:59.690
<v Speaker 3>and I'm witnessing this on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a daily basis and it's a,</v>

1133
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:01.133
<v Speaker 3>and it's unbelievable because when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this story and then you draw a </v>

1134
01:03:06.661 --> 01:03:11.661
<v Speaker 3>line which is so easy to draw onto the </v>
<v Speaker 3>current us political climate and what is</v>

1135
01:03:12.901 --> 01:03:15.450
<v Speaker 3>going on with russian meddling in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>election.</v>

1136
01:03:15.451 --> 01:03:16.284
<v Speaker 3>You go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1137
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.273
<v Speaker 3>if Russia was willing to do tHis for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last 40 years and we have all the </v>

1138
01:03:20.911 --> 01:03:21.744
<v Speaker 3>evidence now that they actually did this</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have denied it and continue to </v>

1139
01:03:25.831 --> 01:03:28.140
<v Speaker 3>deny it and don't take any </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

1140
01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.153
<v Speaker 3>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody who is who is spoke out against </v>

1141
01:03:31.801 --> 01:03:36.780
<v Speaker 3>them ends up dead or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they end up in jail or they end up,</v>

1142
01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:38.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a fake news cycle.</v>

1143
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.680
<v Speaker 3>I think it's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1144
01:03:40.681 --> 01:03:41.514
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there can be a straighten </v>

1145
01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:44.610
<v Speaker 3>analogy into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1146
01:03:44.611 --> 01:03:46.980
<v Speaker 3>if there's any question as to whether or</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1147
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:48.241
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

1148
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:53.241
<v Speaker 3>our election was meddled with or whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not Russia is able to,</v>

1149
01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to assert its power geo politically.</v>

1150
01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.380
<v Speaker 3>I think this film answers that question </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'm hoping that,</v>

1151
01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.633
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that our country is gonna wake up and </v>

1152
01:04:04.621 --> 01:04:04.981
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1153
01:04:04.981 --> 01:04:08.010
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to tolerate this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not acceptable.</v>

1154
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:12.510
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to allow a foreign power</v>
<v Speaker 3>to metal into,</v>

1155
01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:13.873
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into our election process or into the </v>

1156
01:04:17.341 --> 01:04:19.440
<v Speaker 3>potential leadership of this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1157
01:04:19.441 --> 01:04:20.274
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uH,</v>

1158
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.293
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty scary when you think of the </v>

1159
01:04:22.681 --> 01:04:23.514
<v Speaker 3>bigger implications of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what this scandal is an was on a </v>

1160
01:04:29.371 --> 01:04:32.450
<v Speaker 3>global level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then looking at what that means,</v>

1161
01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:33.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even for America.</v>

1162
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.843
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially highlighting the </v>

1163
01:04:35.511 --> 01:04:36.344
<v Speaker 1>intentions and what the russians are </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to do a in sport that the </v>

1164
01:04:41.361 --> 01:04:42.194
<v Speaker 1>evidence though of doping is so far and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the evidence that we have so far </v>

1165
01:04:46.701 --> 01:04:48.380
<v Speaker 1>about election tampering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1166
01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.393
<v Speaker 1>We have evidence of election tampering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you're telling me is just so </v>

1167
01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:54.163
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what your documentary shows is so </v>

1168
01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:02.720
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously undeniable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just stunning that they're allowing</v>

1169
01:05:02.721 --> 01:05:04.100
<v Speaker 1>the russians to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1170
01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:04.934
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really scary when you really think </v>

1171
01:05:06.681 --> 01:05:07.880
<v Speaker 1>about it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning like what is,</v>

1172
01:05:07.881 --> 01:05:09.200
<v Speaker 1>are they being threatened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1173
01:05:09.201 --> 01:05:11.630
<v Speaker 1>what is it just a simply a money thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're saying?</v>

1174
01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:12.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean when we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of athletes and </v>

1175
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.213
<v Speaker 1>over who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was recently a couple of </v>

1176
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:25.290
<v Speaker 1>russian wrestlers had their metals taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>away after the fact because they had new</v>

1177
01:05:27.461 --> 01:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>detection methods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was from,</v>

1178
01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I want to say 2008 or 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1179
01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:35.043
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1180
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:39.420
<v Speaker 2>They're finding a lot of positives in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2012,</v>

1181
01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.750
<v Speaker 2>2008.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a little bit harder because of</v>

1182
01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:47.010
<v Speaker 2>statute of limitations on the retesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>of samples and for,</v>

1183
01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:48.123
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ioc doesn't really want to go in </v>

1184
01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:50.874
<v Speaker 2>there and get all those samples to </v>
<v Speaker 2>retest and what there's been so much </v>

1185
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:56.820
<v Speaker 2>that it proves that the olympics are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fraud,</v>

1186
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
<v Speaker 1>but there's been so much in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been so many,</v>

1187
01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:02.910
<v Speaker 1>so many allegations of deception and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraud.</v>

1188
01:06:02.911 --> 01:06:04.530
<v Speaker 1>When it came to the olympics in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first place,</v>

1189
01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.010
<v Speaker 1>there's always been some brewing behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scenes,</v>

1190
01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:13.280
<v Speaker 1>but you must have been stunned in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of making this documentary about</v>

1191
01:06:14.191 --> 01:06:18.000
<v Speaker 1>one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then while thiS is happening,</v>

1192
01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:21.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just completely,</v>

1193
01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like synchronicity or something</v>

1194
01:06:26.071 --> 01:06:30.240
<v Speaker 1>like you just tapped into it at the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment that this,</v>

1195
01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:34.560
<v Speaker 1>this dream was becoming a raging river </v>
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>

1196
01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:38.210
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a weird moment because I,</v>

1197
01:06:38.211 --> 01:06:39.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1198
01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:40.940
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like Russia,</v>

1199

<v Speaker 2>have tons of Russia to Russia.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've really day guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

1201
01:06:46.371 --> 01:06:46.971
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1202
01:06:46.971 --> 01:06:48.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's god.</v>

1203
01:06:48.031 --> 01:06:48.864
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1204
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:49.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1205
01:06:49.511 --> 01:06:52.340
<v Speaker 2>I jusT did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for anybody who's been to Russia.</v>

1206
01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:53.174
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1207
01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:54.590
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1208
01:06:54.591 --> 01:06:59.300
<v Speaker 2>moscow and st petersburg or world class </v>
<v Speaker 2>cities have so many russian friends,</v>

1209
01:06:59.301 --> 01:07:00.170
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1210
01:07:00.171 --> 01:07:02.450
<v Speaker 2>so we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're caught back up into these cold war</v>

1211
01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:06.740
<v Speaker 2>politics where essentially all of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals,</v>

1212
01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on an individual level,</v>

1213
01:07:08.751 --> 01:07:09.171
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1214
01:07:09.171 --> 01:07:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1215
01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:11.660
<v Speaker 2>I love Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love russian site.</v>

1216
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:13.670
<v Speaker 2>And russians go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love americans.</v>

1217
01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:17.420
<v Speaker 2>And yeT we're caught up into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>geopolitics like we were in the cold war</v>

1218
01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:18.553
<v Speaker 2>between our leaders and the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>workings and the ministry that we have </v>

1219
01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:24.020
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with it.</v>

1220
01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:27.890
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what was shocking to me is,</v>

1221
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:29.263
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think over the last 20 years we've </v>

1222
01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:35.480
<v Speaker 2>viewed Russia as our friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're,</v>

1223
01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:37.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are friend.</v>

1224
01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:42.820
<v Speaker 2>And what we're learning now is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>been a,</v>

1225
01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:49.680
<v Speaker 2>it's been a pretend pat on the back </v>
<v Speaker 2>while we're seeing the government,</v>

1226
01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:53.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1227
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:58.510
<v Speaker 2>do things and we're learning things of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of russian tampering and involvement,</v>

1228
01:07:59.850 --> 01:08:02.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think that americans,</v>

1229
01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:03.920
<v Speaker 2>a year or two ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't,</v>

1230
01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.510
<v Speaker 2>couldn't have imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1231
01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:06.913
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that this story that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncovered then collides with the </v>

1232
01:08:13.850 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 2>election meddling and hacking</v>

1233
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:20.510
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a russian involvement into Syria,</v>

1234
01:08:20.530 --> 01:08:21.650
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>

1235
01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

1236
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:25.700
<v Speaker 3>those things were all coming together at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same time.</v>

1237
01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:28.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't have imagined because even as</v>

1238
01:08:28.161 --> 01:08:32.690
<v Speaker 3>I uncovered this scandal and worked to </v>
<v Speaker 3>expose us,</v>

1239
01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and bring it forward,</v>

1240
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:37.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea at the time,</v>

1241
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:38.870
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there would be,</v>

1242
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>claims of that,</v>

1243
01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:43.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that our election was hacked.</v>

1244
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:47.030
<v Speaker 3>That was never even a discussion before </v>
<v Speaker 3>this cycle.</v>

1245
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:49.730
<v Speaker 3>That was never even a discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can imagine that</v>

1246
01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.590
<v Speaker 1>now when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1247
01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.380
<v Speaker 1>when this all came out and you put this </v>
<v Speaker 1>all together,</v>

1248
01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean you had to think to yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1249
01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.093
<v Speaker 1>what I've just made is going to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports is what I think your documentary </v>

1250
01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:09.850
<v Speaker 1>is the most powerful anti-doping </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary ever made.</v>

1251
01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:11.013
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I Think what you've done </v>

1252
01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:14.613
<v Speaker 1>fortuitously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to be involved in this and be </v>

1253
01:09:18.041 --> 01:09:21.640
<v Speaker 1>involved with gregory as this was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>going down.</v>

1254
01:09:22.150 --> 01:09:22.983
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really crazy how the two coincided </v>

1255
01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:28.060
<v Speaker 1>together and produced this staggering </v>
<v Speaker 1>result.</v>

1256
01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:29.373
<v Speaker 1>When you're sitting there at the table </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all these water guys and you're </v>

1257
01:09:32.290 --> 01:09:33.123
<v Speaker 1>discussing everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like they didn't want to </v>

1258
01:09:35.051 --> 01:09:36.520
<v Speaker 1>hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Almost,</v>

1259
01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:41.700
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like what you were doing was</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposing incompetence and corruption and</v>

1260
01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:42.940
<v Speaker 1>indefensible way.</v>

1261
01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.510
<v Speaker 3>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1262
01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:46.840
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1263
01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:48.383
<v Speaker 3>they didn't want to hear it because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically showed that their system had </v>

1264
01:09:54.421 --> 01:09:57.990
<v Speaker 3>been utterly ineffective at catching </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheaters.</v>

1265
01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:00.150
<v Speaker 3>It showed that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1266
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:03.660
<v Speaker 3>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it caught them with their pants down.</v>

1267
01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:09.000
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as I got into the weeds on this,</v>

1268
01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:10.223
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize that that water essentially </v>

1269
01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:13.074
<v Speaker 3>as co funded by the olympics have 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of waters budget is through the </v>

1270
01:10:17.371 --> 01:10:19.030
<v Speaker 3>olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're,</v>

1271
01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:20.580
<v Speaker 3>they're in bed together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They Are,</v>

1272
01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.370
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to do anythIng that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to hurt the other.</v>

1273
01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.240
<v Speaker 3>You also realize that there are um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many board members have water or part of</v>

1274
01:10:29.461 --> 01:10:32.580
<v Speaker 3>the ioc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like craig reedy who is the president</v>

1275
01:10:32.581 --> 01:10:37.581
<v Speaker 3>of water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is also the vice president of the ioc.</v>

1276
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.863
<v Speaker 3>Dick pound who founded water was running</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the presidency of the ioc and was a </v>

1277
01:10:44.731 --> 01:10:46.980
<v Speaker 3>vice president of the ioc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1278
01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:51.240
<v Speaker 3>so the olympIcs and water or totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>interconnected to each other.</v>

1279
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:54.180
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in my opinion,</v>

1280
01:10:54.181 --> 01:10:56.820
<v Speaker 3>or at least what what grigory has told </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1281
01:10:56.821 --> 01:11:01.821
<v Speaker 3>is that water was essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>established as an arm of the ioc to help</v>

1282
01:11:03.721 --> 01:11:04.554
<v Speaker 3>protect a sponsorship dollar and to end </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make the olympics appear as clean as </v>

1283
01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:14.170
<v Speaker 3>you as up to their</v>

1284
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:18.210
<v Speaker 2>olympic ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know what you're seeing it within</v>

1285
01:11:18.211 --> 01:11:19.044
<v Speaker 2>these organizations is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is water has no power to actually do </v>

1286
01:11:22.681 --> 01:11:23.514
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all that they can do is observe and </v>

1287
01:11:25.141 --> 01:11:26.400
<v Speaker 2>report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the case of,</v>

1288
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:28.980
<v Speaker 2>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scandal gets uncovered.</v>

1289
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:34.250
<v Speaker 2>They then do an investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they corroborate everything as truth,</v>

1290
01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:39.650
<v Speaker 2>and then they advise the olympics water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bless their heart,</v>

1291
01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:40.763
<v Speaker 2>advise the olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they should be banned Russia from </v>

1292
01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:46.650
<v Speaker 2>the summer games in rio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they should ban Russia from the</v>

1293
01:11:46.651 --> 01:11:47.484
<v Speaker 2>winter games coming up and launching </v>
<v Speaker 2>water that was waters recommendation to </v>

1294
01:11:52.111 --> 01:11:54.960
<v Speaker 2>which the olympics did not take that </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommendation.</v>

1295
01:11:55.470 --> 01:12:00.390
<v Speaker 2>And water doesn't have any power to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually enforce punishment.</v>

1296
01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:01.613
<v Speaker 2>So in case of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the case of Russia and talking to </v>

1297
01:12:04.531 --> 01:12:05.364
<v Speaker 2>people inside of water that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with this over those four years </v>

1298
01:12:09.121 --> 01:12:11.190
<v Speaker 2>as they're getting all this information </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Russia.</v>

1299
01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:14.880
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately what is going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have the budget,</v>

1300
01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:16.740
<v Speaker 2>we don't really have the money to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1301
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:17.573
<v Speaker 2>They have like a $25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollar a year global budget for </v>

1302
01:12:20.131 --> 01:12:23.130
<v Speaker 2>the entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't have the budget to do this.</v>

1303
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:24.263
<v Speaker 2>We don't have the manpower to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately we don't have the power </v>

1304
01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:30.510
<v Speaker 2>to do anything anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1305
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:32.700
<v Speaker 2>and how are we going to go take on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia?</v>

1306
01:12:32.701 --> 01:12:33.534
<v Speaker 2>So they sat on the information realizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were ultimately going to be </v>

1307
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:40.860
<v Speaker 2>powerless to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1308
01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:41.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1309
01:12:41.611 --> 01:12:46.611
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very complicated system because,</v>

1310
01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:47.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least from what I've seen is there's </v>

1311
01:12:49.021 --> 01:12:52.230
<v Speaker 2>so much politics and geopolitics around </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1312
01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:53.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1313
01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:58.190
<v Speaker 2>that keeps these operations essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1314
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:59.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ineffective and actually really doing </v>

1315
01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:05.541
<v Speaker 2>something and the anti-doping sport and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a almost becomes an ethical and moral</v>

1316
01:13:06.481 --> 01:13:08.080
<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1317
01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:08.933
<v Speaker 2>if the organizations and leaders </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves are not really trying to do </v>

1318
01:13:12.451 --> 01:13:14.000
<v Speaker 2>anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1319
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.823
<v Speaker 2>Now do you think the banning of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>track and field team was just a slap on </v>

1320
01:13:18.991 --> 01:13:22.050
<v Speaker 2>the wrist or was that a compromise that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was reached where they decided,</v>

1321
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:23.730
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to do something with,</v>

1322
01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:24.750
<v Speaker 2>what should we do?</v>

1323
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what had happened is,</v>

1324
01:13:26.461 --> 01:13:27.294
<v Speaker 2>is um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the first report was all track and </v>

1325
01:13:31.231 --> 01:13:32.064
<v Speaker 2>field mandated and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was so much evidence in </v>

1326
01:13:35.581 --> 01:13:38.040
<v Speaker 2>regards to track and field more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>other sport,</v>

1327
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:39.743
<v Speaker 2>more than other sports because there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>an individual investigation that only </v>

1328
01:13:43.771 --> 01:13:44.604
<v Speaker 2>focused on track and field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even after they released this </v>

1329
01:13:47.851 --> 01:13:50.280
<v Speaker 2>investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these athletes are saying,</v>

1330
01:13:50.281 --> 01:13:50.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1331
01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:54.650
<v Speaker 2>you got to go investigate biathlon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't go investigate bobsled.</v>

1332
01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:55.493
<v Speaker 2>You kind of go investigate speed skating</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wrestling and wrestling and soccer </v>

1333
01:13:59.341 --> 01:14:01.640
<v Speaker 2>and basketball and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1334
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:04.330
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1335
01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:08.190
<v Speaker 2>so there was so much in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the track and field investigation,</v>

1336
01:14:08.191 --> 01:14:11.320
<v Speaker 2>the athletics investigation that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>iwf,</v>

1337
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 2>the international</v>

1338
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.320
<v Speaker 3>athletics federation dealing with her </v>
<v Speaker 3>own scandal.</v>

1339
01:14:14.321 --> 01:14:15.154
<v Speaker 3>If you remember this a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the head of the iwf was arrested on </v>

1340
01:14:18.941 --> 01:14:22.510
<v Speaker 3>bribery and lou lamonte dsac and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>son.</v>

1341
01:14:22.511 --> 01:14:23.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a whole thing.</v>

1342
01:14:23.621 --> 01:14:28.621
<v Speaker 3>And sebastian coe became president and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was all this proof that the I was,</v>

1343
01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:29.613
<v Speaker 3>had been taking bribes for years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and years to cover up positive </v>

1344
01:14:32.771 --> 01:14:34.240
<v Speaker 3>results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

1345
01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:35.860
<v Speaker 3>that's a whole other story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1346
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:36.933
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the iwf upholds the ban and they </v>

1347
01:14:41.051 --> 01:14:42.500
<v Speaker 3>uphold the ban,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1348
01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:43.563
<v Speaker 3>because of gregory's evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were trying to figure out </v>

1349
01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:51.481
<v Speaker 3>whether or not to uphold the band and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was on the eve of the rio olympics and a</v>

1350
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:56.020
<v Speaker 3>gregory through the authorities that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was been working with,</v>

1351
01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:57.243
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was able to get that evidence and </v>

1352
01:14:58.481 --> 01:14:59.314
<v Speaker 3>information to the iwf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The iwf was able to see that and they </v>

1353
01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:07.690
<v Speaker 3>upheld the ban for russia's track and </v>
<v Speaker 3>field team,</v>

1354
01:15:07.691 --> 01:15:08.700
<v Speaker 3>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>

1355
01:15:08.701 --> 01:15:10.510
<v Speaker 3>is a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty big,</v>

1356
01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1357
01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:12.963
<v Speaker 3>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least it's at least it's taking a </v>

1358
01:15:14.741 --> 01:15:16.810
<v Speaker 3>stance of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1359
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:19.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of behavior is not going to be</v>

1360
01:15:19.301 --> 01:15:20.134
<v Speaker 3>tolerated.</v>

1361
01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>

1362
01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1363
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:28.330
<v Speaker 1>gregory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are courageous and bold move on his</v>

1364
01:15:28.551 --> 01:15:29.384
<v Speaker 1>part and what a sacrifice to come forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all this evidence to risk his life </v>

1365
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:35.930
<v Speaker 1>and to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1366
01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:37.910
<v Speaker 1>essentially blow the lid off all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1367

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't for him,</v>

1368
01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:40.670
<v Speaker 1>what would you have?</v>

1369
01:15:41.290 --> 01:15:42.310
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1370
01:15:42.311 --> 01:15:44.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm not able to talk to them.</v>

1374

<v Speaker 3>I'm not in contact with them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You get any messages from anyone else to</v>
<v Speaker 1>him or her or him to you?</v>

1376

<v Speaker 3>he's healthy and he's in good spirits.</v>

1383
01:16:22.891 --> 01:16:27.840

<v Speaker 3>to try to provide him a lifeline over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next years,</v>

1426
01:18:32.391 --> 01:18:33.860
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1427
01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.290
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1428
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:36.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1429
01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:39.170
<v Speaker 3>his future is so uncertain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're,</v>

1430
01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:41.450
<v Speaker 3>where's he going to live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's he going to live,</v>

1431
01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.020
<v Speaker 3>how's he going to pay his bills?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1432
01:18:43.330 --> 01:18:46.590
<v Speaker 3>and he wants to continue to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1433
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:48.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1434
01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:50.260
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1435
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:51.890
<v Speaker 3>kind of frank aboriginal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1436
01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:52.843
<v Speaker 3>a guy who had committed wrong doings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was under the orders of the </v>

1437
01:18:58.401 --> 01:18:59.234
<v Speaker 3>ministry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he has a lot of information that he </v>

1438
01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:06.590
<v Speaker 3>risked his life to bring forward to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world because he felt a,</v>

1439
01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:07.640
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1440
01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:12.320
<v Speaker 3>a huge burden to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do this and he wanted to do this.</v>

1441
01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:14.870
<v Speaker 3>This was his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was his doing.</v>

1442
01:19:14.871 --> 01:19:19.871
<v Speaker 3>And ultimately he entrusted me as his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a conduit to bring this story forward.</v>

1443
01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.113
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also gregory has attempted suicide </v>

1444
01:19:26.091 --> 01:19:27.690
<v Speaker 1>in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

1445
01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:30.650
<v Speaker 1>you're an under much less dire </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

1446
01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:31.573
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's essentially a wanted man right now </v>

1447
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.700
<v Speaker 1>with no freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

1448
01:19:37.701 --> 01:19:38.534
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in hiding and the russians most </v>

1449
01:19:42.321 --> 01:19:43.000
<v Speaker 1>likely</v>

1450
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.260
<v Speaker 3>dead absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1451
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:50.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see on this response to his New York</v>

1452
01:19:50.531 --> 01:19:53.450
<v Speaker 3>times op ed that they would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1453
01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:57.070
<v Speaker 3>there had been a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few followed the news and Russia.</v>

1454
01:19:57.071 --> 01:19:59.770
<v Speaker 3>They had already taken lots and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>action against him to,</v>

1455
01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of silence him to,</v>

1456
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:07.110
<v Speaker 3>to make him irrelevant in the film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the most moments</v>

1457
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.950
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was as a,</v>

1458
01:20:11.010 --> 01:20:13.500
<v Speaker 2>at the end of every year a putin gives </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1459
01:20:13.670 --> 01:20:16.730
<v Speaker 2>a huge press conference with hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists and,</v>

1460
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:20.310
<v Speaker 2>and the doping scandal gets brought up </v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1461
01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.320
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is just,</v>

1462
01:20:22.321 --> 01:20:23.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six months ago goes,</v>

1463
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:26.370
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who defected,</v>

1464
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:29.040
<v Speaker 2>the citizen who defected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1465
01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:32.820
<v Speaker 2>the scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember his name.</v>

1466
01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:37.170
<v Speaker 2>And you're literally going there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>

1467
01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:41.190
<v Speaker 2>putin just says he doesn't remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>gregory's name yet.</v>

1468
01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:46.020
<v Speaker 2>Yet gregory dominated russian news for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the past year.</v>

1469
01:20:46.021 --> 01:20:50.400
<v Speaker 2>He has been front page story for first </v>
<v Speaker 2>solid year.</v>

1470
01:20:50.401 --> 01:20:55.320
<v Speaker 2>This has been the single biggest scandal</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sport and in russian history,</v>

1471
01:20:55.321 --> 01:20:56.154
<v Speaker 2>he's arguably the biggest whistleblower </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the history of Russia and you have </v>

1472
01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:00.653
<v Speaker 2>the president of a country saying he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't even remember his name and what </v>

1473
01:21:04.081 --> 01:21:07.710
<v Speaker 2>that is is that's george orwell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1984.</v>

1474
01:21:07.711 --> 01:21:12.480
<v Speaker 2>That's double think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's essentially fake news.</v>

1475
01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:13.343
<v Speaker 2>That's pretending that by not </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledging you know him is not to </v>

1476
01:21:18.241 --> 01:21:22.980
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge the truth and that is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going on in this world.</v>

1477
01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:27.450
<v Speaker 2>And so here you see the potent look </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight to the camera and say,</v>

1478
01:21:27.451 --> 01:21:28.284
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember gregory's name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that would be the equivalent of </v>

1479
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:32.933
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of asking an american who's our </v>

1480
01:21:35.011 --> 01:21:37.740
<v Speaker 2>president right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and somebody saying,</v>

1481
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember his name.</v>

1482
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is that as the level of lies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and deception,</v>

1483
01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.073
<v Speaker 2>and then you see their reaction to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York times op ed by issuing an </v>

1484
01:21:49.801 --> 01:21:54.801
<v Speaker 2>arrest warrant for gregory to again </v>
<v Speaker 2>paint him as a criminal to again pretend</v>

1485
01:21:55.741 --> 01:21:57.330
<v Speaker 2>that this didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To again,</v>

1486
01:21:57.331 --> 01:21:58.164
<v Speaker 2>try to obstruct the truth and shift the </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus away from the truth and the </v>

1487
01:22:01.891 --> 01:22:02.724
<v Speaker 2>punishment and what all this evidence is</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his bravery of coming forward and </v>

1488
01:22:06.751 --> 01:22:09.960
<v Speaker 2>instead try to turn him into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a criminal.</v>

1489
01:22:10.650 --> 01:22:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

1490
01:22:11.731 --> 01:22:12.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1491
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:16.200
<v Speaker 2>it's startling and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's incredibly upsetting.</v>

1492
01:22:16.201 --> 01:22:18.660
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the reasons why we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1493
01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:19.523
<v Speaker 2>really latched onto 1984 orwell in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>film because everything that is that is </v>

1494
01:22:25.891 --> 01:22:29.040
<v Speaker 2>gregory's life was double thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everything that's going on in our,</v>

1495
01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:33.090
<v Speaker 2>in our geo political cycle and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia and putin,</v>

1496
01:22:33.091 --> 01:22:34.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's double think it's,</v>

1497
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.380
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is no longer the truth.</v>

1498
01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.273
<v Speaker 2>And you don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what news to believe or what not to </v>

1499
01:22:40.741 --> 01:22:41.210
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

1500
01:22:41.210 --> 01:22:43.110
<v Speaker 1>This is obviously very unexpected for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1501
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:43.963
<v Speaker 1>mean you set out to do one documentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>and another thing reveals itself in the </v>

1502
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:49.820
<v Speaker 1>middle of it and something incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious.</v>

1503
01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the impact of this been like for</v>

1504
01:22:52.131 --> 01:22:52.964
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the weight of this all carrying </v>

1505
01:22:54.741 --> 01:22:55.700
<v Speaker 1>this around with you?</v>

1506
01:22:58.450 --> 01:23:00.390
<v Speaker 2>It's been a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1507
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:02.583
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from november of last year when gregory </v>

1508
01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:06.243
<v Speaker 2>to</v>

1509
01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:11.550
<v Speaker 3>los angeles to us ultimately going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the New York times and um,</v>

1510
01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:14.830
<v Speaker 3>in may of last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>May,</v>

1511
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:15.551
<v Speaker 3>2016,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1512
01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:19.570
<v Speaker 3>there was about a seven month period </v>
<v Speaker 3>where myself and my,</v>

1513
01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:23.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my producing partner,</v>

1514
01:23:23.051 --> 01:23:27.250
<v Speaker 3>dan cogan with impact partners and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1515
01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:28.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my other producers,</v>

1516
01:23:28.691 --> 01:23:31.570
<v Speaker 3>jim swartz and david fiasco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1517
01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:32.613
<v Speaker 3>we had this information in the 70 </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] and we knew what this was </v>

1518
01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:37.923
<v Speaker 3>and we knew how big it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so was this period of about seven </v>

1519
01:23:41.951 --> 01:23:46.090
<v Speaker 3>months of a daily crisis navigation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1520
01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:50.020
<v Speaker 3>how do we keep this information </v>
<v Speaker 3>protected?</v>

1521
01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:53.290
<v Speaker 3>We moved our production offices three </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

1522
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.740
<v Speaker 3>We moved gregory into different safe </v>
<v Speaker 3>houses.</v>

1523
01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:56.683
<v Speaker 3>You move into production offices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could we didn't know if we were under </v>

1524
01:23:59.921 --> 01:24:00.754
<v Speaker 3>surveillance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you feel like you're under </v>

1525
01:24:01.421 --> 01:24:03.820
<v Speaker 3>surveillance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Felt like we were under surveillance?</v>

1526
01:24:03.821 --> 01:24:06.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was giving you in done indication?</v>

1527
01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:07.900
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1528
01:24:07.901 --> 01:24:09.550
<v Speaker 3>we'd see like a car.</v>

1529
01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:13.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm gregory who was not in protective </v>
<v Speaker 3>custody at the time,</v>

1530
01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:14.813
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was getting information from his people </v>

1531
01:24:16.571 --> 01:24:18.070
<v Speaker 3>out of Russia that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1532
01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.440
<v Speaker 3>that they were looking for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were,</v>

1533
01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:23.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a concerned,</v>

1534
01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1535
01:24:25.150 --> 01:24:28.900
<v Speaker 3>and we knew the gravity of what this was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

1536
01:24:28.901 --> 01:24:29.734
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1537
01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:34.880
<v Speaker 3>I underStood once I dove into this </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence with gregory how big this was,</v>

1538
01:24:35.441 --> 01:24:35.980
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1539
01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:38.190
<v Speaker 3>what this truly meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1540
01:24:38.191 --> 01:24:39.490
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1541
01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:41.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that I felt that,</v>

1542
01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:43.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia and the olympics,</v>

1543
01:24:43.271 --> 01:24:47.050
<v Speaker 3>but Russia would probably do anything at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all costs to try to,</v>

1544
01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:48.573
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not have this come forward because what </v>

1545
01:24:49.871 --> 01:24:50.704
<v Speaker 3>this meant and it meant that their </v>
<v Speaker 3>olympic games were fraud and that they </v>

1546
01:24:53.801 --> 01:24:58.801
<v Speaker 3>had been cheating global sport for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire modern history.</v>

1547
01:24:58.841 --> 01:25:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1548
01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:05.710
<v Speaker 3>and that it showed the extent to which </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia and the ministry was willing to,</v>

1549
01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:06.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1550
01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:10.210
<v Speaker 3>to tamper in international affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just sport.</v>

1551
01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.390
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understood that and gregory understood</v>

1552
01:25:13.391 --> 01:25:16.150
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it was a daily crisis management.</v>

1553
01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:17.733
<v Speaker 3>We went through about five months where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't even get them a lawyer </v>

1554
01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:22.053
<v Speaker 3>because every law firm that we would go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to would have some sort of confLict of </v>

1555
01:25:24.491 --> 01:25:26.590
<v Speaker 3>interest with russiA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1556
01:25:27.370 --> 01:25:30.130
<v Speaker 3>we uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't.</v>

1557
01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:33.010
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a really,</v>

1558
01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:35.740
<v Speaker 3>really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And during that time,</v>

1559
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:41.160
<v Speaker 3>two of his friends die within two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 3>of each other of heart attacks at age 52</v>

1560
01:25:41.621 --> 01:25:45.610
<v Speaker 3>and 59.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And nikita kumbaya of who's 52 years old</v>

1561
01:25:45.611 --> 01:25:49.210
<v Speaker 3>and he's running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had resigned from running the russian</v>

1562
01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.650
<v Speaker 3>antidoping agency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1563
01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:51.843
<v Speaker 3>so technically the russian anti-doping </v>
<v Speaker 3>agencies shouldn't be working with </v>

1564
01:25:54.551 --> 01:25:57.280
<v Speaker 3>gregory's lab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water,</v>

1565
01:25:57.281 --> 01:26:00.490
<v Speaker 3>the world antidoping agency lab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those should be two independent things.</v>

1566
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:05.770
<v Speaker 3>But these two were working together </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there was never any anti-doping.</v>

1567
01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Russia was the anti anti doping system.</v>

1568
01:26:09.170 --> 01:26:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Posing is anti-doping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So nikita is still in Russia.</v>

1569
01:26:14.031 --> 01:26:17.720
<v Speaker 3>he's been forced to resign and gregory </v>
<v Speaker 3>and him are still talking via,</v>

1570
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:19.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>via skype.</v>

1571
01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:24.890
<v Speaker 3>And nikita tells gregory that he's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go,</v>

1572
01:26:25.210 --> 01:26:29.120
<v Speaker 3>but he's writing a book and that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been in contact with David Walsh.</v>

1573
01:26:29.121 --> 01:26:33.680
<v Speaker 3>And David Walsh is the sunday times </v>
<v Speaker 3>journalists that chased armstrong for 10</v>

1574
01:26:33.681 --> 01:26:34.514
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's probably one of the most renowned </v>

1575
01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.700
<v Speaker 3>famous sports journalists in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stephen frears film,</v>

1576
01:26:40.701 --> 01:26:41.534
<v Speaker 3>the programs based on David Walsh and </v>
<v Speaker 3>send to kieta had reached out to David </v>

1577
01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Walsh and him and David Walsh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're making a plan to meet.</v>

1578
01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:51.060
<v Speaker 3>And nikita had told gregory that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1579
01:26:51.170 --> 01:26:53.540
<v Speaker 3>he was going to meet with David Walsh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gregory was like,</v>

1580
01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:54.830
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do this.</v>

1581
01:26:54.831 --> 01:26:57.080
<v Speaker 3>You're still in Russia and nikita,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still in Russia.</v>

1582
01:26:57.081 --> 01:26:59.840
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a day later,</v>

1583
01:26:59.841 --> 01:27:04.550
<v Speaker 3>nikita dies of a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was a guy who was healthy.</v>

1584
01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:07.220
<v Speaker 3>A had never had a heart problem in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

1585
01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:09.140
<v Speaker 3>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a lifelong athlete.</v>

1586
01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:10.063
<v Speaker 3>Never when he was 50 2:52,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and apparently he died over about three </v>

1587
01:27:13.611 --> 01:27:14.990
<v Speaker 3>and a half hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1588
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:19.310
<v Speaker 3>a nikita's wife was on the phone to </v>
<v Speaker 3>gregory crying.</v>

1589
01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:20.853
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is a really have any suspicion </v>

1603
01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.393
<v Speaker 3>The russian agent that offered a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently the trump dossier with the </v>

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:14.953
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1611
01:28:14.970 --> 01:28:15.803
<v Speaker 3>so this is all going on as we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>figuring out how to bring this story to </v>

1612
01:28:19.641 --> 01:28:21.230
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1613
01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:22.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1614
01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:24.170
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our government,</v>

1615
01:28:24.171 --> 01:28:27.650
<v Speaker 3>the us government gets involved with </v>
<v Speaker 3>department of justice and fbi.</v>

1616
01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:33.040
<v Speaker 3>They started investigating and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we realized that,</v>

1617
01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:34.093
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have to bring this story public </v>

1618
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:41.110
<v Speaker 3>and that it's the best way for gregory </v>
<v Speaker 3>to hopefully be protected and uh,</v>

1619
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:43.490
<v Speaker 3>and that once it's public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1620
01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:45.890
<v Speaker 3>it'll be in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1621
01:28:45.891 --> 01:28:46.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we brought,</v>

1622
01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:47.873
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the New York times with gregory and </v>

1623
01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:53.690
<v Speaker 3>sat with them for three days and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they broke the story and then,</v>

1624
01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:55.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a film,</v>

1625
01:28:55.281 --> 01:28:59.810
<v Speaker 3>we then followed that story as it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as it unraveled.</v>

1626
01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:00.673
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1627
01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:02.400
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been a,</v>

1628
01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:06.000
<v Speaker 3>it's been very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been very heavy and uh,</v>

1629
01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:11.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm very worried about gregory and also </v>
<v Speaker 3>a incredibly frustrating to see that,</v>

1630
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:16.583
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you kind of read about conspiracy </v>

1631
01:29:19.831 --> 01:29:24.570
<v Speaker 3>novels and you read about and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these guys who believed that,</v>

1632
01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:25.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1633
01:29:25.770 --> 01:29:26.760
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1634
01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:31.620
<v Speaker 3>you know of how the system works and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then getting to witness this firsthand.</v>

1635
01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:32.873
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also I think as an athlete having </v>

1636
01:29:34.621 --> 01:29:35.454
<v Speaker 3>kinda my olympic ideal of what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>olympics is being shattered and seeing </v>

1637
01:29:39.871 --> 01:29:42.780
<v Speaker 3>that this organization really has no </v>
<v Speaker 3>regard for,</v>

1638
01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:45.510
<v Speaker 3>for anything other than their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>business interests.</v>

1639
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:47.583
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time does gregory hAve in </v>

1640
01:29:51.131 --> 01:29:52.420
<v Speaker 1>protective custody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

1641
01:29:52.421 --> 01:29:57.421
<v Speaker 1>They have a determined time period where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're willing to protect him.</v>

1642
01:29:58.190 --> 01:29:59.023
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the us government is protecting </v>

1643
01:30:00.181 --> 01:30:01.014
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume,</v>

1644
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:03.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to my understanding,</v>

1645
01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1646
01:30:05.681 --> 01:30:09.190
<v Speaker 3>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that is the case.</v>

1647
01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:10.083
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1648
01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:14.710
<v Speaker 3>I am not being given a updates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1649
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:16.930
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't,</v>

1650
01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1651
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:20.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have that informatIon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1652
01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:21.633
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1653
01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:23.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1654
01:30:23.770 --> 01:30:24.603
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very optimistic that whole continue </v>

1655
01:30:27.131 --> 01:30:30.250
<v Speaker 3>to be okay and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1656
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:33.160
<v Speaker 3>and that also with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if something were to go wrong,</v>

1657
01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:37.710
<v Speaker 3>we'll be able to help him with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1658
01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:39.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through his counsel and team.</v>

1659
01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1660
01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:44.340
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly very concerning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1661
01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:46.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he,</v>

1662
01:30:46.661 --> 01:30:47.494
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he clearly understood the risks before </v>

1663
01:30:48.941 --> 01:30:50.730
<v Speaker 3>coming forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1664
01:30:50.770 --> 01:30:51.603
<v Speaker 3>we had tried to get his family out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia and they didn't understand the </v>

1665
01:30:54.551 --> 01:30:56.360
<v Speaker 3>gravity of the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1666
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:58.870
<v Speaker 3>which I'm sure they do now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1667
01:30:58.871 --> 01:31:00.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1668
01:31:00.250 --> 01:31:01.001
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1669
01:31:01.001 --> 01:31:02.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1670
01:31:02.411 --> 01:31:03.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

1671
01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:04.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1672
01:31:04.661 --> 01:31:06.160
<v Speaker 3>in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fall in love with them.</v>

1673
01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:10.270
<v Speaker 3>You just fall in love with this guy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see him for who he is,</v>

1674
01:31:10.271 --> 01:31:15.271
<v Speaker 3>whIch was incredibly important for me as</v>
<v Speaker 3>the filmmaker and as his friend was.</v>

1675
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:18.183
<v Speaker 3>I knew that it would be very easy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>paint him into an illusion of somebody </v>

1676
01:31:21.611 --> 01:31:25.390
<v Speaker 3>that he wasn't some despicable guy doped</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the russians,</v>

1677
01:31:25.810 --> 01:31:26.643
<v Speaker 3>and then what you see in the film is </v>
<v Speaker 3>truly this loving kind character who </v>

1678
01:31:33.610 --> 01:31:38.610
<v Speaker 3>essentially is caught up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a system that he helped perpetuate,</v>

1679
01:31:41.381 --> 01:31:42.214
<v Speaker 3>but he certainly didn't create and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he is ultimately an employee of the </v>

1680
01:31:46.511 --> 01:31:48.880
<v Speaker 3>russian government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1681
01:31:48.881 --> 01:31:51.760
<v Speaker 3>and he was doing his job and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>his job.</v>

1682
01:31:52.290 --> 01:31:55.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a complex issue.</v>

1683
01:31:55.410 --> 01:31:57.950
<v Speaker 1>And when you put all the pieces out on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>table and you just,</v>

1684
01:31:58.020 --> 01:31:58.853
<v Speaker 1>you've taken into account all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different variables with doping and </v>

1685
01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:05.050
<v Speaker 1>trying to catch these people and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future holds.</v>

1686
01:32:05.051 --> 01:32:07.330
<v Speaker 1>And then what you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>with epo,</v>

1687
01:32:07.331 --> 01:32:08.164
<v Speaker 1>with some sort of a biological way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get your body a genetic way to get your </v>

1688
01:32:10.871 --> 01:32:13.330
<v Speaker 1>body to reproduce the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals.</v>

1689
01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:17.470
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like there's no real solution.</v>

1690
01:32:17.530 --> 01:32:18.363
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll lay it all out and you look at </v>

1691
01:32:19.810 --> 01:32:20.643
<v Speaker 1>what happened in sochi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at what's going on right now </v>

1692
01:32:22.901 --> 01:32:25.840
<v Speaker 1>with the olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing the russians still competing in</v>

1693
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:29.460
<v Speaker 1>the brazilian games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even after all this and just not.</v>

1694
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:31.570
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1695
01:32:31.571 --> 01:32:33.170
<v Speaker 1>this has to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or oh,</v>

1696
01:32:33.171 --> 01:32:35.890
<v Speaker 1>you just put this over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just look at this big mess.</v>

1697
01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:36.801
<v Speaker 1>And he go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

1698
01:32:36.801 --> 01:32:37.720
<v Speaker 1>where does this go?</v>

1699
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:39.343
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1700
01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I think that that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a valid question.</v>

1701
01:32:42.261 --> 01:32:46.020
<v Speaker 2>And because when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start to look at where it goes,</v>

1702
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:51.600
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe in,</v>

1703
01:32:52.290 --> 01:32:54.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concept behind clean sport.</v>

1704
01:32:54.871 --> 01:32:55.704
<v Speaker 2>Like I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe in that and I believe </v>

1705
01:32:57.331 --> 01:32:58.650
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1706
01:32:59.070 --> 01:33:01.920
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that athlete should go and,</v>

1707
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:05.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and compete clean because those,</v>

1708
01:33:05.970 --> 01:33:07.380
<v Speaker 2>those are the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1709
01:33:07.381 --> 01:33:08.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1710
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.731
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1711
01:33:08.731 --> 01:33:11.070
<v Speaker 2>you come from bma world and all men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1712
01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:14.760
<v Speaker 2>you're going into a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You at least it's enough of a fight.</v>

1713
01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:18.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a fight that had at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1714
01:33:18.151 --> 01:33:18.984
<v Speaker 2>you want to believe that you're shaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy's hand and that and that if he </v>

1715
01:33:23.011 --> 01:33:24.960
<v Speaker 2>kicks you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he kicks your ass,</v>

1716
01:33:24.961 --> 01:33:27.630
<v Speaker 2>he kicks your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he did it through hard work,</v>

1717
01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.970
<v Speaker 2>through hard work and planned by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules,</v>

1718
01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:30.804
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1719
01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:32.290
<v Speaker 2>and that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1720
01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.153
<v Speaker 2>the concept I think that fans go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching sports and that athletes in </v>

1721
01:33:36.241 --> 01:33:37.890
<v Speaker 2>general go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go into,</v>

1722
01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:38.940
<v Speaker 2>go into sport.</v>

1723
01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1724
01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.520
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have the flip side of that,</v>

1725
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:46.380
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1726
01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:51.920
<v Speaker 2>human beings are in a constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not done evolving.</v>

1727
01:33:52.230 --> 01:33:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1728
01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.340
<v Speaker 2>a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a philosopher,</v>

1729
01:33:56.370 --> 01:33:58.110
<v Speaker 2>futurist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also an investor.</v>

1730
01:33:58.111 --> 01:34:02.010
<v Speaker 2>His name's juan and rica as if you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen his ted talks and stuff and,</v>

1731
01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:03.300
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1732
01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:05.970
<v Speaker 2>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he geTs into how,</v>

1733
01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:07.313
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he makes this whole scientific </v>

1734
01:34:08.671 --> 01:34:11.580
<v Speaker 2>argument about how human beings are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>done evolving.</v>

1735
01:34:11.610 --> 01:34:13.040
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just not done involvement.</v>

1736
01:34:13.050 --> 01:34:13.883
<v Speaker 2>We believe that we've done involving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he shows through history how we're </v>

1737
01:34:17.431 --> 01:34:20.280
<v Speaker 2>not done evolving just like we went </v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1738
01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:21.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frOm neanderthals and humans and done </v>

1739
01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:25.093
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1740
01:34:25.130 --> 01:34:28.260
<v Speaker 2>and he goes through the whole history of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and he shows how basically humans are</v>

1741
01:34:28.261 --> 01:34:29.094
<v Speaker 2>not done evolving and part of that not </v>
<v Speaker 2>being done evolving as we're constantly </v>

1742
01:34:32.881 --> 01:34:35.160
<v Speaker 2>figuring out how to live longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

1743
01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.233
<v Speaker 2>I sat with a guy yesterday who said the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem isn't whether or not human </v>

1744
01:34:38.791 --> 01:34:42.120
<v Speaker 2>beings are going to start living to 110 </v>
<v Speaker 2>or 120 years old.</v>

1745
01:34:42.450 --> 01:34:44.370
<v Speaker 2>The problem Is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we're figuring out how to,</v>

1746
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:45.383
<v Speaker 2>how to keep our body healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we haven't figured out how to keep </v>

1747
01:34:48.571 --> 01:34:49.404
<v Speaker 2>our minds healthy and that all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are going to be living </v>

1748
01:34:52.290 --> 01:34:55.470
<v Speaker 2>longer lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the problem with alzheimer's now</v>

1749
01:34:55.471 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 2>and dementia that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you live longer</v>

1750
01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:58.880
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1751
01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:02.530
<v Speaker 3>your brain is still deteriorating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point being is that we're in it.</v>

1752
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:03.403
<v Speaker 3>We're in an age of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of medical and scientific technology </v>

1753
01:35:06.771 --> 01:35:09.530
<v Speaker 3>that every single day is another </v>
<v Speaker 3>invention.</v>

1754
01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:13.100
<v Speaker 3>Another advance and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for $200,000</v>

1755
01:35:13.101 --> 01:35:15.440
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it is right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1756
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:18.050
<v Speaker 3>in the embryo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can change your kid's eye color.</v>

1757
01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.033
<v Speaker 3>You can go in and decide that your kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to be six foot and I'm five </v>

1758
01:35:22.341 --> 01:35:22.890
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1759
01:35:22.890 --> 01:35:23.631
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1760
01:35:23.631 --> 01:35:27.260
<v Speaker 3>I would have loved my parents do have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to have seen to it that,</v>

1761
01:35:27.690 --> 01:35:29.300
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was six feet tall,</v>

1762
01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:30.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1763
01:35:30.711 --> 01:35:33.440
<v Speaker 3>and all these kinds of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on right now.</v>

1764
01:35:33.441 --> 01:35:37.220
<v Speaker 3>And in the medical science and </v>
<v Speaker 3>technological advancement world,</v>

1765
01:35:37.690 --> 01:35:39.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were also things that the world is</v>

1766
01:35:39.981 --> 01:35:40.814
<v Speaker 3>going to have to start figuring out what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do on the fields of play and </v>

1767
01:35:44.291 --> 01:35:48.350
<v Speaker 3>athletic because the humans of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>

1768
01:35:48.970 --> 01:35:53.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to be better versions of,</v>

1769
01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:56.210
<v Speaker 3>of what we have right nOw just through </v>
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

1770
01:35:56.211 --> 01:35:57.044
<v Speaker 3>just through technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the question again goes into </v>

1771
01:35:59.661 --> 01:36:02.150
<v Speaker 3>the world of what's clean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's not clean,</v>

1772
01:36:02.630 --> 01:36:03.710
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1773
01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:06.770
<v Speaker 3>what's anti-doping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you police sport.</v>

1774
01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:09.440
<v Speaker 3>And those are very hard questions to </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>

1775
01:36:09.690 --> 01:36:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really are.</v>

1776
01:36:10.770 --> 01:36:13.800
<v Speaker 1>And you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On one hand,</v>

1777
01:36:13.801 --> 01:36:17.670
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to stop medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological progress,</v>

1778
01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:19.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to stop people from being</v>

1779
01:36:19.711 --> 01:36:20.544
<v Speaker 1>able to cure diseases and it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of the technology that they </v>

1780
01:36:26.521 --> 01:36:27.354
<v Speaker 1>use for aerospace makes its way into </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday use or some of the technology </v>

1781
01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:36.630
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to use for all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different medical innovation.</v>

1782
01:36:36.631 --> 01:36:39.600
<v Speaker 1>So there's different ways to cure </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases and increase human performance.</v>

1783
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:40.623
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna make their way into </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletics and it's going to be a very </v>

1784
01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.520
<v Speaker 1>blurry line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what is natural,</v>

1785
01:36:44.521 --> 01:36:45.870
<v Speaker 1>what's not natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1786
01:36:45.871 --> 01:36:46.704
<v Speaker 1>if your parents decide to genetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>all to you in the womb and change you </v>

1787
01:36:50.341 --> 01:36:52.260
<v Speaker 1>into a super athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that your fault?</v>

1788
01:36:52.770 --> 01:36:54.810
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not your choice or your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fault,</v>

1789
01:36:54.811 --> 01:36:55.644
<v Speaker 1>should you be allowed to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was always the argument about </v>

1790
01:36:57.721 --> 01:36:59.160
<v Speaker 1>carolyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1791
01:36:59.270 --> 01:37:02.040
<v Speaker 1>alexander and his parents were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

1792
01:37:02.041 --> 01:37:03.600
<v Speaker 1>five and five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>

1793
01:37:03.810 --> 01:37:04.643
<v Speaker 1>They were these tiny people and he was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking giant and a gorilla and they </v>

1794
01:37:09.811 --> 01:37:13.350
<v Speaker 1>used to call him in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to call him the experiment and</v>

1795
01:37:13.351 --> 01:37:16.020
<v Speaker 1>if you look at corella and you look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>him physically,</v>

1796
01:37:16.021 --> 01:37:16.854
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's very few athletes you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever going to see that look like that </v>

1797
01:37:19.591 --> 01:37:20.490
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1798
01:37:20.491 --> 01:37:22.890
<v Speaker 1>he was close to 300 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move like a cat,</v>

1799
01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:26.730
<v Speaker 1>and would literally launch grown men </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the air.</v>

1800
01:37:26.731 --> 01:37:27.564
<v Speaker 1>They were so terrified of his physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>prowess that grown men used to flatten </v>

1801
01:37:32.071 --> 01:37:32.904
<v Speaker 1>out on their stomach and literally try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cling to the earth to avoid being </v>

1802
01:37:36.211 --> 01:37:37.740
<v Speaker 1>thrown by him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you aware of him?</v>

1803
01:37:38.010 --> 01:37:39.750
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this motherfucker.</v>

1804
01:37:41.250 --> 01:37:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was undefeated in,</v>

1805
01:37:44.230 --> 01:37:48.570
<v Speaker 1>in the olympic games up until rulon </v>
<v Speaker 1>gardner beat him who was an american and</v>

1806
01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.910
<v Speaker 1>who to go to that picture which shows us</v>
<v Speaker 1>full body,</v>

1807
01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:52.830
<v Speaker 1>which shows his legs and that image.</v>

1808
01:37:53.190 --> 01:37:56.860
<v Speaker 1>There's a black and white that have up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there now that there,</v>

1809
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:59.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several,</v>

1810
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:02.760
<v Speaker 1>I forget when he took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all.</v>

1811
01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:03.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1812
01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Go to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a full,</v>

1813
01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:07.680
<v Speaker 1>full image of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie [inaudible] try to find that image</v>

1814
01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:08.514
<v Speaker 1>on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a full one where you get to </v>

1815
01:38:09.421 --> 01:38:12.360
<v Speaker 1>see his entiRe build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1816
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:13.223
<v Speaker 1>he was a fucking freak and so his thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>was throwing these men and he's a </v>

1817
01:38:18.811 --> 01:38:21.210
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sO these guys are 300 plus pounds.</v>

1818
01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:26.540
<v Speaker 1>He would throw them through the air like</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that very few people could do.</v>

1819
01:38:27.061 --> 01:38:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Look at that picture of him with his arm</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised right below that,</v>

1820
01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:33.540
<v Speaker 1>the black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking monstrous.</v>

1821
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And without a doubt,</v>

1822
01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:38.460
<v Speaker 1>choose to the tits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1823
01:38:38.461 --> 01:38:39.294
<v Speaker 1>no question about especially given the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that was disclosed in your </v>

1824
01:38:42.961 --> 01:38:45.630
<v Speaker 1>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this was all,</v>

1825
01:38:45.631 --> 01:38:48.270
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was through the eighties or</v>

1826
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:51.900
<v Speaker 1>the nineties and into the early two </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands when he retired.</v>

1827
01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:54.143
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a freak of all freaks and </v>

1828
01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:01.470
<v Speaker 1>the most terrifying man and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>russian amateur wrestling for sure.</v>

1829
01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:02.453
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was afraid of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is him standing above the greatest </v>

1830
01:39:06.211 --> 01:39:07.980
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts heavyweight of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1831
01:39:07.981 --> 01:39:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Fader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a million ankle.</v>

1832
01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.120
<v Speaker 1>And you'd see how much bigger he is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fader.</v>

1833
01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:14.290
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a fucking giant with the cv.</v>

1834
01:39:14.291 --> 01:39:15.990
<v Speaker 1>You could find a picture of him with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents</v>

1835
01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:16.953
<v Speaker 2>because it was the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the story was always that he was </v>

1836
01:39:18.131 --> 01:39:19.390
<v Speaker 2>basically a genetic mutant.</v>

1837
01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:20.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day did something,</v>

1838
01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one mean it was so long ago.</v>

1839
01:39:23.541 --> 01:39:26.270
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to ascertain what </v>
<v Speaker 1>was capable,</v>

1840
01:39:26.690 --> 01:39:27.523
<v Speaker 1>what was possible back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his performance in wrestling was </v>

1841
01:39:32.781 --> 01:39:35.180
<v Speaker 1>just stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously trained hard,</v>

1842
01:39:35.210 --> 01:39:36.860
<v Speaker 1>obviously very skilled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1843
01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:38.083
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers is not just the fact that </v>

1844
01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:43.730
<v Speaker 1>their physical prowess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're incredibly technical.</v>

1845
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Some of the most technically advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers in the world in terms of their</v>

1846
01:39:48.681 --> 01:39:49.514
<v Speaker 1>tactics and the way they would drill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they really had it down to a </v>

1847
01:39:54.291 --> 01:39:57.410
<v Speaker 1>science and there was so much gravity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all.</v>

1848
01:39:57.411 --> 01:39:58.700
<v Speaker 1>It was so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so important.</v>

1849
01:39:59.150 --> 01:39:59.983
<v Speaker 1>And on top of that choose to the tits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was so many factors that came </v>

1850
01:40:03.591 --> 01:40:05.150
<v Speaker 1>into play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1851
01:40:05.210 --> 01:40:10.210
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about this state </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsored russian doping program,</v>

1852
01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:11.893
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to really think and include </v>

1853
01:40:13.131 --> 01:40:15.980
<v Speaker 1>corella and in that because he was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a massive,</v>

1854
01:40:15.981 --> 01:40:17.400
<v Speaker 1>massive part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1855
01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:18.253
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know when people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>always speculated for for many years </v>

1856
01:40:22.131 --> 01:40:22.964
<v Speaker 1>like fate or who is arguably the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest heavyweight of all time was a </v>

1857
01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:27.493
<v Speaker 1>competing and pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was an openly dirty leak when </v>

1858
01:40:30.291 --> 01:40:31.124
<v Speaker 1>pride was opposite the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ufc had very rudimentary testing at </v>

1859
01:40:34.281 --> 01:40:35.114
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they would essentially do is do </v>

1860
01:40:35.871 --> 01:40:40.871
<v Speaker 1>urine testing at the way in which a </v>
<v Speaker 1>victor conte famously said is just a.</v>

1861
01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:42.210
<v Speaker 1>An intelligence</v>

1862
01:40:42.210 --> 01:40:42.930
<v Speaker 2>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1863
01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:43.970
<v Speaker 2>I know victor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1864
01:40:44.010 --> 01:40:45.150
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to meet him.</v>

1865
01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:46.770
<v Speaker 2>I got to know him pretty well through </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1866
01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:49.680
<v Speaker 1>He had victory to the podcast a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years back and was talking about,</v>

1867
01:40:49.681 --> 01:40:52.830
<v Speaker 1>and this is pre usada now the ufc is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hired,</v>

1868
01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:53.793
<v Speaker 1>saw to individ ski and jeff novitsky has</v>
<v Speaker 1>done a fantastic job and unfortunately </v>

1869
01:40:57.530 --> 01:41:01.150
<v Speaker 1>just caught John Jones who won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We won the title,</v>

1870
01:41:01.151 --> 01:41:01.984
<v Speaker 1>knocking out daniel cormier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stripped him of his title and now </v>

1871
01:41:04.730 --> 01:41:06.190
<v Speaker 1>cormier is going to be the champion </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1872
01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:07.024
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking confusing and distorted </v>

1873
01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:10.900
<v Speaker 1>because in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in mixed martial arts,</v>

1874
01:41:10.901 --> 01:41:13.540
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to any other sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even wrestling,</v>

1875
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:15.070
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your health is on the line,</v>

1876
01:41:15.090 --> 01:41:17.680
<v Speaker 1>but nowhere near as much as it is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts.</v>

1877
01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:18.693
<v Speaker 1>So the cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a matter of a guy getting </v>

1878
01:41:19.811 --> 01:41:20.644
<v Speaker 1>across the finish line faster than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of a guy landing blows or </v>

1879
01:41:24.250 --> 01:41:28.900
<v Speaker 1>woman lending blows that they would not </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been able to land had they not been</v>

1880
01:41:28.901 --> 01:41:31.120
<v Speaker 1>cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it gets very,</v>

1881
01:41:31.121 --> 01:41:31.954
<v Speaker 1>very tricky because you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially about not just illegal </v>

1882
01:41:34.691 --> 01:41:35.950
<v Speaker 1>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just cheating,</v>

1883
01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:39.550
<v Speaker 1>but potentially assault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what if someone dies,</v>

1884
01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:40.593
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if someone is doping and it's </v>

1885
01:41:42.701 --> 01:41:43.534
<v Speaker 1>proven that they're doping and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating they give their opponent leads </v>

1886
01:41:46.031 --> 01:41:46.864
<v Speaker 1>that opponent dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a real argument that </v>

1887
01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:53.080
<v Speaker 1>manslaughter charges at the very least </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be filed if not murder.</v>

1888
01:41:54.330 --> 01:41:54.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1889
01:41:54.721 --> 01:41:55.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1890
01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:58.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly the implications are met.</v>

1891
01:41:58.570 --> 01:42:01.690
<v Speaker 2>So you could certainly make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>implication and you know,</v>

1892
01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:04.260
<v Speaker 2>and in this story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the,</v>

1893
01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:05.393
<v Speaker 2>the idea wheRe you have thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes essentially waking up and </v>

1894
01:42:10.411 --> 01:42:11.244
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1895
01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:12.593
<v Speaker 2>maybe I would've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've gotten metal and how diana </v>

1896
01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:16.103
<v Speaker 2>metal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would be different in my life </v>

1897
01:42:18.511 --> 01:42:20.340
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which changed their whole world.</v>

1898
01:42:20.341 --> 01:42:21.840
<v Speaker 2>It's changed the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1899
01:42:21.841 --> 01:42:23.280
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1900
01:42:23.281 --> 01:42:25.180
<v Speaker 2>and that is why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1901
01:42:25.190 --> 01:42:26.023
<v Speaker 2>this problem is so I think hard and </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to combat because when you </v>

1902
01:42:30.211 --> 01:42:32.130
<v Speaker 2>look at what is at stake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1903
01:42:32.131 --> 01:42:34.350
<v Speaker 2>the economics at stake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1904
01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:36.680
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the box of wheaties essentially that,</v>

1905
01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:37.561
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1906
01:42:37.561 --> 01:42:40.720
<v Speaker 2>going in and nobody remembers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember second place.</v>

1907
01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:42.330
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean anything to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>

1908
01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:45.150
<v Speaker 2>It means nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all one win or you don't.</v>

1909
01:42:45.210 --> 01:42:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you win or you lose.</v>

1910
01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:49.200
<v Speaker 2>And if you win comes all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1911
01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:51.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoils.</v>

1912
01:42:51.690 --> 01:42:54.660
<v Speaker 2>And if you'Re not the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might as well have almost never been</v>

1913
01:42:54.661 --> 01:42:54.900
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1914
01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:55.733
<v Speaker 1>Well in indifferent than the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletic endeavor endeavor because </v>

1915
01:42:58.261 --> 01:43:01.470
<v Speaker 1>essentially it is their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not professional.</v>

1916
01:43:01.650 --> 01:43:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Which is a really weird thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have so much money involved.</v>

1917
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:06.663
<v Speaker 1>the olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions and billions of dollars are </v>

1918
01:43:07.951 --> 01:43:10.890
<v Speaker 1>going into the hands of people who don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even fucking compete,</v>

1919
01:43:11.190 --> 01:43:13.890
<v Speaker 1>which is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unlike any otheR athletic pursuit.</v>

1920
01:43:14.130 --> 01:43:19.130
<v Speaker 1>If you look at professional sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean whether it's the nba or boxing or</v>

1921
01:43:19.621 --> 01:43:20.454
<v Speaker 1>what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of the money goes to </v>

1922
01:43:22.951 --> 01:43:27.000
<v Speaker 1>the athletes themselves right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in the olympics and the olympics.</v>

1923
01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Fucking zero.</v>

1924
01:43:28.890 --> 01:43:29.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just insane.</v>

1925
01:43:29.871 --> 01:43:32.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like college basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

1926
01:43:32.041 --> 01:43:32.874
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's purely an honor to be in the </v>

1927
01:43:36.451 --> 01:43:40.950
<v Speaker 2>olympics to go to the olympics and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes themselves,</v>

1928
01:43:41.310 --> 01:43:42.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is why it's actually you're </v>

1929
01:43:43.621 --> 01:43:46.080
<v Speaker 2>able to understand a state sponsored </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

1930
01:43:46.081 --> 01:43:46.914
<v Speaker 2>which I think the american mentality is </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to understand because here we're </v>

1931
01:43:49.441 --> 01:43:50.274
<v Speaker 2>looking at $205,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>nba contracts and sport is privatized </v>

1932
01:43:55.611 --> 01:43:56.444
<v Speaker 2>and the athletes get paid and that even </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go to the olympics as an </v>

1933
01:44:00.051 --> 01:44:03.680
<v Speaker 2>american athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be competing for America,</v>

1934
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:07.430
<v Speaker 2>but America is not paying your way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the olympics.</v>

1935
01:44:07.431 --> 01:44:08.264
<v Speaker 2>You're nOt on the us payroll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael phelps is not being paid by the </v>

1936
01:44:11.571 --> 01:44:14.480
<v Speaker 2>us government to go compete in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>olympics,</v>

1937
01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:17.300
<v Speaker 2>but in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Russia,</v>

1938
01:44:17.690 --> 01:44:21.640
<v Speaker 2>in a an any essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1939
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:23.750
<v Speaker 2>post communist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>communist,</v>

1940
01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:26.180
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any sort of country like that.</v>

1941
01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:31.400
<v Speaker 2>The athletes are employees of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Government and they're essentially state</v>

1942
01:44:31.401 --> 01:44:32.234
<v Speaker 2>employees and their job is to go and </v>
<v Speaker 2>compete for their country and they're </v>

1943
01:44:35.511 --> 01:44:36.530
<v Speaker 2>being paid to do so</v>

1944
01:44:36.730 --> 01:44:40.840
<v Speaker 1>and the the spoils are so incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>large for the athletes,</v>

1945
01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:41.674
<v Speaker 1>even in America that people are still </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be willing to put it on the </v>

1946
01:44:44.201 --> 01:44:45.034
<v Speaker 1>lawn and compete because you could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Michael Phelps guy that winds up </v>

1947
01:44:47.351 --> 01:44:50.560
<v Speaker 1>getting incredibly rich and famous from </v>
<v Speaker 1>winning the olympics.</v>

1948
01:44:50.590 --> 01:44:51.423
<v Speaker 1>So people are willing to compete and </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially risk their physical body </v>

1949
01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:59.020
<v Speaker 1>risk all of their time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their effort,</v>

1950
01:44:59.021 --> 01:44:59.854
<v Speaker 1>their dedication to try to accomplish </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that all the world's going to </v>

1951
01:45:03.961 --> 01:45:04.794
<v Speaker 1>be watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive profits being made and they </v>

1952
01:45:07.271 --> 01:45:09.940
<v Speaker 1>don't see a fucking penny of it unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>they win.</v>

1953
01:45:10.090 --> 01:45:11.840
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they.</v>

1954
01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:14.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a consequence of them winning that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they see that.</v>

1955
01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if a win,</v>

1956
01:45:16.690 --> 01:45:20.560
<v Speaker 2>if you're simone biles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're phelps,</v>

1957
01:45:20.561 --> 01:45:25.390
<v Speaker 2>if you're any one of these athletes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically sport that people don't really</v>

1958
01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:28.210
<v Speaker 2>watch and there's money behind any </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

1959
01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:30.850
<v Speaker 2>any other time of the year other than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the olympics,</v>

1960
01:45:30.851 --> 01:45:33.820
<v Speaker 2>every four years people care about </v>
<v Speaker 2>gymnastics.</v>

1961
01:45:34.190 --> 01:45:36.250
<v Speaker 2>They don't care about gymnastics any </v>
<v Speaker 2>other time.</v>

1962
01:45:36.251 --> 01:45:38.660
<v Speaker 2>But once every four years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody cares about jim.</v>

1963
01:45:38.661 --> 01:45:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Now who's watching swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1964
01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody cares about swimming.</v>

1965
01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:44.440
<v Speaker 2>But once every four years they care </v>
<v Speaker 2>about swimming.</v>

1966
01:45:44.770 --> 01:45:46.960
<v Speaker 2>And if you can go in and capitalize on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1967
01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.130
<v Speaker 2>you have a live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so if you don't,</v>

1968
01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:52.093
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the whole kind of </v>

1969
01:45:54.910 --> 01:45:59.910
<v Speaker 2>armstrong a basketball player for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia team.</v>

1970
01:46:00.111 --> 01:46:02.980
<v Speaker 2>He's actually an mba player putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>together a shower curtain for his.</v>

1971
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Wherever he was staying in on the side </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1972
01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:08.800
<v Speaker 2>describes the 196,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cabin,</v>

1973
01:46:08.801 --> 01:46:12.340
<v Speaker 2>nine index super ship that the men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women's us basketball teams were staying</v>

1974
01:46:12.341 --> 01:46:15.490
<v Speaker 2>on and had 250 police officers watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1975
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:21.910
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't say who paid for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

1976
01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Well enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They paid for their own know.</v>

1977
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:25.633
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point being that the olympics </v>

1978
01:46:28.041 --> 01:46:32.480
<v Speaker 1>are essentially a professional endeavor </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the athletes,</v>

1979
01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:37.130
<v Speaker 1>the ones who people are watching are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting any of that money and it's a,</v>

1980
01:46:37.131 --> 01:46:40.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a dirty organization in that regard</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is not amateur.</v>

1981
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:42.110
<v Speaker 1>It was amateur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world would see it for free.</v>

1982
01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:45.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay some money.</v>

1983
01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:48.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many billions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>billions and billions of dollars.</v>

1984
01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:49.373
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The contract could staggering what nbc </v>

1985
01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:55.530
<v Speaker 2>paid for the olympic rights for the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>however many games it is.</v>

1986
01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:56.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they get paid from the </v>

1987
01:46:57.211 --> 01:46:59.180
<v Speaker 1>advertiser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just the us.</v>

1988
01:46:59.210 --> 01:46:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1989
01:46:59.750 --> 01:47:01.910
<v Speaker 2>That's just you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on a global level,</v>

1990
01:47:01.911 --> 01:47:06.911
<v Speaker 2>this is the most watched sporting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the most watched event on planet</v>

1991
01:47:07.131 --> 01:47:07.964
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody world cup soccer and the </v>

1992
01:47:10.131 --> 01:47:10.964
<v Speaker 2>olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the olympics even more so most </v>

1993
01:47:12.651 --> 01:47:15.920
<v Speaker 2>watched event on planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1994
01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:17.960
<v Speaker 2>there it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven point seven,</v>

1995
01:47:17.961 --> 01:47:19.880
<v Speaker 2>$5,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion through 20,</v>

1996
01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:20.723
<v Speaker 2>32</v>

1997
01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:22.510
<v Speaker 1>bc paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1998
01:47:23.050 --> 01:47:24.490
<v Speaker 1>stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1999
01:47:24.491 --> 01:47:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the solution is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it never.</v>

2000
01:47:26.311 --> 01:47:30.160
<v Speaker 1>It never sent set right with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like it was gross.</v>

2001
01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:31.263
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't make any sense that </v>

2002
01:47:31.901 --> 01:47:33.670
<v Speaker 1>everyone is getting paid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the athletes,</v>

2003
01:47:34.150 --> 01:47:35.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially,</v>

2004
01:47:35.411 --> 01:47:38.260
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've managed to keep it this way.</v>

2005
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:42.400
<v Speaker 1>They had this situation in place a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time ago,</v>

2006
01:47:42.730 --> 01:47:47.730
<v Speaker 1>and then it became this massive global </v>
<v Speaker 1>business is huge empire and they managed</v>

2007
01:47:48.371 --> 01:47:51.650
<v Speaker 1>to keep the athletes out of the loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2008
01:47:51.710 --> 01:47:53.890
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really a mess.</v>

2009
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.380
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not only that,</v>

2010
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:56.303
<v Speaker 2>there were so many people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>profited to the tunes of millions and </v>

2011
01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:03.113
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially bribery of other countries </v>

2012
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:07.583
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2013
01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:08.753
<v Speaker 2>all the politics behind that to protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>their athletes so that the athletes can </v>

2014
01:48:11.551 --> 01:48:13.620
<v Speaker 2>continue to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to win medals.</v>

2015
01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:18.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm gregory told me a story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2016
01:48:19.170 --> 01:48:20.003
<v Speaker 2>whIch i,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder when this will come true </v>

2017
01:48:21.930 --> 01:48:22.763
<v Speaker 2>because I certainly can't verify it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he told me a story of a former </v>

2018
01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:28.440
<v Speaker 2>olympic medical director and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently,</v>

2019
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:29.783
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the head medical director of the </v>

2020
01:48:31.141 --> 01:48:34.950
<v Speaker 2>olympics for like 15 years or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And according to gregory,</v>

2021
01:48:34.951 --> 01:48:37.100
<v Speaker 2>this gUy liveS in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2022
01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:40.380
<v Speaker 2>an Incredible chateau,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a somewhere in,</v>

2023
01:48:40.410 --> 01:48:41.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Switzerland.</v>

2024
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:44.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like a mind boggling house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2025
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:49.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's lIke an orthopedic doctor,</v>

2026
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:53.580
<v Speaker 2>but he's the head medical director of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the olympics and according to gregory,</v>

2027
01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:58.560
<v Speaker 2>he's accepted millions and millions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars in bribes,</v>

2028
01:48:58.970 --> 01:48:59.803
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through different countries to conceal </v>

2029
01:49:01.231 --> 01:49:06.231
<v Speaker 2>positives over all these various olympic</v>
<v Speaker 2>games that whatever it was,</v>

2030
01:49:06.241 --> 01:49:07.074
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2031
01:49:07.530 --> 01:49:09.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slovakia or whatever,</v>

2032
01:49:09.511 --> 01:49:10.344
<v Speaker 2>there'd be a positive in this guy would </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a half a million dollars to conceal </v>

2033
01:49:13.681 --> 01:49:13.840
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2034
01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.530
<v Speaker 2>There's a positive here and he'd take </v>
<v Speaker 2>the money and conceal it.</v>

2035
01:49:17.130 --> 01:49:19.280
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2036
01:49:19.281 --> 01:49:20.114
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be surprised if that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's just the tip of the </v>

2037
01:49:23.881 --> 01:49:24.714
<v Speaker 2>iceberg because this is huge money in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these countries are willing to pay this </v>

2038
01:49:28.471 --> 01:49:33.471
<v Speaker 2>big money because for a country like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia or China or,</v>

2039
01:49:35.490 --> 01:49:37.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even Jamaica,</v>

2040
01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:38.303
<v Speaker 2>right to win medals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that does for its country on a </v>

2041
01:49:42.391 --> 01:49:44.670
<v Speaker 2>world level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of the sudden when jamaica's winning</v>

2042
01:49:44.671 --> 01:49:46.350
<v Speaker 2>medals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's going,</v>

2043
01:49:46.351 --> 01:49:47.184
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2044
01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:49.000
<v Speaker 2>we want to go to Jamaica.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2045
01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:50.133
<v Speaker 2>just what that jamaican team did </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably did for tourism dollars to </v>

2046
01:49:54.431 --> 01:49:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Jamaica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could add.</v>

2047
01:49:56.620 --> 01:49:57.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's staggering,</v>

2048
01:49:58.170 --> 01:50:01.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It made Jamaica and victor conte,</v>

2049
01:50:01.421 --> 01:50:02.680
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2050
01:50:02.681 --> 01:50:07.000
<v Speaker 2>in detail how the fast five fastest </v>
<v Speaker 2>runners on planet earth are jamaican and</v>

2051
01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:10.630
<v Speaker 2>content will go right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And don catlin goes,</v>

2053
01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:13.490
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look at the money that,</v>

2054
01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:18.220
<v Speaker 2>that had to have brought Jamaica of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tourism,</v>

2055
01:50:18.221 --> 01:50:19.580
<v Speaker 2>of advertising,</v>

2063

<v Speaker 1>as far as the heavyweights in mixed </v>

<v Speaker 1>room and called the police.</v>

2089

<v Speaker 1>safe room.</v>

2095
01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:00.480
<v Speaker 1>You got to think about the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money that's involved in these things.</v>

2096
01:52:00.481 --> 01:52:02.380
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know that other people,</v>

2097
01:52:02.381 --> 01:52:06.870
<v Speaker 1>serena williams lOcks herself in panic </v>
<v Speaker 1>room and drug test mix up.</v>

2098
01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a mix up.</v>

2099
01:52:09.241 --> 01:52:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that our los angeles manchin,</v>

2100
01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:13.750
<v Speaker 1>no worries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mansion.</v>

2101
01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:14.613
<v Speaker 1>The tennis legends assistant at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM local time last wednesday and told </v>

2102
01:52:19.111 --> 01:52:19.944
<v Speaker 1>the emergency operator that a prowler </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been spotted at the luxurious </v>

2103
01:52:23.431 --> 01:52:24.264
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She retreated to her panic room and a </v>

2104
01:52:26.611 --> 01:52:31.410
<v Speaker 1>bid to protect herself for that is where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are Giving her every benefit of the</v>

2105
01:52:31.411 --> 01:52:32.244
<v Speaker 1>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that one,</v>

2106
01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

2107
01:52:35.190 --> 01:52:37.060
<v Speaker 1>It's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the intruder train hold on,</v>

2108
01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:38.993
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be a random drug test who </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped by unannounced for a urine </v>

2109
01:52:41.821 --> 01:52:46.821
<v Speaker 1>sample to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you the cops responded on them on.</v>

2110
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:50.090
<v Speaker 1>But the quickly left the property when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the misunderstanding was discovered,</v>

2111
01:52:50.091 --> 01:52:52.550
<v Speaker 1>it was not known whether or not william </v>
<v Speaker 1>submitted to the drug test.</v>

2112
01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2113
01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:55.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean she didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's not known that means she didn't </v>

2114
01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:02.400
<v Speaker 1>or potentially in the panic room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lots of saline solution.</v>

2115
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:06.183
<v Speaker 1>But I couldn't imagine if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the amount of money that </v>

2116
01:53:09.171 --> 01:53:13.490
<v Speaker 1>a certain person who is a world renowned</v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete in whatever sport it is,</v>

2117
01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean the amount of money that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved as fucking staggering.</v>

2118
01:53:16.311 --> 01:53:18.500
<v Speaker 1>And if you have stringent drug testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2119
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:19.383
<v Speaker 1>that's why the John Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so disheartening because jon </v>

2120
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:24.320
<v Speaker 1>jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's arguably,</v>

2121
01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:27.620
<v Speaker 1>if not the greatest mixed martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter of all time,</v>

2122
01:53:27.621 --> 01:53:29.240
<v Speaker 1>he's number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2123
01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:30.733
<v Speaker 1>maybe mighty mouse is number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you would say that mighty mouse is </v>

2124
01:53:32.811 --> 01:53:34.970
<v Speaker 1>not faceless kind of competition that </v>
<v Speaker 1>john has.</v>

2125
01:53:35.090 --> 01:53:37.460
<v Speaker 1>So that would put john into number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people's eyes.</v>

2126
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:41.780
<v Speaker 1>But to have him test positive like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was so disheartening for people and just</v>

2127
01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:46.040
<v Speaker 1>such a heartbreaker because people had </v>
<v Speaker 1>just hoped and prayed that,</v>

2128
01:53:46.041 --> 01:53:48.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him coming back and winning that way.</v>

2129
01:53:48.051 --> 01:53:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe he'll get his shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2130
01:53:50.091 --> 01:53:50.924
<v Speaker 1>when you see a guy with massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential and he's been involved in all </v>

2131
01:53:52.911 --> 01:53:56.150
<v Speaker 1>these fuck ups in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe finally he's got his shit together</v>

2132
01:53:56.650 --> 01:54:01.650
<v Speaker 2>or maybe what happened is he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came back and he realized that he was</v>

2133
01:54:03.101 --> 01:54:03.934
<v Speaker 2>never going to be what he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be and that whole psychology kicked in </v>

2134
01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:12.450
<v Speaker 2>and I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2135
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:14.530
<v Speaker 2>you see that in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2136
01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:15.373
<v Speaker 2>in so many guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that once you've been on that </v>

2137
01:54:17.291 --> 01:54:21.010
<v Speaker 2>program or you understand that program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably very,</v>

2138
01:54:21.011 --> 01:54:23.980
<v Speaker 2>very hard psychologically to go off of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2139
01:54:23.981 --> 01:54:25.330
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2140
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:27.550
<v Speaker 2>you're always going to be pushing those </v>
<v Speaker 2>limits.</v>

2141
01:54:27.551 --> 01:54:29.620
<v Speaker 2>It's always the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the icarus story.</v>

2142
01:54:29.710 --> 01:54:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's um,</v>

2143
01:54:31.450 --> 01:54:31.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>

2144
01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:33.380
<v Speaker 2>an armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2145
01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:37.300
<v Speaker 2>in 2009 when he staged that comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2146
01:54:37.530 --> 01:54:38.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2147
01:54:38.011 --> 01:54:38.844
<v Speaker 2>I believe that he was trying to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>clean and then all of a sudden realize </v>

2148
01:54:43.601 --> 01:54:46.330
<v Speaker 2>he was gonna get his ass kicked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a clean.</v>

2149
01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:47.373
<v Speaker 2>And you look at that comeback here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so interesting that contador </v>

2150
01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:56.040
<v Speaker 2>who beat him set the all time fastest </v>
<v Speaker 2>times in that year.</v>

2151
01:54:57.100 --> 01:54:59.560
<v Speaker 2>And that was supposed to be the clean </v>
<v Speaker 2>tour.</v>

2152
01:54:59.561 --> 01:55:03.250
<v Speaker 2>That was the redemption tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the tour to approve that.</v>

2153
01:55:03.251 --> 01:55:05.380
<v Speaker 2>It's clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet in that tour,</v>

2154
01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:09.520
<v Speaker 2>a contador set the all time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fastest times.</v>

2155
01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:14.440
<v Speaker 2>And funny enough that year were </v>
<v Speaker 2>armstrong got third,</v>

2156
01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:15.893
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had he been doing the tour any other </v>

2157
01:55:17.921 --> 01:55:20.530
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the watts per kilo that he had put up,</v>

2158
01:55:20.531 --> 01:55:25.510
<v Speaker 2>the power that he had put up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was actually his best tour ever,</v>

2159
01:55:26.410 --> 01:55:29.260
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he came into that tour going,</v>

2160
01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:30.513
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna win it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet his teammate got the door and </v>

2161
01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.990
<v Speaker 2>schleicher I'll open them essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was the end.</v>

2162
01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:40.840
<v Speaker 2>And so had it been any other year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have won that tour.</v>

2163
01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:43.740
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now with crispr,</v>

2164
01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:46.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now with this new technology that allows</v>

2165
01:55:46.261 --> 01:55:50.130
<v Speaker 1>people to essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the,</v>

2166
01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:53.460
<v Speaker 1>it's on the table what the potential is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to completely play out,</v>

2167
01:55:53.461 --> 01:55:54.294
<v Speaker 1>but other countries are using it right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and embryos and know whether or not </v>

2168
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:57.790
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2169
01:55:57.930 --> 01:55:58.763
<v Speaker 1>in the United States whether they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to use it and you're going to see </v>

2170
01:56:01.411 --> 01:56:04.440
<v Speaker 1>these children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not when or it's not.</v>

2171
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:05.303
<v Speaker 1>If rather it's more like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as this technology progresses and it </v>

2172
01:56:08.821 --> 01:56:09.654
<v Speaker 1>gets better and better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you find out that your children have </v>

2173
01:56:11.461 --> 01:56:15.290
<v Speaker 1>the genetic markers that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially lead to alzheimer's down,</v>

2174
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:16.051
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the road.</v>

2175
01:56:16.051 --> 01:56:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want your children to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>alzheimer's?</v>

2176
01:56:17.731 --> 01:56:18.870
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't,</v>

2177
01:56:18.871 --> 01:56:20.010
<v Speaker 1>you would edit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would say,</v>

2178
01:56:20.011 --> 01:56:20.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>

2179
01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:22.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a simple procedure.</v>

2180
01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:25.740
<v Speaker 1>It's no more dangerous than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2181
01:56:25.741 --> 01:56:27.570
<v Speaker 1>other medical procedures that we do </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

2182
01:56:27.630 --> 01:56:29.280
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be real simple,</v>

2183
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:31.950
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you have a preference.</v>

2184
01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you like your child to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>

2185
01:56:35.230 --> 01:56:38.170
<v Speaker 1>a vo two max?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you,</v>

2186
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:41.970
<v Speaker 1>would you like your kid to be one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most ridiculous mesomorphs the world has</v>

2187
01:56:41.971 --> 01:56:43.860
<v Speaker 1>ever known?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to herschel walker type body</v>

2188
01:56:43.861 --> 01:56:44.694
<v Speaker 1>for your child?</v>

2189
01:56:44.850 --> 01:56:45.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do it.</v>

2190
01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do it.</v>

2191
01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:49.170
<v Speaker 2>The technology's there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2192
01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:50.133
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's close.</v>

2193
01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:51.593
<v Speaker 2>Technology's there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading all these articles right </v>

2194
01:56:55.381 --> 01:56:56.840
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a funny.</v>

2195
01:56:56.850 --> 01:56:59.220
<v Speaker 2>silicon valley did a show with the blood</v>
<v Speaker 2>bags.</v>

2196
01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:01.940
<v Speaker 2>If you saw that episode where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2197
01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:05.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gavin belson television show is,</v>

2198
01:57:05.431 --> 01:57:06.264
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is having his blood swapped out by like </v>

2199
01:57:08.011 --> 01:57:11.190
<v Speaker 2>a 21 year old and really good looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

2200
01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Peter teal does that on a regular basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was the,</v>

2201
01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:14.783
<v Speaker 2>and that was the lampooning of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've been doing all this test in </v>

2202
01:57:17.161 --> 01:57:17.994
<v Speaker 2>mice that if you take an old mouse and </v>
<v Speaker 2>give it the blood of a young mouse that </v>

2203
01:57:24.271 --> 01:57:27.000
<v Speaker 2>the old mouse starts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2204
01:57:27.001 --> 01:57:27.834
<v Speaker 2>basically reverse aging and if you give </v>
<v Speaker 2>the old mouse blood to the young mouse </v>

2205
01:57:32.070 --> 01:57:34.290
<v Speaker 2>that the young mouse turns into an old </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouse.</v>

2206
01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:36.780
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2207
01:57:36.810 --> 01:57:39.540
<v Speaker 2>this is on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the horizon.</v>

2208
01:57:39.541 --> 01:57:40.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is there.</v>

2209
01:57:40.831 --> 01:57:42.010
<v Speaker 2>So the question is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2210
01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:43.260
<v Speaker 2>what do you do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2211
01:57:43.261 --> 01:57:44.850
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like a,</v>

2212
01:57:45.330 --> 01:57:48.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your urine enthusiasts and you're in the</v>

2213
01:57:48.031 --> 01:57:51.330
<v Speaker 2>sports that you care about or dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent sports.</v>

2214
01:57:51.450 --> 01:57:52.580
<v Speaker 2>So how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

2215
01:57:52.610 --> 01:57:53.460
<v Speaker 2>what do you do about it?</v>

2216
01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:54.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a real question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2217
01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:56.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like all those things we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier,</v>

2218
01:57:56.881 --> 01:58:00.270
<v Speaker 1>you put all the pieces on the table and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to imagine what's the solution?</v>

2219
01:58:00.271 --> 01:58:01.104
<v Speaker 1>I don't see the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is because I don't </v>

2220
01:58:02.431 --> 01:58:05.370
<v Speaker 1>think we were talking about this with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some friends.</v>

2221
01:58:05.371 --> 01:58:08.280
<v Speaker 1>We were saying like if everybody decides</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay clean,</v>

2222
01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:12.780
<v Speaker 1>but yet the technology becomes viable </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the average person.</v>

2223
01:58:13.050 --> 01:58:13.883
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have a mailman that </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like the incredible hulk and </v>

2224
01:58:15.871 --> 01:58:18.360
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be watching these </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrawny guys fight in the ufc.</v>

2225
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:20.380
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to tolerate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2226
01:58:20.610 --> 01:58:24.030
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to have to assume at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some point in time that all these people</v>

2227
01:58:24.031 --> 01:58:24.864
<v Speaker 1>are enhanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to assume that it's </v>

2228
01:58:26.941 --> 01:58:27.774
<v Speaker 1>more than just dedication and hard work </v>
<v Speaker 1>and honestly it's going to be a sad day </v>

2229
01:58:31.951 --> 01:58:32.784
<v Speaker 1>when that happens because when that does</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and we just accept the fact that </v>

2230
01:58:36.001 --> 01:58:39.120
<v Speaker 1>we've created these genetic freaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to be special.</v>

2231
01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:41.920
<v Speaker 1>It'S not going to stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you saw Mike Tyson,</v>

2232
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:43.143
<v Speaker 1>it was a special thing because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 eighties and there was really </v>

2233
01:58:45.971 --> 01:58:47.650
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean who knows?</v>

2234
01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:48.513
<v Speaker 1>It's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was probably some steroids </v>

2235
01:58:49.481 --> 01:58:50.314
<v Speaker 1>involved in that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's the steroids involved in </v>

2236
01:58:51.671 --> 01:58:52.504
<v Speaker 1>a lot of different things that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>just assumed there weren't little just </v>

2237
01:58:55.331 --> 01:58:58.060
<v Speaker 1>leave that on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't genetics,</v>

2238
01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:00.910
<v Speaker 1>which you saw as a guy who was born that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2239
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.400
<v Speaker 1>who was born with that freakish power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and speed.</v>

2240
01:59:03.810 --> 01:59:04.643
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get it from a laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get it from somebody's </v>

2241
01:59:07.031 --> 01:59:07.864
<v Speaker 1>literally taking the embryo and altering</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genetiCs and the embryo and making </v>

2242
01:59:12.251 --> 01:59:16.690
<v Speaker 1>him a destruction machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making him a violent force of nature.</v>

2243
01:59:16.691 --> 01:59:17.524
<v Speaker 1>Like Mike Tyson was in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that yOu could take a regular </v>

2244
01:59:20.021 --> 01:59:20.854
<v Speaker 1>person like young jamie over there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn them into some sort of crazy freak </v>

2245
01:59:25.451 --> 01:59:26.700
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

2246
01:59:27.190 --> 01:59:29.680
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because when a freak athlete </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes along,</v>

2247
01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:31.360
<v Speaker 1>you see them and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2248
01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:33.130
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

2249
01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:35.980
<v Speaker 1>No one can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody do that before,</v>

2250
01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:39.490
<v Speaker 2>but then you look at the money behind it</v>
<v Speaker 2>now and then you look at,</v>

2251
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:43.450
<v Speaker 2>as in this film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see all of a sudden the geo politics</v>

2252
01:59:43.451 --> 01:59:44.284
<v Speaker 2>behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the us or whatever were we're </v>

2253
01:59:46.691 --> 01:59:48.850
<v Speaker 2>looking at it on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2254
01:59:48.851 --> 01:59:49.684
<v Speaker 2>the $40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollar a year contract level of </v>

2255
01:59:51.581 --> 01:59:54.880
<v Speaker 2>it and whether or not that's ethical and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we do about that.</v>

2256
01:59:54.881 --> 01:59:59.881
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden we have athletes has </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic mutants and what is that future.</v>

2257
02:00:00.190 --> 02:00:01.023
<v Speaker 2>But then when you look at it on the geo </v>
<v Speaker 2>political level and what a country is </v>

2258
02:00:03.671 --> 02:00:04.504
<v Speaker 2>willing to do to win and what it means </v>
<v Speaker 2>for their athletes to win an assert </v>

2259
02:00:08.831 --> 02:00:11.140
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I rememBer when,</v>

2260
02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:12.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of years ago when Germany won </v>

2261
02:00:13.091 --> 02:00:16.470
<v Speaker 2>the world cup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a.</v>

2262
02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:20.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>german pride had to have been at a,</v>

2263
02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:23.560
<v Speaker 2>at a staggering level.</v>

2264
02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2265
02:00:24.190 --> 02:00:25.023
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably could have went and went </v>

2266
02:00:26.111 --> 02:00:28.270
<v Speaker 2>into any bar in Germany and said </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2267
02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:31.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you would've got your face speeding.</v>

2268
02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:34.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is because of the emotion that people</v>

2269
02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:35.793
<v Speaker 2>get connected to with their athletes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their sports team and I think </v>

2270
02:00:39.110 --> 02:00:44.110
<v Speaker 2>governments and in the case of icarus </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you understand what that is,</v>

2271
02:00:44.730 --> 02:00:47.320
<v Speaker 2>that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so far beyond,</v>

2272
02:00:47.730 --> 02:00:49.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes into,</v>

2273
02:00:49.330 --> 02:00:50.163
<v Speaker 2>into global power and how do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>consolidate power and sport in many </v>

2274
02:00:54.371 --> 02:00:55.570
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

2275
02:00:56.020 --> 02:00:58.270
<v Speaker 2>is that vehicle I see it.</v>

2276
02:00:58.400 --> 02:00:59.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly as.</v>

2277
02:00:59.061 --> 02:00:59.894
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's such a huge part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreation of the people and giving </v>

2278
02:01:02.391 --> 02:01:05.180
<v Speaker 1>people something to be excited about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you,</v>

2279
02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>you do take into consideration this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology that's on the horizon crisper</v>

2280
02:01:10.341 --> 02:01:12.350
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who knows what's after crispr,</v>

2281
02:01:12.351 --> 02:01:13.184
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you look at what Russia has </v>

2282
02:01:14.661 --> 02:01:17.420
<v Speaker 1>been unwilling to do with their state </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsored doping program.</v>

2283
02:01:17.630 --> 02:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>You've got to think they were already </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in that.</v>

2284
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:20.870
<v Speaker 1>You gotta think they're already.</v>

2285
02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:22.373
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know greg gregory said something to </v>

2286
02:01:23.251 --> 02:01:26.340
<v Speaker 2>me interesting is he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2287
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:30.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they put on that water list,</v>

2288
02:01:30.570 --> 02:01:31.403
<v Speaker 2>meaning whatever banned substances they </v>
<v Speaker 2>put on the list we've already got in </v>

2289
02:01:36.061 --> 02:01:36.894
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've already got another 10 or 20 that </v>

2290
02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:42.080
<v Speaker 2>messing with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you remember last year,</v>

2291
02:01:42.081 --> 02:01:42.914
<v Speaker 2>the whole meldonium scandal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>sharapova and all these assets as the </v>

2292
02:01:47.341 --> 02:01:49.290
<v Speaker 2>ufc gets freaked out for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll donate them.</v>

2293
02:01:49.291 --> 02:01:50.124
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a substance that Russia had </v>

2294
02:01:51.861 --> 02:01:52.694
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2295
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:55.940
<v Speaker 2>messing with for years knowing that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't on the pan,</v>

2296
02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:56.833
<v Speaker 2>on the banned list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they essentially put it on the </v>

2297
02:01:59.031 --> 02:02:02.090
<v Speaker 2>banned list like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they started testing for it and</v>

2298
02:02:02.091 --> 02:02:03.290
<v Speaker 2>they did it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2299
02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:04.453
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very intentional to go catch </v>

2300
02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:09.190
<v Speaker 2>everybody on meldonium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2301
02:02:09.250 --> 02:02:10.850
<v Speaker 2>according to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to gregory is,</v>

2302
02:02:10.851 --> 02:02:11.840
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2303
02:02:11.841 --> 02:02:12.674
<v Speaker 2>they've already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're already figuring out the next </v>

2304
02:02:14.901 --> 02:02:15.651
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next thing,</v>

2305
02:02:15.651 --> 02:02:16.850
<v Speaker 2>the next thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next thing</v>

2306
02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:18.133
<v Speaker 1>well spent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you have a state </v>

2307
02:02:18.901 --> 02:02:19.734
<v Speaker 1>sponsored program and there are no state</v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsored programs that we know of like </v>

2308
02:02:22.831 --> 02:02:23.664
<v Speaker 1>that in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that would give them a massive </v>

2309
02:02:25.561 --> 02:02:26.394
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>

2310
02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:27.441
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>

2311
02:02:27.441 --> 02:02:29.780
<v Speaker 2>We don't know of any program where.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2312
02:02:29.781 --> 02:02:34.781
<v Speaker 2>when you think about what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be like the equivalent of obama</v>

2313
02:02:35.391 --> 02:02:36.710
<v Speaker 2>or trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2314
02:02:36.711 --> 02:02:37.760
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2315
02:02:38.810 --> 02:02:42.170
<v Speaker 2>american athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to be on this program.</v>

2316
02:02:42.230 --> 02:02:45.800
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to be on the national </v>
<v Speaker 2>team and represent America,</v>

2317
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:48.920
<v Speaker 2>you go on this program and if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be on this program,</v>

2318
02:02:48.921 --> 02:02:52.480
<v Speaker 2>well you're not on the team and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2319
02:02:52.481 --> 02:02:53.314
<v Speaker 2>and what gregory was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was part of the whole ethical and </v>

2320
02:02:56.181 --> 02:02:57.014
<v Speaker 2>moral conundrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an interesting thing which we </v>

2321
02:02:58.551 --> 02:02:59.384
<v Speaker 2>never get into in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he was constantly being forced to </v>

2322
02:03:02.421 --> 02:03:05.840
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So part of this system,</v>

2323
02:03:05.841 --> 02:03:09.620
<v Speaker 2>the only way that it would work is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to have lamps.</v>

2324
02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:12.260
<v Speaker 2>If nobody ever tested positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2325
02:03:12.530 --> 02:03:13.363
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would look like there's something </v>

2326
02:03:14.721 --> 02:03:15.650
<v Speaker 2>wrong with the system.</v>

2327
02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:16.723
<v Speaker 2>So they had to have positive tests and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would consistently have positive </v>

2328
02:03:21.291 --> 02:03:23.690
<v Speaker 2>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guys who would test positive,</v>

2329
02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:24.913
<v Speaker 2>what they would do is they were the guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>who either were past champions that the </v>

2330
02:03:29.241 --> 02:03:30.860
<v Speaker 2>ministry looked at and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2331
02:03:30.861 --> 02:03:32.900
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to go and win another </v>
<v Speaker 2>gold medal.</v>

2332
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:35.780
<v Speaker 2>You're not know you're not who you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2333
02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Or it was an athlete who they believed </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be a champion,</v>

2334
02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:44.210
<v Speaker 2>never lived up to his potential and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the state program.</v>

2335
02:03:44.211 --> 02:03:45.044
<v Speaker 2>So they would sacrifice athletes along </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way to make it appear that the </v>

2336
02:03:48.471 --> 02:03:52.370
<v Speaker 2>system was catching them and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2337
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:53.263
<v Speaker 2>and that was a whole a conundrum for </v>
<v Speaker 2>gregory because he got to know a lot of </v>

2338
02:03:58.190 --> 02:04:01.250
<v Speaker 2>these guys and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these athletes would think that they</v>

2339
02:04:01.251 --> 02:04:02.084
<v Speaker 2>were being protected because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that they were on the state </v>

2340
02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:05.233
<v Speaker 2>state program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they think that they're being </v>

2341
02:04:06.591 --> 02:04:07.424
<v Speaker 2>protected and all of a sudden they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive and they're banned and they're </v>

2342
02:04:11.331 --> 02:04:12.070
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2343
02:04:12.070 --> 02:04:14.900
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you told me you told me to take this and</v>

2344
02:04:14.901 --> 02:04:16.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what do you mean on band?</v>

2345
02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:17.593
<v Speaker 2>You told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you told me I'd,</v>

2346
02:04:17.670 --> 02:04:22.060
<v Speaker 2>I'd be negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be like your positive jesus.</v>

2347
02:04:22.150 --> 02:04:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Well they were always positive so it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a matter of,</v>

2348
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:25.903
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of who to sacrifice and whether or not </v>

2349
02:04:29.091 --> 02:04:31.160
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would swap the urine.</v>

2350
02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:34.130
<v Speaker 2>He had this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never get intO,</v>

2351
02:04:34.131 --> 02:04:35.330
<v Speaker 2>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the film,</v>

2352
02:04:35.331 --> 02:04:40.331
<v Speaker 2>but this is mind blowing to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he had developed right after the,</v>

2353
02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:41.453
<v Speaker 2>the london olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figure out how to break into the </v>

2354
02:04:45.151 --> 02:04:45.931
<v Speaker 2>bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2355
02:04:45.931 --> 02:04:46.764
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they figure out how they can break into </v>

2356
02:04:48.241 --> 02:04:53.241
<v Speaker 2>these bottles and swapped the urine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he personally was never doing that.</v>

2357
02:04:53.521 --> 02:04:57.520
<v Speaker 2>what he would do is the fsb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys would come in,</v>

2358
02:04:57.550 --> 02:05:00.390
<v Speaker 2>they had this device and like once a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

2359
02:05:00.391 --> 02:05:01.224
<v Speaker 2>whenever they needed to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd come in and swap out all these b </v>

2360
02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:06.170
<v Speaker 2>samples that they'd keep in storage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2361
02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:07.620
<v Speaker 2>just for safe keeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

2362
02:05:07.621 --> 02:05:09.330
<v Speaker 2>a sample was always swapped.</v>

2363
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:12.000
<v Speaker 2>But the b sample,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would like,</v>

2364
02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:12.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't going to be a need to </v>

2365
02:05:13.861 --> 02:05:14.694
<v Speaker 2>retest it right that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they'd keep it for a week or </v>

2366
02:05:16.621 --> 02:05:19.170
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the guys would come in and they</v>

2367
02:05:19.171 --> 02:05:20.004
<v Speaker 2>would swap out all the samples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So part of this system was as he kept a </v>

2368
02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:29.840
<v Speaker 2>urine database,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he had 16,000</v>

2369
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:31.223
<v Speaker 2>matching urine samples that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding in the laboratory that they </v>

2370
02:05:35.401 --> 02:05:38.580
<v Speaker 2>should have all been disposed of after </v>
<v Speaker 2>three months according to the code.</v>

2371
02:05:38.850 --> 02:05:39.683
<v Speaker 2>So any international athlete that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>come into Russia to compete in the </v>

2372
02:05:42.121 --> 02:05:43.620
<v Speaker 2>games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

2373
02:05:43.650 --> 02:05:45.960
<v Speaker 2>gymnast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody competing in Russia.</v>

2374
02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:50.250
<v Speaker 2>And if they tested clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia would hold their urine,</v>

2375
02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:54.090
<v Speaker 2>put it down for the specific gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the steroid profile,</v>

2376
02:05:54.091 --> 02:05:56.850
<v Speaker 2>keep it in a database,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2377
02:05:56.880 --> 02:05:57.713
<v Speaker 2>the urine is being kept frozen so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would always have samples to swap for </v>

2378
02:06:01.051 --> 02:06:01.884
<v Speaker 2>any of the russian athletes at any time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they didn't have a clean sample </v>

2379
02:06:06.301 --> 02:06:07.350
<v Speaker 2>for that athlete.</v>

2380
02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:11.700
<v Speaker 2>So because most of the russian athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were on the program in sochi,</v>

2381
02:06:11.701 --> 02:06:12.534
<v Speaker 2>they took extraordinary precaution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They collected clean urine of each of </v>

2382
02:06:15.961 --> 02:06:19.590
<v Speaker 2>the athletes on the program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But outside of that,</v>

2383
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:21.660
<v Speaker 2>what they were doing was just going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2384
02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:25.140
<v Speaker 2>we have 16 thOusand samples to choose </v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

2385
02:06:25.530 --> 02:06:29.610
<v Speaker 2>So whatever is going to best match the </v>
<v Speaker 2>russian athlete to swap with,</v>

2386
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:32.400
<v Speaker 2>we can take the urine of another </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete,</v>

2387
02:06:32.610 --> 02:06:33.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2388
02:06:33.590 --> 02:06:34.423
<v Speaker 2>a clean athlete and make it look pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>much identical to that russian athletes </v>

2389
02:06:39.361 --> 02:06:41.490
<v Speaker 2>because they could choose from 16,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>samples.</v>

2390
02:06:41.550 --> 02:06:42.383
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had it all index as far as the </v>

2391
02:06:44.311 --> 02:06:45.144
<v Speaker 2>weight and index everything because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a color profile and everything was </v>

2392
02:06:48.271 --> 02:06:48.980
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2393
02:06:48.980 --> 02:06:49.813
<v Speaker 2>I got to see a spreadsheet and then on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the eve of this investigation breaking </v>

2394
02:06:54.820 --> 02:06:55.653
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and water's going to go raid this </v>

2395
02:06:57.451 --> 02:07:01.260
<v Speaker 2>laboratory and there's thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing samples and,</v>

2396
02:07:01.490 --> 02:07:02.323
<v Speaker 2>and then the report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this report that's 335 page report </v>

2397
02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:11.340
<v Speaker 2>tryIng to remember it was something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>1400 samples are missing or 1400 samples</v>

2398
02:07:12.301 --> 02:07:13.134
<v Speaker 2>were destroyed.</v>

2399
02:07:13.410 --> 02:07:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Will the real number was 8,200</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2400
02:07:18.541 --> 02:07:20.360
<v Speaker 2>It was truly 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>

2401
02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:22.530
<v Speaker 2>8,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>samples matching in two bottles,</v>

2402
02:07:22.531 --> 02:07:23.364
<v Speaker 2>16,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>samples and they had to bring in these </v>

2403
02:07:25.531 --> 02:07:29.340
<v Speaker 2>containers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>industrial trash containers and the dark</v>

2404
02:07:29.341 --> 02:07:30.174
<v Speaker 2>of night operation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emptying out the lab and bringing all </v>

2405
02:07:33.151 --> 02:07:33.984
<v Speaker 2>these bottles to some industrial trash </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they dumped them and crushed them </v>

2406
02:07:37.151 --> 02:07:39.250
<v Speaker 2>and incinerated them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2407
02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:41.860
<v Speaker 2>And so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this was,</v>

2408
02:07:41.890 --> 02:07:42.723
<v Speaker 2>this was a pretty nutty operation going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on and they did this for the collegiate </v>

2409
02:07:48.311 --> 02:07:49.540
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the.</v>

2410
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:52.900
<v Speaker 2>So the world junior track championships </v>
<v Speaker 2>were in Russia.</v>

2411
02:07:53.170 --> 02:07:54.003
<v Speaker 2>They did it for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did it for the swimming </v>

2412
02:07:55.181 --> 02:07:57.550
<v Speaker 2>championships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did for everything.</v>

2413
02:07:57.551 --> 02:07:59.770
<v Speaker 2>So they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were kids to any,</v>

2414
02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:02.230
<v Speaker 2>any of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of the collegiate athletes.</v>

2415
02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:04.690
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that all the athletes kept </v>
<v Speaker 2>her mouth shut,</v>

2416
02:08:05.090 --> 02:08:08.260
<v Speaker 2>no athlete got a bad conscience and </v>
<v Speaker 2>psych are,</v>

2417
02:08:08.290 --> 02:08:09.280
<v Speaker 2>can't do this anymore.</v>

2418
02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:11.170
<v Speaker 2>I need to come clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2419
02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:13.630
<v Speaker 2>there's been athletes that have come </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

2420
02:08:13.650 --> 02:08:14.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's been,</v>

2421
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:17.080
<v Speaker 2>whistleblowers has been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been multiple ones,</v>

2422
02:08:17.081 --> 02:08:18.130
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2423
02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:22.990
<v Speaker 2>what you start seeing in that system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very hard,</v>

2424
02:08:22.991 --> 02:08:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I think for an american to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2425
02:08:26.710 --> 02:08:31.630
<v Speaker 2>and we talked very openly against our </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

2426
02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:32.493
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in the current </v>

2427
02:08:33.161 --> 02:08:34.210
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2428
02:08:34.211 --> 02:08:35.910
<v Speaker 2>people are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2429
02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:40.780
<v Speaker 2>anti trump or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or pro trump or anti obama,</v>

2430
02:08:40.781 --> 02:08:41.960
<v Speaker 2>whatever that mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

2431
02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:43.810
<v Speaker 2>as americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2432
02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:44.673
<v Speaker 2>we do that and we had that mentality </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't in China and in Russia and other </v>

2433
02:08:49.841 --> 02:08:52.780
<v Speaker 2>countries like this go through communism</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>

2434
02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:53.973
<v Speaker 2>That mentality neveR goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mentality is always that the state </v>

2435
02:08:57.011 --> 02:08:59.470
<v Speaker 2>can take everything from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can put you in jail,</v>

2436
02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:02.110
<v Speaker 2>they can take your passport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can see your assets.</v>

2437
02:09:02.111 --> 02:09:04.000
<v Speaker 2>They can launch fake news against you.</v>

2438
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.510
<v Speaker 2>They can put you in jail just like they </v>
<v Speaker 2>did to gregory just like they're doing.</v>

2439
02:09:08.020 --> 02:09:11.110
<v Speaker 2>And so everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how powerful they all had that</v>

2440
02:09:11.230 --> 02:09:15.070
<v Speaker 2>fear of the government in their mind and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you See,</v>

2441
02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:20.080
<v Speaker 2>because I saw this firsthand in Russia </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I have some very wealthy,</v>

2442
02:09:20.141 --> 02:09:25.141
<v Speaker 2>very powerful russian friends and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>will never talk bad about the government</v>

2443
02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:30.430
<v Speaker 2>in public everywhere now off camera or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2444
02:09:30.431 --> 02:09:32.700
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And closed doors one-on-one.</v>

2445
02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:33.281
<v Speaker 2>There'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2446
02:09:33.281 --> 02:09:33.701
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2447
02:09:33.701 --> 02:09:34.534
<v Speaker 2>I dOn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2448
02:09:34.890 --> 02:09:36.370

<v Speaker 2>they'll tell you how it is.</v>

2449
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:37.383
<v Speaker 2>But in public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if among their friends in a social </v>

2450
02:09:39.401 --> 02:09:40.234
<v Speaker 2>setting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always this belief that </v>

2451
02:09:41.831 --> 02:09:42.664
<v Speaker 2>somebody's watching you or somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>might rat you out or somehow you're </v>

2452
02:09:45.761 --> 02:09:46.594
<v Speaker 2>going to lose your wealth or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you're going to cross the paths of </v>

2453
02:09:49.871 --> 02:09:51.250
<v Speaker 2>wrong person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we've,</v>

2454

<v Speaker 2>what we've seen in all these stories </v>

2529
02:13:16.930 --> 02:13:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2530
02:13:17.971 --> 02:13:21.330
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy and they put them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail for quite a long time.</v>

2531
02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Ten years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years in jail.</v>

2532
02:13:22.891 --> 02:13:24.760
<v Speaker 1>And just let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2533
02:13:24.761 --> 02:13:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

2534
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:26.530
<v Speaker 1>don't mess with Russia.</v>

2535
02:13:26.710 --> 02:13:30.010
<v Speaker 1>But even the letting go thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just amazing that they just decided</v>

2536
02:13:30.011 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 1>to let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they put them in jail,</v>

2537
02:13:32.131 --> 02:13:33.700
<v Speaker 1>took all his money and then go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2538
02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:35.060

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2539
02:13:35.070 --> 02:13:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Well once he was no longer a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2540
02:13:37.021 --> 02:13:39.270
<v Speaker 1>But it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also a learned his lesson.</v>

2541
02:13:39.450 --> 02:13:42.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a let everybody know like this can </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to you.</v>

2542
02:13:42.450 --> 02:13:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2543
02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:47.370
<v Speaker 1>And by freeing him but also like lets </v>
<v Speaker 1>them know like you see what happens,</v>

2544
02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:50.070
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to mess with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna pay the price.</v>

2545
02:13:50.110 --> 02:13:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2546
02:13:51.590 --> 02:13:52.170
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

2547
02:13:52.170 --> 02:13:53.880
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of what's going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2548
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:55.223
<v Speaker 1>in the us right now with all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>allegations after seeing the film or </v>

2549
02:13:59.071 --> 02:14:00.310
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's your head at?</v>

2550
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:01.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't put the two of them together </v>

2551
02:14:02.191 --> 02:14:03.024
<v Speaker 1>because when I was watching the film </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially I was just thinking about </v>

2552
02:14:04.621 --> 02:14:06.510
<v Speaker 1>the anti-doping ramifications.</v>

2553
02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:07.793
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's pretty obvious that if </v>

2554
02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:13.100
<v Speaker 1>they're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>

2555
02:14:13.410 --> 02:14:14.243
<v Speaker 1>And there's seems to be a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that they have at least </v>

2556
02:14:17.671 --> 02:14:19.450
<v Speaker 1>attempted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a,</v>

2557
02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:21.720
<v Speaker 1>there were sOme new thing recently about</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook ads,</v>

2558
02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:23.130
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter at.</v>

2559
02:14:23.131 --> 02:14:23.964
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's definitely something </v>

2560
02:14:25.111 --> 02:14:27.600
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're doing it too,</v>

2561
02:14:27.690 --> 02:14:29.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing it to them.</v>

2562
02:14:29.250 --> 02:14:30.083
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially been a part of global </v>

2563
02:14:31.531 --> 02:14:33.030
<v Speaker 1>politics forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2564
02:14:33.031 --> 02:14:36.330
<v Speaker 1>we influence their elections and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just there as we influence the elections</v>

2565
02:14:36.331 --> 02:14:39.000
<v Speaker 1>of countless countries all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2566
02:14:39.210 --> 02:14:41.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Gross.</v>

2567
02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:41.933
<v Speaker 1>It's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only thing that I can think is </v>

2568
02:14:43.141 --> 02:14:47.310
<v Speaker 1>that with the information age that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>currently experiencing,</v>

2569
02:14:47.370 --> 02:14:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I think I feel like we're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescence of this and that.</v>

2570
02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.530
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what seems to highlight this age is that</v>

2571
02:14:56.010 --> 02:14:56.843
<v Speaker 1>the distance between people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>information just keeps getting shorter </v>

2572
02:14:59.311 --> 02:15:02.850
<v Speaker 1>and shorter and the aBility to hide </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2573
02:15:02.940 --> 02:15:07.590
<v Speaker 1>hide devious acts and hide money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hide influence.</v>

2574
02:15:07.590 --> 02:15:12.590
<v Speaker 1>And hide manipulation seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be able to.</v>

2575
02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:17.250
<v Speaker 1>The people seem to be able to find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>things quicker and quicker now.</v>

2576
02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:20.900
<v Speaker 1>And I was having a conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this the other day where,</v>

2577
02:15:21.390 --> 02:15:23.120
<v Speaker 1>where if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2578
02:15:23.140 --> 02:15:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at the instagram age and </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook and everything.</v>

2579
02:15:25.681 --> 02:15:26.514
<v Speaker 1>Everybody seems to know everything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone and that anything eventually </v>

2580
02:15:31.051 --> 02:15:32.670
<v Speaker 1>comes out in the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2581
02:15:32.671 --> 02:15:33.504
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're experiencing the adolescents of </v>

2582
02:15:35.161 --> 02:15:35.994
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's gonna come a point in </v>

2583
02:15:36.961 --> 02:15:37.794
<v Speaker 1>time with an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's going to be through </v>

2584
02:15:38.731 --> 02:15:39.564
<v Speaker 1>technological innovation that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be able to read each other's </v>

2585
02:15:41.221 --> 02:15:43.110
<v Speaker 1>minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's inevitable.</v>

2586
02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:44.033
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea of the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you went to someone in the 18 </v>

2587
02:15:46.231 --> 02:15:47.910
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and told them one day you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna,</v>

2588
02:15:47.911 --> 02:15:49.500
<v Speaker 1>be able to talk to your phone and ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>your phone,</v>

2589
02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:50.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of different questions that are </v>

2590
02:15:51.831 --> 02:15:53.040
<v Speaker 1>literally give you the answer.</v>

2591
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:55.440
<v Speaker 1>They would go with the fuck as a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2592
02:15:55.441 --> 02:15:56.670
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

2593
02:15:56.820 --> 02:15:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's a crazy person.</v>

2594
02:15:59.191 --> 02:16:00.880
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about witchcraft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2595
02:16:00.890 --> 02:16:01.191
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2596
02:16:01.191 --> 02:16:02.024
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about all the world being </v>

2597
02:16:02.761 --> 02:16:04.440
<v Speaker 1>connected and you'll be able to share </v>
<v Speaker 1>photos.</v>

2598
02:16:04.650 --> 02:16:05.483
<v Speaker 1>What's a photo will be able to capture </v>
<v Speaker 1>time with a small device in your pocket </v>

2599
02:16:08.790 --> 02:16:09.623
<v Speaker 1>and video as well with perfect sound and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be able to download hundreds of </v>

2600
02:16:14.580 --> 02:16:16.860
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of hours of music and put it on</v>

2601
02:16:16.861 --> 02:16:18.330
<v Speaker 1>your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be able to listen to that.</v>

2602
02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:22.170
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like recorded music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fuck are you talking about?</v>

2603
02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:23.940
<v Speaker 1>This is just a couple of hundred years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

2604
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we goinG to experience a couple</v>

2605
02:16:26.251 --> 02:16:27.084
<v Speaker 1>of hundred years from now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to be able to read </v>

2606
02:16:28.291 --> 02:16:31.300
<v Speaker 1>each other's minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea that we're a way,</v>

2607
02:16:31.301 --> 02:16:35.590
<v Speaker 1>the way we operate now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our operating system of language,</v>

2608
02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:40.060
<v Speaker 1>the way we communicate with each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>through mouth noises and that you have a</v>

2609
02:16:40.090 --> 02:16:40.810
<v Speaker 1>dictionary.</v>

2610
02:16:40.810 --> 02:16:44.080
<v Speaker 1>We understand what the noises are and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

2611
02:16:44.081 --> 02:16:46.750
<v Speaker 1>You say some things like the entire time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been talking here,</v>

2612
02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:47.753
<v Speaker 1>I have referred to my database of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information so I know exactly what he's </v>

2613
02:16:50.801 --> 02:16:53.240
<v Speaker 1>saying and yell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian means this and he means,</v>

2614
02:16:53.590 --> 02:16:54.423
<v Speaker 1>as you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the people that are listening are </v>

2615
02:16:55.421 --> 02:16:56.254
<v Speaker 1>doing the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is entirely possible that in </v>

2616
02:16:58.811 --> 02:17:02.020
<v Speaker 1>the future we will swap that out for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of universal system,</v>

2617
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:03.063
<v Speaker 1>some sort of universal system that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurologically connected that we're </v>

2618
02:17:07.301 --> 02:17:10.210
<v Speaker 1>going to have something that is either </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded into our minds,</v>

2619
02:17:10.420 --> 02:17:12.490
<v Speaker 1>embedded into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into our brain itself,</v>

2620
02:17:12.491 --> 02:17:15.550
<v Speaker 1>embedded into our neurological system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's minority report.</v>

2621
02:17:15.610 --> 02:17:16.443
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just inevitable if </v>

2622
02:17:18.281 --> 02:17:19.114
<v Speaker 1>technology keeps going and We keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressing and there's no reason to </v>

2623
02:17:21.881 --> 02:17:25.030
<v Speaker 1>think other than some sort of a natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>disaster or some sort of a human created</v>

2624
02:17:25.031 --> 02:17:25.864
<v Speaker 1>disaster that it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't keep going the way it's </v>

2625
02:17:27.731 --> 02:17:28.900
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going,</v>

2626
02:17:28.901 --> 02:17:31.570
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get to someplace where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can see each other's minds.</v>

2627
02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:35.470
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be able to read each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other's thoughts and for good or bad,</v>

2628
02:17:35.530 --> 02:17:39.020
<v Speaker 1>and I tend to think both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both good and bad.</v>

2629
02:17:39.050 --> 02:17:40.270
<v Speaker 1>we're going to long for the good old </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

2630
02:17:40.271 --> 02:17:41.104
<v Speaker 1>When you have some privaCy going along </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the good old days of you can keep a </v>

2631
02:17:43.181 --> 02:17:43.930
<v Speaker 1>secret.</v>

2632
02:17:43.930 --> 02:17:44.201
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2633
02:17:44.201 --> 02:17:45.034
<v Speaker 2>because right now we're already in an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an era where almost anything is </v>

2634
02:17:48.401 --> 02:17:49.980
<v Speaker 2>discoverable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

2635
02:17:49.981 --> 02:17:51.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>

2636
02:17:51.820 --> 02:17:52.653
<v Speaker 2>nothing is private anymore and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>always something to come out and then </v>

2637
02:17:56.681 --> 02:17:58.930
<v Speaker 2>there's some sort of electronic trail of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2638
02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:01.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean even in the oe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we don't,</v>

2639
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:03.110
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2640
02:18:03.540 --> 02:18:06.250
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't know about the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way that,</v>

2641
02:18:06.251 --> 02:18:07.084
<v Speaker 2>that evidence was truly corroborate it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the electronic trail and here's the </v>

2642
02:18:10.661 --> 02:18:13.120
<v Speaker 2>amazing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which people probably don't realize it.</v>

2643
02:18:13.121 --> 02:18:15.840
<v Speaker 2>So like gregory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he comes to the us,</v>

2644
02:18:15.850 --> 02:18:20.850
<v Speaker 2>he had erased all of his phones because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was under the ministry order to erase</v>

2645
02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:21.930
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2646
02:18:21.930 --> 02:18:22.763
<v Speaker 2>and what was happening was the athletes </v>
<v Speaker 2>were snapping a photo of their doping </v>

2647
02:18:25.841 --> 02:18:29.250
<v Speaker 2>control forms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's how gregory would know what,</v>

2648
02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:31.510
<v Speaker 2>what number corresponded to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete.</v>

2649
02:18:31.511 --> 02:18:32.344
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was very intricate how this was </v>

2650
02:18:33.431 --> 02:18:36.250
<v Speaker 2>going down because nobody in the lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2651
02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:37.533
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're the scientist and you're </v>

2652
02:18:38.441 --> 02:18:41.290
<v Speaker 2>getting armstrong sample,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what's armstrong sample.</v>

2653
02:18:41.290 --> 02:18:42.850
<v Speaker 2>It's numbered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a seven,</v>

2654
02:18:42.910 --> 02:18:45.250
<v Speaker 2>eight digit number on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a random number.</v>

2655
02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:49.090
<v Speaker 2>But so What the russians were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were snapping a photo of her doping</v>

2656
02:18:49.091 --> 02:18:50.890
<v Speaker 2>control form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which only they could do,</v>

2657
02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:54.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they were sending this photo to</v>

2658
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:55.840
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2659
02:18:56.110 --> 02:18:56.943
<v Speaker 2>an fsb agent who was also a coach and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she would send the photo to gregory and </v>

2660
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:03.063
<v Speaker 2>the kgb guy in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the lab who was assisting him and so </v>

2661
02:19:06.851 --> 02:19:09.340
<v Speaker 2>that they would know that that number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>

2662
02:19:09.341 --> 02:19:10.151
<v Speaker 2>one seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

2663
02:19:10.151 --> 02:19:13.390
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corresponded to this athlete,</v>

2664
02:19:13.810 --> 02:19:16.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point that I'm getting at is that,</v>

2665
02:19:16.931 --> 02:19:17.764
<v Speaker 2>so he was erased all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They told them to erase it all from his </v>

2666
02:19:20.951 --> 02:19:22.540
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the computers,</v>

2667
02:19:22.541 --> 02:19:23.760
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he comes here,</v>

2668
02:19:23.761 --> 02:19:27.920
<v Speaker 2>he brings his old computer and he brings</v>
<v Speaker 2>his old phones because this guy,</v>

2669
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:32.660
<v Speaker 2>he just knows and when he turns over all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence to,</v>

2670
02:19:33.070 --> 02:19:35.300
<v Speaker 2>to water and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2671
02:19:35.330 --> 02:19:36.320
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2672
02:19:36.650 --> 02:19:37.483
<v Speaker 2>and the us authorities and interpol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're able to do is they're able </v>

2673
02:19:42.441 --> 02:19:43.274
<v Speaker 2>to get all this erased information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this array stuff that was on his </v>

2674
02:19:48.261 --> 02:19:49.730
<v Speaker 2>phone and computer and retrieve it.</v>

2675
02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:52.333
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's like a massive portion of </v>

2676
02:19:56.961 --> 02:19:58.360
<v Speaker 2>this evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2677
02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:01.700
<v Speaker 2>What they were also able to do is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we probably don't realize,</v>

2678
02:20:01.701 --> 02:20:04.700
<v Speaker 2>and this goes into what you're saying is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you send an email,</v>

2679
02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:07.330
<v Speaker 2>if you've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2680
02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:08.273
<v Speaker 2>the metadata behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like he was getting emails sent </v>

2681
02:20:11.181 --> 02:20:13.160
<v Speaker 2>through the russian ministry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're sitting there going,</v>

2682
02:20:13.161 --> 02:20:16.100
<v Speaker 2>well how do you know where this came </v>
<v Speaker 2>from?</v>

2683
02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:17.533
<v Speaker 2>They can go back in the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the metadata that is being sent </v>

2684
02:20:21.441 --> 02:20:25.880
<v Speaker 2>into computer and show exactly from what</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>

2685
02:20:25.890 --> 02:20:30.890
<v Speaker 2>where date time that email was sent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how they were able to corroborate</v>

2686
02:20:31.341 --> 02:20:35.750
<v Speaker 2>all his evidence through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through basically forensics of,</v>

2687
02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:36.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2688
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:39.900
<v Speaker 2>whatever that study is of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of electronic forensics.</v>

2689
02:20:39.901 --> 02:20:42.200
<v Speaker 2>So When you talk about reading minds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff,</v>

2690
02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean half of that technology is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is already there.</v>

2691
02:20:45.890 --> 02:20:46.401
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

2692
02:20:46.401 --> 02:20:48.890
<v Speaker 2>any photo you take on your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you delete it,</v>

2693
02:20:48.891 --> 02:20:52.370
<v Speaker 2>they can get it back and they can figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out exactly where you were,</v>

2694
02:20:52.371 --> 02:20:54.020
<v Speaker 2>where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said how it was sent,</v>

2695
02:20:54.021 --> 02:20:57.890
<v Speaker 2>the spot that you sent it from where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nuts and it's going to get crazier.</v>

2696
02:20:58.010 --> 02:20:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Just going to get crazier.</v>

2697
02:20:58.970 --> 02:20:59.803
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure there's gonna be some new </v>

2698
02:21:00.741 --> 02:21:01.574
<v Speaker 1>technologies to couple of years from now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to make it even easier to </v>

2699
02:21:03.921 --> 02:21:04.754
<v Speaker 1>do than that.</v>

2700
02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:06.960
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you read about,</v>

2701
02:21:06.961 --> 02:21:07.794
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all these apps with encryption </v>

2702
02:21:08.731 --> 02:21:12.600
<v Speaker 2>software and stuff and a maverick given </v>
<v Speaker 2>up the idea that,</v>

2703
02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:14.940
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2704
02:21:14.941 --> 02:21:17.490
<v Speaker 2>that you can be essentially invisible or</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>

2705
02:21:18.180 --> 02:21:19.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2706
02:21:19.231 --> 02:21:21.000
<v Speaker 2>that if somebody wants to get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

2707
02:21:21.001 --> 02:21:22.110
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get your information.</v>

2708
02:21:22.690 --> 02:21:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unquestionably.</v>

2709
02:21:24.370 --> 02:21:25.203
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing that's really interesting </v>

2710
02:21:26.081 --> 02:21:26.914
<v Speaker 1>is that we're looking at photos when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at video and email and </v>

2711
02:21:30.281 --> 02:21:32.650
<v Speaker 1>we're assuming that is going to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>

2712
02:21:32.980 --> 02:21:35.230
<v Speaker 1>more access to photo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more access to email,</v>

2713
02:21:35.231 --> 02:21:37.150
<v Speaker 1>more access to video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>

2714
02:21:37.230 --> 02:21:39.340
<v Speaker 1>what is coming down the pipe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2715
02:21:39.341 --> 02:21:40.750
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the new thing?</v>

2716
02:21:41.140 --> 02:21:41.641
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2717
02:21:41.641 --> 02:21:42.474
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there could be something that's even </v>

2718
02:21:43.121 --> 02:21:43.954
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazier than video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're just assuming that it's </v>

2719
02:21:47.321 --> 02:21:50.590
<v Speaker 1>going to stay video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to stay photos like why those</v>

2720
02:21:50.591 --> 02:21:52.480
<v Speaker 1>things didn't even exist a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years ago.</v>

2721
02:21:52.730 --> 02:21:53.563
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that's going on now is going </v>

2722
02:21:54.531 --> 02:21:56.400
<v Speaker 2>into this world of vr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2723
02:21:56.600 --> 02:21:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Where essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2724
02:21:58.040 --> 02:21:59.180
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2725
02:21:59.181 --> 02:22:00.014
<v Speaker 2>the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that as you can see things and you </v>

2726
02:22:01.971 --> 02:22:02.804
<v Speaker 2>can create your own reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's lots of discussion even </v>

2727
02:22:05.901 --> 02:22:07.940
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world of sex that,</v>

2728
02:22:07.941 --> 02:22:08.774
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sex of the future is why do you </v>

2729
02:22:10.491 --> 02:22:12.380
<v Speaker 2>really need a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2730
02:22:12.381 --> 02:22:13.214
<v Speaker 2>another human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can essentially simulate that and </v>

2731
02:22:16.770 --> 02:22:19.860
<v Speaker 2>program it and make it everything you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted and more.</v>

2732
02:22:19.890 --> 02:22:21.560
<v Speaker 2>I never know the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2733
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:22.471
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2734
02:22:22.471 --> 02:22:25.140
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through augmented reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtual reality,</v>

2735
02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:27.210
<v Speaker 1>robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>

2736
02:22:27.211 --> 02:22:31.620
<v Speaker 1>we're just a few steps away from all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff and if it's not 10 years from</v>

2737
02:22:31.621 --> 02:22:32.610
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 50.</v>

2738
02:22:32.930 --> 02:22:34.380
<v Speaker 1>If it's not 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 100.</v>

2739
02:22:34.530 --> 02:22:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human beings don't destroy ourselves.</v>

2740
02:22:38.311 --> 02:22:39.144
<v Speaker 1>We stay alive long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to see a complete desolving </v>

2741
02:22:43.381 --> 02:22:44.610
<v Speaker 1>of reality as we know it.</v>

2742
02:22:44.990 --> 02:22:45.823
<v Speaker 3>Which I think even goes into like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole anti-doping world of it in sports </v>

2743
02:22:50.421 --> 02:22:51.450
<v Speaker 3>where he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2744
02:22:51.451 --> 02:22:52.284
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually just made me think about </v>

2745
02:22:53.301 --> 02:22:55.700
<v Speaker 3>like terminator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're sitting there going,</v>

2746
02:22:55.701 --> 02:22:59.480
<v Speaker 3>well wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think it's a real person and,</v>

2747
02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:01.880
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a terminator,</v>

2748
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.983
<v Speaker 3>but you think of all the technologies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are going on right now and why </v>

2749
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.823
<v Speaker 3>won't there be a chip in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in yOur brain that basically takes away </v>

2750
02:23:11.571 --> 02:23:13.580
<v Speaker 3>pain so that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2751
02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:17.630
<v Speaker 3>persevere in an mma fight that takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>away your,</v>

2752
02:23:17.631 --> 02:23:18.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

2753
02:23:18.930 --> 02:23:22.160
<v Speaker 3>all these different technologies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are essentially create,</v>

2754
02:23:22.161 --> 02:23:23.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>controlling your synapses,</v>

2755
02:23:23.781 --> 02:23:26.630
<v Speaker 3>controlling your reflexes all it's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2756
02:23:27.210 --> 02:23:29.060
<v Speaker 3>And how is that not gonna happen?</v>

2757
02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:32.030
<v Speaker 1>And then obviously in enhancing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human body itself,</v>

2758
02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:32.893
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a technology that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking about recently where they </v>

2759
02:23:34.941 --> 02:23:35.774
<v Speaker 1>were trying to combine spider silk with </v>
<v Speaker 1>human skin tissue to make an artificial </v>

2760
02:23:41.841 --> 02:23:44.090
<v Speaker 1>skin a replacement skin that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof.</v>

2761
02:23:45.680 --> 02:23:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just blew my mind.</v>

2762
02:23:48.530 --> 02:23:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just blew my mom there.</v>

2763
02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:53.180
<v Speaker 1>They're going to genetically engineer </v>
<v Speaker 1>human skin,</v>

2764
02:23:53.181 --> 02:23:54.014
<v Speaker 1>so it'll look like humans scan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll have much of the same properties </v>

2765
02:23:56.421 --> 02:23:57.254
<v Speaker 1>of human skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll be bulletproof because it'll </v>

2766
02:24:00.590 --> 02:24:02.030
<v Speaker 1>be you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be you.</v>

2767
02:24:02.110 --> 02:24:03.530
<v Speaker 1>You'll replace your skin,</v>

2768
02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:05.623
<v Speaker 3>and then how do they stop?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the power of that bullet would </v>

2769
02:24:07.821 --> 02:24:09.260
<v Speaker 3>still be up.</v>

2770
02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:10.050
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2771
02:24:10.050 --> 02:24:10.883
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do some some tissue trauma </v>

2772
02:24:12.831 --> 02:24:17.270
<v Speaker 1>underneath the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the actual skin itself won't break.</v>

2773
02:24:17.390 --> 02:24:19.790
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like having a bulletproof vest </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of your body.</v>

2774
02:24:20.030 --> 02:24:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what kevlar essentially is.</v>

2775
02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:22.753
<v Speaker 1>What cavalera is is a material that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so dense and so it's so thick and so </v>

2776
02:24:28.011 --> 02:24:28.844
<v Speaker 1>impenetrable that when You shoot a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular bullet into the regular bullet </v>

2777
02:24:31.521 --> 02:24:32.354
<v Speaker 1>hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does not go through it and just </v>

2778
02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:34.693
<v Speaker 1>spreads out and expands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still very painful for the person </v>

2779
02:24:37.041 --> 02:24:37.874
<v Speaker 1>who gets shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it protects your life and we could </v>

2780
02:24:40.251 --> 02:24:43.490
<v Speaker 1>easily see that happen with entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>body's made out of that stuff.</v>

2781
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.823
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to believe it's priority out </v>

2782
02:24:45.731 --> 02:24:47.500
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in some secret lab,</v>

2783
02:24:47.530 --> 02:24:52.530
<v Speaker 3>they are like develop the skin and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in like a in like a petri dish.</v>

2784
02:24:52.781 --> 02:24:54.100
<v Speaker 3>That's bulletproof skin.</v>

2785
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:55.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm reading it on a sCience website </v>

2786
02:24:56.420 --> 02:24:57.253
<v Speaker 1>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the first one to get the </v>

2787
02:24:58.011 --> 02:24:58.791
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2788
02:24:58.791 --> 02:25:01.010
<v Speaker 1>this is getting to the highest level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2789
02:25:01.220 --> 02:25:02.750
<v Speaker 1>where is the real money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2790
02:25:02.780 --> 02:25:05.240
<v Speaker 1>It's the real question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know this answer,</v>

2791
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:09.440
<v Speaker 1>is the top scientists in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top innovators in the world.</v>

2792
02:25:09.441 --> 02:25:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when do they scoop those people up?</v>

2793
02:25:11.151 --> 02:25:12.800
<v Speaker 1>When does the government come in with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2794
02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:15.600
<v Speaker 1>some black ops money and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2795
02:25:15.950 --> 02:25:16.783
<v Speaker 1>we would like to hire you and give you x</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money to create this and this </v>

2796
02:25:21.021 --> 02:25:23.710
<v Speaker 1>is what we know so far about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2797
02:25:23.711 --> 02:25:24.544
<v Speaker 1>here we're going to take you to groom </v>
<v Speaker 1>lake out in the middle of Nevada and </v>

2798
02:25:26.590 --> 02:25:28.810
<v Speaker 1>show you some lab that you didn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>know existed.</v>

2799
02:25:28.890 --> 02:25:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to beLieve it.</v>

2800
02:25:29.821 --> 02:25:34.740
<v Speaker 2>That's already way into going on because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing that we spend more money</v>

2801
02:25:34.741 --> 02:25:38.790
<v Speaker 2>on than military basically defense than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2802
02:25:38.791 --> 02:25:42.870
<v Speaker 2>This is what we spend money on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is actually,</v>

2803
02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:43.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2804
02:25:43.860 --> 02:25:45.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you probably know the,</v>

2805
02:25:45.860 --> 02:25:48.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read that the single biggest export</v>

2806
02:25:48.660 --> 02:25:51.700
<v Speaker 2>of the United States is our weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2807
02:25:52.050 --> 02:25:54.990
<v Speaker 2>That's what we make and sell to the rest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>

2808
02:25:55.020 --> 02:25:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We saw them and stuff.</v>

2809
02:25:55.861 --> 02:25:57.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not as good as the stuff we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>making right now.</v>

2810
02:25:57.480 --> 02:26:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Right now we sell the world our weapons </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

2811
02:26:00.690 --> 02:26:01.523
<v Speaker 2>and that is what is employing like </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions and millions of people in this </v>

2812
02:26:05.821 --> 02:26:07.430
<v Speaker 2>country is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is basically the,</v>

2813
02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:10.500
<v Speaker 2>our military and our defense and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately,</v>

2814
02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:12.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing spider skin.</v>

2815
02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:13.793
<v Speaker 1>YeAh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this and this is what we're </v>

2816
02:26:14.521 --> 02:26:15.181
<v Speaker 1>seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2817
02:26:15.181 --> 02:26:16.014
<v Speaker 1>This is what we get to see and look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows how many different programs </v>

2818
02:26:18.421 --> 02:26:22.290
<v Speaker 1>are going on right now as we're speaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have no knowledge of whatsoever.</v>

2819
02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:25.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean when they released the stealth </v>
<v Speaker 1>bomber and a couple other,</v>

2820
02:26:25.471 --> 02:26:28.930
<v Speaker 1>there's these like a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2821
02:26:29.130 --> 02:26:33.150
<v Speaker 1>experimental vehicles where they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting together these things once they,</v>

2822
02:26:33.230 --> 02:26:35.730
<v Speaker 1>they actually released them when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually put,</v>

2823
02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:37.890
<v Speaker 1>had press conferences and showed people </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2824
02:26:38.100 --> 02:26:39.720
<v Speaker 1>they had been working on these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

2825
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.720
<v Speaker 1>It means</v>

2826
02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:43.960
<v Speaker 2>under wraps for like 20 years and all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sudden you see the singer like,</v>

2827
02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:46.420
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen one person a stealth?</v>

2828
02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:47.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2829
02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:48.463
<v Speaker 1>I was in palmdale and that's near </v>
<v Speaker 1>edwards air force base and we were </v>

2830
02:26:51.741 --> 02:26:52.574
<v Speaker 1>filming fear factor out there and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>was right after September 11th and so </v>

2831
02:26:55.491 --> 02:26:56.324
<v Speaker 1>they were doing all these exercises and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things were flying over the </v>

2832
02:26:57.921 --> 02:27:00.020
<v Speaker 1>desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like being in star wars.</v>

2833
02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:02.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean once you see them in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2834
02:27:02.091 --> 02:27:04.490
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking ufo.</v>

2835
02:27:04.850 --> 02:27:09.020
<v Speaker 1>this black thing not shaped like any </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane you've ever seen before,</v>

2836
02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:12.460
<v Speaker 1>flying across the sky and you just look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it a little.</v>

2837
02:27:12.470 --> 02:27:14.840
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that thing?</v>

2838
02:27:15.210 --> 02:27:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like 20 years old now.</v>

2839
02:27:17.220 --> 02:27:18.053
<v Speaker 2>All the shit.</v>

2840
02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:20.210
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2841
02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:21.073
<v Speaker 1>I mean about what's out there now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they probably have some </v>

2842
02:27:22.641 --> 02:27:25.700
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous stuff and then there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical ideas.</v>

2843
02:27:25.701 --> 02:27:26.534
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the magnetic drives they're trying to </v>

2844
02:27:27.801 --> 02:27:28.730
<v Speaker 1>put together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some.</v>

2845
02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:30.033
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of speculation about </v>

2846
02:27:32.241 --> 02:27:33.860
<v Speaker 1>different types of weapons that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>

2847
02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:37.610
<v Speaker 1>to anti-matter weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some things that are going to be able to</v>

2848
02:27:37.611 --> 02:27:40.310
<v Speaker 1>just completely annihilate anything they</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch,</v>

2849
02:27:40.340 --> 02:27:42.260
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they're going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely through the earth.</v>

2850
02:27:42.261 --> 02:27:46.580
<v Speaker 1>If you hit things and who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what's on the horizon.</v>

2851
02:27:46.610 --> 02:27:47.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're just going to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting better and better at blowing </v>

2852
02:27:49.251 --> 02:27:50.750
<v Speaker 1>shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2853
02:27:50.770 --> 02:27:51.603
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of power that we have with </v>

2854
02:27:53.181 --> 02:27:54.014
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear arsenal today and the amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of power and the weapons in comparison </v>

2855
02:27:57.171 --> 02:28:02.171
<v Speaker 1>to the weapons that we used in hiroshima</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nagasaki is insane.</v>

2856
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.943
<v Speaker 1>It's not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are hundreds and hundreds </v>

2857
02:28:06.051 --> 02:28:06.950
<v Speaker 1>of times more powerful.</v>

2858
02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:07.873
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's staggering to kind of understand </v>

2859
02:28:10.061 --> 02:28:13.390
<v Speaker 2>what kind of destruction is possible and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the like.</v>

2860
02:28:13.570 --> 02:28:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think on the level of what we're</v>

2861
02:28:15.281 --> 02:28:17.940
<v Speaker 2>seeing in natural destruction of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature can do alone,</v>

2862
02:28:17.941 --> 02:28:18.440
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2863
02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:20.900
<v Speaker 1>But it's also fascinating when you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the,</v>

2864
02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:22.160
<v Speaker 1>that your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2865
02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.360
<v Speaker 1>your film is sort of brought to light is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of this destruction,</v>

2866
02:28:26.361 --> 02:28:27.770
<v Speaker 1>like when you were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine,</v>

2867
02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:31.070
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this destruction and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2868
02:28:31.290 --> 02:28:35.670
<v Speaker 1>the confidence that they have to go into</v>
<v Speaker 1>these places and,</v>

2869
02:28:35.671 --> 02:28:38.960
<v Speaker 1>and use these weapons is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent upon public opinion.</v>

2870
02:28:38.961 --> 02:28:40.340
<v Speaker 1>That's dependent upon sport,</v>

2871
02:28:40.470 --> 02:28:41.303
<v Speaker 2>rIght?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And be dependent on basically kicking </v>

2872
02:28:42.691 --> 02:28:43.524
<v Speaker 2>somebody else's ass without the weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that allows you to almost like </v>

2873
02:28:47.881 --> 02:28:51.780
<v Speaker 2>weaponized because you have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of the country behind you,</v>

2874
02:28:52.100 --> 02:28:52.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

2875
02:28:52.770 --> 02:28:57.470
<v Speaker 2>what was interesting is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is um,</v>

2876
02:28:57.780 --> 02:29:02.780
<v Speaker 2>after sochi and putin's a rating goes up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to 95 percent or something like that,</v>

2877
02:29:03.890 --> 02:29:04.723
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody in Russia supported him </v>

2878
02:29:07.171 --> 02:29:09.120
<v Speaker 2>going into Ukraine too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2879
02:29:09.690 --> 02:29:11.390
<v Speaker 2>this was a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

2880
02:29:11.660 --> 02:29:13.080
<v Speaker 2>we're strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're powerful.</v>

2881
02:29:13.081 --> 02:29:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Let's go in and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and take back,</v>

2882
02:29:15.130 --> 02:29:16.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of territory that,</v>

2883
02:29:16.751 --> 02:29:17.584
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2884
02:29:17.610 --> 02:29:19.110
<v Speaker 2>that we lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's go do it.</v>

2885
02:29:19.380 --> 02:29:20.130
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2886
02:29:20.130 --> 02:29:21.480
<v Speaker 2>and you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2887
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:22.343
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of nationalistic pride is </v>

2888
02:29:25.231 --> 02:29:26.700
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2889
02:29:26.970 --> 02:29:28.590
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in,</v>

2890
02:29:28.591 --> 02:29:30.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Colorado,</v>

2891
02:29:30.031 --> 02:29:30.811
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2892
02:29:30.811 --> 02:29:35.811
<v Speaker 2>denver bronco territory and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people would paint and they still</v>

2893
02:29:36.361 --> 02:29:36.991
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2894
02:29:36.991 --> 02:29:37.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around football.</v>

2895
02:29:37.770 --> 02:29:41.120
<v Speaker 2>So you driving around the city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see thousands of houses painted it,</v>

2896
02:29:41.130 --> 02:29:43.260
<v Speaker 2>orange and blue people are in orange and</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue.</v>

2897
02:29:43.261 --> 02:29:44.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's literally,</v>

2898
02:29:44.971 --> 02:29:46.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cult.</v>

2899
02:29:46.890 --> 02:29:49.590
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is an ethos.</v>

2900
02:29:49.650 --> 02:29:52.230
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's something to even fight about.</v>

2901
02:29:52.890 --> 02:29:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk bad about the broncos were.</v>

2902
02:29:56.100 --> 02:29:56.933
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2903
02:29:57.020 --> 02:29:58.020
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

2904
02:29:58.110 --> 02:29:59.750
<v Speaker 2>that's a point of fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2905
02:30:00.050 --> 02:30:00.960
<v Speaker 2>and I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2906
02:30:00.961 --> 02:30:01.794
<v Speaker 2>the few years ago when the broncos won </v>
<v Speaker 2>the super bowl and you're looking at </v>

2907
02:30:04.140 --> 02:30:04.973
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the statistic was something like 85 </v>

2908
02:30:08.701 --> 02:30:12.270
<v Speaker 2>percent of the city of denver showed up </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a parade on a monday.</v>

2909
02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:15.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

2910
02:30:15.870 --> 02:30:19.790
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy and this is what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what people.</v>

2911
02:30:19.800 --> 02:30:22.710
<v Speaker 2>So if you don't believe that that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>governor or whatever,</v>

2912
02:30:22.711 --> 02:30:25.980
<v Speaker 2>the governor of Colorado that day could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been like,</v>

2913
02:30:25.981 --> 02:30:28.860
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go seize Montana,</v>

2914
02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Wyoming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arizona and Utah.</v>

2915
02:30:32.270 --> 02:30:34.890
<v Speaker 2>Everybody had state of Colorado would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been like,</v>

2916
02:30:35.430 --> 02:30:37.260
<v Speaker 2>hell yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go broncos.</v>

2917
02:30:38.940 --> 02:30:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2918
02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:42.020
<v Speaker 2>and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is what,</v>

2919
02:30:42.140 --> 02:30:45.470
<v Speaker 2>what this is masking behind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2920
02:30:45.480 --> 02:30:47.040
<v Speaker 2>a playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2921
02:30:47.041 --> 02:30:47.874
<v Speaker 2>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just people care about this </v>

2922
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:54.270
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you're basically beating </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else without weapOns.</v>

2923
02:30:54.350 --> 02:30:56.180
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're manipulating their opinions.</v>

2924
02:30:56.181 --> 02:30:59.450
<v Speaker 1>you're manipulating the way people feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>and public opinion.</v>

2925
02:31:00.370 --> 02:31:01.870
<v Speaker 2>What do you think should be done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2926
02:31:01.950 --> 02:31:02.580
<v Speaker 2>How do you.</v>

2927
02:31:02.580 --> 02:31:05.100
<v Speaker 1>This is what I was sayinG before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you put all the pieces on the table.</v>

2928
02:31:05.101 --> 02:31:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we're,</v>

2929
02:31:06.910 --> 02:31:10.260
<v Speaker 1>we're at a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can stop technology.</v>

2930
02:31:10.320 --> 02:31:10.941
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2931
02:31:10.941 --> 02:31:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think I,</v>

2932
02:31:12.620 --> 02:31:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2933
02:31:14.100 --> 02:31:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I think if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at human beings as a whole</v>

2934
02:31:17.610 --> 02:31:21.000
<v Speaker 1>and you look at what we to be versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we are now,</v>

2935
02:31:21.001 --> 02:31:21.834
<v Speaker 1>if you were some sort of an objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>life form from another planet that </v>

2936
02:31:25.471 --> 02:31:30.410
<v Speaker 1>didn't have any vested interest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding our culture and just tried</v>

2937
02:31:30.411 --> 02:31:34.380
<v Speaker 1>to examine us as a super organism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>

2938
02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:36.930
<v Speaker 1>We make better sHit every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do.</v>

2939
02:31:36.960 --> 02:31:37.793
<v Speaker 1>We're always going to make better shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're always gonna make better shit as </v>

2940
02:31:39.451 --> 02:31:40.284
<v Speaker 1>long as we stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as we don't get hit by an </v>

2941
02:31:41.821 --> 02:31:45.780
<v Speaker 1>asteroid killed by a hurricane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swamped and an earthquake or tsunami,</v>

2942
02:31:46.080 --> 02:31:47.220
<v Speaker 1>we're going to continue to make better.</v>

2943
02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:50.010
<v Speaker 1>We're going to continue to become better</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans technically,</v>

2944
02:31:50.011 --> 02:31:52.320
<v Speaker 1>tactically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not maybe from,</v>

2945
02:31:52.321 --> 02:31:54.570
<v Speaker 1>hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think even from a moral standpoint,</v>

2946
02:31:54.571 --> 02:31:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I think we're better now than we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

2947
02:31:56.010 --> 02:31:58.200
<v Speaker 1>which is why things like putin are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing,</v>

2948
02:31:58.410 --> 02:31:59.243
<v Speaker 1>which is what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go back to like the gang is con </v>

2949
02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:01.980
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the norm,</v>

2950
02:32:02.220 --> 02:32:04.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was how dictators ran.</v>

2951
02:32:04.201 --> 02:32:06.760
<v Speaker 1>That's how kings ran and emperors ran </v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

2952
02:32:06.770 --> 02:32:07.603
<v Speaker 1>their dynasties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more uncommon now and more </v>

2953
02:32:10.381 --> 02:32:13.650
<v Speaker 1>disturbing because the main superpower </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do it that way.</v>

2954
02:32:13.700 --> 02:32:16.680
<v Speaker 1>The United States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the reasons why people</v>

2955
02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:20.610
<v Speaker 1>are so patriotic about America because </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look back at human history,</v>

2956
02:32:20.611 --> 02:32:25.050
<v Speaker 1>we are the fucked up as we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>undeniably fucked up as it is.</v>

2957
02:32:25.890 --> 02:32:26.723
<v Speaker 1>We are the shining example of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible in the future that we can keep </v>

2958
02:32:31.111 --> 02:32:35.310
<v Speaker 1>going and eventually create some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a system that's different.</v>

2959
02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:36.173
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of a experiment in self </v>
<v Speaker 1>government has different than has ever </v>

2960
02:32:39.301 --> 02:32:40.134
<v Speaker 1>existed before where you can get to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where a fucking reality show </v>

2961
02:32:42.781 --> 02:32:43.614
<v Speaker 1>president or a reality show host becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president of the United States of </v>

2962
02:32:47.550 --> 02:32:48.383
<v Speaker 1>America for good or for bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It opens people's eyes to the </v>

2963
02:32:51.091 --> 02:32:52.080
<v Speaker 1>possibility like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2964
02:32:52.081 --> 02:32:54.870
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a new thing like this.</v>

2965
02:32:54.900 --> 02:32:57.030
<v Speaker 1>In terms of human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a new thing.</v>

2966
02:32:57.210 --> 02:32:58.043
<v Speaker 1>This whole experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing called the United </v>

2967
02:33:00.450 --> 02:33:01.283
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only a few hundred years old is a </v>

2968
02:33:01.891 --> 02:33:05.130
<v Speaker 1>very new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you looked at us objective,</v>

2969
02:33:05.160 --> 02:33:05.993
<v Speaker 1>lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were something from another </v>

2970
02:33:06.601 --> 02:33:08.160
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would say,</v>

2971
02:33:08.161 --> 02:33:09.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they?</v>

2972
02:33:09.031 --> 02:33:11.700
<v Speaker 1>What's the end game with these fuckers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they trying to do?</v>

2973
02:33:11.730 --> 02:33:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're trying to do is make better</v>

2974
02:33:13.351 --> 02:33:14.184
<v Speaker 1>and better stuff and I think the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with that is artificial </v>

2975
02:33:16.891 --> 02:33:19.950
<v Speaker 1>intelligence because we look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence,</v>

2976
02:33:19.951 --> 02:33:20.784
<v Speaker 1>we say the word artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we think of it as like a thing that </v>

2977
02:33:25.201 --> 02:33:26.760
<v Speaker 1>we can turn on or turn off.</v>

2978
02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.100
<v Speaker 1>We think of it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a device,</v>

2979
02:33:29.101 --> 02:33:31.440
<v Speaker 1>a vcr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or fucking television.</v>

2980
02:33:31.441 --> 02:33:32.274
<v Speaker 1>We think of it as a piece of equipment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a human has created that may be </v>

2981
02:33:35.731 --> 02:33:38.580
<v Speaker 1>able to think for itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a life form.</v>

2982
02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:39.893
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just a life form that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists from parts and pieces that we're </v>

2983
02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:44.873
<v Speaker 1>designed to put together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think our entire thing about being </v>

2984
02:33:49.411 --> 02:33:53.580
<v Speaker 1>attached to materialism are are constant</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirst for innovation.</v>

2985
02:33:53.581 --> 02:33:56.670
<v Speaker 1>We always want the iphone eight is </v>
<v Speaker 1>albert iphone 10 is around the corner.</v>

2986
02:33:56.671 --> 02:33:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you hold out or to get the new one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have two options.</v>

2987
02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:01.050
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to stick with the iphone </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

2988
02:34:01.051 --> 02:34:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2989
02:34:02.311 --> 02:34:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get the update.</v>

2990
02:34:03.361 --> 02:34:05.460
<v Speaker 1>The update is going to make it slower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that happens,</v>

2991
02:34:05.461 --> 02:34:06.294
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2992
02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:08.130
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're thirsty for this shit,</v>

2993
02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:08.993
<v Speaker 1>but we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're fueling is innovation and </v>

2994
02:34:10.321 --> 02:34:13.530
<v Speaker 1>innovation will inevitably lead to a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>life form.</v>

2995
02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:15.960
<v Speaker 1>It's Going to lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're calling it artificial color,</v>

2996
02:34:15.961 --> 02:34:17.740
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking real.</v>

2997
02:34:17.770 --> 02:34:18.603
<v Speaker 1>It's not artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a life form that's not based </v>

2998
02:34:20.411 --> 02:34:23.590
<v Speaker 1>on blood and bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so life form that's based on circuits.</v>

2999
02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:27.600
<v Speaker 1>A lifelong is based on something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings have created and once it,</v>

3000
02:34:28.270 --> 02:34:30.880
<v Speaker 1>once it can think for itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to make better life forms.</v>

3001
02:34:30.970 --> 02:34:33.130
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make something way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way different than us.</v>

3002
02:34:33.131 --> 02:34:35.260
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any emotions.</v>

3003
02:34:35.410 --> 02:34:38.260
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any biological needs.</v>

3004
02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:39.393
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have any weird jealousy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird issues that have been holding us </v>

3005
02:34:41.891 --> 02:34:43.540
<v Speaker 1>back forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do you do with that?</v>

3006
02:34:43.930 --> 02:34:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Exactly when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3007
02:34:44.921 --> 02:34:46.410
<v Speaker 1>What is it's motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3008
02:34:46.460 --> 02:34:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Why does it even exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it even want to do anything?</v>

3009
02:34:49.460 --> 02:34:52.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of questions involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and you know,</v>

3010
02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:54.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe it can find some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>

3011
02:34:54.251 --> 02:34:55.084
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can figure out some reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist and to innovate and to keep going </v>

3012
02:34:57.731 --> 02:34:59.800
<v Speaker 1>better and better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're.</v>

3013
02:34:59.890 --> 02:35:00.723
<v Speaker 1>We're limited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're limited by the scope of our </v>

3014
02:35:02.531 --> 02:35:03.364
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at and you're talking </v>

3015
02:35:03.971 --> 02:35:06.210
<v Speaker 1>about human beings haven't been run out.</v>

3016
02:35:06.430 --> 02:35:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's getting into with,</v>

3017
02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:11.320
<v Speaker 2>with one henriquez which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

3018
02:35:11.380 --> 02:35:12.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're his argument and I'd actually </v>

3019
02:35:13.901 --> 02:35:14.734
<v Speaker 2>interviewed him for the film and ended </v>
<v Speaker 2>up not using it because of where the </v>

3020
02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:17.974
<v Speaker 2>story went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his argument was not the moral </v>

3021
02:35:20.891 --> 02:35:23.920
<v Speaker 2>ethical argument around anti-doping and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport.</v>

3022
02:35:23.921 --> 02:35:26.770
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just purely the argument of,</v>

3023
02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:28.840
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at evolution,</v>

3024
02:35:29.170 --> 02:35:31.600
<v Speaker 2>look at reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at where we're gOing,</v>

3025
02:35:31.601 --> 02:35:36.601
<v Speaker 2>look at where human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially transcending to and then how</v>

3026
02:35:39.191 --> 02:35:44.191
<v Speaker 2>do you ever have the basis of what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the concept behind like clean sport more</v>

3027
02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:49.930
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even transcending sport,</v>

3028
02:35:49.931 --> 02:35:53.410
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as being a pure ethos.</v>

3029
02:35:53.470 --> 02:35:54.303
<v Speaker 2>Because there are so many technoloGical </v>
<v Speaker 2>and really evolutionary variables that </v>

3030
02:35:59.291 --> 02:36:00.124
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seem to make that a fundamentally </v>

3031
02:36:03.371 --> 02:36:04.100
<v Speaker 2>difficult</v>

3032
02:36:04.100 --> 02:36:05.930
<v Speaker 1>and were resisting the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3033
02:36:05.931 --> 02:36:06.764
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like resisting performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancing drugs is is futile in the </v>

3034
02:36:10.671 --> 02:36:11.504
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like foolish because these </v>

3035
02:36:12.831 --> 02:36:15.140
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drugs represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

3036
02:36:15.141 --> 02:36:17.750
<v Speaker 1>The represent our ability to manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>our bodies recover.</v>

3037
02:36:18.110 --> 02:36:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And manipulate our biology.</v>

3038
02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Biology too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just recover,</v>

3039
02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:25.430
<v Speaker 1>but also to grow at a rate that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>never been able to grow before.</v>

3040
02:36:25.431 --> 02:36:28.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not just recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was just about recovery.</v>

3041
02:36:28.670 --> 02:36:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Some steroids allow you to grow at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate.</v>

3042
02:36:31.580 --> 02:36:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Look at bodybuilders like look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaks.</v>

3043
02:36:34.191 --> 02:36:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Like lee haney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when he was in his prime.</v>

3044
02:36:36.110 --> 02:36:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>

3045
02:36:37.500 --> 02:36:40.160
<v Speaker 1>that's not just about recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also about growth.</v>

3046
02:36:40.190 --> 02:36:41.023
<v Speaker 1>It's also about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the speed that ben johnson had </v>

3047
02:36:43.311 --> 02:36:45.800
<v Speaker 1>when he won the gold medal and he tested</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>

3048
02:36:45.801 --> 02:36:48.170
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out that Carl Lewis was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>some shit too.</v>

3049
02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:49.840
<v Speaker 1>And they hid that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's.</v>

3050
02:36:49.850 --> 02:36:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3051
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.903
<v Speaker 2>Camp catlin in 1984.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were nine samples that went </v>

3052
02:36:54.030 --> 02:36:56.190
<v Speaker 2>missing to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3053
02:36:56.220 --> 02:36:59.730
<v Speaker 2>And the story behind that is that the u,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s,</v>

3054
02:36:59.740 --> 02:37:04.740
<v Speaker 2>o c a came to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came to don catlin because ca catlin had</v>

3055
02:37:05.191 --> 02:37:10.191
<v Speaker 2>found the positives and basically those </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine samples just vanished.</v>

3056
02:37:10.980 --> 02:37:13.770
<v Speaker 1>And you remember when ben johnson tried </v>
<v Speaker 1>to compete clean after that?</v>

3057
02:37:14.050 --> 02:37:15.320
<v Speaker 2>It was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3058
02:37:15.350 --> 02:37:16.100
<v Speaker 2>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

3059
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:19.370
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at a regular guy trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to race against superstars.</v>

3060
02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:20.061
<v Speaker 4>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

3061
02:37:20.061 --> 02:37:20.960
<v Speaker 4>if I was running,</v>

3062
02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:22.950
<v Speaker 3>here's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's an interesting story.</v>

3063
02:37:23.070 --> 02:37:26.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm slightly off topic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on the topic of ben johnson.</v>

3064
02:37:26.491 --> 02:37:29.220
<v Speaker 3>So I'm dick pound Richard Powell.</v>

3065
02:37:29.290 --> 02:37:30.190
<v Speaker 4>What a great name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

3066
02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:31.600
<v Speaker 4>dick pound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3067
02:37:31.780 --> 02:37:32.613
<v Speaker 4>how do you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cannot mess with a guy by the name </v>

3068
02:37:34.391 --> 02:37:35.224
<v Speaker 4>of dick cow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did the fuck did he ever go with </v>

3069
02:37:36.641 --> 02:37:37.474
<v Speaker 4>dick when his name was richard?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I chose pound is that it does </v>

3070
02:37:40.090 --> 02:37:41.560
<v Speaker 4>what to it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just been like,</v>

3071
02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:43.091
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3072
02:37:43.091 --> 02:37:48.091
<v Speaker 4>I'm dick pound back in the day like dick</v>
<v Speaker 4>nixon just go through your life.</v>

3073
02:37:50.921 --> 02:37:53.830
<v Speaker 4>a video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You introduce yourself to a girl like,</v>

3074
02:37:53.831 --> 02:37:55.120
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you named dick pound.</v>

3075
02:37:55.180 --> 02:37:58.630
<v Speaker 4>But still they call it dick back in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies and the sixties I think.</v>

3076
02:37:58.631 --> 02:38:00.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Richard Nixon wasn't a dick.</v>

3077
02:38:00.900 --> 02:38:01.733
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess all was his friends called him </v>

3078
02:38:02.471 --> 02:38:03.320
<v Speaker 4>dick nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3079
02:38:03.321 --> 02:38:03.851
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3080
02:38:03.851 --> 02:38:05.380
<v Speaker 4>buT that's not my point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My point is,</v>

3081
02:38:05.410 --> 02:38:08.110
<v Speaker 4>was a penis called a dick?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know</v>

3082
02:38:08.110 --> 02:38:08.890
<v Speaker 3>when.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When a.</v>

3083
02:38:08.890 --> 02:38:10.190
<v Speaker 3>When a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When a penis became.</v>

3084
02:38:10.191 --> 02:38:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3085
02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:10.861
<v Speaker 4>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3086
02:38:10.861 --> 02:38:12.150
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3087
02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:13.513
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if dick pound adopted the name </v>
<v Speaker 4>prior to penises or if he or when he </v>

3088
02:38:19.351 --> 02:38:21.330
<v Speaker 4>started calling himself dick pound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3089
02:38:22.100 --> 02:38:25.320
<v Speaker 4>he knew that it was a dick and then or </v>
<v Speaker 4>if he adopted it,</v>

3090
02:38:25.321 --> 02:38:28.260

3102
02:38:51.901 --> 02:38:54.720
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make sense at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about Jack Johnson?</v>

02:38:57.180 --> 02:39:00.210
<v Speaker 4>I think his name was actually jack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you can have a name.</v>

3105

02:39:06.001 --> 02:39:07.820
<v Speaker 4>that I thought I still had it on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like this.</v>

3111
02:39:09.990 --> 02:39:10.823
<v Speaker 3>dick pound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a richard pound who actually founded </v>

3112
02:39:14.551 --> 02:39:15.384
<v Speaker 3>water at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's basically within the ioc and he'd </v>

3113
02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:20.580
<v Speaker 3>talk about a crazy conflict of interest </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

3114
02:39:20.581 --> 02:39:22.970
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so richard pan was an,</v>

3115
02:39:23.100 --> 02:39:25.250
<v Speaker 3>an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a swimmer in olympics one.</v>

3116
02:39:25.251 --> 02:39:26.084
<v Speaker 3>We're actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he gone into being in the ioc </v>

3117
02:39:29.370 --> 02:39:30.203
<v Speaker 3>and he's a lawyer and his law firm has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been representing the olympics for the </v>

3118
02:39:35.431 --> 02:39:37.410
<v Speaker 3>last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know how many years.</v>

3119
02:39:37.411 --> 02:39:38.244
<v Speaker 3>Thirty years in all of their sale of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>olympics to the entire world is Richard </v>

3120
02:39:44.071 --> 02:39:46.230
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lawford law firm,</v>

3121
02:39:46.231 --> 02:39:47.064
<v Speaker 3>striking pound number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan is also the vice president of the </v>

3122
02:39:49.951 --> 02:39:53.170
<v Speaker 3>ioc and richard pound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3123
02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:58.140
<v Speaker 3>establishes water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the first head of water in 1999.</v>

3124
02:39:59.130 --> 02:40:04.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm now an interesting stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's canadian and he is essentially like</v>

3125
02:40:05.011 --> 02:40:05.844
<v Speaker 3>the ambassador to Canada during the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>that ben johnson test positive and ben </v>

3126
02:40:13.501 --> 02:40:14.280
<v Speaker 3>johnson test</v>

3127
02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:19.280
<v Speaker 2>positive and Canada sends richard pound </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there to basically see if they can do</v>

3128
02:40:20.461 --> 02:40:24.270
<v Speaker 2>something to make this go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this true?</v>

3129
02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Can they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there some,</v>

3130
02:40:26.100 --> 02:40:26.933
<v Speaker 2>some way that basically ben johnson </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot be positive and dick pound as he </v>

3131
02:40:32.161 --> 02:40:33.960
<v Speaker 2>will tell you was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

3132
02:40:33.990 --> 02:40:38.130
<v Speaker 2>was there essentially trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiate,</v>

3133
02:40:38.131 --> 02:40:43.131
<v Speaker 2>find a loophole on behalf of Canada that</v>
<v Speaker 2>ben johnson would not be positive,</v>

3134
02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:44.633
<v Speaker 2>but that apparently he was just so </v>
<v Speaker 2>radically positive and there was just </v>

3135
02:40:48.161 --> 02:40:48.994
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing that anybody could do </v>

3136
02:40:50.731 --> 02:40:52.430
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like a,</v>

3137
02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:55.170
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd really like to help you,</v>

3138
02:40:55.171 --> 02:40:57.630
<v Speaker 2>but this is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bad.</v>

3139
02:40:57.670 --> 02:41:01.350
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember an article that described the</v>

3140
02:41:01.351 --> 02:41:02.184
<v Speaker 2>whites of his eyes being yellow because </v>
<v Speaker 2>his liver was overwhelmed trying to </v>

3141
02:41:07.441 --> 02:41:09.960
<v Speaker 2>process the amount of steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women's body.</v>

3142
02:41:10.270 --> 02:41:12.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he argues that the coaches,</v>

3143
02:41:12.331 --> 02:41:14.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he had no idea that they had always</v>

3144
02:41:15.300 --> 02:41:16.440
<v Speaker 2>just kept telling them to just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3145
02:41:16.441 --> 02:41:17.580
<v Speaker 2>it's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fine.</v>

3146
02:41:17.580 --> 02:41:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might be true,</v>

3147
02:41:21.330 --> 02:41:22.163
<v Speaker 2>but I wonder what they really did think </v>
<v Speaker 2>was gonna happen or how they thought </v>

3148
02:41:24.271 --> 02:41:25.690
<v Speaker 2>they would pull it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3149
02:41:25.730 --> 02:41:26.563
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was these kinds of scandals that </v>

3150
02:41:27.781 --> 02:41:28.614
<v Speaker 2>forced the ioc to create water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world antidoping agency [inaudible] </v>

3151
02:41:32.381 --> 02:41:33.214
<v Speaker 2>they looked at a brand and crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how were they gonna regain public </v>

3152
02:41:37.501 --> 02:41:39.060
<v Speaker 2>trust?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the year was this.</v>

3153
02:41:39.290 --> 02:41:42.900
<v Speaker 2>This was a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets established in 1999.</v>

3154
02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:47.040
<v Speaker 2>If I remember ben johnson was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>

3155
02:41:47.050 --> 02:41:48.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the 84 olympics.</v>

3156
02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:50.700
<v Speaker 2>It might've been the first olympics </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they tested.</v>

3157
02:41:50.701 --> 02:41:51.534
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the 84 olympics were ben </v>

3158
02:41:52.591 --> 02:41:54.400
<v Speaker 2>johnson was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3159
02:41:54.510 --> 02:41:56.430
<v Speaker 2>was tested positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe they just did,</v>

3160
02:41:56.431 --> 02:41:57.264
<v Speaker 2>but all the americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But according to everybody that I've </v>

3161
02:42:00.061 --> 02:42:00.894
<v Speaker 2>talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire american team was positive </v>

3162
02:42:02.791 --> 02:42:03.624
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

3163
02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:08.710
<v Speaker 4>was just so positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too far.</v>

3164
02:42:09.440 --> 02:42:11.800
<v Speaker 4>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just pushed away to fuck.</v>

3165
02:42:12.010 --> 02:42:14.200
<v Speaker 4>But he looked like a freak to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was so jack,</v>

3166
02:42:14.201 --> 02:42:16.000

3167
02:42:16.001 --> 02:42:16.870
<v Speaker 4>That stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3168
02:42:17.140 --> 02:42:17.973

3170
02:42:20.621 --> 02:42:23.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he is a machine.</v>

3171
02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:24.033
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>track and field sprinter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has just a machine.</v>

3173
02:42:27.191 --> 02:42:28.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looked like,</v>

3174
02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:29.313
<v Speaker 4>like an mma fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was just fucking look at a </v>

<v Speaker 4>tell looking at someone whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're on steroids.</v>

3187
02:43:07.931 --> 02:43:09.880
<v Speaker 4>That was always the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the sniff test.</v>

<v Speaker 5>he could just look at it</v>

3206
02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:52.740
<v Speaker 2>somebody and know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he just,</v>

3207
02:43:52.741 --> 02:43:53.820
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3208
02:43:53.821 --> 02:43:57.060
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody he knew and we would meet people</v>

3209
02:43:57.061 --> 02:43:58.650
<v Speaker 2>over that year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3210
02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:00.313
<v Speaker 2>was a funny story when I was in moscow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I go to meet him after this haute </v>

3211
02:44:05.410 --> 02:44:06.243
<v Speaker 2>route,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

3212
02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:07.370
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Race and I,</v>

3213
02:44:07.470 --> 02:44:09.150
<v Speaker 2>and I bring with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>

3214
02:44:09.151 --> 02:44:11.130
<v Speaker 2>we don't get into the film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty crazy.</v>

3215
02:44:11.131 --> 02:44:11.964
<v Speaker 2>I'd had figured out essentially because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't going to be tested every day </v>

3216
02:44:15.330 --> 02:44:16.960
<v Speaker 2>that I was going to simulate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>protocol.</v>

3217
02:44:16.961 --> 02:44:19.080
<v Speaker 2>So during this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second race,</v>

3218
02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:24.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm pinging every single night into </v>
<v Speaker 2>ziploc bags and basically the ceiling,</v>

3219
02:44:25.321 --> 02:44:26.154
<v Speaker 2>the ziploc bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and storing this frozen urine unlike a </v>

3220
02:44:28.231 --> 02:44:29.064
<v Speaker 2>little thermos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is as I'm going to bring </v>

3221
02:44:31.141 --> 02:44:31.974
<v Speaker 2>all my frozen urine with me to moscow </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had all these blood tests done to </v>

3222
02:44:36.031 --> 02:44:36.864
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after to build the biological passport </v>

3223
02:44:39.121 --> 02:44:41.130
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the steroid profile.</v>

3224
02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I bring him,</v>

3225
02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:44.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all my,</v>

3226
02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:47.210
<v Speaker 2>all my frozen urine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3227
02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:51.510
<v Speaker 2>to moscow and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had went into the process of,</v>

3228
02:44:51.870 --> 02:44:53.110
<v Speaker 2>of literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3229
02:44:53.250 --> 02:44:54.780
<v Speaker 2>testing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3230
02:44:54.840 --> 02:44:55.673
<v Speaker 2>this urine that I'd brought them in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ziploc bags that had smuggled with me </v>

3231
02:44:58.830 --> 02:45:00.420
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into Russia.</v>

3232
02:45:00.870 --> 02:45:04.050
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the second part of the investigation</v>

3233
02:45:04.051 --> 02:45:09.051
<v Speaker 2>comes out before he's able to covertly </v>
<v Speaker 2>test all of my urine within his lab,</v>

3234
02:45:09.451 --> 02:45:13.680
<v Speaker 2>which he shouldn't have been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I go to this birthday party and it's</v>

3235
02:45:13.681 --> 02:45:15.450
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the film,</v>

3236
02:45:15.451 --> 02:45:16.370
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

3237
02:45:16.371 --> 02:45:17.204
<v Speaker 2>I shot it on my iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that scene of chaos with the birthday </v>

3238
02:45:20.191 --> 02:45:22.710

<v Speaker 2>And he's there and he's singing and he's</v>
