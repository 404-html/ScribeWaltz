<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.733
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.220
<v Speaker 2>The Lost Art of knifemaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still alive.</v>

5
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.990

<v Speaker 2>Nice for me.</v>

10
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:24.860
<v Speaker 2>But this one is one I use all the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

11
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I've posted on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people freak out as we were talking</v>

12
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 2>about before the podcast said it</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually has meteor in it.</v>

13
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Media,</v>

14
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's meteor is a big one.</v>

15
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.410
<v Speaker 2>Media writes a little one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the idea?</v>

16
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess</v>

17
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 2>she had the knife maker</v>

18
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.490
<v Speaker 3>so I didn't actually make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I made the knife,</v>

19
00:00:42.491 --> 00:00:44.450
<v Speaker 3>I forged the knife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the steel is,</v>

20
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.130
<v Speaker 3>is a very special kind of steel that</v>
<v Speaker 3>very few people can actually</v>

21
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.160
<v Speaker 3>manufacturer on a small scale in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

22
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.950
<v Speaker 3>And that was made by my shop made</v>
<v Speaker 3>Petersburg.</v>

23
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.760
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

24
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 3>the meteorite is kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a small element in the whole matrix</v>

25
00:01:01.901 --> 00:01:06.901
<v Speaker 3>because most media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right is all nickel or all iron or</v>

26
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:10.240
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this one particularly is a lot of</v>

27
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:14.050
<v Speaker 3>nickel and some cobalt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're going to make it an actual</v>

28
00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 3>usable steel out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't really use a whole lot of it</v>

29
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 3>in the overall mixture.</v>

30
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is there any media rights that are</v>

31
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 2>made at all iron?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

32
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.450
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have to find them.</v>

33
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.860
<v Speaker 2>You just got to find the ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 2>And they're their impact sites all over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

35
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Like they're hitting the world all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

36
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 2>How does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is it?</v>

37
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.140
<v Speaker 2>Can you just take them like when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>land,</v>

38
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 2>is it yours?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you find it,</v>

39
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.650
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to report it to NASA or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

40
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:40.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

41
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Hey Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>found some space junk.</v>

42
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Most of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are so small that they,</v>

43
00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:49.120
<v Speaker 3>by the time they hit the actual earth</v>
<v Speaker 3>surface,</v>

44
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 3>they've completely disintegrated or</v>
<v Speaker 3>burned up.</v>

45
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 3>So it's the really massive ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was part of a impact,</v>

46
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 3>I think in South America.</v>

47
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember where he's like,</v>

48
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.330
<v Speaker 2>it's just crazy to think that this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of space in there.</v>

49
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yandian this dope pattern.</v>

50
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really into crafts from Shit,</v>

51
00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:12.050
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always have been.</v>

52
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.080
<v Speaker 2>I love handmade pool cues and this desk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a handmade desk and I feel like</v>

53
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:22.700
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things that are really</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate in this modern digital world.</v>

54
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.410
<v Speaker 2>And I also feel like unfortunately it</v>
<v Speaker 2>may be one of the things that's slipping</v>

55
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:28.244
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

56
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 3>It definitely is slipping away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think with,</v>

57
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

58
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 3>with technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technology has been great for us and a</v>

59
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:38.390
<v Speaker 3>lot of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we couldn't be fucking talking into</v>

60
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.233
<v Speaker 3>a piece of metal</v>

61
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.570
<v Speaker 2>recorded on the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going through a wire flying through the</v>

62
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:43.060
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it</v>

63
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 3>does a lot of great things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in doing all those great things,</v>

64
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.030
<v Speaker 3>it actually has taken us away from</v>
<v Speaker 3>really creating and working with our</v>

65
00:02:51.851 --> 00:02:53.770
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so like,</v>

66
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even this whole like a farm to table</v>

67
00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 3>movement where people even growing their</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetables.</v>

68
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got your own chickens.</v>

69
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're laying eggs for you.</v>

70
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 3>Like knowing where this stuff is coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

71
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 3>handling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like firsthand contact with that.</v>

72
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just having that relationship in general</v>

73
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:15.721
<v Speaker 3>with it brings so much more value to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>overall experience of eating those eggs</v>

74
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 3>are using that knife or sitting at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking table right here</v>

75
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 2>and it seems like a fairly recent</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement in that direction.</v>

76
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it feels like things got so digital</v>

77
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 2>that people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

78
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

79
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:31.410
<v Speaker 2>What the facebook and the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram I want to I,</v>

80
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a wood table,</v>

81
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I want to saw this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dating myself.</v>

82
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your hands on it.</v>

83
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it to meet pastor rick.</v>

84
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want real stuff.</v>

85
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 2>And there's something about handmade</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

86
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:48.110
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a handmade pair of boots</v>
<v Speaker 2>are handmade bag like this.</v>

87
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Like there's something about things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are made by hand that people get at like</v>

88
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 2>a deep appreciation of,</v>

89
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

90
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it,</v>

91
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 3>I think it also kind of goes back to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was saying like as technology has</v>

92
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 3>advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've kind of grown away from these</v>

93
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 3>kinds of what's considered like blue</v>
<v Speaker 3>collar work and craftsmanship kind of</v>

94
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think people really are driven by</v>

95
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 3>a sense of achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you're doing data entry that</v>

96
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 3>literally millions of people fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>monkeys can be trained to do,</v>

97
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.140
<v Speaker 3>not to like diminish anything that</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody's doing but literally like it.</v>

98
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.440
<v Speaker 3>To be able to go into a craft and to and</v>
<v Speaker 3>had the hands on experience is very,</v>

99
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:28.571
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

100
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 3>very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that sense of achievement.</v>

101
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 3>Even when somebody comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>something and maybe I taught a class on</v>

102
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 3>how to make a knife and it looks like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Turd,</v>

103
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna think it looks like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most beautiful fucking knife they've</v>

104
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:42.270
<v Speaker 3>ever seen in their life because their</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands and their creativity,</v>

105
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 3>they've touched their energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

106
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:48.280
<v Speaker 3>their sweat and pop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably some of their blood is put into</v>

107
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:50.730
<v Speaker 3>creating that thing and that brings that</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more valuable.</v>

108
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's an issue with people</v>

109
00:04:52.411 --> 00:04:55.290
<v Speaker 2>today that have jobs that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel are very fulfilling is that there's</v>

110
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:57.810
<v Speaker 2>no real thing that they're creating at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>

111
00:04:57.811 --> 00:05:01.740
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like if you make a table at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end when you were putting the final</v>

112
00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:04.350
<v Speaker 2>sanding on the final,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:05:04.351 --> 00:05:08.400
<v Speaker 2>a layer of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a stain and you're looking at it</v>

114
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.960
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking made this.</v>

115
00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a real thing that I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>touch that I made.</v>

116
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Just like human beings in our current</v>
<v Speaker 2>form,</v>

117
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.680
<v Speaker 2>we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a deep connection to making</v>

118
00:05:19.681 --> 00:05:21.500
<v Speaker 2>things physical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things end up settling and,</v>

119
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.971
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

120
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:24.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an appreciation for things that people</v>

121
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:25.260
<v Speaker 2>have made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's a,</v>

122
00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:28.220
<v Speaker 2>a rifle that somebody made or a night</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a,</v>

123
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hammer that's that someone's made.</v>

124
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:35.100
<v Speaker 2>There's something about that that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>just have a real appreciation for.</v>

125
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:39.240
<v Speaker 2>If you can buy us a knife from the store</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's made in a show,</v>

126
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will work,</v>

127
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some knife that's made some mass</v>

128
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:45.090
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll work and it's fine.</v>

129
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>

130
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you'll appreciate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you won't appreciate it.</v>

131
00:05:47.311 --> 00:05:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate this thing.</v>

132
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Like every time I take this out and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like super careful with it and you know,</v>

133
00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:56.850
<v Speaker 2>and then the handle the handle's made</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of this is Moose antler and elk</v>

134
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right at the</v>

135
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.670
<v Speaker 4>top and the Moose of the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

136
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 4>and I saw your conversation or listen to</v>
<v Speaker 4>your conversation with Guy Ritchie and</v>

137
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 4>you brought up that there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think actually Jamie pulled it up and</v>

138
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 4>he was like bogged oak and Guy Richie</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like boggo what bog or their</v>

139
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 4>American bugs there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if there are any American</v>

140
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 4>box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was from a a bog in Russia and it was</v>

141
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:19.390
<v Speaker 4>carbon dated to 5,400 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jeez.</v>

142
00:06:19.391 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 4>So essentially it's been sunken and Abog</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just other knife that you made for</v>

143
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:26.220
<v Speaker 4>me that has a handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how did,</v>

144
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.810
<v Speaker 4>how's wanting to get ahold of Boggo?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So people are raising logs.</v>

145
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 4>Like there actually was a show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was on discovery channel or</v>

146
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 4>history where people were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their job was raising logs out of the</v>

147
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 4>ball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the swamps down in Louisiana and the</v>

148
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:43.540
<v Speaker 4>south and using,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making use of that wood for tape of</v>

149
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 4>projects and craft projects like this.</v>

150
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's happening all over the world.</v>

151
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.890
<v Speaker 4>And some of that stuff are these ancient</v>
<v Speaker 4>logs that you know,</v>

152
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 4>it's the right conditions where the log,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tree falls over.</v>

153
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 4>It just sits there and steeps and that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big thing for the pool cue shafts,</v>

154
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 4>Lakewood chaffs they like to take these</v>
<v Speaker 4>logs out of the bottom like Lake</v>

155
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:06.860
<v Speaker 4>Michigan or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

156
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 4>And then they dry it all out and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make shafts out of it.</v>

157
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:14.750
<v Speaker 4>And there's something about it being in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottom of the water for so long.</v>

158
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 4>It does something to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the way they feel.</v>

159
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.321
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you got there,</v>

160
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:20.930

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.920
<v Speaker 4>He's a nice kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met him a couple of years ago and uh,</v>

188
00:08:22.921 --> 00:08:25.610
<v Speaker 4>in Eugene actually they do a knife show</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

189
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 4>Every image that you just showed Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's bogged oak that some other like</v>

190
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:32.750
<v Speaker 4>big chunks of it that they pulled out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

191
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.050
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there must be a community of view</v>

192
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:36.920
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

193
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.200
<v Speaker 4>these knifemaking people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

194
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:41.600
<v Speaker 4>There,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are quite a few people who have</v>

195
00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:44.050
<v Speaker 4>started getting into the knife making</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

196
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.750
<v Speaker 4>the knife making,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

197
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moral of the knife making a really</v>

198
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:53.651
<v Speaker 4>there the resurgence of kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>handcrafted hand forge knives kind of</v>

199
00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 4>started back in the um,</v>

200
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.420
<v Speaker 3>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it stemmed off from um,</v>

201
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.920
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a custom knife making</v>
<v Speaker 3>association or uh,</v>

202
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.240
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cuffed custom knife makers association</v>

203
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 3>and then it stemmed off to the ABS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the American bladesmith</v>

204
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was all about the forge blade</v>

205
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.760
<v Speaker 3>and kind of the mission to retain that</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge and that history and in the</v>

206
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Speaker 3>skills that go into actually taking a</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of metal and forging a blade out</v>

207
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you were blades,</v>

208
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 3>they were forged to shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were a one pr approach is to just</v>

209
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:31.800
<v Speaker 3>take a bar steel trace out a line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut that out.</v>

210
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.710
<v Speaker 3>Whereas talking about it's totally valid</v>
<v Speaker 3>way of doing it.</v>

211
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forging the forging aspect.</v>

212
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if somebody doesn't actually</v>

213
00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:43.080
<v Speaker 3>know what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just like heating up a piece of</v>

214
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:44.700
<v Speaker 3>steel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know how fucking hot it is</v>

215
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:45.060
<v Speaker 3>getting.</v>

216
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 3>They don't know how when to stop hitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

217
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:50.040
<v Speaker 3>They may be hitting it too cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may be overheating it and hidden it</v>

218
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 3>and while it's way too hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could really actually do</v>

219
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 3>detrimental damage to the material and</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn out a piece of shit.</v>

220
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the forge aspect really just brings</v>

221
00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:07.401
<v Speaker 3>kind of an aesthetic and it kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>depth of story to help bring kind of a</v>

222
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.140
<v Speaker 3>more to that product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

223
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 3>it's another level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

224
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just another layer of it.</v>

225
00:10:12.921 --> 00:10:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just hand crafting something</v>

226
00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:15.620
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

227
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a piece of metal that you bought</v>

228
00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:19.800
<v Speaker 3>and you put all the pieces together and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Polish it down,</v>

229
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.380
<v Speaker 3>sanded it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did you get into this?</v>

230
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.490
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a kind of a funny story.</v>

231
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 3>So I got into this back in 2008 is when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met Bob Kramer.</v>

232
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.540
<v Speaker 3>At the time I was working in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant,</v>

233
00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually in my hometown of Olympia.</v>

234
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was working at a restaurant.</v>

235
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.930
<v Speaker 3>I was moonlighting as an assistant salsa</v>
<v Speaker 3>dancing instructor and doing like,</v>

236
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

237
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 3>like community performances and shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

238
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:48.331
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

239
00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:51.870
<v Speaker 3>I was 24 and I didn't know what the Hell</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing with myself and I didn't</v>

240
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 3>really have much of a direction in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

241
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.670
<v Speaker 3>I was terrible at school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

242
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had maybe 40 credits towards,</v>

243
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.010
<v Speaker 3>towards an Ame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't even have him like an actual</v>

244
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 3>certification or degree or have any kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

245
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.040
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

246
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.420
<v Speaker 3>I was sharing this with my dance partner</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she had just started working for</v>

247
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:12.240
<v Speaker 3>this guy who was a knife maker and she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

248
00:11:12.241 --> 00:11:13.051
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should meet him.</v>

249
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:14.880
<v Speaker 3>He's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

250
00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of feel like you're lost.</v>

251
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.020
<v Speaker 3>He's been all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's even like,</v>

252
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:20.730
<v Speaker 3>he was even a clown at one point.</v>

253
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.090
<v Speaker 3>Kramer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

254
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.040
<v Speaker 3>he used to be a clown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a clown I think for a year for</v>

255
00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:28.860
<v Speaker 3>ringling Barnum and Bailey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

256
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.220
<v Speaker 3>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I understand,</v>

257
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.940
<v Speaker 3>it was a great experience and he loved</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

258
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.800
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyways,</v>

259
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.491
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

260
00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:37.350
<v Speaker 3>I think you guys would hit it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

261
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he could help bestow some wisdom</v>

262
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:43.500
<v Speaker 3>as to where you're at and where he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>at and maybe what kind of choices or</v>

263
00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:46.230
<v Speaker 3>options you have ahead of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I met up with him,</v>

264
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:47.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the brewpub or that I was actually</v>

265
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:52.740
<v Speaker 3>working at and got some beers because a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish and chips sit and bullshitting and</v>

266
00:11:52.741 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 3>it ended up turning into an a job</v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity.</v>

267
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.960
<v Speaker 3>And neither of us really went into it</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing that that's the direction it was</v>

268
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 3>going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

269
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was anticipating,</v>

270
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.440
<v Speaker 3>he had an article coming out in the New</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yorker like in a month and that was</v>

271
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:11.950
<v Speaker 3>going to really like blow his shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he had had a couple big articles</v>

272
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:15.580
<v Speaker 3>like in Savour magazine and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>featured in Cook's illustrated at one</v>

273
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:17.380
<v Speaker 3>point and each time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

274
00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:21.610
<v Speaker 3>there's a huge influx.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think in part of anticipation</v>

275
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Speaker 3>for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

276
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you seem like a nice guy.</v>

277
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 3>You don't really seem to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

278
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we could work something out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't make any promises to you that I</v>

279
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:33.280
<v Speaker 3>have full time work for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

280
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 3>so he just took you on as an apprentice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially</v>

281
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 2>video with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Bordain.</v>

282
00:12:38.711 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 2>That's how I found out about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was making a knife with meteors,</v>

283
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:44.710
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meet with a piece of media right in it</v>

284
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:45.940
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same kind of thing.</v>

285
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.950
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking like,</v>

286
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.120
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy is this,</v>

287
00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:51.940
<v Speaker 2>this guys hammering this thing together</v>
<v Speaker 2>and put into that.</v>

288
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 2>That was like one of the ways that I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in custom knife making sure</v>

289
00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 2>it might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd always had knives,</v>

290
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like pocket knives and I always kind of</v>

291
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.120
<v Speaker 2>thought they were cool and enjoyed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But until I watched that video I didn't</v>

292
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:09.160
<v Speaker 2>realize that there was a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

293
00:13:09.161 --> 00:13:09.994
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

294
00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Him and Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize there was a lot of</v>

295
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:15.160
<v Speaker 2>people that are out there doing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>from scratch.</v>

296
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

297
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.861
<v Speaker 2>then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

298
00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:19.390
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

299
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 2>then I saw your page on instagram and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember thinking,</v>

300
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy does some wild shit.</v>

301
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.660
<v Speaker 2>And I don't remember how you and I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to chatting.</v>

302
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just remember seeing your stuff on</v>

303
00:13:31.631 --> 00:13:32.090
<v Speaker 2>instinct.</v>

304
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:37.070
<v Speaker 3>You reached out to me on email and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Joe Rogan and I was like that</v>

305
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.020
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>

306
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Was it a instagram message?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh actually I'm not sure.</v>

307
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.190
<v Speaker 3>I think it was the email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Email.</v>

308
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.980
<v Speaker 3>Either way from your website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

309
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the previous conversation somewhere,</v>

311
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this can't be like the Joe Rogan.</v>

312
00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.920
<v Speaker 3>And then as the conversation continued</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I was like me</v>

316
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.260
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

317
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.000
<v Speaker 3>I think this actually might be Joe</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rogan.</v>

318
00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:12.710
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

319
00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.890

<v Speaker 3>this work.</v>

320
00:14:15.891 --> 00:14:18.350
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and finding and connecting with people</v>

321
00:14:18.351 --> 00:14:22.490
<v Speaker 3>who have an appreciation for the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the actual work that goes into it</v>

322
00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.500

<v Speaker 3>started under my own brand,</v>

325
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.990
<v Speaker 3>there's no way it would've thought I'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>be sitting here hanging out with you</v>

326
00:14:32.991 --> 00:14:35.630
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of a been a crazy ride for</v>

327
00:14:35.631 --> 00:14:36.620
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy,</v>

328
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>All of it is life's crazy.</v>

330
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.060
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I said,</v>

331
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.080
<v Speaker 2>I've always had a deep appreciation for</v>
<v Speaker 2>artisans.</v>

332
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for art.</v>

333
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.250
<v Speaker 2>What I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think your knife making his art,</v>

334
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean I really do like at this as</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's pulled up an image from your</v>

335
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:56.900
<v Speaker 2>website that shows this incredible blade</v>
<v Speaker 2>design.</v>

336
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Now this is what I've always wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

337
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Like is that Damascus steels that what</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is?</v>

338
00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.480
<v Speaker 3>That is Damascus in and it's just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>quick note.</v>

339
00:15:04.481 --> 00:15:08.980
<v Speaker 3>This is actually a post that I did to</v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrate another maker.</v>

340
00:15:08.981 --> 00:15:10.990
<v Speaker 3>His name's Julian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can actually kind of see it there on</v>

341
00:15:10.991 --> 00:15:12.070
<v Speaker 3>the right margin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

342
00:15:12.071 --> 00:15:13.890
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a South American kid,</v>

343
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.550
<v Speaker 2>the blade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blades that you made,</v>

344
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:19.850
<v Speaker 2>that you have here today that you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're bringing with you for an</v>

345
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:21.380
<v Speaker 2>auction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

346
00:15:21.381 --> 00:15:24.440
<v Speaker 2>the patterns on those things are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

347
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you make these,</v>

348
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:31.100
<v Speaker 2>cause it's not just steel for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are just listening to this.</v>

349
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Like that one is a great example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

350

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met three years right now and I just</v>

377
00:16:30.191 --> 00:16:32.800
<v Speaker 3>kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to shut it down because it's kind</v>

378
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.830
<v Speaker 3>of an overwhelming point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

379
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.930
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a good problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's overwhelming because it's a</v>

380
00:16:37.931 --> 00:16:39.180
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can imagine.</v>

381
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And balancing,</v>

382
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.690
<v Speaker 3>doing the work with now the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

383
00:16:43.691 --> 00:16:46.750
<v Speaker 3>like the marketing and branding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maintaining relevance through social</v>

384
00:16:46.751 --> 00:16:50.590
<v Speaker 3>media and taking the time to create</v>
<v Speaker 3>content on top of all of that.</v>

385
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:51.760
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

386
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.010
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're first starting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>

387
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.840
<v Speaker 3>the content part side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it fucking time,</v>

388
00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:57.843
<v Speaker 3>time consuming.</v>

389
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Crazy like long waiting lists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

390
00:17:00.581 --> 00:17:01.414
<v Speaker 2>Three years.</v>

391
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And realistic.</v>

392
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.480
<v Speaker 3>My hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually in the,</v>

393
00:17:05.481 --> 00:17:08.660
<v Speaker 3>at least in the knife making world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not uncommon for people to actually</v>

394
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:09.770
<v Speaker 3>wait longer than that.</v>

395
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.610
<v Speaker 2>This is the same thing with the pool cue</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

396
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is really the exact same thing.</v>

397
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.420
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

398
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:20.220
<v Speaker 2>famous pool cue manufacturers like</v>
<v Speaker 2>southwest or sugar tree and then they</v>

399
00:17:20.221 --> 00:17:24.210
<v Speaker 2>have 10 year waiting lists and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they do it right.</v>

400
00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:26.760
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's done by hand.</v>

401
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.490
<v Speaker 2>They're highly sought after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>

402
00:17:29.491 --> 00:17:31.680
<v Speaker 2>like you could buy a pool cue from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

403
00:17:31.681 --> 00:17:34.380
<v Speaker 2>a company that makes them through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

404
00:17:34.381 --> 00:17:37.410
<v Speaker 2>computerized process and they're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They play really good.</v>

405
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Just like a knife that you'd buy from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>store that's made by a machine and saw</v>

406
00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:45.840
<v Speaker 2>all done mass manufacturing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll cut your meat.</v>

407
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:46.710
<v Speaker 2>It works great.</v>

408
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets the job done,</v>

409
00:17:48.031 --> 00:17:50.670
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't feel the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't feel,</v>

410
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can feel the difference between</v>

411
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:57.810
<v Speaker 3>a handmade thing and a machine made</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

412
00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.790
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bizarre.</v>

413
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.320
<v Speaker 3>It trips me out every time.</v>

414
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little something that people</v>

415
00:18:03.471 --> 00:18:05.840
<v Speaker 2>leave and things that they make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

416
00:18:05.841 --> 00:18:06.710
<v Speaker 2>there really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

417
00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.390
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it exists in everything that</v>

418
00:18:08.391 --> 00:18:10.190
<v Speaker 2>people make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's clothing or jewelry or</v>

419
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.920
<v Speaker 2>furniture or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just think there's a little</v>

420
00:18:12.921 --> 00:18:15.060
<v Speaker 2>something that people leave when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

421
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.250
<v Speaker 2>in a thing that they make.</v>

422
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do there's something that you talk</v>

423
00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.650
<v Speaker 3>about sometimes about how animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>inherit,</v>

424
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.030
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

425
00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:23.740
<v Speaker 3>passed down through genes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

426
00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.550
<v Speaker 3>watch out for this plant and watch out</v>
<v Speaker 3>for these predators and shit like that.</v>

427
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.810
<v Speaker 3>Like the passing something on like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of in a way like where I'm toiling</v>

428
00:18:31.811 --> 00:18:33.820
<v Speaker 3>over something like that for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

429
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.490
<v Speaker 3>40 dedicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>solid fucking hours.</v>

430
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.530
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Making sure it's as perfect as I</v>

431
00:18:38.531 --> 00:18:43.531
<v Speaker 3>possibly can make that thing at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>point in my life with the skills I got.</v>

432
00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:45.000
<v Speaker 3>And I think</v>

433
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.090
<v Speaker 2>there's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

434
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:51.270
<v Speaker 2>even if it's just a thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you just know when you touch it,</v>

435
00:18:51.641 --> 00:18:54.160
<v Speaker 2>like if I touch this knife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that you made this,</v>

436
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm,</v>

437
00:18:55.271 --> 00:18:57.220
<v Speaker 2>when I'm cutting something with this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cooking,</v>

438
00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.830
<v Speaker 2>I know that you made this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it's just,</v>

439
00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.340
<v Speaker 2>even if it's only in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still,</v>

440
00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.440
<v Speaker 2>it just feels different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

441
00:19:05.441 --> 00:19:06.274
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

442
00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

443
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.830
<v Speaker 2>there's rupert sheldrake who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what exactly kind of</v>

444
00:19:11.831 --> 00:19:16.180
<v Speaker 2>scientist he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he has this bizarre theory and he's</v>

445
00:19:16.181 --> 00:19:19.930
<v Speaker 2>a really interesting guy to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would never discount it.</v>

446
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.230
<v Speaker 2>He thinks that everything has memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks he just,</v>

447
00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.020
<v Speaker 2>you just can't access that memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he thinks there's things that have</v>

448
00:19:26.021 --> 00:19:30.370
<v Speaker 2>memories and he thinks that our idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>that memory is something that only</v>

449
00:19:30.371 --> 00:19:33.610
<v Speaker 2>animals and humans possess is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just,</v>

450
00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.170
<v Speaker 2>it's probably not true.</v>

451
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.120
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably one of the reasons why</v>

452
00:19:37.121 --> 00:19:39.250
<v Speaker 2>people don't want to buy a house where</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone was murdered.</v>

453
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.270
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea is that a haunted house,</v>

454
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.920
<v Speaker 2>even if it's not really a ghost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe that home has memories,</v>

455
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe like my dad went to Gettysburg and</v>

456
00:19:51.611 --> 00:19:53.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not woo woo at all.</v>

457
00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:58.390
<v Speaker 2>He's like as fucking straight laced</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the board.</v>

458
00:19:58.391 --> 00:20:00.250
<v Speaker 2>No bullshit as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

459
00:20:00.251 --> 00:20:02.560
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could feel sadness.</v>

460
00:20:02.561 --> 00:20:03.670
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes.</v>

461
00:20:03.671 --> 00:20:06.880
<v Speaker 2>He's just think of how many thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people died at Gettysburg.</v>

462
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.410
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were there,</v>

463
00:20:08.411 --> 00:20:10.540
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels sad.</v>

464
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Like you feel death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

465
00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's real or if it's</v>

466
00:20:15.641 --> 00:20:18.880
<v Speaker 2>maybe the knowledge that you have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a war there.</v>

467
00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

468
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.640
<v Speaker 3>I used to do the thing where I would</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk through cemeteries.</v>

469
00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm just interested like looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's names and like when,</v>

470
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.890
<v Speaker 3>when did they live and what did people</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to say about them or what,</v>

471
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's left behind and just walking</v>

472
00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:36.810
<v Speaker 3>through cemeteries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like sometimes I would even do it on</v>

473
00:20:36.811 --> 00:20:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Halloween attraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my answer.</v>

474
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.060
<v Speaker 3>And it definitely feels weird in there.</v>

475
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.440
<v Speaker 2>I used to run through some guitars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to run through them because I</v>

476
00:20:47.441 --> 00:20:48.260
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

477
00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I would want to be reminded that life is</v>
<v Speaker 2>short.</v>

478
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Get something done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make something happen that all these</v>

479
00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:58.810
<v Speaker 2>people that aren't here anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing about cemeteries,</v>

480
00:20:58.811 --> 00:21:00.130
<v Speaker 2>it's like 30 dead when they get in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

481
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like the memory thing is like,</v>

482
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:04.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're on a boat and somebody gets</v>

483
00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:07.090
<v Speaker 2>murdered on that boat and you're in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>boat and you're like fucking freaking</v>

484
00:21:07.091 --> 00:21:07.400
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

485
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.400
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about like,</v>

486
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 2>things like if you had a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had a wallet that Mike Tyson</v>

487
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 2>owned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

488
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.140
<v Speaker 2>You'd hold it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

489
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:22.000
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

490
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.250
<v Speaker 2>there's something to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morphic resonance.</v>

491
00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Rupert sheldrake's theory,</v>

492
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to theory developed by Rupert Sheldrake,</v>

493
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:34.150
<v Speaker 2>British biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a paranormal influenced by which a</v>

494
00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:38.110
<v Speaker 2>pattern of events or behavior can</v>
<v Speaker 2>facilitate subsequent occurrences of</v>

495
00:21:38.111 --> 00:21:38.890
<v Speaker 2>similar patents.</v>

496
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

497
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.410
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

498
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.840
<v Speaker 2>that is not about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Memory,</v>

499
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.240
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was his other theories referred to</v>

500
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:50.190
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of the other ways about memory</v>
<v Speaker 2>is inherent in nature and yeah.</v>

501
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of it.</v>

502
00:21:52.121 --> 00:21:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Like I think what I was talking about as</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of his theory of morphic residence,</v>

503
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.820
<v Speaker 2>but morphic residence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's,</v>

504
00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:58.801
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

505
00:21:58.801 --> 00:21:59.634
<v Speaker 2>he's here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says that,</v>

506
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.573
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scroll back,</v>

507
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.460
<v Speaker 2>scroll down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the process whereby self organizing</v>

508
00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:07.270
<v Speaker 2>systems inherent a memory from previous</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar systems.</v>

509
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.870
<v Speaker 2>So when he was talking about with</v>
<v Speaker 2>morphic residence was um,</v>

510
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.710
<v Speaker 2>how mice if they learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

511
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.990
<v Speaker 2>like say if you have a pattern and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like cheese at the end of this</v>

512
00:22:16.991 --> 00:22:21.970
<v Speaker 2>pattern and then they go through a maze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if one mouse figures out that pattern,</v>

513
00:22:21.971 --> 00:22:25.720
<v Speaker 2>other mouse can figure it out quicker</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's something somehow or</v>

514
00:22:25.721 --> 00:22:27.520
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they learn from each other.</v>

515
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.360
<v Speaker 2>And when chimpanzees were observed using</v>
<v Speaker 2>tools,</v>

516
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:35.530
<v Speaker 2>other chimpanzees on the other side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world started mimicking that</v>

517
00:22:35.531 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 2>behavior without any interaction with</v>
<v Speaker 2>those chimpanzees at all.</v>

518
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

519
00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very strange.</v>

520
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.040
<v Speaker 2>That's like fucking butterfly effects</v>
<v Speaker 2>shelter more intense than butterfly</v>

521
00:22:47.111 --> 00:22:52.111
<v Speaker 2>effect because it implies that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of collective information pool</v>

522
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.550
<v Speaker 2>that they're sharing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

523
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:59.580
<v Speaker 2>through the ether that there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that they are sharing through</v>

524
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:03.040
<v Speaker 2>some unknown method has crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

525
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Well it's been a pr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

526
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:08.560
<v Speaker 2>it's actually been shown that there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a,</v>

527
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.920
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something to this and there's a</v>

528
00:23:11.921 --> 00:23:14.770
<v Speaker 2>lot of criticism of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're one of those people right</v>

529
00:23:14.771 --> 00:23:17.620
<v Speaker 2>now that's like a strict materialist and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're screaming out,</v>

530
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.930
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

531
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.860
<v Speaker 2>If someone who's a real rationalist who</v>
<v Speaker 2>just wants only science,</v>

532
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 2>provable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>

533
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:27.610
<v Speaker 2>it is kind of provable because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>

534
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.730
<v Speaker 2>there has been some tasks and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fierce opposition to this,</v>

535
00:23:30.731 --> 00:23:34.050
<v Speaker 2>which is anything that has like some woo</v>
<v Speaker 2>attached to it,</v>

536
00:23:34.051 --> 00:23:35.590
<v Speaker 2>it's going to have some fierce</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition.</v>

537
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:40.770
<v Speaker 2>But Rupert was a really fascinating guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's also a rare scientists.</v>

538
00:23:41.361 --> 00:23:42.760
<v Speaker 2>That's he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

539
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.380
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was Christian.</v>

540
00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really into,</v>

541
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:51.610
<v Speaker 2>he has a certain level of Christianity</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he accepts and adopts cause he</v>

542
00:23:53.491 --> 00:23:56.060
<v Speaker 2>feels like it's beneficial to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting guy.</v>

543
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

544
00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:58.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a podcast,</v>

545
00:23:58.131 --> 00:23:59.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few years back.</v>

546
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a trip him and um,</v>

547
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a mathematician and Terence</v>

548
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the other gentlemen,</v>

549
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.810
<v Speaker 2>they were the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the trial logs.</v>

550
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.900
<v Speaker 2>They had these fantastic recordings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was sheldrake Mckenna and one other</v>

551
00:24:17.301 --> 00:24:21.170
<v Speaker 2>guy was also brilliant and they would go</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and forth.</v>

552
00:24:21.171 --> 00:24:23.570
<v Speaker 2>They had these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Ralph Abraham,</v>

553
00:24:23.571 --> 00:24:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Abraham Abrams or Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham,</v>

554
00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

555
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:31.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did these series of talks and a,</v>

556
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:35.060
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the things that came up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Mckenna was the most woowoo.</v>

557
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Ralph Abraham was the least woo woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sheldrick was kind of in the middle,</v>

558
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:41.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

559
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Interesting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've ever been around.</v>

560
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trial logs.</v>

561
00:24:45.141 --> 00:24:46.700
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>

562
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.590
<v Speaker 2>The recordings is still available</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>

563
00:24:48.591 --> 00:24:50.870
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

564
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.780
<v Speaker 2>our friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a psychedelic salon,</v>

565
00:24:53.781 --> 00:24:57.230
<v Speaker 2>I think Lorenzo has them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they available on line?</v>

566
00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking cool man.</v>

569
00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Actually play it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why you can't play it.</v>

570
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.390
<v Speaker 4>It was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to take him down now that yeah,</v>

571
00:25:06.391 --> 00:25:07.980
<v Speaker 4>that is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Looks I got removed.</v>

572
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

573
00:25:09.021 --> 00:25:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Someone's probably selling it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

574
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.410
<v Speaker 2>It's really cool though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

575
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:15.440
<v Speaker 2>you get to see these guys in the 1990s</v>
<v Speaker 2>pre-internet,</v>

576
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:21.460
<v Speaker 2>was it pre internet might not have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be like 98 I think Mckenna died</v>

577
00:25:21.771 --> 00:25:26.771
<v Speaker 2>around 2000 ish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died posts to hold a site.</v>

578
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:32.550
<v Speaker 2>Say he died like 2003 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did he die?</v>

579
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Why am I asking this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all about memory and things as</v>

580
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.810
<v Speaker 2>we went on the fucking deep road off to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the woods here.</v>

581
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.310
<v Speaker 2>But anybody who's listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2000.</v>

582
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he made it to y two K and then he</v>

583
00:25:48.151 --> 00:25:50.220
<v Speaker 2>kicked the bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

584
00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:54.810
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's just interested in really</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool conversations,</v>

585
00:25:54.811 --> 00:25:57.570
<v Speaker 2>it's something to listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds very interesting.</v>

586
00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just three super smart dudes kinda</v>

587
00:25:59.431 --> 00:26:01.740
<v Speaker 2>debating ideas and bouncing around off</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

588
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:04.080
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I've actually gotten into recently</v>

589
00:26:04.081 --> 00:26:07.650
<v Speaker 4>is listening to old recordings of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

590
00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:09.900
<v Speaker 4>Alan Watts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

591
00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was great reading Joseph Campbell and</v>

592
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.550
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

593
00:26:14.551 --> 00:26:16.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just absorbing it and trying to figure</v>

594
00:26:16.801 --> 00:26:21.801
<v Speaker 4>out what that means to me today in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the hero different world.</v>

595
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:22.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

596
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watson is a fascinating guy.</v>

597
00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Plus that accent made him sound so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooler.</v>

598
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:27.853
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

599
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:33.370
<v Speaker 4>Drone [inaudible] yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His actually,</v>

600
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:35.810
<v Speaker 4>the first time I ever gotten to a good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

601
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.673
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

602
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:42.490
<v Speaker 4>like a meditative space was a meditation</v>
<v Speaker 4>led by Alan Watts from like,</v>

603
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't know when the fuck</v>

604
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.240
<v Speaker 3>it was like 60 seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just the way he explained it for me,</v>

605
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.870
<v Speaker 3>like it was the first time I'd ever made</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense how meditation should,</v>

606
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.450
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't try to not think of anything,</v>

607
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:59.540
<v Speaker 3>but just accept them that the there and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also ignore them at the same time.</v>

608
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:00.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>

609
00:27:00.811 --> 00:27:05.370
<v Speaker 3>And then I just totally like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I was above myself watching</v>

610
00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:08.040
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just sitting there listening to this</v>

611
00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:08.874
<v Speaker 3>recording,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a trip.</v>

612
00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was such a heady guy.</v>

613
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.340
<v Speaker 2>There's the sound of his voice and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing his thoughts.</v>

614
00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.710
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hear a really deep thinker like</v>

615
00:27:15.711 --> 00:27:17.360
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that it does is kind</v>

616
00:27:17.361 --> 00:27:20.240
<v Speaker 2>of gets you into that pattern of thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you realize like,</v>

617
00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.030
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can probably kind of sorta think that</v>

618
00:27:23.031 --> 00:27:26.390
<v Speaker 2>way too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll just allow myself to be guided by</v>

619
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:30.080
<v Speaker 2>his words and sort of try to pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to how he's doing this.</v>

620
00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

621
00:27:31.281 --> 00:27:34.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was an interesting guy because not</v>

622
00:27:34.671 --> 00:27:37.040
<v Speaker 2>just was he a deep thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his,</v>

623
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the influences of those people.</v>

624
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.870
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very different.</v>

625
00:27:41.871 --> 00:27:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Like there's very few recordings even</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then for them to listen to,</v>

626
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff was based on reading,</v>

627
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:52.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their education and their actual</v>

628
00:27:52.311 --> 00:27:56.120
<v Speaker 2>life experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were very unique and original.</v>

629
00:27:56.121 --> 00:27:59.330
<v Speaker 2>They were the really the cornerstones</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of these deep philosophical</v>

630
00:27:59.331 --> 00:28:00.710
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

631
00:28:00.711 --> 00:28:04.430
<v Speaker 2>And so then when you hear an Alan Watts</v>
<v Speaker 2>recording today,</v>

632
00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe someone like me or some other</v>

633
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.550
<v Speaker 2>people that listen to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll might,</v>

634
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:12.170
<v Speaker 2>might share those ideas or reflect on</v>
<v Speaker 2>those ideas.</v>

635
00:28:12.171 --> 00:28:17.171
<v Speaker 2>But clearly these are not my ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are ideas that have come from</v>

636
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.560
<v Speaker 2>these intense cornerstone people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Mckenna,</v>

637
00:28:21.561 --> 00:28:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Alan Watts or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you get a chance while you're,</v>

638
00:28:25.011 --> 00:28:27.410
<v Speaker 2>when you're working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you listen to shit or do you just,</v>

639
00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got all the time to sit in.</v>

640
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.370
<v Speaker 3>The headphones are cause it seems like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be loud as fuck.</v>

641
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I just got Ahold of these like</v>

642
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 3>Bluetooth head head and like earbuds and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have this memory phone so they are</v>

643
00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.610
<v Speaker 3>memory foam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ear bud like tips.</v>

644
00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:45.730
<v Speaker 3>So that helps reduce the amount of noise</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually coming in.</v>

645
00:28:45.731 --> 00:28:48.190
<v Speaker 3>So it helps protect it in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just kinda in general,</v>

646
00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:52.210
<v Speaker 3>like a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a inner ear plug would work.</v>

647
00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.970
<v Speaker 3>But also because it's reducing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of noise that's getting in.</v>

648
00:28:54.971 --> 00:28:59.971
<v Speaker 3>You can also listen at a lower volume so</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not like blowing out your ears to</v>

649
00:29:00.311 --> 00:29:02.530
<v Speaker 3>be able to hear whatever you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to.</v>

650
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Like you wouldn't through normal</v>
<v Speaker 3>earbuds.</v>

651
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So loud in your shop.</v>

652
00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.490
<v Speaker 3>So much noise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's whenever I'm working,</v>

653
00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.270
<v Speaker 3>like especially if somebody happens to</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop by the shop and they want to see and</v>

654
00:29:13.271 --> 00:29:16.660
<v Speaker 3>like they're just curious and so we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff going on or we can heat some steel</v>

655
00:29:16.661 --> 00:29:18.490
<v Speaker 3>up real quick and do a quick</v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstration.</v>

656
00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:23.560
<v Speaker 3>Usually I don't take the time to throw</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff in and fuck it is so</v>

657
00:29:23.561 --> 00:29:25.120
<v Speaker 3>loud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually feel like my hearing is</v>

658
00:29:25.121 --> 00:29:30.121
<v Speaker 3>become more sensitive since I started</v>
<v Speaker 3>making knives than it was before.</v>

659
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably your years of getting beat up.</v>

660
00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Well you always have earplugs in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always have hearing protection and so,</v>

661
00:29:36.611 --> 00:29:40.150
<v Speaker 3>so my hearing is always protected so I</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like it's become more sensitive.</v>

662
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 3>I've a sense</v>

663
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.930
<v Speaker 4>of hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's possible to get</v>

664
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:46.430
<v Speaker 4>your hearing back or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

665
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.060
<v Speaker 4>maybe your protect doing better because</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>

666
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.103
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

667
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:54.220
<v Speaker 4>I hear a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all the things it feels like</v>

668
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:56.980
<v Speaker 4>whenever I take my hearing or that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a hearing protection out,</v>

669
00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.240
<v Speaker 4>I'll be at home or something and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>picking what the Lux,</v>

670
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 4>that noise and my wife's looking at me</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm fucking crazy.</v>

671
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:02.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

672
00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.760
<v Speaker 2>one us the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if like,</v>

673
00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.560
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

674
00:30:06.561 --> 00:30:09.140
<v Speaker 2>people don't use their hands and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hands get soft.</v>

675
00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:14.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't gain it back.</v>

676
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you might be protecting it longer</v>

677
00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.200
<v Speaker 2>and since your habit sensitivity issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe since it's quiet or all day.</v>

678
00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.050
<v Speaker 2>So if you blow it out from like concerts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit like that,</v>

679
00:30:24.051 --> 00:30:25.880
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell it was while you can do is get a</v>

680
00:30:25.881 --> 00:30:26.714
<v Speaker 2>hearing aid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

681
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.630
<v Speaker 2>What about the little hairs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stem cells or some shit.</v>

682
00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.840
<v Speaker 2>They don't do that yet because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally what you hearing.</v>

683
00:30:32.841 --> 00:30:33.470
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

684
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:35.840
<v Speaker 2>like a hair follicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's vibrating.</v>

685
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Blow that shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't synthetically made those</v>

686
00:30:39.261 --> 00:30:40.560
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throw him yet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It didn't know any better and now they,</v>

688

<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden.</v>

691

<v Speaker 2>That's the Lord's work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just kidding.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think you should have nobody knew any</v>

701
00:31:09.971 --> 00:31:10.804
<v Speaker 2>better back then.</v>

702
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.330
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen that documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an older one.</v>

703
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.180
<v Speaker 4>Older one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like from the early two thousands</v>

704
00:31:16.181 --> 00:31:20.230
<v Speaker 4>but this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she progressively got deafer and deafer</v>

705
00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:24.460
<v Speaker 4>as she grew older until like I think she</v>
<v Speaker 4>in high school or something and like she</v>

706
00:31:24.461 --> 00:31:28.750
<v Speaker 4>was like practically completely deaf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But she's a percussionist and she's like</v>

707
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.030
<v Speaker 4>a world renowned percussionists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this awesome documentary is</v>

708
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.540
<v Speaker 4>called a touch the sound and she hears</v>
<v Speaker 4>through her body,</v>

709
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.970
<v Speaker 4>which is a fun trips me out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the tones that she's able to achieve</v>

710
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.640
<v Speaker 4>that control,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she has over everything,</v>

711
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.070
<v Speaker 4>whatever kind of instrument she's</v>
<v Speaker 4>playing.</v>

712
00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.450
<v Speaker 4>It's an awesome documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

713
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:55.210
<v Speaker 4>But she has almost literally no hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She hears everything through her body</v>

714
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.390
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's kind of interesting to think</v>

715
00:31:58.391 --> 00:32:01.480
<v Speaker 4>like if angus could figure that shit out</v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

716
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's holding the fucking thing is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole time he's standing in front of</v>

717
00:32:05.391 --> 00:32:06.850
<v Speaker 4>the angus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lead singer.</v>

718
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:07.720
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

719
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.440
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fuck's his name?</v>

721
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.830
<v Speaker 4>Second lead singer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian Johnson.</v>

722
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.130
<v Speaker 4>And I forget that he's gone deaf too.</v>

<v Speaker 4>stuff they're learning now.</v>

731
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:42.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

734
00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:52.520
<v Speaker 4>My neck was always all kinds of fucked</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and you know,</v>

735
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.460
<v Speaker 4>I definitely had some serious</v>
<v Speaker 4>concussions.</v>

736
00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.340
<v Speaker 4>Well I'm sure and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

737
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.580
<v Speaker 4>sometimes it scares me and worries me a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>

738
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:03.980
<v Speaker 4>Like what does that mean for how old are</v>
<v Speaker 4>you now?</v>

739
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:04.940
<v Speaker 4>34.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

740
00:33:04.941 --> 00:33:06.080
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just turned 34.</v>

741
00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's scary.</v>

742
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're lucky you stopped when you did.</v>

743
00:33:09.791 --> 00:33:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people with brain damage</v>

744
00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:14.130
<v Speaker 2>meat too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

745
00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I have some guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must,</v>

746
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody rides for free.</v>

747
00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I think you get hit in the head enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got some brain damage.</v>

748
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got hit in the head on a regular basis</v>

749
00:33:26.681 --> 00:33:31.681
<v Speaker 2>for most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of my younger years from like 15 to</v>

750
00:33:32.861 --> 00:33:35.230
<v Speaker 2>like 22 yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to hit in the head all the time.</v>

751
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:39.040
<v Speaker 2>It's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knew any better,</v>

752
00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.710
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And back then you thought that like once</v>

753
00:33:41.711 --> 00:33:45.610
<v Speaker 2>you got like once you were slurring your</v>
<v Speaker 2>words and stuff,</v>

754
00:33:45.611 --> 00:33:48.820
<v Speaker 2>if he just stopped like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh he's a little punchy,</v>

755
00:33:48.821 --> 00:33:50.020
<v Speaker 2>you should stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

756
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how people thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't realize that it's</v>

757
00:33:52.001 --> 00:33:56.380
<v Speaker 2>regressive and then like you don't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>really show brain damage like 10 years</v>

758
00:33:56.381 --> 00:33:58.490
<v Speaker 2>after the initial injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

759
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.760
<v Speaker 2>That's when you really start showing</v>
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>

760
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:04.840
<v Speaker 2>So some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some cte just compounds it until it just</v>

761
00:34:04.841 --> 00:34:07.240
<v Speaker 2>becomes unmanageable for these poor</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

762
00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:09.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

763
00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.320
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

764
00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:12.330
<v Speaker 4>especially after watching concussion</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

765
00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:15.870
<v Speaker 4>and seeing and reading like articles</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the real life people that this</v>

766
00:34:15.871 --> 00:34:17.760
<v Speaker 4>shit's happened to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

767
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.180
<v Speaker 4>I have a hard time watching football and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I used to watch football time.</v>

768
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:25.020
<v Speaker 4>I've never been like crazy in a sports.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Knowing all the stats and every stuff.</v>

769
00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.500
<v Speaker 4>I enjoyed watching like a good contest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never really rooted for anybody.</v>

770
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:33.480
<v Speaker 4>But now when I see like even kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>signing the draft or signing up from</v>

771
00:34:33.481 --> 00:34:35.520
<v Speaker 4>high school to go to a certain college,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's somebody who's fucking baby.</v>

773
00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:40.050

<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

774
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:41.460

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

779
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.650
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's other stuff like x games</v>

<v Speaker 2>people that are in the snowboarding,</v>

782
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 2>snowboarders wipe out all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>crack their head open ledger.</v>

783
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Can you get a scholarship and martial</v>
<v Speaker 2>arts of any kind?</v>

788
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.110

<v Speaker 2>It's probably one of the most important</v>

789
00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:16.550
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably it,</v>

794
00:35:24.471 --> 00:35:25.220
<v Speaker 2>and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

795
00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.690
<v Speaker 2>boxing was a a legitimate sport in</v>
<v Speaker 2>college but not anymore.</v>

799
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to be careful with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand eye and your fingers</v>

800
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:43.020
<v Speaker 4>and shit now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you gotta think like when you're</v>

801
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:46.530
<v Speaker 4>working with hammers and hot metal and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

802
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:51.060
<v Speaker 4>you must always have to be [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody that works in machine shops</v>

803
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:53.850
<v Speaker 4>missing that fingertip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something's fucked up.</v>

804
00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.550
<v Speaker 4>This crazy story is to buffer the</v>
<v Speaker 4>buffer.</v>

805
00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:01.170
<v Speaker 4>Like the fluffy little thing is like one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the most dangerous things because it</v>

806
00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:03.210
<v Speaker 4>catches an edge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're snowboarding,</v>

807
00:36:03.211 --> 00:36:08.211
<v Speaker 4>you catch a bad edge and just plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It bites the blade bites into that and</v>

808
00:36:08.671 --> 00:36:13.671
<v Speaker 4>it acts as a hand and just rips it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flings it wherever it's throwing knives</v>

809
00:36:14.251 --> 00:36:15.990
<v Speaker 4>right back into guys and fucking killed</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

810

<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My wife probably hating me.</v>

811
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.350

<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

812
00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is reality.</v>

813
00:36:22.291 --> 00:36:24.330
<v Speaker 4>I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've actually done a lot of work to get</v>

814
00:36:24.331 --> 00:36:28.740
<v Speaker 4>away from using buffers because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm still like doing great work.</v>

815
00:36:28.741 --> 00:36:31.110
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a lot of friends who just,</v>

816
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.320
<v Speaker 4>they'll never touch a fucking buffer and</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrifying.</v>

817
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 4>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it look like for pizza put up?</v>

818
00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:39.060
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it?</v>

819
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buffing.</v>

820
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.170
<v Speaker 4>Wash it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what usually,</v>

821
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.530
<v Speaker 4>usually it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bench top thing,</v>

822
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:49.920
<v Speaker 4>like a bench grinder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Usually it has like the hard wheat round</v>

823
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.170
<v Speaker 4>stone wheel on one size at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it right there.</v>

824
00:36:52.171 --> 00:36:55.620
<v Speaker 4>Those mother fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just not one fucking day was</v>

825
00:36:55.621 --> 00:36:59.070
<v Speaker 4>going to kick this going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not making me nervous.</v>

826
00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.650
<v Speaker 4>That look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that looks like something.</v>

827
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:06.840
<v Speaker 4>So if you fucked up and you got that</v>
<v Speaker 4>blade to close and kick it and then that</v>

828
00:37:06.841 --> 00:37:09.160
<v Speaker 4>one is what's called a sizable wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

829
00:37:09.161 --> 00:37:11.800
<v Speaker 4>it's made from a t that type of rope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

830
00:37:11.801 --> 00:37:16.260
<v Speaker 4>the ones that are the most dangerous or</v>
<v Speaker 4>the softer cotton wheels because they</v>

831
00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:19.080
<v Speaker 4>want to grab that much easier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have more give.</v>

832
00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

833
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:23.670
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what's interesting is I've actually</v>

834
00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:28.810
<v Speaker 4>been cut less working in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a metal shop than I ever did working</v>

835
00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.780
<v Speaker 4>in and burned less than I ever did</v>
<v Speaker 4>working in,</v>

836
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.500
<v Speaker 4>in kitchens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worked in restaurants back at house</v>

837
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:39.420
<v Speaker 4>like for seven years collectively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And most of that has to do with other</v>

838
00:37:39.421 --> 00:37:42.910
<v Speaker 4>people not calling like hot coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>across and fucking,</v>

839
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.610
<v Speaker 4>I turned around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't call it,</v>

840
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.620
<v Speaker 4>I turned around there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there with this fucking saute pan right</v>

841
00:37:47.621 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 4>in the side of my arm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm ready to fucking drop it.</v>

842
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.760
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's being in a metal shop,</v>

843
00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.910
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do have to pay so much attention.</v>

844
00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.480
<v Speaker 4>You have to be focused at what you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing because literally everything in</v>

845
00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:03.120
<v Speaker 4>that fucking shop wants to hurt you or</v>
<v Speaker 4>kill you.</v>

846
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.420
<v Speaker 4>The second you're not paying attention</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the second you're not paying</v>

847
00:38:06.421 --> 00:38:09.360
<v Speaker 4>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to grab you like their horror</v>

848
00:38:09.361 --> 00:38:14.250
<v Speaker 4>stories of people working next to</v>
<v Speaker 4>machines and they have long hair and it</v>

849
00:38:14.251 --> 00:38:19.251
<v Speaker 4>just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>scalps and like just straight heritable</v>

850
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.730
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arable cider in the power tool last</v>

851
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:24.331
<v Speaker 4>week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

852
00:38:24.331 --> 00:38:27.060
<v Speaker 4>He got a power tool stuck in his balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was that</v>

853
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.080
<v Speaker 4>poor bastard?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

854
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.640
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian Wilson.</v>

855
00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Drill that uh,</v>

856
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 4>he lost his hearing due to not</v>

857
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.900
<v Speaker 2>plot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting in earplugs at a car race,</v>

858
00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:41.080
<v Speaker 2>not music</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically.</v>

859
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 2>There was a quote Brian Wilson from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beach boys.</v>

860
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian Wilson from the beach boy or I'm</v>

861
00:38:46.601 --> 00:38:47.410
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

862
00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:50.560
<v Speaker 2>this article has him at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian Johnson.</v>

863
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Johnson from cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

864
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck does he know mother fuckers</v>

865
00:38:55.961 --> 00:38:57.620
<v Speaker 2>in AC DC?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

866
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you think that'd be loud too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro?</v>

867
00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:02.140
<v Speaker 2>Angus young says it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lost a little bit,</v>

868
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:04.360
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his quote says that he never really had</v>

869
00:39:04.361 --> 00:39:06.940
<v Speaker 2>a problem with it because that's why he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was running around on stage so much too.</v>

870
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:12.400
<v Speaker 2>He's never in one place so long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The room,</v>

871
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:15.700
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin or ever saw ICDS.</v>

872
00:39:15.701 --> 00:39:17.500
<v Speaker 2>ACDC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if people were more</v>

873
00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:19.120
<v Speaker 2>susceptible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like some people are more</v>

874
00:39:19.121 --> 00:39:22.320
<v Speaker 2>susceptible to cte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

875
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Remember Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patrick was talking about certain genes</v>

876
00:39:25.001 --> 00:39:28.090
<v Speaker 2>that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it apropos,</v>

877
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it was called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever genes that make you more</v>

878
00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:36.160
<v Speaker 2>susceptible and more likely to get cte</v>
<v Speaker 2>from concussions problem.</v>

879
00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Probably not to be something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably makes sense.</v>

880
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in that shop and you're,</v>

881
00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:43.990
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

882
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:48.340
<v Speaker 2>you're doing all this grinding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there any concern about chemicals</v>

883
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.400
<v Speaker 2>like dessert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical ingestion or smells in the air?</v>

884
00:39:51.401 --> 00:39:54.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dipping things and you've got all</v>

885
00:39:54.581 --> 00:39:55.650
<v Speaker 2>this stuff that using,</v>

886
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.581
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially for you.</v>

887
00:39:56.581 --> 00:39:58.050
<v Speaker 4>We're working with synthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

888
00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.270
<v Speaker 4>any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any material that you're grinding,</v>

889
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.210
<v Speaker 4>you're making it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's airborne.</v>

890
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:07.800
<v Speaker 4>Like any of it can go onto your loans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm almost always wearing a respirator.</v>

891
00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially when I'm grinding.</v>

892
00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:13.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like double can always like</v>

893
00:40:13.891 --> 00:40:14.970
<v Speaker 4>covering up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it work?</v>

894
00:40:14.971 --> 00:40:16.530
<v Speaker 4>Does a respray are filled out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of it.</v>

895
00:40:16.531 --> 00:40:17.970
<v Speaker 4>It makes a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

896
00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.240
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where have my facial hair right now?</v>

897
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.340
<v Speaker 4>Even this little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you got,</v>

898
00:40:23.341 --> 00:40:27.120
<v Speaker 4>even that little bit is enough to create</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little gap and it can get through</v>

899
00:40:27.121 --> 00:40:28.890
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to shave your face smooth.</v>

900
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>usually I keep it pretty well now I'm</v>

901
00:40:31.641 --> 00:40:33.270
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck do you create those</v>

902
00:40:33.271 --> 00:40:35.040
<v Speaker 4>patterns?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Damascus steel.</v>

903
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:36.330
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

904
00:40:36.331 --> 00:40:39.660
<v Speaker 4>this doesn't have too much of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was not in the Damascus steel</v>

905
00:40:39.661 --> 00:40:40.494
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately.</v>

906
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.100
<v Speaker 4>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

907
00:40:42.101 --> 00:40:44.520
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does create those black that,</v>

908
00:40:44.521 --> 00:40:45.600
<v Speaker 4>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you do that?</v>

909
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:49.260
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at a crazy image that</v>
<v Speaker 4>looks like it almost looks like someone</v>

910
00:40:49.261 --> 00:40:51.450
<v Speaker 4>drew on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a,</v>

911
00:40:51.451 --> 00:40:53.370
<v Speaker 4>this is a pattern that just came up with</v>
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>

912
00:40:53.371 --> 00:40:56.040
<v Speaker 4>It's called,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I call it the brain mosaic for lack of</v>

913
00:40:56.041 --> 00:40:57.330
<v Speaker 4>better term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

914
00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:01.230
<v Speaker 4>but it just looks like a braid and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>something I've been wanting to create</v>

915
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:06.910
<v Speaker 4>and really figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So essentially to create pattern welded</v>

916
00:41:07.291 --> 00:41:08.850
<v Speaker 4>Damascus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

917
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:12.060
<v Speaker 4>first off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damascus is kind of a blanket has become</v>

918
00:41:12.061 --> 00:41:15.720
<v Speaker 4>a blanket term traditionally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And originally it actually referred to</v>

919
00:41:15.721 --> 00:41:18.600
<v Speaker 4>the steel that like the type of steel</v>
<v Speaker 4>that your knife,</v>

920
00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:21.150
<v Speaker 4>this knife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the media and knife is made from.</v>

921
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:26.510
<v Speaker 4>And it eventually became a blanket term</v>
<v Speaker 4>for all kinds of kind of pattern steel</v>

922
00:41:27.451 --> 00:41:29.030
<v Speaker 4>in general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's it,</v>

923
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:33.680
<v Speaker 4>it curdles naturally or if it's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>forced and created the way that pattern</v>

924
00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:34.514
<v Speaker 4>was made.</v>

925
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.800
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's pattern welded steel.</v>

926
00:41:36.801 --> 00:41:41.210
<v Speaker 3>And so you have to start with at least</v>
<v Speaker 3>two different types of high carbon</v>

927
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:45.050
<v Speaker 3>steel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ideally s steels that heat treat in a</v>

928
00:41:45.051 --> 00:41:47.600
<v Speaker 3>similar range.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you heat them up and squish on</v>

929
00:41:47.601 --> 00:41:50.240
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they they move at a similar rate.</v>

930
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:51.530
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

931
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.830
<v Speaker 3>most commonly people are working with 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>80 and 15 and 20.</v>

932
00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Those are just codes for two different</v>
<v Speaker 3>types of high carbon steel.</v>

933
00:41:58.611 --> 00:42:01.280
<v Speaker 3>But essentially you're bringing them up</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a high temperature.</v>

934
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:02.870
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

935
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.860
<v Speaker 3>you squish them either under a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>hammer or under a press.</v>

936
00:42:06.861 --> 00:42:09.920
<v Speaker 3>You can even actually do it by hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to do kind of a smaller</v>

937
00:42:09.921 --> 00:42:14.150
<v Speaker 3>bill it to create the patterns and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to stick because the trick is really</v>

938
00:42:14.151 --> 00:42:14.990
<v Speaker 3>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

939
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:18.710
<v Speaker 3>getting them clothes evenly squishing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

940
00:42:18.711 --> 00:42:19.880
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

941
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:24.620
<v Speaker 3>if you've ever like rolled out dough or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody who's ever made like pastry</v>

942
00:42:24.621 --> 00:42:26.180
<v Speaker 3>dough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you would use in a croissant,</v>

943
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.180
<v Speaker 3>you tear open a croissant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see all those layers in there.</v>

944
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:32.030
<v Speaker 3>And that's from a piece of dough being</v>
<v Speaker 3>rolled out,</v>

945
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 3>fully rolled out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's Kinda the same fucking thing</v>

946
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.910
<v Speaker 3>but with metal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have to have the kind of,</v>

947
00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right kind of temperature</v>

948
00:42:40.821 --> 00:42:42.170
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of,</v>

949
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.821
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

950
00:42:42.821 --> 00:42:47.750
<v Speaker 3>you want as little oxygen in there as</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible because of the oxygen creates</v>

951
00:42:47.751 --> 00:42:50.990
<v Speaker 3>carbon</v>
<v Speaker 3>or no carbon.</v>

952
00:42:50.991 --> 00:42:52.860
<v Speaker 3>But iron oxide that helps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

953
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:55.820
<v Speaker 3>kind of is detrimental to creating solid</v>
<v Speaker 3>weld bonds.</v>

954
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:57.470
<v Speaker 3>And there are different ways to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

955
00:42:57.471 --> 00:43:01.340
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once the 10 80 is the black steel,</v>

956
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.160
<v Speaker 3>the black color and the 15 and 20 is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

957
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:06.860
<v Speaker 3>is the silver color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a difference in the way those</v>

958
00:43:06.861 --> 00:43:09.760
<v Speaker 3>steels performance harder or more</v>
<v Speaker 3>doable.</v>

959
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.700
<v Speaker 3>So they pretty much on edge more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pretty much form almost or perform</v>

960
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.920
<v Speaker 3>almost exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>

961
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:17.600
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemically speaking,</v>

962
00:43:17.601 --> 00:43:20.630
<v Speaker 3>they're almost exactly the same except</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the 15 and 20,</v>

963
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:25.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a high level of nickel and end 0.2%</v>

964
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:27.050
<v Speaker 3>by volume or by weight.</v>

965
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:31.100
<v Speaker 3>And so that steel is traditionally used</v>
<v Speaker 3>in saw blades,</v>

966
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:35.390
<v Speaker 3>especially large big mill band saws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

967
00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in Oregon there's like one of the</v>

968
00:43:37.431 --> 00:43:39.990
<v Speaker 3>oldest continuously running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

969
00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:44.150
<v Speaker 3>wood saw mill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still there and doing its thing</v>

970
00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:49.480
<v Speaker 3>with these giant bandsaw blades that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 30 feet and that are uh,</v>

971
00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:54.850
<v Speaker 3>in circumference and they're like foot</v>
<v Speaker 3>wide and there's monsters and foot wide.</v>

972
00:43:56.091 --> 00:43:57.830
<v Speaker 3>You mean like thick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

973
00:43:57.831 --> 00:43:58.041
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

974
00:43:58.041 --> 00:44:01.880
<v Speaker 3>Like they're only in like maybe a 16th</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an inch thick because you want to</v>

975
00:44:01.881 --> 00:44:04.220
<v Speaker 3>narrow soccer so you're not wasting</v>
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>

976
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:09.550
<v Speaker 3>But their why to help prevent deflection</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep it from kind of Swiss band saw.</v>

977
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:11.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking of a circular saw for some</v>
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

978
00:44:11.511 --> 00:44:11.961
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

979
00:44:11.961 --> 00:44:15.080
<v Speaker 3>band saws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So circular saw those.</v>

980
00:44:15.081 --> 00:44:19.310
<v Speaker 3>Soccer's are usually probably around a</v>
<v Speaker 3>eighth of an inch to a quarter of an</v>

981
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:22.130
<v Speaker 3>inch thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's the same kind of idea is that</v>

982
00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:26.660
<v Speaker 3>they're trimming down these giant logs</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they need a big fucking saw.</v>

983
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's circular break,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

984
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 3>I must be a fucking nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's gotta be</v>

985
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.480
<v Speaker 4>such,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to be standing right</v>

986
00:44:33.481 --> 00:44:36.060
<v Speaker 4>there when that you've seen an original</v>
<v Speaker 4>Samurai sword.</v>

987
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.330
<v Speaker 4>I've seen a few,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually this one's from the 15</v>

988
00:44:39.331 --> 00:44:40.540
<v Speaker 4>hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Check this shit out of us.</v>

989
00:44:40.541 --> 00:44:42.660
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

990
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.070
<v Speaker 4>This is the one that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

991
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Speaker 4>Mr Neil degrasse tyson was posing with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other day.</v>

992
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a real one.</v>

993
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:53.730
<v Speaker 4>That's an actual Real Samurai sword,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

994
00:44:53.731 --> 00:44:55.560
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From the 15 hundreds.</v>

995
00:44:55.580 --> 00:45:00.580
<v Speaker 4>See the race skin is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know when it was made exactly?</v>

996
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:02.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they know.</v>

997
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:06.460
<v Speaker 2>They just know it's from some time</v>
<v Speaker 2>period in the 15 hundreds for sure.</v>

998
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Sit Certificate of authentication that</v>
<v Speaker 2>came with it.</v>

999
00:45:10.641 --> 00:45:11.550
<v Speaker 2>That explains,</v>

1000
00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm just looking to see what the hormone</v>
<v Speaker 4>activity looks like.</v>

1001
00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.220
<v Speaker 4>So the hormone is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1002
00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:25.180
<v Speaker 4>you can kind of see this line that runs</v>
<v Speaker 4>parallel to the cutting edge and that</v>

1003
00:45:26.361 --> 00:45:31.361
<v Speaker 4>usually indicates where the soft</v>
<v Speaker 4>materials stops and the hard materials</v>

1004
00:45:31.691 --> 00:45:33.440
<v Speaker 4>starts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1005
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.800
<v Speaker 4>and so the idea with these kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1006
00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:40.810
<v Speaker 4>the challenge with any knife is making a</v>
<v Speaker 4>knife that takes and holds a sharp edge,</v>

1007
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>For a good period of time.</v>

1008
00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.330
<v Speaker 4>What's the key to that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's also tough,</v>

1009
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:50.540
<v Speaker 4>which means like you can drop it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to break.</v>

1010
00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.910
<v Speaker 4>So like if you wanted a hunting knife or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

1011
00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.050
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1012
00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:56.420
<v Speaker 4>a hunting knife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>throwing knives,</v>

1013
00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.570
<v Speaker 4>those are harder working knives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you want to actually bring that</v>

1014
00:45:59.571 --> 00:46:02.240
<v Speaker 4>hardness down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to bring it down a ton,</v>

1015
00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:06.730
<v Speaker 4>but just a few points will make a huge</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking difference in housing forms.</v>

1016
00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:07.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1017
00:46:07.701 --> 00:46:09.890
<v Speaker 4>What's the difference in the way that</v>
<v Speaker 4>knife is made?</v>

1018
00:46:09.891 --> 00:46:11.750
<v Speaker 4>And this knife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they were temporary.</v>

1019
00:46:11.751 --> 00:46:16.670
<v Speaker 4>They were heat treated the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they were brought up to like 1500</v>

1020
00:46:16.671 --> 00:46:17.210
<v Speaker 4>degrees</v>

1021
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:19.580
<v Speaker 2>from people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not lists are listening.</v>

1022
00:46:19.581 --> 00:46:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Not watching this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of these knives is a hunting knife</v>

1023
00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.430
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's that feel bad by?</v>

1024
00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:25.970
<v Speaker 2>It's great man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to love it.</v>

1025
00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

1026
00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's uh,</v>

1027
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:32.210
<v Speaker 2>it's made very similarly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look into the,</v>

1028
00:46:32.211 --> 00:46:34.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the video of it,</v>

1029
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.490
<v Speaker 2>the handle's the same and it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks very similar.</v>

1030
00:46:37.491 --> 00:46:39.680
<v Speaker 2>It has a different knife guard though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>

1031
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.900
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

1032
00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1033
00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:47.340
<v Speaker 4>The garden keeps you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it keeps your hand from sliding up.</v>

1034
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:48.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1035
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.680
<v Speaker 2>I liked the way he made the handle too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting handles,</v>

1036
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.580
<v Speaker 4>curved and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where,</v>

1037
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:55.600
<v Speaker 4>where'd you get that pattern for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like some dough?</v>

1038
00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:57.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the first question,</v>

1039
00:46:57.721 --> 00:47:00.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember at first like what is the</v>

1040
00:47:00.211 --> 00:47:01.770
<v Speaker 4>difference in the way they're treated?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1041
00:47:01.771 --> 00:47:02.101
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1042
00:47:02.101 --> 00:47:05.850
<v Speaker 4>So they were hardened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he treating the whole process is</v>

1043
00:47:05.851 --> 00:47:08.820
<v Speaker 4>essentially heating up the steel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it hard,</v>

1044
00:47:08.821 --> 00:47:12.360
<v Speaker 4>and then you put it back into heat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a low,</v>

1045
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:14.580
<v Speaker 4>much lower temperature to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>toughen it up.</v>

1046
00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you're pulling some of that</v>

1047
00:47:17.521 --> 00:47:20.850
<v Speaker 4>hardness back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they were hardened the same way,</v>

1048
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:25.230
<v Speaker 4>but they were tempered at different</v>
<v Speaker 4>temperatures because one is a hard use</v>

1049
00:47:25.231 --> 00:47:27.270
<v Speaker 4>knife while the chef's knife is not a</v>
<v Speaker 4>heartbeat.</v>

1050
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:30.030
<v Speaker 4>What is the difference between a temper</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what,</v>

1051
00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.350
<v Speaker 3>like what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the tempering,</v>

1052
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:33.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so essentially,</v>

1053
00:47:33.521 --> 00:47:36.580
<v Speaker 3>so I harden it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I bring it up to 1500 degrees,</v>

1054
00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like a adult glowing orange</v>

1055
00:47:39.941 --> 00:47:44.941
<v Speaker 3>color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I dip it in a special oil that</v>

1056
00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:48.400
<v Speaker 3>I have that's designed for quenching</v>
<v Speaker 3>materials,</v>

1057
00:47:48.401 --> 00:47:51.430
<v Speaker 3>not just in knifemaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all kinds of different industrial</v>

1058
00:47:51.431 --> 00:47:53.950
<v Speaker 3>applications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clenching materials or oil,</v>

1059
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.940
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quenching oil.</v>

1060
00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.880
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's cooling the,</v>

1061
00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.980
<v Speaker 3>this hot steel down in a very short</v>
<v Speaker 3>period of time and punching it.</v>

1062
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.510
<v Speaker 3>Oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coal,</v>

1063
00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.140
<v Speaker 3>oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so actually the,</v>

1064
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.570
<v Speaker 3>depending on how the steel needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>heat treated,</v>

1065
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually want to heat up the oil so</v>

1066
00:48:10.961 --> 00:48:12.100
<v Speaker 3>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1067
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.980
<v Speaker 3>it's thinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it also,</v>

1068
00:48:14.981 --> 00:48:17.260
<v Speaker 3>there's this thing that's called a vapor</v>
<v Speaker 3>jacket.</v>

1069
00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:21.910
<v Speaker 3>So if you've ever like been next to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>wood burning stove and you drop a little</v>

1070
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:25.120
<v Speaker 3>water on it and you see that bead water</v>
<v Speaker 3>dance around on there,</v>

1071
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:29.260
<v Speaker 3>the same thing happens on the surface of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blade except for the blade is a</v>

1072
00:48:29.261 --> 00:48:30.130
<v Speaker 3>source of the heat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1073
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.090
<v Speaker 3>He put it in that oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that oil is dancing around on it.</v>

1074
00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:37.480
<v Speaker 3>So when the oil's thinner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1075
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:40.750
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not as large of a jacket because</v>

1076
00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:44.620
<v Speaker 3>when that jacket is large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so jack encasing that steel,</v>

1077
00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:46.760
<v Speaker 3>while it's trying to cool down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1078
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 3>it actually kind of acts as an insulator</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ruin or could potentially ruin.</v>

1079
00:48:51.611 --> 00:48:55.690
<v Speaker 3>So not only do you put it in the oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you want to agitate it to kind of</v>

1080
00:48:55.691 --> 00:48:57.840
<v Speaker 3>break up that jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1081
00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:02.710
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't get a chance to just sit</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and all the way around the blade.</v>

1082
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:07.090
<v Speaker 3>And if it was cold it would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be thicker.</v>

1083
00:49:07.091 --> 00:49:08.380
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1084
00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:11.590
<v Speaker 3>it would make a larger jacket actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also the,</v>

1085
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.040
<v Speaker 3>it probably wouldn't be as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1086
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:16.570
<v Speaker 3>efficient I guess in cooling the steel</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1087
00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.980
<v Speaker 3>Cause ideally like for most seals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to cool them down pretty much</v>

1088
00:49:20.981 --> 00:49:22.360
<v Speaker 3>as quickly as you possibly can.</v>

1089
00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:24.010
<v Speaker 3>So you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

1090
00:49:24.011 --> 00:49:24.844
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

1091
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.590
<v Speaker 3>So we could keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just going to say you,</v>

1092
00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.820
<v Speaker 3>you essentially have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on what kind of steel you're</v>

1093
00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:33.880
<v Speaker 3>working with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have anywhere from half a second to,</v>

1094
00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:37.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like five seconds to get it from 1500</v>

1095
00:49:37.121 --> 00:49:42.121
<v Speaker 3>degrees or sometimes higher to below 800</v>
<v Speaker 3>degrees and the,</v>

1096
00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.940
<v Speaker 3>so this knife would be more durable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is then?</v>

1097
00:49:45.941 --> 00:49:47.650
<v Speaker 3>This knife durable?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1098
00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Tougher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in,</v>

1099
00:49:49.081 --> 00:49:54.081
<v Speaker 3>in knifemaking commonly refer to it as</v>
<v Speaker 3>being tougher so it can withstand coming</v>

1100
00:49:54.311 --> 00:49:58.540
<v Speaker 3>into impact with bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could chop with that thing a lot</v>

1101
00:49:58.541 --> 00:50:02.310
<v Speaker 3>more efficiently with a tougher knife</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this hasn't been tempered at it</v>

1102
00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:05.080
<v Speaker 3>as uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as high of a temperature.</v>

1103
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.293
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1104
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:10.030
<v Speaker 3>it's much harder than this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it's a few points,</v>

1105
00:50:10.031 --> 00:50:13.570
<v Speaker 3>those few points make a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you were to take this out into</v>

1106
00:50:13.571 --> 00:50:15.360
<v Speaker 3>the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to do the same job as this one's</v>

1107
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:17.710
<v Speaker 3>just the cutting it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't necessarily snap.</v>

1108
00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but parts of the cutting edge wood up</v>

1109
00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:23.460
<v Speaker 3>blow out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably blow it and chips.</v>

1110
00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually recently just from time to</v>

1111
00:50:26.531 --> 00:50:31.010
<v Speaker 3>time is good as a knife maker to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure that you're still doing your thing,</v>

1112
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:32.690
<v Speaker 3>your heat treating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1113
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.060
<v Speaker 3>I take a knife and I just beat the shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of it for such hop through some wood</v>

1114
00:50:36.061 --> 00:50:38.840
<v Speaker 3>and then I actually took it to an antler</v>
<v Speaker 3>and beat the shit out of it too.</v>

1115
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:40.880
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1116
00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:44.240
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is amazing that if you're doing</v>

1117
00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:45.890
<v Speaker 3>things right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1118
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:49.610
<v Speaker 3>10 thousandths of an inch is enough to</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1119
00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:53.690
<v Speaker 3>to withstand impact of chopping through</v>
<v Speaker 3>would pretty well of course,</v>

1120
00:50:53.691 --> 00:50:56.600
<v Speaker 3>unless you're coming into contact with</v>
<v Speaker 3>like super,</v>

1121
00:50:56.601 --> 00:50:58.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nail or super dense knots,</v>

1122
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.100
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy because it's so thin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1123
00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:04.970
<v Speaker 3>That's actually on the thicker side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is on the thicker side at least,</v>

1124
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.380
<v Speaker 3>especially in longer cutting edge.</v>

1125
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:09.350
<v Speaker 3>That's probably twice as thick as it</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually needs to be.</v>

1126
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is crazy,</v>

1127
00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.670
<v Speaker 3>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes down to the material.</v>

1128
00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:17.030
<v Speaker 3>Not everybody or a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>mistakenly think,</v>

1129
00:51:17.031 --> 00:51:18.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steel is steel,</v>

1130
00:51:18.831 --> 00:51:20.180
<v Speaker 3>is steel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is steel and whatever,</v>

1131
00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:23.390
<v Speaker 3>but they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steel is made for many different</v>

1132
00:51:23.391 --> 00:51:26.720
<v Speaker 3>applications and they're actually very</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically designed for those</v>

1133
00:51:26.721 --> 00:51:27.950
<v Speaker 3>applications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1134
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a structural steel,</v>

1135
00:51:29.961 --> 00:51:31.450
<v Speaker 3>this kind of stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1136
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:34.040
<v Speaker 3>buildings are built out of very</v>
<v Speaker 3>different from this.</v>

1137
00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:38.000
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have very much carbon in it</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all that way.</v>

1138
00:51:38.001 --> 00:51:38.930
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1139
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:41.120
<v Speaker 3>the carbon is what helps make these</v>
<v Speaker 3>really hard.</v>

1140
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:46.400
<v Speaker 3>So lacking that carbon is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allows it to be way tougher.</v>

1141
00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.970
<v Speaker 3>So you can bend it all fucking day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1142
00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.740
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why you want it for buildings</v>

1143
00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:55.100
<v Speaker 3>in la where the earthquakes hit and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>wiggle a little bit.</v>

1144
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:56.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1145
00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is much thinner than a lot of</v>

1146
00:52:00.531 --> 00:52:01.520
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1147
00:52:01.521 --> 00:52:04.820
<v Speaker 3>hunting knives would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting,</v>

1148
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:08.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w with your use of this exotic metal and</v>

1149
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:09.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1150
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:12.080
<v Speaker 3>your methods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were able to do that.</v>

1151
00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.710
<v Speaker 3>Well and also part of the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're able to do that is because it's</v>

1152
00:52:15.711 --> 00:52:17.210
<v Speaker 3>high carbon steel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a,</v>

1153
00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:22.480
<v Speaker 3>which means it has a high volume of</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbon comparatively a then other kinds</v>

1154
00:52:24.281 --> 00:52:26.360
<v Speaker 3>of kinds of tool or cutlery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steel.</v>

1155
00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:29.180
<v Speaker 3>It was a benefit of high carbon versus</v>
<v Speaker 3>last carbon.</v>

1156
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so high carbon allows you to,</v>

1157
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:32.360
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1158
00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:34.370
<v Speaker 3>especially for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the media rights deal,</v>

1159
00:52:34.371 --> 00:52:36.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a kind of crucible steel called</v>

1160
00:52:36.981 --> 00:52:39.710
<v Speaker 3>woots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the patterning you've seen there</v>

1161
00:52:39.711 --> 00:52:44.711
<v Speaker 3>is actually strands of carbon are</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbide material.</v>

1162
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:49.790
<v Speaker 3>So all the extra carbon floating around</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the matrix.</v>

1163
00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:54.820
<v Speaker 3>The Iron Matrix of this steel jumps on</v>
<v Speaker 3>to these bands called carbides and there</v>

1164
00:52:56.781 --> 00:53:00.650
<v Speaker 3>are different elements in vanadium is</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the elements in this steel that</v>

1165
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:03.470
<v Speaker 3>draws those carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that carbon in.</v>

1166
00:53:03.471 --> 00:53:08.471
<v Speaker 3>So what you're seeing are thousands and</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of all these ultra hard carbon</v>

1167
00:53:09.171 --> 00:53:11.660
<v Speaker 3>bands floating around through the Iron</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matrix.</v>

1168
00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Do you watch game of thrones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1169
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.820
<v Speaker 3>When they have like swords that are made</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of Valyrian steel.</v>

1170
00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:17.693
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pissed off.</v>

1171
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck out of here with your fake</v>
<v Speaker 3>magic style.</v>

1172
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what's interesting back in the day,</v>

1173
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:26.950
<v Speaker 3>shit was fucking magical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1174
00:53:26.951 --> 00:53:28.800
<v Speaker 3>Like they didn't understand what was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

1175
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:29.903
<v Speaker 3>Now how did they</v>

1176
00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:30.820
<v Speaker 2>learn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1177
00:53:30.821 --> 00:53:33.220
<v Speaker 2>what is the history?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously that sword,</v>

1178
00:53:33.221 --> 00:53:38.221
<v Speaker 2>there's from the 15 hundreds but you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know from back in the Roman gladiator</v>

1179
00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:41.290
<v Speaker 2>days and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did they understand how to do this?</v>

1180
00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:45.210
<v Speaker 3>So the steel that they were using in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe was not really that great.</v>

1181
00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.440
<v Speaker 3>It was at the best shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Japanese,</v>

1182
00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:49.200
<v Speaker 3>Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just were pretty fucking good.</v>

1183
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:51.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As well as the park,</v>

1184
00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:56.180
<v Speaker 3>the Persians and the Indonesians Vikings</v>
<v Speaker 3>material wasn't the greatest.</v>

1185
00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't too barbaric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no time.</v>

1186
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.470
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes down to a what they had</v>

1187
00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:02.450
<v Speaker 3>available to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1188
00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:06.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who was the pioneer of like really</v>

1189
00:54:06.901 --> 00:54:11.310
<v Speaker 3>durable Badass sword material?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it Japanese?</v>

1190
00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:16.410
<v Speaker 3>So probably so the Japanese and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Persian slash Indonesian Persians,</v>

1191
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:21.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swords are probably the most legendary,</v>

1192
00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:24.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the ones where like it could cut</v>

1193
00:54:24.181 --> 00:54:26.490
<v Speaker 3>through silk floating in the air and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit like that.</v>

1194
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.650
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did they do different?</v>

1195
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:33.950
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the Persian steel is steel very,</v>

1196
00:54:34.651 --> 00:54:36.570
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very similar to these meetings.</v>

1197
00:54:36.571 --> 00:54:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a crucible.</v>

1198
00:54:37.921 --> 00:54:40.080
<v Speaker 3>It starts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called a crucible steel.</v>

1199
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:44.850
<v Speaker 3>And so essentially there's this clay jar</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially called a crucible.</v>

1200
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:48.450
<v Speaker 3>People melt all kinds of stuff in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can mail melt steel in it as</v>

1201
00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:52.320
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they were making these ingots of</v>

1202
00:54:52.321 --> 00:54:54.150
<v Speaker 3>crucible steel and then forging them</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1203
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:57.720
<v Speaker 3>And they really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really very heavily relied on these</v>

1204
00:54:57.721 --> 00:55:02.220
<v Speaker 3>carbide bans floating through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>material because unfortunately they</v>

1205
00:55:02.221 --> 00:55:04.230
<v Speaker 3>didn't really have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1206
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:09.810
<v Speaker 3>advanced way of quenching that steel so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that not only do they have the bands,</v>

1207
00:55:09.811 --> 00:55:12.810
<v Speaker 3>but they also had hard iron matrix as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1208
00:55:12.811 --> 00:55:15.810
<v Speaker 3>that those bands were floating in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they really relied on those,</v>

1209
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:17.380
<v Speaker 3>that banding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

1210
00:55:17.381 --> 00:55:17.630
<v Speaker 3>they</v>

1211
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:22.360
<v Speaker 2>just learned from trial and error of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years of experimenting with</v>

1212
00:55:22.361 --> 00:55:26.080
<v Speaker 2>different materials and different</v>
<v Speaker 2>locations that they got the iron from</v>

1213
00:55:26.081 --> 00:55:29.020
<v Speaker 2>and different things that they added to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to make steel.</v>

1214
00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1215
00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:30.870
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why like,</v>

1216
00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:33.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you even watching game of thrones or</v>

1217
00:55:33.181 --> 00:55:36.960
<v Speaker 3>other kind of medieval or movies set in</v>
<v Speaker 3>medieval times,</v>

1218
00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:40.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were very specific makers who were</v>

1219
00:55:40.591 --> 00:55:43.920
<v Speaker 3>the best who could really make the shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

1220
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.340
<v Speaker 3>And it's because they had a tradition</v>
<v Speaker 3>passed down to them.</v>

1221
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.340
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that's a lot of that stuff was very</v>

1222
00:55:50.341 --> 00:55:53.220
<v Speaker 3>fictional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the real world,</v>

1223
00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:55.020
<v Speaker 3>that was the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1224
00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:59.310
<v Speaker 3>you had very specific lineages of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who had the,</v>

1225
00:55:59.311 --> 00:56:02.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially the most advanced technology</v>

1226
00:56:02.461 --> 00:56:07.461
<v Speaker 3>and skills and techniques for creating</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most highest performing weaponry</v>

1227
00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:10.470
<v Speaker 3>essentially of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was like the currency of the</v>

1228
00:56:10.471 --> 00:56:11.304
<v Speaker 3>fucking time.</v>

1229
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:16.850
<v Speaker 2>Went to Japan fairly recently in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>filmed them working with a high level</v>

1230
00:56:19.231 --> 00:56:23.920
<v Speaker 2>sword maker for a television show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to remember who it was.</v>

1231
00:56:23.921 --> 00:56:27.400
<v Speaker 2>It was someone famous but it was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad ass.</v>

1232
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:31.120
<v Speaker 2>They went to this sword maker shop and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1233
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's doing the whole thing like</v>
<v Speaker 2>hammering it all out and building a</v>

1234
00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Samurai sword from scratch the way it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>always been.</v>

1235
00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:40.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a few of those documentaries.</v>

1236
00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:45.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it is trending on youtube there you</v>

1237
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:47.200
<v Speaker 3>got to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually you got to do a little bit of</v>

1238
00:56:47.201 --> 00:56:49.030
<v Speaker 3>digging to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1239
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.540
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually just watched a few of them</v>

1240
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.680
<v Speaker 3>like in the last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not recall what they're going to</v>

1241
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:57.490
<v Speaker 3>make a Samurai sword.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of these days.</v>

1242
00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.680
<v Speaker 3>I might do it eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

1243
00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm always going to do chef</v>
<v Speaker 3>science because that's what I know.</v>

1244
00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the tool I know the most.</v>

1245
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:08.270
<v Speaker 3>That's the biggest market right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a giant,</v>

1246
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean for a super foodies and I'll let</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1247
00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:14.150
<v Speaker 3>Well it's not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you think about it like there's</v>

1248
00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:19.270
<v Speaker 3>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of mystique around</v>

1249
00:57:19.271 --> 00:57:24.271
<v Speaker 3>Japanese sores or even the American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we knife as well as you know,</v>

1250
00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:25.390
<v Speaker 3>Viking swords.</v>

1251
00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:27.680
<v Speaker 3>But nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1252
00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:31.450
<v Speaker 3>people have that shit made but you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes on a wall.</v>

1253
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:34.300
<v Speaker 3>The things that are really getting used</v>
<v Speaker 3>or like a hunting knife and a chef's</v>

1254
00:57:34.301 --> 00:57:36.810
<v Speaker 3>knife and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cooking knives are,</v>

1255
00:57:36.811 --> 00:57:41.811
<v Speaker 3>are used like almost literally in every</v>
<v Speaker 3>single household around the world every</v>

1256
00:57:41.951 --> 00:57:43.660
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>year round.</v>

1257
00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:49.270
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting is because of its</v>

1258
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:53.510
<v Speaker 3>ubiquity to our everyday life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it lacks that mistake because we see the</v>

1259
00:57:53.511 --> 00:57:55.960
<v Speaker 3>shit every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think much of it versus a</v>

1260
00:57:55.961 --> 00:57:57.910
<v Speaker 3>Japanese sword.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People walk in here and they're like,</v>

1261
00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.790
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I tell you what</v>

1262
00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:01.780
<v Speaker 2>thing man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people come over to my house and</v>

1263
00:58:01.781 --> 00:58:04.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm cooking and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the fuck did you get that night?</v>

1264
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:08.080
<v Speaker 2>That happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when it's either this one or the</v>

1265
00:58:08.081 --> 00:58:10.330
<v Speaker 2>other one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I show them the bog oak one,</v>

1266
00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:12.160
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like two.</v>

1267
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:13.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>

1268
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:17.080
<v Speaker 2>check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now in terms of like this one or the</v>

1269
00:58:17.081 --> 00:58:19.240
<v Speaker 2>other one that you made me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other hunting knife that you made me</v>

1270
00:58:19.241 --> 00:58:22.690
<v Speaker 2>out of Damascus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which one is like tougher or more</v>

1271
00:58:22.691 --> 00:58:23.524
<v Speaker 2>durable?</v>

1272
00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:27.930
<v Speaker 3>So they've been heat treated to perform</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1273
00:58:27.931 --> 00:58:29.220
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very similarly.</v>

1274
00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:32.310
<v Speaker 3>So the base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd essentially have to destroy them</v>

1275
00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.350
<v Speaker 3>to really determine which one outperform</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other.</v>

1276
00:58:35.351 --> 00:58:37.530
<v Speaker 3>You have to stick it in a bowl and try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to break it.</v>

1277
00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Essentially use it.</v>

1278
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:41.710
<v Speaker 3>How it's not supposed to be frying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

1279
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:43.590
<v Speaker 2>they cut it keeps an edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1280
00:58:43.591 --> 00:58:44.790
<v Speaker 2>well man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

1281
00:58:44.791 --> 00:58:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

1282
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:47.640
<v Speaker 2>I get nervous every time I touch the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blade.</v>

1283
00:58:47.641 --> 00:58:49.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean this thing slices through things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1284
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1285
00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.880
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be an art to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1286
00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.550
<v Speaker 2>actually sharpening things too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1287
00:58:56.610 --> 00:58:57.443
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1288
00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:01.260
<v Speaker 2>And how do you know like the right angle</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a approach?</v>

1289
00:59:01.261 --> 00:59:02.094
<v Speaker 2>Sharpening?</v>

1290
00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:04.220
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are a lot,</v>

1291
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:07.540
<v Speaker 3>they're actually a lot of great</v>
<v Speaker 3>information online there,</v>

1292
00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:11.210
<v Speaker 3>especially in big cities like Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>La,</v>

1293
00:59:11.211 --> 00:59:12.590
<v Speaker 3>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1294
00:59:12.591 --> 00:59:15.020
<v Speaker 3>Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there a Portland as well.</v>

1295
00:59:15.021 --> 00:59:18.800
<v Speaker 3>There is super reputable people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only who will offer service,</v>

1296
00:59:18.801 --> 00:59:22.820
<v Speaker 3>but I usually offer lessons as I</v>
<v Speaker 3>suggest.</v>

1297
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Like if you can't afford it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1298
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.290
<v Speaker 3>you can dig around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can find the stuff online.</v>

1299
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:32.650
<v Speaker 3>But it's not the same as having</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially having a coach next to you</v>

1300
00:59:32.841 --> 00:59:34.820
<v Speaker 3>saying uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or yeah.</v>

1301
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.020
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's perfect.</v>

1302
00:59:36.021 --> 00:59:37.200
<v Speaker 3>That's where you want to be doing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1303
00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.280
<v Speaker 3>Do you sharpen both sides?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1304
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:44.600
<v Speaker 3>So you sharpen the top and the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

1305
00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:48.080
<v Speaker 3>you mean the sides of the steel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you sharpen it like this and then</v>

1306
00:59:48.081 --> 00:59:49.690
<v Speaker 3>flip it over?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1307
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Now what are those things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have those metal things where</v>

1308
00:59:53.141 --> 00:59:54.350
<v Speaker 3>people go xing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Xing,</v>

1309
00:59:54.351 --> 00:59:55.220
<v Speaker 3>shooshing.</v>

1310
00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those,</v>

1311
00:59:56.421 --> 00:59:58.190
<v Speaker 3>those ones seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1312
00:59:58.191 --> 01:00:00.830
<v Speaker 3>that looks brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do that to a good knife.</v>

1313
01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:04.280
<v Speaker 3>It so am I right thinking that way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1314
01:00:04.281 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 3>it depends on the type of steel that</v>
<v Speaker 3>your knives made from and then what the</v>

1315
01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:10.820
<v Speaker 3>material is that those rods are made</v>
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

1316
01:00:10.821 --> 01:00:15.800
<v Speaker 3>So those are commonly referred to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sharpening ron's or sharpening sticks.</v>

1317
01:00:15.801 --> 01:00:17.870
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is they're not actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>sharpening.</v>

1318
01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.400
<v Speaker 3>What are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're,</v>

1319
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more accurately referred to as honing</v>

1320
01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:24.170
<v Speaker 3>rods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's happening at your,</v>

1321
01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:27.170
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the cutting edge of your knife is you</v>

1322
01:00:27.171 --> 01:00:29.960
<v Speaker 3>have all these micro seriations</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially if you go,</v>

1323
01:00:29.961 --> 01:00:31.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>

1324
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:33.050
<v Speaker 3>take it under a microscope and look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cutting edge.</v>

1325
01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.740
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a saw blade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're like,</v>

1326
01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:40.070
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking microns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Micron is a millionth of a meter.</v>

1327
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Like they're teeny tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1328
01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.530
<v Speaker 3>but what happens over normal use?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1329
01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.930
<v Speaker 3>those teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they bend over,</v>

1330
01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:51.350
<v Speaker 3>they flex over or sometimes they</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually wear out and fall off.</v>

1331
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:56.480
<v Speaker 3>And so what the honing rod does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if they've bent over showing</v>

1332
01:00:56.481 --> 01:00:57.570
<v Speaker 3>it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>

1333
01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.250
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1334
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:06.110
<v Speaker 3>You want to ignore like those long</v>
<v Speaker 3>streaks and you're just like the tiny</v>

1335
01:01:06.111 --> 01:01:07.310
<v Speaker 3>little thin black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1336
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:10.900
<v Speaker 3>that's the shit right there in black</v>
<v Speaker 3>line</v>

1337
01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.990
<v Speaker 3>observation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you looking at you?</v>

1338
01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like someone's doing it tiered</v>
<v Speaker 3>instruction.</v>

1339
01:01:18.951 --> 01:01:20.030
<v Speaker 3>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a youtube video.</v>

1340
01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:22.350
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy.</v>

1341
01:01:22.351 --> 01:01:23.360
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you doing that shit?</v>

1342
01:01:23.361 --> 01:01:27.560
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] hundred x magnification view</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the top.</v>

1343
01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:30.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what's happening along your</v>

1344
01:01:30.471 --> 01:01:32.060
<v Speaker 3>cutting edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what happens to those tiny</v>

1345
01:01:32.061 --> 01:01:35.390
<v Speaker 3>serrations where it bend over like I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying or break off.</v>

1346
01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:38.180
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as they bend over and it's just</v>

1347
01:01:38.181 --> 01:01:42.320
<v Speaker 3>normal shit that honing ron by swiping</v>
<v Speaker 3>across at Honing Ron.</v>

1348
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:45.350
<v Speaker 3>And you don't just do it willy nilly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you got to do it at the right angle</v>

1349
01:01:45.351 --> 01:01:48.530
<v Speaker 3>and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what it does is it realigns and</v>

1350
01:01:48.531 --> 01:01:52.520
<v Speaker 3>hones those teeth back into alignment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people mistakenly call them</v>

1351
01:01:52.521 --> 01:01:56.090
<v Speaker 3>sharpening sticks because all of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden their knife is sharp as fuck</v>

1352
01:01:56.091 --> 01:01:56.924
<v Speaker 3>afterwards.</v>

1353
01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.710
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is that it's honed those</v>
<v Speaker 3>teeth back into alignment so it can do</v>

1354
01:02:00.711 --> 01:02:01.700
<v Speaker 3>its job again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1355
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:06.050
<v Speaker 3>what's the purpose of the leather strop</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's just a gentler way,</v>

1356
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:09.710
<v Speaker 3>especially for things that are super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super,</v>

1357
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:12.800
<v Speaker 3>a razor sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which essentially have been sharpened to</v>

1358
01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:15.170
<v Speaker 3>really high finish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1359
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.560
<v Speaker 3>like 10,000 grit or higher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those micro serrations are even</v>

1360
01:02:19.561 --> 01:02:21.090
<v Speaker 3>smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means there are even more</v>

1361
01:02:21.091 --> 01:02:23.220
<v Speaker 3>delicate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means they don't need as much</v>

1362
01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:26.660
<v Speaker 3>force to realign them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So honing rod or Ho or,</v>

1363
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:29.160
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a strop is,</v>

1364
01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:31.150
<v Speaker 3>that's a human hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1365
01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That looks disgusting.</v>

1366
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:36.810
<v Speaker 3>I just choking on that hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just to give you some reference,</v>

1367
01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.840
<v Speaker 3>a typical and average human hair is</v>
<v Speaker 3>about three thousandths of an inch.</v>

1368
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1369
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:48.570
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to help put that a little bit more</v>

1370
01:02:48.571 --> 01:02:50.730
<v Speaker 3>better perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 16th of an inch,</v>

1371
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:56.030
<v Speaker 3>like a normal measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one 16th of an inch is 62.5 thousands of</v>

1372
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.300
<v Speaker 3>an inch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's like one,</v>

1373
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.230
<v Speaker 3>I can't even do the math,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1374
01:03:01.231 --> 01:03:06.180
<v Speaker 3>One 20th of a 16th of an inch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fucking teeny tiny.</v>

1375
01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:09.630
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like split the hair.</v>

1376
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>

1377
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1378
01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:19.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a big debate and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world of bow hunting with broadheads</v>

1379
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:23.420
<v Speaker 2>with a what kind of steel to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1380
01:03:23.421 --> 01:03:24.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1381
01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:27.270
<v Speaker 2>there's harder steel that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1382
01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.030
<v Speaker 2>some people use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it breaks.</v>

1383
01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.950
<v Speaker 2>And just saying there's an issue with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1384
01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.020
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like this big debate,</v>

1385
01:03:33.021 --> 01:03:38.021
<v Speaker 2>harder versus steel that has less hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll bend more and give slightly</v>

1386
01:03:39.111 --> 01:03:40.460
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1387
01:03:40.461 --> 01:03:41.330
<v Speaker 2>And then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1388
01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.340
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the broadhead that I use,</v>

1389
01:03:43.341 --> 01:03:47.030
<v Speaker 2>which is a carbon steel broadhead from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>company called [inaudible].</v>

1390
01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:49.280
<v Speaker 2>They make this a broadhead called a</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] tech.</v>

1391
01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:50.660
<v Speaker 2>It's pull up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1392
01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.440
<v Speaker 2>g five carbon steel monotech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your top tech cs,</v>

1393
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:57.980
<v Speaker 2>they call them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking to,</v>

1394
01:03:57.981 --> 01:04:01.910
<v Speaker 2>it's just the head like term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just what a triangular or is it even a</v>

1395
01:04:01.911 --> 01:04:04.400
<v Speaker 2>triangle hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that I use.</v>

1396
01:04:04.401 --> 01:04:05.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1397
01:04:05.391 --> 01:04:06.224
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1398
01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:07.940
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a,</v>

1399
01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:10.660
<v Speaker 2>it was a three points or four points</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1400
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:11.503
<v Speaker 2>He'll pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see?</v>

1401
01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.620
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1402
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:14.000
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's three points,</v>

1403
01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.730
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a carbon steel broadhead.</v>

1404
01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:21.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what I shot my elk with last year</v>
<v Speaker 2>with and that things virtually</v>

1405
01:04:21.621 --> 01:04:22.730
<v Speaker 2>indestructable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1406
01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:25.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a crazy photograph.</v>

1407
01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:26.480
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you this crazy video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1408
01:04:26.481 --> 01:04:30.810
<v Speaker 2>I put it up on my instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find that on my instagram where I'm uh,</v>

1409
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:35.600
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking around with something on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my bow at,</v>

1410
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:37.780
<v Speaker 2>at full draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to set something and the,</v>

1411
01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:43.300
<v Speaker 2>the Bo went off and it hit a cement wall</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's stuck into the wall like a</v>

1412
01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.020
<v Speaker 2>cinder block or solid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some solid cement wall and didn't kill</v>

1413
01:04:48.021 --> 01:04:50.870
<v Speaker 2>the broadhead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still have the broadhead back there.</v>

1414
01:04:50.871 --> 01:04:53.030
<v Speaker 2>It's stuck into the broad head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>

1415
01:04:53.031 --> 01:04:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Did it stuck into the broadhead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shaft and look what it did to the,</v>

1416
01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:02.860
<v Speaker 2>to the Arrow that we'll look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that brought ed that fucking things got</v>

1417
01:05:02.991 --> 01:05:06.140
<v Speaker 2>my bet for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That things got my confidence forever.</v>

1418
01:05:06.141 --> 01:05:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Cause if that does that to concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will that do to bone?</v>

1419
01:05:09.351 --> 01:05:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that we'll go through anything</v>

1420
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:12.500
<v Speaker 3>that's going to kick some ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Silver.</v>

1421
01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:14.550
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I would say after</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing that,</v>

1422
01:05:14.551 --> 01:05:18.310
<v Speaker 3>especially that first image is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>geometry of</v>

1423
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.700
<v Speaker 4>the blades that the actual points,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1424
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:25.740
<v Speaker 4>they lend themselves similarly to how</v>
<v Speaker 4>your hunting knife to sharpen</v>

1425
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:29.290
<v Speaker 4>differently from your chef's knife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the chef's knife material's</v>

1426
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:31.750
<v Speaker 4>thinner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're also sharpened at different</v>

1427
01:05:31.751 --> 01:05:34.240
<v Speaker 4>angles because they have different jobs</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're supposed to do.</v>

1428
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:36.730
<v Speaker 4>And so the broader essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or sorry,</v>

1429
01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.940
<v Speaker 4>the more acute that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more easily that will break as well</v>

1430
01:05:39.941 --> 01:05:41.980
<v Speaker 4>as the thinner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thinner the material that,</v>

1431
01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:45.520
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that geometry is living on is more,</v>

1432
01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>susceptible to breaking that first image</v>

1433
01:05:48.761 --> 01:05:52.090
<v Speaker 4>that Jamie pulled up the geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked like it was pretty robust.</v>

1434
01:05:52.091 --> 01:05:53.470
<v Speaker 4>Hold that up again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1435
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.980
<v Speaker 4>And as well as like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like it's probably at least 30</v>

1436
01:05:56.981 --> 01:05:59.020
<v Speaker 4>thousands of an inch thick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1437
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:02.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's about if not more actually the</v>

1438
01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:03.580
<v Speaker 4>original image,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

1439
01:06:03.581 --> 01:06:06.910
<v Speaker 4>we see the actual broadhead in the um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without the,</v>

1440
01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:09.430
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1441
01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:11.740
<v Speaker 4>my friend Brian Stevens turned me onto</v>
<v Speaker 4>these.</v>

1442
01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:16.330
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he shot a bear through the head with one</v>

1443
01:06:16.331 --> 01:06:21.331
<v Speaker 4>of those genes from 10 feet away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was coming at him and he's got an</v>

1444
01:06:23.171 --> 01:06:27.340
<v Speaker 4>image of the skull.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he sent me where you could see the</v>

1445
01:06:27.341 --> 01:06:30.550
<v Speaker 4>outline of that broad had through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bear skull as crazy.</v>

1446
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:33.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it and it killed the bear and didn't</v>

1447
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:34.990
<v Speaker 4>even fuck up the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1448
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.280
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1449
01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:39.910
<v Speaker 4>And so a lot of like you see people</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing these incredible feats like</v>

1450
01:06:39.911 --> 01:06:43.300
<v Speaker 4>hammering through nails and shit like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that with their knives and like what the</v>

1451
01:06:43.301 --> 01:06:46.840
<v Speaker 4>fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing that most people are used to</v>

1452
01:06:46.841 --> 01:06:49.610
<v Speaker 4>our chef's knife and they think that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did that with their [inaudible] it</v>

1453
01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:54.620
<v Speaker 4>up and 100% pretty much wood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with the right thickness coming up</v>

1454
01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:59.470
<v Speaker 4>to the cutting edge as well as the</v>
<v Speaker 4>actual lead cutting edge geometry,</v>

1455
01:06:59.471 --> 01:07:03.010
<v Speaker 4>like the actual angle that it sharpened</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you could do that shit all day</v>

1456
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:03.280
<v Speaker 4>long.</v>

1457
01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:08.280
<v Speaker 4>Now when you sharpen a blade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you use something to hold it next to</v>

1458
01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:12.520
<v Speaker 4>the stone so that it reaches the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 4>angle or do you do it by,</v>

1459
01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:13.750
<v Speaker 4>I do buy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1460
01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.790
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel handed it over to me.</v>

1461
01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.520
<v Speaker 4>One of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when I first started</v>

1462
01:07:18.521 --> 01:07:20.620
<v Speaker 4>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would use my finger as a guide,</v>

1463
01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:25.900
<v Speaker 4>so that would inform me as to the angle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when the edge of my finger would</v>

1464
01:07:25.901 --> 01:07:29.140
<v Speaker 4>touch the top of the stone that told me</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was about the right angle and then</v>

1465
01:07:29.141 --> 01:07:30.790
<v Speaker 4>when I flipped it over to do the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>

1466
01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:35.470
<v Speaker 4>I do the same thing with my thumb and</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially experience.</v>

1467
01:07:35.471 --> 01:07:39.550
<v Speaker 4>I just know it from experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do make a sharpening guides that</v>

1468
01:07:39.551 --> 01:07:43.030
<v Speaker 4>you can clip on to the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>knives as well as little ramps.</v>

1469
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:45.130
<v Speaker 4>Those are all great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're starting.</v>

1470
01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.450
<v Speaker 4>The hardest part about all of this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the muscle memory portion.</v>

1471
01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:54.720
<v Speaker 4>It's figuring out how to lock in and</v>
<v Speaker 4>maintain that angle without wavering and</v>

1472
01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:57.610
<v Speaker 4>placing your risks and all that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit and that just,</v>

1473
01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:00.040
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like riding a bike or any other,</v>

1474
01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:03.970
<v Speaker 4>anything you've ever had to learn in</v>
<v Speaker 4>your life with practice and repetition,</v>

1475
01:08:03.971 --> 01:08:05.590
<v Speaker 4>you'll get better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about that?</v>

1476
01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:07.870
<v Speaker 4>Those machines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like little,</v>

1477
01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:11.770
<v Speaker 4>they're like little linked through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>worst fucking thing ever.</v>

1478
01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.910
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have like almost kind of a conspiracy</v>

1479
01:08:16.911 --> 01:08:21.380
<v Speaker 4>theory that like the reality is they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>designed to destroy your knife so you</v>

1480
01:08:21.381 --> 01:08:24.410
<v Speaker 4>have to turn around and reinvest again</v>
<v Speaker 4>because most people,</v>

1481
01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:28.010
<v Speaker 4>but one because of the knives aren't</v>
<v Speaker 4>usually sold for very much money that</v>

1482
01:08:28.011 --> 01:08:32.980
<v Speaker 4>are being used with those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you're not selling them for my</v>

1483
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:36.380
<v Speaker 4>very much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're relying on volume and what better</v>

1484
01:08:36.381 --> 01:08:39.590
<v Speaker 4>way than to create a thing that does the</v>
<v Speaker 4>job for a little bit,</v>

1485
01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:42.290
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately destroys it and you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to reinvest.</v>

1486
01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:44.570
<v Speaker 4>What about those ones where you stick it</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the slot?</v>

1487
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:49.400
<v Speaker 4>It's the same kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a little slower process,</v>

1488
01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:51.830
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll notice the problem with those,</v>

1489
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:55.820
<v Speaker 4>the real problem with those is that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't sharpen the whole edge.</v>

1490
01:08:55.821 --> 01:09:00.650
<v Speaker 4>You usually start at the heel or just a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit in front of the heel and then</v>

1491
01:09:00.651 --> 01:09:03.290
<v Speaker 4>you do the major work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tripped myself out.</v>

1492
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:03.920
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

1493
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to cut myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is actually,</v>

1494
01:09:05.311 --> 01:09:06.250
<v Speaker 4>it's still pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1495
01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:07.510
<v Speaker 4>it's sharp as far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1496
01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:12.230
<v Speaker 4>and so the problem is because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting the full length,</v>

1497
01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:16.610
<v Speaker 4>you'll continue to dish this material</v>
<v Speaker 4>out just in front of the heel and then</v>

1498
01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:20.150
<v Speaker 4>when you go to cut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this little bit of shit there</v>

1499
01:09:20.151 --> 01:09:22.730
<v Speaker 4>that's not doing any work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not doing anything.</v>

1500
01:09:22.731 --> 01:09:25.130
<v Speaker 4>Especially when you're relying on that</v>
<v Speaker 4>cutting board.</v>

1501
01:09:25.131 --> 01:09:27.260
<v Speaker 4>When the knife comes down to the cutting</v>
<v Speaker 4>board to do some work,</v>

1502
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:28.330
<v Speaker 4>it's not happening.</v>

1503
01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:30.230
<v Speaker 4>If I cut my lunch with that today,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's some real art to</v>

1512
01:09:48.171 --> 01:09:51.620
<v Speaker 4>that as well from my friend Chad Ward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whiskey ban,</v>

1513
01:09:51.621 --> 01:09:55.500
<v Speaker 4>barbecue on instagram.</v>

<v Speaker 4>barbecue master.</v>

1515
01:10:00.141 --> 01:10:04.760
<v Speaker 4>And he's the one that taught me how to</v>
<v Speaker 4>cook slowly at low temperatures and then</v>

1516
01:10:04.761 --> 01:10:08.750
<v Speaker 4>sear it after you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always thought you supposed to just</v>

1517
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:12.410
<v Speaker 4>put it on high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He cooked shit out of it and then eat</v>

1520
01:10:15.501 --> 01:10:18.050
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're dealing with what I really</v>

1521
01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:22.040
<v Speaker 4>had to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in particular cooking with</v>

1522
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:27.140
<v Speaker 4>wild game is very unforgiving because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's low in fat.</v>

1523
01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got none.</v>

1524
01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:30.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're basically eating a sprinter.</v>

1525
01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.630
<v Speaker 4>Here it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the end.</v>

1526
01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:38.090
<v Speaker 4>I have reverse sear it in a pan with</v>
<v Speaker 4>grass fed.</v>

1527
01:10:38.091 --> 01:10:39.350
<v Speaker 4>But here that pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>

1529
01:10:41.010 --> 01:10:44.830
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1530
01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.550
<v Speaker 4>that's the last of my backdrop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta I gotta get some more meat.</v>

1531
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.310
<v Speaker 4>I eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I eat so much meat.</v>

1532
01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.420
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1533
01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.190
<v Speaker 4>Sue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was super healthy though,</v>

1534
01:10:55.191 --> 01:10:57.140
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fuck what you heard?</v>

1535
01:10:59.190 --> 01:11:00.680
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like it works.</v>

1536
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:01.640
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1537
01:11:01.641 --> 01:11:02.870
<v Speaker 4>you know what too?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

1538
01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:06.020
<v Speaker 4>there's something really magical about</v>
<v Speaker 4>wild game and um,</v>

1539
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really don't and I don't think anybody</v>

1540
01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:11.990
<v Speaker 4>does because I don't think there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough people out there that are eating</v>

1541
01:11:11.991 --> 01:11:13.100
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it has,</v>

1542
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 4>it has a different effect</v>

1543
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.850
<v Speaker 2>on your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels different when I eat beef.</v>

1544
01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.790
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have grass fed beef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1545
01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:22.800
<v Speaker 2>like total,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like pasture raised,</v>

1546
01:11:22.801 --> 01:11:24.300
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1547
01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.270
<v Speaker 2>the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know about butcher box?</v>

1548
01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:28.800
<v Speaker 2>I am aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1549
01:11:28.801 --> 01:11:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That companies the shit,</v>

1550
01:11:30.121 --> 01:11:32.130
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll send it to your house.</v>

1551
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Frozen grass fed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pasture raised,</v>

1552
01:11:35.761 --> 01:11:38.350
<v Speaker 2>like in the pasture finished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1553
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:40.500
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty cheap too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good deal.</v>

1554
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:43.950
<v Speaker 2>The few top sponsors of this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I use them all the time.</v>

1555
01:11:43.951 --> 01:11:45.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brilliant.</v>

1556
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the few times that I,</v>

1557
01:11:47.171 --> 01:11:50.280
<v Speaker 2>and it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel embarrassed saying that I've only</v>

1558
01:11:50.281 --> 01:11:52.740
<v Speaker 2>eaten really good beef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy beef,</v>

1559
01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:54.600
<v Speaker 2>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only a few times.</v>

1560
01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to,</v>

1561
01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:56.973
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1562
01:11:57.010 --> 01:11:58.470
<v Speaker 2>especially in some place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1563
01:11:58.471 --> 01:12:01.260
<v Speaker 2>When you take a bite like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even just that first buy,</v>

1564
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:04.530
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole different world.</v>

1565
01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:05.430
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1566
01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Just the flavors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

1567
01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:09.710
<v Speaker 2>I have my friend Mike Hawk Ridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1568
01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:13.320

<v Speaker 2>then afterwards we went out to eat and,</v>

1575
01:12:25.951 --> 01:12:27.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were eaten steak.</v>

1576
01:12:27.061 --> 01:12:30.840
<v Speaker 2>We ate at a restaurant and they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing like they're used to eating</v>

1577
01:12:30.841 --> 01:12:32.260
<v Speaker 2>moose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1578
01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.180
<v Speaker 2>like this beat is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this poor little sick animal.</v>

1579
01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:39.180
<v Speaker 2>It's all mushy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1580
01:12:39.181 --> 01:12:43.020
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you eat a piece of wild</v>
<v Speaker 2>moose meat,</v>

1581
01:12:43.021 --> 01:12:44.070
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

1582
01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:44.910
<v Speaker 2>you eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1583
01:12:44.911 --> 01:12:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like filled with flavor and it's</v>

1584
01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:51.780
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like it gives you energy.</v>

1585
01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:54.420
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would totally buy that.</v>

1586
01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:55.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll,</v>

1587
01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:01.520
<v Speaker 2>what does that people are trying to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>inject young people's blood into the</v>

1588
01:13:01.701 --> 01:13:04.200
<v Speaker 2>body is trying to make themselves feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>younger,</v>

1589
01:13:04.201 --> 01:13:06.960
<v Speaker 2>like eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting good,</v>

1590
01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:11.220
<v Speaker 2>well sourced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those two things are now.</v>

1591
01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's the same,</v>

1592
01:13:13.111 --> 01:13:15.780
<v Speaker 2>find out the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that there's,</v>

1593
01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:21.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's gotta be something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming and incredibly healthy,</v>

1594
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:27.570
<v Speaker 2>vibrant animal versus something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like raised in a cage.</v>

1595
01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1596
01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:31.650
<v Speaker 2>this just does just make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think this is something that</v>

1597
01:13:31.651 --> 01:13:33.050
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1598
01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:38.070
<v Speaker 2>they have absolutely measured protein</v>
<v Speaker 2>content and the protein contents off the</v>

1599
01:13:38.071 --> 01:13:39.270
<v Speaker 2>charts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the difference in the</v>

1600
01:13:39.271 --> 01:13:43.830
<v Speaker 2>protein content of chicken or regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>beef versus Moose or elk,</v>

1601
01:13:43.831 --> 01:13:46.830
<v Speaker 2>it's much higher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much denser and protein like,</v>

1602
01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:52.160
<v Speaker 2>like I think something like six ounces</v>
<v Speaker 2>of acts as is 48 grams of protein.</v>

1603
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is incredible,</v>

1604
01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.360
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1605
01:13:57.361 --> 01:14:02.250
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to think about that to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to get that same amount of protein.</v>

1606
01:14:02.251 --> 01:14:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't have to gorge giant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

1607
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just eat that little bit.</v>

1608
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're good little six ounce piece and</v>

1609
01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:10.230
<v Speaker 2>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even less if you want to stay in</v>

1610
01:14:10.231 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're like in a kito diet,</v>

1611
01:14:12.221 --> 01:14:13.900
<v Speaker 2>you really need less than six ounces and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1612
01:14:13.901 --> 01:14:15.040
<v Speaker 2>like three ounces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1613
01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:16.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1614
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:20.260
<v Speaker 2>food is does to me as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially as I've gotten older,</v>

1615
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I've started doing a lot more cooking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it becomes a different thing.</v>

1616
01:14:26.201 --> 01:14:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1617
01:14:26.850 --> 01:14:29.110
<v Speaker 2>it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hungry and he stuffed my face.</v>

1618
01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>

1619
01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:33.730
<v Speaker 2>the preparing of food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much like we were talking about with</v>

1620
01:14:33.731 --> 01:14:37.630
<v Speaker 2>craftsmanship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's an art to making food and I</v>

1621
01:14:37.631 --> 01:14:42.310
<v Speaker 2>mean I'm by no means a chef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can cook a few things really good,</v>

1622
01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:45.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I take great satisfaction that I</v>

1623
01:14:45.041 --> 01:14:46.240
<v Speaker 2>fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1624
01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.980
<v Speaker 3>I'll take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife used to hate this,</v>

1625
01:14:48.981 --> 01:14:52.460
<v Speaker 3>but we would get home and we're like</v>
<v Speaker 3>more hungry.</v>

1626
01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:56.720
<v Speaker 3>You gonna make some food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two hours later she's like,</v>

1627
01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:58.670
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1628
01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.070
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people are that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My brother's the same way.</v>

1629
01:15:01.071 --> 01:15:03.650
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm fucking hungry now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to eat now.</v>

1630
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Rip Your fucking head off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you need to set up some</v>

1631
01:15:06.771 --> 01:15:10.350
<v Speaker 3>cheese and some like Salami or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's what I started doing,</v>

1632
01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:12.790
<v Speaker 3>putting out some snack items while I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>working.</v>

1633
01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:14.810
<v Speaker 3>It's just relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where,</v>

1634
01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:18.280
<v Speaker 3>where like I could be starving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get done with a long ass day grind and</v>

1635
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:19.990
<v Speaker 3>I'll go home and I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1636
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:22.550
<v Speaker 3>I have this thing locked in my mind that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to eat.</v>

1637
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:24.560
<v Speaker 3>I'll take two hours to make the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1638
01:15:24.561 --> 01:15:27.350
<v Speaker 3>even though I'm starving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't eaten since like one o'clock</v>

1639
01:15:27.351 --> 01:15:29.150
<v Speaker 3>in the afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nine o'clock at night.</v>

1640
01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you find that as a person who is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>craftsman,</v>

1641
01:15:32.831 --> 01:15:35.380
<v Speaker 2>an artisan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you try to have that approach with</v>

1642
01:15:35.381 --> 01:15:38.710
<v Speaker 2>like other things in your life too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what you're talking just talking</v>

1643
01:15:38.711 --> 01:15:40.300
<v Speaker 2>about with like making food and,</v>

1644
01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:41.493
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1645
01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I don't really think too</v>

1646
01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:47.680
<v Speaker 3>much about the fact that I'm doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>this way.</v>

1647
01:15:47.681 --> 01:15:52.681
<v Speaker 3>It's just kind of the way I do things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm a little bit more methodical and</v>

1648
01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:56.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess not necessarily more thoughtful</v>

1649
01:15:56.501 --> 01:15:58.380
<v Speaker 3>than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like when I'm go to,</v>

1650
01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:01.150
<v Speaker 3>when I approached these challenges or</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things they got to do,</v>

1651
01:16:02.490 --> 01:16:06.510
<v Speaker 3>I take my time to do them right and try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do them right the first time I used</v>

1652
01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:06.941
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1653
01:16:06.941 --> 01:16:09.110
<v Speaker 3>actually when I was working for Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1654
01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:14.050
<v Speaker 3>we would have to mock up stuff or build</v>
<v Speaker 3>machines or six years or some shit like</v>

1655
01:16:14.051 --> 01:16:15.850
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1656
01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:17.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a very,</v>

1657
01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:20.650
<v Speaker 3>his mindset was quick and dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to do this,</v>

1658
01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:23.950
<v Speaker 3>get this done as quick as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it doesn't work the first time,</v>

1659
01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:26.740
<v Speaker 3>we'll make some modifications and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>try it a second time.</v>

1660
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Still doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sec time,</v>

1661
01:16:28.181 --> 01:16:30.640
<v Speaker 3>so and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So on and so forth until we got it</v>

1662
01:16:30.641 --> 01:16:33.580
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where I would just think it through a</v>

1663
01:16:33.581 --> 01:16:36.820
<v Speaker 3>little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First Time it was all I need it.</v>

1664
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:39.820
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a long time,</v>

1665
01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:43.330
<v Speaker 3>I used to do a lot of woodworking before</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got in the metal working and I was</v>

1666
01:16:43.690 --> 01:16:47.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always had to measure five times and</v>

1667
01:16:47.351 --> 01:16:48.520
<v Speaker 3>cut twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1668
01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:50.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I started getting to this point</v>

1669
01:16:50.831 --> 01:16:53.440
<v Speaker 3>where like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really had to think shit through</v>

1670
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:57.250
<v Speaker 3>because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it felt like a huge waste of time</v>

1671
01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.050
<v Speaker 3>and energy and materials really to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>through all that process.</v>

1672
01:17:02.051 --> 01:17:04.880
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they had to be a long time long</v>

1673
01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:05.970
<v Speaker 2>learning curve though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1674
01:17:05.971 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Until like really learn how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially I would imagine the aspect of</v>

1675
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.900
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably incredibly difficult.</v>

1676
01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I was working for bomb,</v>

1677
01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:16.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only forging we did was a forging</v>

1678
01:17:16.911 --> 01:17:19.580
<v Speaker 3>the Damascus to make the patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1679
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:22.550
<v Speaker 3>and then we would like cut pleads out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go from there.</v>

1680
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:25.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned forging about five years ago.</v>

1681
01:17:25.491 --> 01:17:29.960
<v Speaker 3>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm working with a gentleman named David</v>

1682
01:17:29.961 --> 01:17:32.120
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] who's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a master bladesmith.</v>

1683
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:33.710
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he used to work in Seattle.</v>

1684
01:17:33.711 --> 01:17:37.010
<v Speaker 3>He's down in Olympia area now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

1685
01:17:37.011 --> 01:17:37.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1686
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:41.900
<v Speaker 3>he did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a blacksmith by trade that got into</v>

1687
01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:44.450
<v Speaker 3>knifemaking and he's fucking skill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's super talented,</v>

1688
01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:46.280
<v Speaker 3>especially when it comes to the bowie</v>
<v Speaker 3>knives and hunters.</v>

1689
01:17:46.281 --> 01:17:49.520
<v Speaker 3>Like he doesn't really great work and</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially his Damascus patterns are</v>

1690
01:17:49.530 --> 01:17:53.480
<v Speaker 3>really great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to watch somebody move and</v>

1691
01:17:53.481 --> 01:17:57.020
<v Speaker 3>manipulate material and really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said before,</v>

1692
01:17:57.021 --> 01:18:01.070
<v Speaker 3>like stock removal is a very valid way</v>
<v Speaker 3>of doing it because the cost of the</v>

1693
01:18:01.071 --> 01:18:03.200
<v Speaker 3>actual materials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1694
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:07.400
<v Speaker 3>is very small compared to the removal</v>
<v Speaker 3>stock removal.</v>

1695
01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:11.610
<v Speaker 3>So earlier I was talking about taking a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bar and then cutting out the blade shape</v>

1696
01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:12.950
<v Speaker 3>and then grind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1697
01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.530
<v Speaker 3>Cause you're literally removing stock</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1698
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.150
<v Speaker 3>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the starting the parent material.</v>

1699
01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Would you take what's left and melt it</v>
<v Speaker 3>down?</v>

1700
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:23.570
<v Speaker 3>You could melt it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could turn it and forge it into</v>

1701
01:18:23.571 --> 01:18:25.220
<v Speaker 3>other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1702
01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:28.820
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a really interesting practice.</v>

1703
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:30.560
<v Speaker 3>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like,</v>

1704
01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:32.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people refer to yoga as a practice and</v>

1705
01:18:32.651 --> 01:18:33.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be perfect and like</v>

1706
01:18:33.681 --> 01:18:36.560
<v Speaker 3>there's never going to be perfection</v>
<v Speaker 3>blade forging,</v>

1707
01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.110
<v Speaker 3>but there's always an opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn something and the practice it.</v>

1708
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:43.700
<v Speaker 3>And so when you see like you have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>decent little chunk,</v>

1709
01:18:43.701 --> 01:18:45.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start smashing on that thing and see</v>

1710
01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:48.110
<v Speaker 3>what you can get out of it to economize</v>
<v Speaker 3>that material.</v>

1711
01:18:48.111 --> 01:18:48.944
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1712
01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:52.970
<v Speaker 3>you don't really need to do that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of how inexpensive material is.</v>

1713
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:55.070
<v Speaker 3>But if you think back like even a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred years,</v>

1714
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:58.970
<v Speaker 3>like this high quality material,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking expensive.</v>

1715
01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:01.850
<v Speaker 3>You had to get the most out of it as you</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly could.</v>

1716
01:19:02.150 --> 01:19:05.060
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why forging with such a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big deal.</v>

1717
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:08.960
<v Speaker 3>And then as that price went down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people change the way they manufactured</v>

1718
01:19:08.961 --> 01:19:12.500
<v Speaker 3>just because then the time was the thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that costs the most,</v>

1719
01:19:12.501 --> 01:19:15.470
<v Speaker 3>not the materials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they turned around and made it</v>

1720
01:19:15.471 --> 01:19:18.390
<v Speaker 3>easier to manufacturer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't give a shit about the waste.</v>

1721
01:19:18.490 --> 01:19:22.340
<v Speaker 3>Now how did you learn handled geometry?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the handle on this hunting knife.</v>

1722
01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:24.320
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1723
01:19:24.321 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 3>So you're asking him is very unique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is unique and actually,</v>

1724
01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:30.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my hand perfectly fits in your hand know</v>

1725
01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.480
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the goal.</v>

1726
01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.860
<v Speaker 3>A friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend refers to it as a,</v>

1727
01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.880
<v Speaker 3>the knife shaking your hand back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it fits so well.</v>

1728
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:46.160
<v Speaker 3>It feels like you're holding like shake</v>
<v Speaker 3>it for people that are just listening.</v>

1729
01:19:46.230 --> 01:19:50.570
<v Speaker 3>Then there's an initial smoothness in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the front and then there's like this</v>

1730
01:19:50.571 --> 01:19:54.740
<v Speaker 3>little bump and then like a little step</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom and it just locks in your</v>

1731
01:19:54.741 --> 01:19:59.741
<v Speaker 3>hand and just feels perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was inspired to do that by a maker</v>

1732
01:19:59.871 --> 01:20:02.840
<v Speaker 3>named Claude beauchamp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a Belgian maker.</v>

1733
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:04.700
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I first met him,</v>

1734
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:07.790
<v Speaker 3>odd</v>
<v Speaker 3>Claude Bosch,</v>

1735
01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:09.990
<v Speaker 4>Bosch Chevy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is,</v>

1736
01:20:09.991 --> 01:20:11.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a Belgium maker.</v>

1737
01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:14.790
<v Speaker 4>He at the first time I met him was at</v>
<v Speaker 4>blade show,</v>

1738
01:20:14.791 --> 01:20:18.240
<v Speaker 4>which is a huge knife exposition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the biggest one in the world that</v>

1739
01:20:18.241 --> 01:20:20.940
<v Speaker 4>happens down in Atlanta every year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first weekend of June,</v>

1740
01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:25.680
<v Speaker 4>he was my table neighbor and I had never</v>
<v Speaker 4>told him the story,</v>

1741
01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:29.610
<v Speaker 4>but the first time I saw his knives I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like the blades and everything</v>

1742
01:20:29.611 --> 01:20:32.880
<v Speaker 4>looked great but that the handle looks</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking weird as shit.</v>

1743
01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:34.350
<v Speaker 4>This handle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1744
01:20:34.650 --> 01:20:38.430
<v Speaker 4>very similar to that handle cause his</v>
<v Speaker 4>has more of like a nice gentle curve</v>

1745
01:20:38.431 --> 01:20:42.420
<v Speaker 4>around to the end instead of kind of how</v>
<v Speaker 4>that one's kind of at a clip or an</v>

1746
01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:43.840
<v Speaker 4>angle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1747
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:47.550
<v Speaker 4>and so finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like on the third day of the show,</v>

1748
01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:49.830
<v Speaker 4>this really great maker that I look up</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1749
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>came over and he was just like doting</v>

1750
01:20:52.591 --> 01:20:53.610
<v Speaker 4>over clods work.</v>

1751
01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:54.390
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1752
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:55.840
<v Speaker 4>there must be something that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I have any,</v>

1753
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:58.590
<v Speaker 4>I feel like such an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I didn't even touch the stuff.</v>

1754
01:20:58.591 --> 01:21:01.860
<v Speaker 4>I was just looking at it and judging and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I picked it up and I was like,</v>

1755
01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:02.670
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1756
01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:05.160
<v Speaker 4>it was a totally like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

1757
01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:09.150
<v Speaker 4>Because that same feeling that you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're holding that,</v>

1758
01:21:09.170 --> 01:21:11.320
<v Speaker 4>it feels perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like it,</v>

1759
01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:16.420
<v Speaker 4>it totally shifted my entire mindset and</v>
<v Speaker 4>paradigm around what I thought handle</v>

1760
01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:21.390
<v Speaker 4>shapes should look and feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that has definitely inspired</v>

1761
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:26.280
<v Speaker 4>continued especially for like hard use</v>
<v Speaker 4>knives like especially like for a bigger</v>

1762
01:21:26.281 --> 01:21:28.260
<v Speaker 4>blade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a Bush knife that you're trying to</v>

1763
01:21:28.261 --> 01:21:33.261
<v Speaker 4>chop through stuff with a handle like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is going to benefit you immensely</v>

1764
01:21:33.691 --> 01:21:36.330
<v Speaker 4>because it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels like a natural extension of</v>

1765
01:21:36.331 --> 01:21:40.470
<v Speaker 4>your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is this your your logo into the</v>

1766
01:21:40.471 --> 01:21:40.800
<v Speaker 4>bottles?</v>

1767
01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.940
<v Speaker 4>My insignia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

1768
01:21:41.941 --> 01:21:46.080
<v Speaker 4>my name is Marco Mel Masiya.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's two m's kind of swirling around</v>

1769
01:21:46.081 --> 01:21:48.510
<v Speaker 4>each other and it looks kind of like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>flame dude.</v>

1770
01:21:48.511 --> 01:21:50.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm such a Dork for this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

1771
01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:55.110
<v Speaker 4>So interesting man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the handle too,</v>

1772
01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:58.440
<v Speaker 4>there's something about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the handle being made out of Antler,</v>

1773
01:21:58.710 --> 01:22:01.710
<v Speaker 4>like the Antler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the feel that it has in your hand to the</v>

1774
01:22:01.711 --> 01:22:05.210
<v Speaker 4>organic materials,</v>
<v Speaker 4>organic especially uh,</v>

1775
01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:09.330
<v Speaker 4>antler and bone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have this kind of like,</v>

1776
01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:11.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've experienced it</v>
<v Speaker 4>with these,</v>

1777
01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.040
<v Speaker 4>especially cutting up the like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>greasy meat,</v>

1778
01:22:14.041 --> 01:22:17.520
<v Speaker 4>but from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from my experience it does,</v>

1779
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:20.430
<v Speaker 4>it stays grippy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't become super slippery or</v>

1780
01:22:20.431 --> 01:22:24.230
<v Speaker 4>anything I handle on my bow is actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>made out of antler.</v>

1781
01:22:24.450 --> 01:22:26.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had it custom made.</v>

1782
01:22:26.011 --> 01:22:30.600
<v Speaker 4>My friend John Dudley had these ones</v>
<v Speaker 4>made from a bull that he killed on</v>

1783
01:22:30.601 --> 01:22:35.280
<v Speaker 4>September 11 2001 like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh she has the nine 11 bull and he had</v>

1784
01:22:35.281 --> 01:22:38.820
<v Speaker 4>these handle's made out of the antlers</v>
<v Speaker 4>of this.</v>

1785
01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.130
<v Speaker 4>And it does the way it sits in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>hand.</v>

1786
01:22:41.131 --> 01:22:43.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's got an,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you're sweaty or you know</v>

1787
01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:45.120
<v Speaker 4>there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1788
01:22:45.121 --> 01:22:47.190
<v Speaker 4>it's rainy out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just has an extra grip to it.</v>

1789
01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.160
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and especially something like that,</v>

1790
01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:53.130
<v Speaker 4>like if you're skinning and breaking</v>
<v Speaker 4>down an animal and like it's important,</v>

1791
01:22:53.131 --> 01:22:56.160
<v Speaker 4>but it's not going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like one of those moments where</v>

1792
01:22:56.161 --> 01:23:01.070
<v Speaker 4>you relying on that grip for your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you do need that for your life,</v>

1793
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:03.750
<v Speaker 4>like you're trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or like you're digging in the ground,</v>

1794
01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:06.030
<v Speaker 4>you're falling down the hillside and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to jab</v>

1795
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.960
<v Speaker 2>it and get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a hold.</v>

1796
01:23:07.961 --> 01:23:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Like that's going to be really</v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

1797
01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.130
<v Speaker 2>But obviously that's a very rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1798
01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:15.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incident when that one happened.</v>

1799
01:23:15.311 --> 01:23:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just something cool about it too.</v>

1800
01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just like the tactility.</v>

1801
01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1802
01:23:20.410 --> 01:23:21.740
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to the,</v>

1803
01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:25.060
<v Speaker 2>essentially the user experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what does it feel like?</v>

1804
01:23:25.061 --> 01:23:27.250
<v Speaker 2>How is it different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it makes,</v>

1805
01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.800
<v Speaker 2>it really does make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1806
01:23:29.801 --> 01:23:32.860
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the cool things to me also about</v>

1807
01:23:32.861 --> 01:23:35.250
<v Speaker 2>antlers is that they shed them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1808
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:39.700
<v Speaker 2>that they lose these things every year</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that every year they grow a new one.</v>

1809
01:23:39.701 --> 01:23:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that it's the fastest</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing organic material on earth?</v>

1810
01:23:44.290 --> 01:23:45.123
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

1811
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:49.990
<v Speaker 2>That shit right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that giant elk antler that grows in a</v>

1812
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:54.130
<v Speaker 2>couple of months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that falls off.</v>

1813
01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lose it after they're done running.</v>

1814
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:59.520
<v Speaker 2>So after they're done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they fell off and they just kind of</v>

1815
01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:01.690
<v Speaker 2>immediately started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like kind of slowly grow.</v>

1816
01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:04.630
<v Speaker 2>They grow the whole thing back in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple months.</v>

1817
01:24:04.631 --> 01:24:07.660
<v Speaker 2>It's radical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you find a video that shows,</v>

1818
01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:10.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elk antler growth,</v>

1819
01:24:10.751 --> 01:24:15.550
<v Speaker 2>time lapse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's crazy how fast it grows and</v>

1820
01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:17.380
<v Speaker 2>it's all just for war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1821
01:24:17.381 --> 01:24:19.930
<v Speaker 2>that's all that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to show off for the ladies.</v>

1822

1857
01:25:56.890 --> 01:26:00.190
<v Speaker 2>So by the time August rolls around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're ripe right now,</v>

1858
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:04.400
<v Speaker 2>beginning of September there in hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>horned and they'll go to war and they'll</v>

1859
01:26:04.401 --> 01:26:06.080
<v Speaker 2>keep that shit for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1860
01:26:06.081 --> 01:26:08.720
<v Speaker 2>till the end of December.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably December I think.</v>

1861
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Maybe January and then they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll lose it and then they lose the</v>

1862
01:26:13.641 --> 01:26:16.080
<v Speaker 2>fastest growing organic material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1863
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.780
<v Speaker 2>By volume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weight,</v>

1864
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:18.820
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1865
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think by all those things,</v>

1866
01:26:21.141 --> 01:26:23.510
<v Speaker 2>because it grows so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so heavy.</v>

1867
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:26.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's like 40 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just have antlers.</v>

1868
01:26:26.211 --> 01:26:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it grows over a couple months.</v>

1869
01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking nuts man.</v>

1870
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:33.620
<v Speaker 2>This scene picture on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made that up about the fastest growing</v>

1871
01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:35.210
<v Speaker 2>organic material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's true.</v>

1872
01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:36.381
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says,</v>

1873
01:26:36.381 --> 01:26:38.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first fun fact I found it,</v>

1874
01:26:38.391 --> 01:26:41.840
<v Speaker 2>they can grow 10 pounds of velvet per</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1875
01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.270
<v Speaker 2>That's just the valve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the velvet.</v>

1876
01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:45.133
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1877
01:26:45.930 --> 01:26:46.763
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>

1878
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's probably because a,</v>

1879
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:49.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a velvet farm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1880
01:26:49.511 --> 01:26:51.460
<v Speaker 2>they use that stuff for human growth</v>
<v Speaker 2>hormone.</v>

1881
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of baseball players were</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking on a shit.</v>

1882
01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine,</v>

1883
01:26:56.111 --> 01:26:58.540
<v Speaker 2>my friend John Rivet shout out to Johnny</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ribot,</v>

1884
01:26:58.870 --> 01:27:03.550
<v Speaker 2>he lives in Alberta in his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of his friends had an elk farm up</v>

1885
01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:07.150
<v Speaker 2>there in Alberta and he grew elk non for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat,</v>

1886
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:11.890
<v Speaker 2>but for the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the velvet because that stuff that</v>

1887
01:27:11.891 --> 01:27:14.710
<v Speaker 2>grows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grows so fast and it's so,</v>

1888
01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.830
<v Speaker 2>so ridiculously potent that they would</v>
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>

1889
01:27:17.890 --> 01:27:20.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antler velvet and they were turning into</v>

1890
01:27:20.831 --> 01:27:24.850
<v Speaker 2>a spray that would equal the effects of</v>
<v Speaker 2>human growth hormone.</v>

1891
01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.670
<v Speaker 2>How could you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crossing me?</v>

1899
01:27:46.781 --> 01:27:48.190

1902
01:27:53.530 --> 01:27:55.720
<v Speaker 2>but it was a big thing in the,</v>

1921
01:28:34.001 --> 01:28:34.381
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1924
01:28:37.571 --> 01:28:41.170
<v Speaker 2>There's all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shout out to my good friend Tommy Junior</v>

1925
01:28:41.171 --> 01:28:42.770
<v Speaker 2>and lived in Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1926
01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:43.960
<v Speaker 2>I finally found it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1927
01:28:43.961 --> 01:28:46.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just antlers in general</v>

1928
01:28:46.091 --> 01:28:48.760
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the fastest growing tissue and an</v>

1929
01:28:48.761 --> 01:28:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Annie Mammo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1930
01:28:50.110 --> 01:28:53.080
<v Speaker 2>And then she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elk Antler is the fastest growing out of</v>

1931
01:28:53.081 --> 01:28:56.890
<v Speaker 2>all of them because it's the largest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it grows in the same amount of time</v>

1932
01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:59.920
<v Speaker 2>that the deer would grow its antlers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's far larger.</v>

1933
01:29:00.610 --> 01:29:01.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1934
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:04.020
<v Speaker 2>like if that was been more mass than a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than a Moose,</v>

1935
01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:05.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1936
01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:08.220
<v Speaker 2>no dear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would be big Musubi where some Moose,</v>

1937
01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:10.500
<v Speaker 2>cause my are here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the biggest,</v>

1938
01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:14.010
<v Speaker 2>they're the biggest of all of the deer</v>
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>

1939
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Like by far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1940
01:29:15.991 --> 01:29:20.991
<v Speaker 2>I think like a full grown Yukon Moose</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be as much as 2000 pounds.</v>

1941
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:27.950
<v Speaker 2>A really big rocky mountain elk under</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal circumstances is like a fucking</v>

1942
01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:33.810
<v Speaker 2>giant one is pushing a thousand genes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a giant though.</v>

1943
01:29:33.811 --> 01:29:38.811
<v Speaker 2>That'd be like a 400 inch bull like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>one that's out for the,</v>

1944
01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:42.300
<v Speaker 2>the inches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The measurement of the size of the</v>

1945
01:29:42.301 --> 01:29:45.180
<v Speaker 2>inches of the antler like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see that one that's in the front?</v>

1946
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:47.100
<v Speaker 2>That's considerably bigger than this</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

1947
01:29:47.130 --> 01:29:49.650
<v Speaker 2>That was the one out in the front is 382</v>
<v Speaker 2>inches.</v>

1948
01:29:49.651 --> 01:29:53.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a giant bull chasing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That fucker was about a thousand pounds.</v>

1949
01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.110
<v Speaker 2>He was huge.</v>

1950
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moose.</v>

1951
01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Moose is twice as big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hips would see that thing go.</v>

1952
01:30:00.301 --> 01:30:01.320
<v Speaker 2>Shut the fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

1953
01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just start running for Moose.</v>

1954
01:30:05.131 --> 01:30:05.790
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1955
01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:08.550
<v Speaker 2>the weird thing about a moose is their</v>
<v Speaker 2>antlers or like a door,</v>

1956
01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:12.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's basically like they're so fat</v>

1957
01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:14.520
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like pokey mean.</v>

1958
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:17.790
<v Speaker 2>They're basically like they're hitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other in the head with doors.</v>

1959
01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like big old gloves and,</v>

1960
01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:22.020
<v Speaker 2>but you seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you seen,</v>

1961
01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:24.220
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a few pictures where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the Moose there,</v>

1962
01:30:24.221 --> 01:30:29.221
<v Speaker 2>the antlers get locked up and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stuck more deer than Moose.</v>

1963
01:30:30.311 --> 01:30:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the design of a moose antlers is</v>

1964
01:30:33.481 --> 01:30:35.220
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as intertwined.</v>

1965
01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:38.190
<v Speaker 2>But with deer it happens all the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a little bit of flex to</v>

1966
01:30:38.191 --> 01:30:41.910
<v Speaker 2>the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the clash and in the force of the</v>

1967
01:30:41.911 --> 01:30:44.250
<v Speaker 2>two of them slamming each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get stuck.</v>

1968
01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.100
<v Speaker 2>CTE Will they drown?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Gee.</v>

1969
01:30:47.190 --> 01:30:49.770
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've fought like that and then,</v>

1970
01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:51.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestled and wound up in the water and</v>

1971
01:30:51.961 --> 01:30:56.961
<v Speaker 2>one up drowning does a horrible video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw of two deer that got stuck in one</v>

1972
01:30:58.051 --> 01:31:02.460
<v Speaker 2>of them got killed by a coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just get a whole pack of them torn</v>

1973
01:31:02.461 --> 01:31:05.010
<v Speaker 2>to shreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tore him and they eat them.</v>

1974
01:31:05.011 --> 01:31:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Asshole first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I've documented many times in this</v>

1975
01:31:07.861 --> 01:31:08.990
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1976
01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:11.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like a lot of animals do go for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>buck first.</v>

1977
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1978
01:31:12.271 --> 01:31:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Lions do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them do.</v>

1979
01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that's all about.</v>

1980
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1981
01:31:17.821 --> 01:31:22.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one deer was still attached to his</v>

1982
01:31:22.351 --> 01:31:27.150
<v Speaker 2>dead friend and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these hunters had to help it get</v>

1983
01:31:27.151 --> 01:31:31.770
<v Speaker 2>released and they saw one of the antlers</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the other deer is dead deer and</v>

1984
01:31:31.771 --> 01:31:33.690
<v Speaker 2>fried it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this other one ran off.</v>

1985
01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Like what a nightmare that guys lived</v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

1986
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know his buddy,</v>

1987
01:31:36.811 --> 01:31:40.440
<v Speaker 2>it's his ass hole torn apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They literally eating him alive while he</v>

1988
01:31:40.441 --> 01:31:42.120
<v Speaker 2>stuck to the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1989
01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Probably fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1990
01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I have him as well kicking in and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>could he be trying to talk about,</v>

1991
01:31:46.921 --> 01:31:49.560
<v Speaker 2>could have easily been you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally could have easily been</v>

1992
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:50.790
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two dear.</v>

1993
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.470
<v Speaker 2>One of them gets eaten alive and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other one's just sitting there like,</v>

1994
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:59.380
<v Speaker 2>like living with the horror of his and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then these people come over and he can't</v>

1995
01:31:59.381 --> 01:32:00.910
<v Speaker 2>get away from the fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1996
01:32:00.911 --> 01:32:02.950
<v Speaker 2>these people are gonna eat me and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even eat them.</v>

1997
01:32:03.010 --> 01:32:08.010
<v Speaker 2>They let them go and they're hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They freed him up and let me lose crazy.</v>

1998
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got that.</v>

1999
01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one that elk got stuck with a</v>

2000
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.860
<v Speaker 2>dead elk.</v>

2001
01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:18.480
<v Speaker 2>That's a dead elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an elk head that stuck on this</v>

2002
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:20.080
<v Speaker 2>other elks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>

2003
01:32:20.170 --> 01:32:24.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That to me makes me think that that</v>

2004
01:32:24.641 --> 01:32:29.641
<v Speaker 2>could have very easily been like an elk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>found a dead elk and just started head</v>

2005
01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:32.480
<v Speaker 2>butting in and ripped his head off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>got stuck with them.</v>

2006
01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:35.400
<v Speaker 2>They kill each other all the time right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2007
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:38.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Geez.</v>

2008
01:32:38.381 --> 01:32:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Look at those racks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2009
01:32:39.761 --> 01:32:42.760
<v Speaker 2>When you hear them fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the first times I ever went</v>

2010
01:32:42.761 --> 01:32:45.940
<v Speaker 2>elk hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were coming over this hill and it</v>

2011
01:32:45.941 --> 01:32:49.450
<v Speaker 2>sounded like two dudes slam and baseball</v>
<v Speaker 2>bands together.</v>

2012
01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Just crack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crack,</v>

2013
01:32:51.730 --> 01:32:52.900
<v Speaker 2>crack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crack.</v>

2014
01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:54.760
<v Speaker 2>And when we came over the top of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hill,</v>

2015
01:32:54.761 --> 01:32:59.761
<v Speaker 2>these two giant elk were just running at</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other and smashing each other.</v>

2016
01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:03.310
<v Speaker 2>It was a magical day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like one of the first times I</v>

2017
01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:04.150
<v Speaker 2>ever elk hunted.</v>

2018
01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:08.110
<v Speaker 2>And there's a thing that happens when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hit a peak rut and when the peak</v>

2019
01:33:08.111 --> 01:33:11.230
<v Speaker 2>rudd happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just go crazy all around you.</v>

2020
01:33:11.231 --> 01:33:16.231
<v Speaker 2>They're all screaming and it might only</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen once in a season and you just,</v>

2021
01:33:16.570 --> 01:33:19.810
<v Speaker 2>if you might be there for that couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours when it all goes down,</v>

2022
01:33:19.811 --> 01:33:22.180
<v Speaker 2>what's insanity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Insanity.</v>

2023
01:33:22.181 --> 01:33:24.760
<v Speaker 2>There's all around you screaming and</v>
<v Speaker 2>head butting each other.</v>

2024
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:27.520
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imagine him walking over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top of the hill and it's like</v>

2025
01:33:27.521 --> 01:33:30.040
<v Speaker 2>fucking stumbling across are so</v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable.</v>

2026
01:33:30.930 --> 01:33:34.690
<v Speaker 2>First one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a tree and they're screaming</v>

2027
01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:38.650
<v Speaker 2>and they're so big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2028
01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:40.010
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a screen.</v>

2029
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:44.080
<v Speaker 2>There's two going at it right there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear him,</v>

2030
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.430
<v Speaker 2>they just clash and slamming each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2031
01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:50.670
<v Speaker 2>you hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

2032
01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:54.880
<v Speaker 2>the boy dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

2033
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:58.870
<v Speaker 2>And they don't even know he's alive</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now and they kill each other all</v>

2034
01:33:58.871 --> 01:34:01.510
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the hormones they got going on.</v>

2035
01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:04.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck about anything else.</v>

2036
01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:07.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Cam came across one last year</v>

2037
01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:10.120
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he crept up on it.</v>

2038
01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:14.530
<v Speaker 2>He thought it was bedded and he shot it</v>
<v Speaker 2>with an Arrow and it didn't move.</v>

2039
01:34:14.830 --> 01:34:15.910
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2040
01:34:15.911 --> 01:34:18.750
<v Speaker 2>And he got over to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was already dead and another elk,</v>

2041
01:34:18.751 --> 01:34:22.060
<v Speaker 2>it stabbed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stabbed through the heart and it</v>

2042
01:34:22.061 --> 01:34:23.870
<v Speaker 2>laid down and died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2043
01:34:23.871 --> 01:34:25.280
<v Speaker 2>It happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>

2044
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:27.940
<v Speaker 2>they're always finding them that other</v>
<v Speaker 2>other elk have murdered.</v>

2045
01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:29.890
<v Speaker 2>They don't crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

2046
01:34:29.891 --> 01:34:33.610
<v Speaker 2>They just trying to get that policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I to get the pose,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Is that a monster?</v>

2048
01:34:36.111 --> 01:34:37.300
<v Speaker 2>A month?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a month.</v>

2049
01:34:37.301 --> 01:34:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a little bit longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a second rut.</v>

2050
01:34:39.671 --> 01:34:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes in October when a another</v>
<v Speaker 2>female,</v>

2051
01:34:42.111 --> 01:34:45.190
<v Speaker 2>we'll go into estrus and they'll resume</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Rut.</v>

2052
01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's magical times.</v>

2053
01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imagine stumbled across</v>

2054
01:34:50.261 --> 01:34:51.310
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool,</v>

2055
01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:52.810
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>

2056
01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:54.400
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real wild,</v>

2057
01:34:54.401 --> 01:34:57.350
<v Speaker 2>the actual real wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you are in Connecticut,</v>

2058
01:34:57.351 --> 01:34:58.820
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to worry about two things.</v>

2059
01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:01.070
<v Speaker 2>Hitting a deer with your car and lyme</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

2060
01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:02.750
<v Speaker 3>The lime dust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2061
01:35:02.751 --> 01:35:06.530
<v Speaker 3>So that's something that we didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize we were moving into.</v>

2062
01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man,</v>

2063
01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I wish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I told you because you and I were</v>

2064
01:35:09.931 --> 01:35:11.850
<v Speaker 2>going back and forth when you were about</v>
<v Speaker 2>to move,</v>

2065
01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:12.621
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2066
01:35:12.621 --> 01:35:14.210
<v Speaker 3>That was definitely one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2067
01:35:14.211 --> 01:35:15.021
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>

2068
01:35:15.021 --> 01:35:15.854
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2069
01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:17.460
<v Speaker 3>They're everywhere and you got to him</v>

2070
01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.520
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ticks,</v>

2071
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:22.310
<v Speaker 2>and if you're listening to this anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the east coast,</v>

2072
01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially New York has got it really</v>

2073
01:35:25.791 --> 01:35:27.950
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lyme disease map and</v>

2074
01:35:27.951 --> 01:35:30.560
<v Speaker 2>you see like the instances of lyme</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease and the east coast.</v>

2075
01:35:30.710 --> 01:35:34.880
<v Speaker 2>It's horrific man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know fucking at least a dozen</v>

2076
01:35:34.881 --> 01:35:37.080
<v Speaker 2>people that have it and it stays with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you for life.</v>

2077
01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my friend Jim Miller,</v>

2078
01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy who fights in the UFC.</v>

2079
01:35:40.341 --> 01:35:43.130
<v Speaker 2>He's got to take a giant fistful of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pills every day.</v>

2080
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:47.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's got it real bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real bad and he's still fighting,</v>

2081
01:35:48.170 --> 01:35:49.190
<v Speaker 2>still fighting in the UFC</v>

2082
01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:51.670
<v Speaker 3>and those deer too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been worried about actually when</v>

2083
01:35:51.671 --> 01:35:52.840
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when we were moving out</v>

2084
01:35:52.841 --> 01:35:55.270
<v Speaker 3>because I was driving through</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania,</v>

2085
01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:00.720
<v Speaker 3>I hit Pennsylvania at like we drove</v>
<v Speaker 3>cross country at sunset and drove from</v>

2086
01:36:01.331 --> 01:36:05.380
<v Speaker 3>there all the way to Connecticut and</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark and all I could think is like,</v>

2087
01:36:05.530 --> 01:36:08.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fucking hit a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see so many of them.</v>

2088
01:36:08.231 --> 01:36:10.930
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see so many dead ones on the side of</v>

2089
01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:13.150
<v Speaker 3>the fucking room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blows my mind.</v>

2090
01:36:13.450 --> 01:36:18.450
<v Speaker 3>But the biggest issue has been actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>other Connecticut drivers is the big,</v>

2091
01:36:19.841 --> 01:36:23.560
<v Speaker 3>the biggest concern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife and I both have been t boned in</v>

2092
01:36:23.561 --> 01:36:26.260
<v Speaker 3>the last eight months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People in Connecticut just,</v>

2093
01:36:26.261 --> 01:36:29.050
<v Speaker 3>they're just given up man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This hitting the gas and closing her</v>

2094
01:36:29.051 --> 01:36:29.884
<v Speaker 3>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2095
01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:32.590
<v Speaker 3>what's crazy is like I've driven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've driven an la,</v>

2096
01:36:32.591 --> 01:36:35.740
<v Speaker 3>I've driven in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've driven in fucking Oregon,</v>

2097
01:36:35.741 --> 01:36:37.540
<v Speaker 3>seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of crazy places,</v>

2098
01:36:37.690 --> 01:36:42.690
<v Speaker 3>but they all have like a culture about</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they work and I could not figure out</v>

2099
01:36:43.601 --> 01:36:47.410
<v Speaker 3>Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a friend finally explained it to me.</v>

2100
01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:51.910
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're driving as if nobody else is on</v>

2101
01:36:51.911 --> 01:36:52.571
<v Speaker 3>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2102
01:36:52.571 --> 01:36:54.100
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes perfect sense.</v>

2103
01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:58.870
<v Speaker 3>The w the choices they make are as if</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody else is there.</v>

2104
01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:02.470
<v Speaker 3>I'll be coming up in the passing lane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he's in the lane to the right of</v>

2105
01:37:02.471 --> 01:37:04.150
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no exits coming up.</v>

2106
01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:06.460
<v Speaker 3>There's no other cars for like half a</v>
<v Speaker 3>mile.</v>

2107
01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:09.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm cruising probably like five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 miles faster than them.</v>

2108
01:37:09.730 --> 01:37:12.430
<v Speaker 3>They changed lanes right in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2109
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:13.703
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

2110
01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Because like say if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2111
01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:17.580
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

2112
01:37:17.610 --> 01:37:21.060
<v Speaker 2>let's say there's a thing that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>making like in a poxy,</v>

2113
01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:22.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're making an epoxy,</v>

2114
01:37:22.651 --> 01:37:25.110
<v Speaker 2>there's several ingredients that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to add to it.</v>

2115
01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe that's not the best example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like say maybe there's a electronics,</v>

2116
01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.750
<v Speaker 2>just whatever it is that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2117
01:37:33.810 --> 01:37:38.810
<v Speaker 2>you're making say so if you're making a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and it requires 10 different</v>

2118
01:37:40.021 --> 01:37:43.860
<v Speaker 2>ingredients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are a person in Connecticut,</v>

2119
01:37:43.861 --> 01:37:46.050
<v Speaker 2>you have eight ingredients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have those other two and you</v>

2120
01:37:46.051 --> 01:37:48.840
<v Speaker 2>just do without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without you just deal with it.</v>

2121
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:53.280
<v Speaker 2>You just missing two things and you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit the gas and just drive places and no</v>

2122
01:37:53.281 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 2>one knows what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a real state.</v>

2123
01:37:57.210 --> 01:38:00.090
<v Speaker 2>It's just not well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's also bonkers that we weren't</v>

2124
01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:03.690
<v Speaker 2>expecting is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're driving 15 to 20 miles</v>

2125
01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:06.870
<v Speaker 2>over the speed limit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going too slow or,</v>

2126
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:08.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a stoplight.</v>

2127
01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:14.090
<v Speaker 2>And stop signs are suggestion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People used right or left,</v>

2128
01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.940
<v Speaker 2>left where they're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are they going?</v>

2129
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:20.490
<v Speaker 2>They don't under the state so small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could drive through the state and</v>

2130
01:38:20.491 --> 01:38:23.100
<v Speaker 2>demand and a half hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of stuff.</v>

2131
01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:25.470
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so confused now and I'm not</v>

2132
01:38:25.471 --> 01:38:27.510
<v Speaker 2>trying to sit here and shit on fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut,</v>

2133
01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:32.370
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that those things haven't been</v>

2134
01:38:32.371 --> 01:38:35.160
<v Speaker 2>a serious culture shock for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despair,</v>

2135
01:38:35.490 --> 01:38:37.110
<v Speaker 2>despair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hit the gas.</v>

2136
01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:39.720
<v Speaker 2>What's crazy is it's a fucking beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

2137
01:38:41.370 --> 01:38:43.830
<v Speaker 2>especially in the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrifying trying to drive around</v>

<v Speaker 2>winter,</v>

2165
01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:50.490
<v Speaker 2>like a beaten wife waiting for your</v>
<v Speaker 2>husband to come home and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2173
01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:13.380

<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2174
01:40:13.410 --> 01:40:14.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2186
01:40:34.890 --> 01:40:35.481
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2187
01:40:35.481 --> 01:40:39.360
<v Speaker 2>the people are so fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The restaurants are amazing and the</v>

2188
01:40:39.361 --> 01:40:42.150
<v Speaker 2>summers are so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three years later he's back in La.</v>

2189
01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:42.781
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

2190
01:40:42.781 --> 01:40:43.501
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do it,</v>

2191
01:40:43.501 --> 01:40:44.850
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't do it anymore.</v>

2192
01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.160
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2193
01:40:46.170 --> 01:40:48.180
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a thing.</v>

2194
01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:51.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like you hang in there for as long</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you can,</v>

2195
01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:53.680
<v Speaker 2>but you can't hang in there forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That what it is.</v>

2196
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:56.470
<v Speaker 4>But some people can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can hang.</v>

2197
01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:57.460
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2198
01:40:57.460 --> 01:40:58.570
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it,</v>

2199
01:40:58.850 --> 01:41:01.270
<v Speaker 4>seasonal depression syndrome or some</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2200
01:41:01.271 --> 01:41:03.910
<v Speaker 4>Like it's cause you grew up there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

2201
01:41:03.911 --> 01:41:06.760
<v Speaker 4>Cause my sister and my mom both grew up</v>
<v Speaker 4>there too.</v>

2202
01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:09.630
<v Speaker 4>My wife even the hate it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2203
01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.030
<v Speaker 4>especially the winter time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wintertime when it is that dark</v>

2204
01:41:13.031 --> 01:41:14.500
<v Speaker 4>gray,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it doesn't snow,</v>

2205
01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:17.290
<v Speaker 4>it just rains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just gets dark.</v>

2206
01:41:17.890 --> 01:41:19.810
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think part of my issue is,</v>

2207
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:22.060
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always worked in restaurants or in</v>

2208
01:41:22.061 --> 01:41:23.530
<v Speaker 4>Phuket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're in a shop,</v>

2209
01:41:23.531 --> 01:41:27.190
<v Speaker 4>so it's like I'm in a virtual cave all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fucking time,</v>

2210
01:41:27.191 --> 01:41:31.660
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not experiencing that except for</v>
<v Speaker 4>the drive home or to work.</v>

2211
01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:36.100
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't Jamie just said sad as I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking up seasonal effective disorder.</v>

2212
01:41:36.101 --> 01:41:38.830
<v Speaker 4>That's the acronym they give is sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sad.</v>

2213
01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:39.970
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it is.</v>

2214
01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:45.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they probably called it that on purpose.</v>

2215
01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:47.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they needed to call it</v>

2216
01:41:47.231 --> 01:41:51.100
<v Speaker 4>seasonal affective disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the best feel like shit</v>

2217
01:41:51.101 --> 01:41:53.590
<v Speaker 4>because of the rain disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2218
01:41:53.610 --> 01:41:56.830
<v Speaker 4>something isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something about like the lack of vitamin</v>

2219
01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:59.290
<v Speaker 4>D felt light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what though.</v>

2220
01:42:00.190 --> 01:42:03.940
<v Speaker 4>There's light therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take it over Connecticut all day.</v>

2221
01:42:04.630 --> 01:42:06.310
<v Speaker 4>I'll take Seattle over Connecticut.</v>

2222
01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:09.780
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all day.</v>

2223
01:42:09.810 --> 01:42:11.880
<v Speaker 4>You know what I dream about it sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 4>is Denver.</v>

2224
01:42:11.881 --> 01:42:14.540
<v Speaker 4>Even Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lived in Denver for only a few,</v>

2225
01:42:14.970 --> 01:42:18.180
<v Speaker 4>a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People that live in Connecticut right</v>

2226
01:42:18.181 --> 01:42:18.541
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2227
01:42:18.541 --> 01:42:19.740
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude?</v>

2228
01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:22.470
<v Speaker 4>I actually running gag folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really care.</v>

2229
01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:26.970
<v Speaker 4>When we first moved in Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Denver's fucking beautiful.</v>

2230
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:29.100
<v Speaker 4>Fucking love Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love it.</v>

2231
01:42:29.610 --> 01:42:30.443
<v Speaker 4>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was,</v>

2232
01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:32.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I first moved there,</v>

2233
01:42:32.041 --> 01:42:34.500
<v Speaker 4>I thought I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I grew up in Washington right at the</v>

2234
01:42:34.501 --> 01:42:38.550
<v Speaker 4>base of the puget sound water around me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually used to sail on a racing team</v>

2235
01:42:38.551 --> 01:42:39.361
<v Speaker 4>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2236
01:42:39.361 --> 01:42:42.030
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to miss the water so much and</v>

2237
01:42:42.031 --> 01:42:44.370
<v Speaker 4>it's so green too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got there and I was like,</v>

2238
01:42:45.150 --> 01:42:47.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I care about the water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I care about the green.</v>

2239
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:51.030
<v Speaker 4>But the second the spring rains hit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything turned green.</v>

2240
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:52.530
<v Speaker 4>All the trees started blossoming.</v>

2241
01:42:52.530 --> 01:42:53.640
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

2242
01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:56.760
<v Speaker 4>And it was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>

2243
01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:02.390
<v Speaker 4>The only thing I hated about Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody had a fucking dog and nobody</v>

2244
01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:04.040
<v Speaker 4>cleaned up the dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2245
01:43:04.041 --> 01:43:06.000
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the everywhere.</v>

2246
01:43:06.030 --> 01:43:08.590
<v Speaker 4>Lazy bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't understand it.</v>

2247
01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:11.670
<v Speaker 4>It's probably worse now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other hand,</v>

2248
01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:14.700
<v Speaker 4>the free pot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the legal pot to everywhere.</v>

2249
01:43:14.850 --> 01:43:17.670
<v Speaker 4>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it has that's amazing,</v>

2250
01:43:17.671 --> 01:43:19.260
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the view of the mountains.</v>

2251
01:43:19.530 --> 01:43:22.860
<v Speaker 4>There's something about being right</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and seeing those rockies that just</v>

2252
01:43:23.010 --> 01:43:25.110
<v Speaker 4>humbles you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It puts it in perspective.</v>

2253
01:43:25.730 --> 01:43:27.900
<v Speaker 4>So that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what being in puget sounds like</v>

2254
01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:30.120
<v Speaker 4>as well because you always got Mount</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rainier.</v>

2255
01:43:31.110 --> 01:43:32.490
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the road,</v>

2256
01:43:32.491 --> 01:43:35.690
<v Speaker 4>the cities were engineered so like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're coming up and down hills and like</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a monster.</v>

2259
01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:40.910
<v Speaker 4>Mount Rainier is a monster.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you don't leave any footprints because</v>

2269

<v Speaker 4>fucking rambunctious.</v>

2327
01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:34.070

<v Speaker 4>through the eyes of your child,</v>

2332
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:47.240
<v Speaker 4>just watching them experiencing all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things.</v>

2333
01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:52.470
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can almost see the little</v>
<v Speaker 4>cogs turning in their head.</v>

2334
01:46:53.370 --> 01:46:54.570

<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one thing that I didn't</v>

2336
01:46:56.821 --> 01:47:01.740
<v Speaker 4>anticipate before you had children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like watching them learn like,</v>

2337
01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:02.370
<v Speaker 4>oh wow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>watching kids learn.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

<v Speaker 4>there's something about like you learn</v>
<v Speaker 4>watching them learn and it really sort</v>

2341
01:47:12.661 --> 01:47:16.380
<v Speaker 4>of reinforces this idea that every human</v>
<v Speaker 4>being is essentially,</v>

2342
01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:21.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're not a blank slate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they are most certainly subject to</v>

2343
01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:25.310
<v Speaker 4>the influences of their environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they experience.</v>

2344
01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:27.740
<v Speaker 4>They take that data in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2345
01:47:28.110 --> 01:47:30.750
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>none of the countries are marked down on</v>

2351
01:47:42.901 --> 01:47:46.710
<v Speaker 4>it or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we knew some of the spots and so we</v>

<v Speaker 4>started teaching him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knows where like over a hundred</v>

<v Speaker 4>China pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you go over to Europe,</v>

2359
01:48:04.081 --> 01:48:05.700
<v Speaker 4>he's like hungry Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greece,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Show you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tell you what Africa is,</v>

2363

<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>

2364
01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:16.470
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only reason I know them it's cause</v>

<v Speaker 4>he knows at least it doesn't in a</v>

2369
01:48:26.981 --> 01:48:28.980
<v Speaker 4>different flags.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're so open,</v>

<v Speaker 4>They're so open.</v>

2372
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:36.960
<v Speaker 4>Let me think about kids learn language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the time they go to school,</v>

2373
01:48:36.961 --> 01:48:37.920
<v Speaker 4>they already know how to talk.</v>

2374
01:48:39.130 --> 01:48:41.340
<v Speaker 4>They don't learn in school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Learn how to talk.</v>

2375
01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:45.510
<v Speaker 4>When my wife has her master's degree at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the university level for teaching</v>

<v Speaker 3>if you go to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my instagram profile,</v>

<v Speaker 3>goes straight to the auction page for</v>

2422
01:51:01.041 --> 01:51:02.500
