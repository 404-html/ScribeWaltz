<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

4
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

5
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.760
<v Speaker 1>So Tom pop and I are sitting here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>USA.</v>

6
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you see the fight on Saturday night?</v>

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy that got knocked down,</v>

8
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health guy,</v>

9
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>the guy got up for everyone with mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>But you said no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see the fight.</v>

11
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Like I only saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only saw that.</v>

12
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>How narratives work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in this day and age especially,</v>

14
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>there's way too much information out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

15
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:31.674
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no way you could see every </v>

16
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>television show or watch every sporting </v>
<v Speaker 1>event or,</v>

17
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every scandal.</v>

18
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>So when something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the blurb,</v>

19
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little summary that I have absorbed,</v>

20
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my one buddy watched it on instagram,</v>

21
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:46.194
<v Speaker 1>he posted a thing and it was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>heartfelt that he got up for all the </v>

22
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>people with mental health.</v>

23
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.093
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read that and I feel like I </v>

24
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>experienced the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

25
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:54.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

26
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:56.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he won or lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he got to draw,</v>

27
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw.</v>

28
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

29
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.593
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a firm opinion on whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not the draw was justified because I </v>

30
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>only watched it once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I thought that Tyson fewer one</v>

31
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.710
<v Speaker 1>most of the rounds except the two that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he got knocked down in tysons.</v>

32
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:15.530
<v Speaker 1>The anti mental health guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

33
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.360
<v Speaker 1>he's the white guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the white guy that got knocked down</v>

34
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>and Deontay wilder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

35
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.763
<v Speaker 1>Is he strange in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has like the most freaky punching </v>

36
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:30.290
<v Speaker 1>power I think I've ever seen ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard too.</v>

37
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Big Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for a heavyweight.</v>

38
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>He's 212 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks pretty big though.</v>

39
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>He's Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shredded.</v>

40
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:38.440
<v Speaker 1>He has no fat on them whatsoever.</v>

41
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Back is where all the power is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I was.</v>

42
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>His muscle is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see his back.</v>

43
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a bundle of snakes.</v>

44
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.963
<v Speaker 1>But I saw the clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knocked him out and then backed up </v>

45
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>and dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iceland got up.</v>

46
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy.</v>

47
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilder punches so hard.</v>

48
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>And that was in the twelfth and final </v>
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

49
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>That was a fight where he was mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>losing.</v>

50
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>He was mostly getting boxed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was mostly getting out boxed,</v>

51
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.720
<v Speaker 1>but then he would land and he landed </v>
<v Speaker 1>real hard and like,</v>

52
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 1>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the eighth or the ninth,</v>

53
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

54
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:12.500
<v Speaker 1>He dropped him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't a big knockdown.</v>

55
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>He knocked him down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he got up pretty quick and he was.</v>

56
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.103
<v Speaker 1>He was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the twelfth he fucking blasted </v>

57
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit him with a right hand and then as</v>

58
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.074
<v Speaker 1>he was falling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hit him with a left hook on the chin </v>

59
00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:24.324
<v Speaker 1>as he was going down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any laid flat on his back with his </v>

60
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>arms down.</v>

61
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.580
<v Speaker 1>He looked unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

62
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:29.414
<v Speaker 1>he really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he rose like Lazarus and he </v>

63
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>looked pretty sharp when he got on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet,</v>

64
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>one of the rest of the round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to rest around the stung him.</v>

65
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>He stunned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deontay wilder.</v>

66
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy because of the mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>health kids.</v>

67
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.103
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

68
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:44.784
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that's really what he was </v>

69
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:47.610
<v Speaker 1>thinking when you're getting up off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>canvas?</v>

70
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.800

<v Speaker 1>A lot of cocaine and just fucked his </v>

112
00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:38.370
<v Speaker 1>life up just as he achieved what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to achieve.</v>

113
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's calling it mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:42.360
<v Speaker 1>because of depression and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

115
00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:45.810
<v Speaker 1>But part of me wants to say that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that is.</v>

116
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

117
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.810
<v Speaker 1>obviously I've never been inside of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

118
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.900
<v Speaker 1>but when you're doing that much coke and</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking that much,</v>

119
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.070
<v Speaker 1>that is got to be a major factor in why </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like shit.</v>

120
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:56.904
<v Speaker 1>And then the let down of this incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement becoming the heavyweight </v>

121
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:03.810
<v Speaker 1>champion of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beating this guy who hadn't been beat in</v>

122
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.460
<v Speaker 1>a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

123
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.420
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years,</v>

124
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.243
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just partying too hard and then getting </v>

125
00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:14.040
<v Speaker 1>into a horrible funk and deciding to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back.</v>

126
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.330
<v Speaker 2>So is that part of it where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

127
00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:18.164
<v Speaker 2>that you have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are those personalities and </v>

128
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.490
<v Speaker 2>there's genetics involved and he gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>you into the drugs,</v>

129
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.773
<v Speaker 2>but then the drugs start going to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>on your brain and then it becomes </v>

130
00:05:27.081 --> 00:05:27.914
<v Speaker 2>something different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes no longer your own </v>

131
00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:32.144
<v Speaker 2>consciousness that's working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this sponge that just absorbs all </v>

132
00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 2>of these toxins and who knows what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>misfiring,</v>

133
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.810
<v Speaker 2>what's happening at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We say that as we drink wine.</v>

134
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Happy holidays.</v>

135
00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for heroin in the holidays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever little fucking meth.</v>

136
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I was going to bring you some wine </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is good stuff.</v>

138
00:05:52.161 --> 00:05:54.050

<v Speaker 2>I don't know Jack Shit about one.</v>

139
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I learned a great method for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanksgiving wine.</v>

140
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 2>What's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to this place in la.</v>

141
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 2>It's called a 2020 wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this.</v>

142
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 2>It looks like right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the last dark.</v>

143
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:07.420
<v Speaker 2>It's on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the four.</v>

144
00:06:07.421 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you just walk in and just wine.</v>

145
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 2>This huge room racks and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so elegant.</v>

146
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 2>It's just like this great place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>

147
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.043
<v Speaker 2>It's like temperature wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's great and it's </v>

148
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:22.350
<v Speaker 2>intimidating because they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that much about wine I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

150
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.513
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realized this was my strategy and </v>

151
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:28.814
<v Speaker 2>it worked out perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the guy who works there and I </v>

152
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

153
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 2>I have 12 people coming over for </v>
<v Speaker 2>thanksgiving.</v>

154
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Show me a $20 bottle of wine or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I can buy a bunch of for my friends</v>

155
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 2>that's going to blow everyone away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he lit up like a Christmas tree.</v>

156
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what he wants to do.</v>

157
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.901
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

158
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 2>there's 200 bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar bottles of wine.</v>

159
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:54.674
<v Speaker 2>We know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to come with me and there it </v>

160
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:57.884
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he took me into the back and he </v>

161
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:01.094
<v Speaker 2>found these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

162
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.220
<v Speaker 2>this one's from Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$18.</v>

163
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.040
<v Speaker 2>No one knows it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best wine I've had all year,</v>

164
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.780
<v Speaker 2>another one and this Italian Barolo that</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows about it,</v>

165
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:11.623
<v Speaker 2>and look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only $12 a bottle because nobody </v>

166
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 2>knows we have an extra cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It became like his.</v>

167
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what a wine guy wants to do.</v>

168
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.023
<v Speaker 2>Turn you on.</v>

169
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Is the wine thing that a name is just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>important as how good it is?</v>

170
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

171
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Like when people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.950
<v Speaker 1>an opus one or a famous or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know that because that's like the</v>

173
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Mercedes of wines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cigars are like that as well.</v>

174
00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I know more about to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know much about cigars,</v>

175
00:07:36.241 --> 00:07:37.074
<v Speaker 1>but I know more about cigars that I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about wine and like everybody wants a </v>

176
00:07:39.341 --> 00:07:44.341
<v Speaker 1>Cuban cute Cohiba oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants something that's</v>

177
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.420
<v Speaker 2>hard to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

178
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.980
<v Speaker 2>But this was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

179
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how you should do it.</v>

180
00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:51.164
<v Speaker 2>Find a good wine shop and go to the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's waiting to be asked that question </v>

181
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 2>and he so excited to show you what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned and he works in a wine shop.</v>

182
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:01.400
<v Speaker 2>So he's not spending $500 for a bottle </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

183
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.413
<v Speaker 1>Me and my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Buddy Mark Telegraph and I were in </v>

184
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:05.414
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're eating this very nice time </v>

185
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:08.000
<v Speaker 1>restaurant with a bunch of people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC.</v>

186
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.640
<v Speaker 1>We just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get a nice bottle of wine.</v>

187
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:12.440
<v Speaker 1>You're have a nice bottle of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

188
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.393
<v Speaker 1>I've had good bottles of wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this place had like bought bottles </v>

189
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.400
<v Speaker 1>wine from the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

190
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.141
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

191
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>let's go fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought a bottle of wine from 1974.</v>

192
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is better.</v>

193
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.510
<v Speaker 1>This is better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one's better.</v>

194
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was weird.</v>

195
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.013
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you're a real connoisseur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like part of it is like Roberto Duran </v>

196
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:37.500
<v Speaker 1>was the champ when this will bottled </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and stuff about.</v>

197
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.870
<v Speaker 1>It was in the third grade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something Mrs Mcmillan.</v>

198
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.420
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it felt like it had less alcohol.</v>

199
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:48.640
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

200
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.873
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that maybe happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flavor sorts starts to morph and </v>

201
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just felt less</v>

202
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 3>potent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost more watered down.</v>

203
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed it,</v>

204
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

205
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.163
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

206
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Speaker 3>and you probably paid a lot for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a thousand dollars.</v>

207
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm not joking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

208
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.710
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a thousand dollar bottle </v>
<v Speaker 3>of wine.</v>

209
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this Thanksgiving we had it.</v>

210
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.260
<v Speaker 3>It was $18 bottles of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably way bigger.</v>

211
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.310
<v Speaker 3>Heads off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

212
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 3>probably way better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So great.</v>

213
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 3>They're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

214
00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:20.454
<v Speaker 3>I try and learn about them and there are</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain wines they say like there's </v>

215
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:23.604
<v Speaker 3>certain Brunellos that like those should</v>
<v Speaker 3>age and those you can go like 20 years </v>

216
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:28.104
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll get even better at 30 and then </v>

217
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:32.640
<v Speaker 3>there's other wines at that same amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>

218
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 3>They'll go sour and they'll get funky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's so hard to tell.</v>

219
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>APP that I have,</v>

220
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 3>I've never fucking opened at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I had downloaded it.</v>

221
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:42.523
<v Speaker 3>It's like Vino Vino,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we almost went down with that write on </v>

222
00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:47.130
<v Speaker 3>the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

223
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 3>it's got a power ballad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

224
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 3>Because that was headed towards the </v>
<v Speaker 3>board team.</v>

225
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not even drinking.</v>

226
00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:53.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't fuck with laptops in front of me</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

227
00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:57.030
<v Speaker 3>I've learned my lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing a show on Saturday.</v>

228
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:57.893
<v Speaker 3>My friend had a laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had a glass of water and a salad on </v>

229
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 3>the keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

230
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.320
<v Speaker 3>what are you having a gun in your baby's</v>
<v Speaker 3>head?</v>

231
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Rest your head on the gun separated now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this was,</v>

232
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:14.263
<v Speaker 3>this was such a great way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's so you can focus in on </v>

233

234

<v Speaker 3>would be a lot of studying to learn all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of wine and like go into a fancy </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

237
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things where you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

238
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 3>You really have to talk to someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting the time.</v>

239
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:36.930
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

240
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.711
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

241
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 3>my keys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's something that I know a lot about</v>

242
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.243
<v Speaker 3>pool cues,</v>

243
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot about pool,</v>

244
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.330
<v Speaker 1>so if you come to me and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

245
00:10:47.331 --> 00:10:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about buying this pool cue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of?</v>

246
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here's what you need to know.</v>

247
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:52.663
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very expensive pool cue and </v>

248
00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:55.004
<v Speaker 1>it's expensive because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>collector's item because the guy who </v>

249
00:10:56.481 --> 00:10:57.800
<v Speaker 1>makes it as dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

250
00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.693
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like how it plays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does not play any better than a pool </v>

251
00:11:01.101 --> 00:11:01.934
<v Speaker 1>cue that crossed one small fraction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that costs and then I could turn </v>

252
00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:10.121
<v Speaker 1>you onto a bunch of custom pool cue </v>
<v Speaker 1>makers that make a really good cue for a</v>

253
00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:11.724
<v Speaker 1>fraction of what you would pay for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cue and I'm telling you like you would </v>

254
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.730
<v Speaker 1>play with this queue and be happy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it for the rest of your life,</v>

255
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.040
<v Speaker 1>but it will cost you $500 as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's cues that are $15,000,</v>

256
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.380
<v Speaker 1>$20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and up.</v>

257
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a really ornate and beautiful</v>

258
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.063
<v Speaker 3>and this is a lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your adult lifetime of learning about </v>

259
00:11:30.501 --> 00:11:31.300
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man,</v>

260
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:31.980
<v Speaker 3>I've been immersed.</v>

261
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.980
<v Speaker 1>I started playing pool in 1990,</v>
<v Speaker 1>91.</v>

262
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 1>90,</v>
<v Speaker 1>91.</v>

263
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:39.450
<v Speaker 1>That's when I probably bought my first </v>
<v Speaker 1>pool cue.</v>

264
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.740
<v Speaker 3>What's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a good pool cue for bumper pool?</v>

265
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.473
<v Speaker 3>My neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my neighbors had a bumper pool table </v>

266
00:11:47.211 --> 00:11:49.130
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was bad ass.</v>

267
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.060
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So stupid and dumb game.</v>

268
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.753
<v Speaker 3>The</v>

269
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.743
<v Speaker 4>older brother Mark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was the dominant one because he was </v>

270
00:11:57.671 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 4>able to jump over the bumpers and get on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other side.</v>

271
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 4>Cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cheating.</v>

272
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.383
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The jumping is a very controversial </v>

273
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 4>thing in the world of pool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not allowed to jump.</v>

274
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.123
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can butt attack jumping and then </v>

275
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:13.060
<v Speaker 4>there's bar table jumping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

276
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:13.894
<v Speaker 4>Like when you play with people on a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think they're jumping in the pool </v>

277
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:16.923
<v Speaker 4>cue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what they're doing is they're </v>

278
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.490
<v Speaker 4>scooping under the cue ball with their </v>
<v Speaker 4>tip,</v>

279
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 4>like they go under it and it sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes the cue ball pop up in the air.</v>

280
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:26.110
<v Speaker 4>It's really like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

281
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.190
<v Speaker 4>Ms Dot cueings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

282
00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:28.024
<v Speaker 4>It's like the way you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>jump a ball has shoot down on it and </v>

283
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.930
<v Speaker 4>make it hop over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's imagine,</v>

284
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.200
<v Speaker 4>have you seen this before?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

285
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 4>that's an expense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a Mcdermott.</v>

286
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.913
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called the excalibur or some shit </v>

287
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:40.000
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

288
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.470
<v Speaker 4>That's a pool cue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit is,</v>

289
00:12:41.471 --> 00:12:43.900
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's foolish.</v>

290
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.320
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a sickle that the grim </v>
<v Speaker 4>reaper comes to do away with.</v>

291
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.293
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was a cute that was made a long </v>

292
00:12:49.931 --> 00:12:51.940
<v Speaker 4>time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was made back in the fucking nineties</v>

293
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:52.774
<v Speaker 4>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not the most expensive pool </v>

294
00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:55.150
<v Speaker 4>cue in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that whole thing?</v>

295
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:55.984
<v Speaker 4>The q says it sold for $150.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the most expensive shoe in </v>

296
00:12:58.631 --> 00:12:59.440
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

297
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.273
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The most expensive cue in the world is </v>

298
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.103
<v Speaker 4>Gina.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gina Q is actually right here in north </v>

299
00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:05.974
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

300
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.810
<v Speaker 4>they call it the most expensive in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

301
00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:08.890
<v Speaker 4>It's that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Queue.</v>

302
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.740

<v Speaker 4>That's not to stand in a queue seat.</v>

303
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.390
<v Speaker 4>It's a acute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that whole,</v>

304

306
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:19.330
<v Speaker 4>It's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nonsense.</v>

307
00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.790
<v Speaker 4>It's like having a car and you decided </v>
<v Speaker 4>to glue diamonds on it.</v>

308
00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking stupid with calling the </v>

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 4>His name is Ernie Cortez and he makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>all sorts.</v>

323
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:12.870
<v Speaker 4>I have one of his cues that's earning </v>
<v Speaker 4>right there.</v>

324
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.510
<v Speaker 4>Makes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he wasn't married to share.</v>

325
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.010

<v Speaker 4>that's Sonny Bono.</v>

326
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.630
<v Speaker 4>You're an asshole.</v>

327
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.590
<v Speaker 4>I got in this podcast now I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ernie is A.</v>

328
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's like a real innovator in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world of pool cues.</v>

329
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:28.200
<v Speaker 4>He makes beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful.</v>

330
00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.034
<v Speaker 4>That is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he had one that he made that was </v>

331
00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:33.220
<v Speaker 4>filled with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I thought,</v>

332
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say what the material </v>
<v Speaker 4>was by believing the handle.</v>

333
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.133
<v Speaker 4>The handle was made out of solid ivory </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm thinking it had a gold and all </v>

334
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:44.170
<v Speaker 4>sorts of other shit in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it went for half a million dollars.</v>

335
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.233
<v Speaker 4>It's worth a half million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think the deal is that he won't </v>

336
00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:49.340
<v Speaker 4>sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's very wealth.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're called CNC machines to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything together and piece it so that</v>

<v Speaker 1>But they're all like his designs and </v>

349
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.310
<v Speaker 1>that like three d printing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

350
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.211
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

351
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:21.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what it is,</v>

352
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:26.030
<v Speaker 1>is like you have a design and you put it</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this computer and you put the spa,</v>

353
00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on 100 percent of the process,</v>

354
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:29.774
<v Speaker 1>but you put your specifications like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>wide you want in lays to be and they </v>

355
00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:41.351
<v Speaker 1>make them exactly the same size and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>points fit exactly the same way.</v>

356
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

357
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all super complicated stuff.</v>

358
00:15:44.571 --> 00:15:45.404
<v Speaker 1>But the point is like if you were a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who wanted to buy a pool cue and you </v>

359
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:51.080

398
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:45.074
<v Speaker 1>make it more expensive than they'll use </v>
<v Speaker 1>it unless you give them subsidies for </v>

<v Speaker 1>electric cars.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Scroll back to where it was a the price </v>

404
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:04.260
<v Speaker 4>of fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

405
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.180
<v Speaker 4>Thirty cents a gallon.</v>

<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

408
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.233
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that.</v>

409
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:14.934
<v Speaker 4>backs and they drive you to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Bush was leaving office and they </v>

410
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:22.830
<v Speaker 4>jacked the fucking price of gas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Way Up Dude.</v>

411
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.050
<v Speaker 4>But there's people that were panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

412
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.750
<v Speaker 4>September 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like lines everywhere because we</v>

413
00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:28.280
<v Speaker 4>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ryan,</v>

414
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.113
<v Speaker 4>I just empty the price.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't I don't think the price rattling </v>

415
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:34.853
<v Speaker 4>you went up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some places were charge like 25 bucks a </v>

416
00:18:37.111 --> 00:18:40.950
<v Speaker 4>gallon they should go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>

417
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.980
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of insane that people used </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have riots like that when,</v>

418
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.860
<v Speaker 4>when we would spike and people couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat this,</v>

419
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.680
<v Speaker 4>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's a shitty little car.</v>

421
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.013
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I probably wanted to lie that empire </v>

422
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.940
<v Speaker 4>finally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not even part of the protests.</v>

423
00:18:56.941 --> 00:19:01.941
<v Speaker 4>He's just talking to me about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody was telling me about this.</v>

424
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.550
<v Speaker 4>I was at a little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pardon me.</v>

425
00:19:03.551 --> 00:19:07.530
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to one of the dads and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was telling me about this,</v>

426
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that happened,</v>

427
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.620
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was in northern California.</v>

428
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.900
<v Speaker 4>It was a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking might not have been.</v>

429
00:19:15.901 --> 00:19:18.890
<v Speaker 4>Northern California was a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

430
00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 4>initially they thought it was just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fire,</v>

431
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:27.740
<v Speaker 4>but then the CEO and his vice president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're both of their houses caught fire.</v>

432
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.063
<v Speaker 4>So then they thought it was like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>attack on both people and then they </v>

433
00:19:35.161 --> 00:19:35.994
<v Speaker 4>realized no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a murder and one of the guys </v>

434
00:19:37.651 --> 00:19:42.630
<v Speaker 4>killed the guy and his family and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>lit his house on fire and then went back</v>

435
00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:43.464
<v Speaker 4>to his house and lit his own house on </v>
<v Speaker 4>fire to make it look like they were </v>

436
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:46.620
<v Speaker 4>going after.</v>

437
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.650
<v Speaker 4>Both of them and he's the only one that </v>
<v Speaker 4>survived.</v>

438
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Set the house on fire on fire.</v>

507
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Then lit his own house on fire to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it look like he was being targeted.</v>

508
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know his.</v>

00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 1>He had kids in his wife and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughters were inside.</v>

510
00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:51.243
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To try to make it look as if his whole </v>

511

<v Speaker 1>is being targeted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His brother and him.</v>

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.790

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.260
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

<v Speaker 1>AM,</v>

520
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:17.853
<v Speaker 1>Paul.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Unfolded.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Striking Keith fucking when you got mad </v>

00:23:35.471 --> 00:23:37.180

<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>

527
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel like you could kill me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

528
00:23:38.891 --> 00:23:41.440
<v Speaker 1>not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need more.</v>

529
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Need more than Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He walked inside,</v>

530
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 1>found his wife's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found Keith's wife Jennifer.</v>

531
00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:52.220
<v Speaker 1>He shot and stabbed her and then stabbed</v>
<v Speaker 1>their children.</v>

532
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Jesse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eleven and Sophia eight.</v>

533
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:55.603
<v Speaker 1>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he took some documents instead of </v>

534
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 1>fire in the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were they doing?</v>

535
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Like the fucking stabbed an eight year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old dude,</v>

536
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:05.443
<v Speaker 1>an eight year old girl in her sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to how to fuck to someone it would </v>

537
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:12.920
<v Speaker 1>say in her sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

538
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:13.820
<v Speaker 1>it was 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM.</v>

539
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

540
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.020
<v Speaker 1>There's gunshots in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids had gotten up.</v>

541
00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good Lord.</v>

542
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.840
<v Speaker 1>What a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A monster.</v>

543
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.913
<v Speaker 1>What was this guy like the month before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the hell is that normal </v>

544
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:29.384
<v Speaker 1>looking house shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the normalist looking normal </v>

545
00:24:31.491 --> 00:24:32.324
<v Speaker 1>house ever.</v>

546
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:33.633
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe that there isn't always a</v>
<v Speaker 2>presence of good and evil in the world </v>

547
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.540
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just evil deeds.</v>

548
00:24:43.541 --> 00:24:44.374
<v Speaker 2>What this guy did was evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you believe that there is a real </v>

549
00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.213
<v Speaker 2>presence of evil?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it's like a thing that takes over </v>

550
00:24:56.471 --> 00:24:58.390
<v Speaker 2>people or takes over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

551
00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

552
00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like good and evil.</v>

553
00:25:01.181 --> 00:25:05.830
<v Speaker 2>Is that more than just people's actions </v>
<v Speaker 2>or is it like a force of nature?</v>

554
00:25:05.831 --> 00:25:06.664
<v Speaker 2>Is there a good force of nature and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil force of nature that is constantly </v>

555
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.890
<v Speaker 2>using people and using things as as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>catalyst or as a</v>

556
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.120
<v Speaker 1>okay instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's break this down.</v>

557
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:17.983
<v Speaker 1>I don't think nature's the right way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach it because I don't think </v>

558
00:25:19.611 --> 00:25:20.444
<v Speaker 1>there's good or evil in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think nature nature is actually far </v>

559
00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:28.340
<v Speaker 1>more moral than humans are because </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature is just about survival.</v>

560
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Predators and prey and they kill things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and eat things,</v>

561
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:33.223
<v Speaker 1>but when animals in nature kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with the called surplus killings </v>

562
00:25:37.011 --> 00:25:40.400
<v Speaker 1>were wolves will kill like 18 elk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not not eat them.</v>

563
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.190
<v Speaker 1>They're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just going on their instincts.</v>

564
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.430
<v Speaker 1>These things are there to be killed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can get them because they can't run</v>

565
00:25:46.431 --> 00:25:47.264
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's fixed now or something like </v>

566
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:49.430
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they just can't help it.</v>

567
00:25:49.431 --> 00:25:54.431
<v Speaker 1>They just tear them apart because their </v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts are drive them to kill because</v>

568
00:25:54.471 --> 00:25:56.960
<v Speaker 1>that's how they survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's other family survives.</v>

569
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:58.063
<v Speaker 1>They're killing and eating these elk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just what they do and even if </v>

570
00:26:01.281 --> 00:26:03.290
<v Speaker 1>they kill a bunch of them where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't eat them,</v>

571
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.900
<v Speaker 1>their instinct is to kill because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they survive.</v>

572
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:10.170
<v Speaker 1>It's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's normal with humans will.</v>

573
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It's very different because with humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's consequences,</v>

574
00:26:13.851 --> 00:26:16.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's law and there's other humans</v>

575
00:26:16.611 --> 00:26:19.690
<v Speaker 1>finding out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's deception and then there's,</v>

576
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.823
<v Speaker 1>there's selfishness and there's the fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>of getting caught and then there's your </v>

577
00:26:25.221 --> 00:26:28.910
<v Speaker 1>own your own survival instincts in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>

578
00:26:28.911 --> 00:26:29.744
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to get locked up in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to get caught for </v>

579
00:26:31.701 --> 00:26:32.534
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think if I had a guess that this </v>

580
00:26:35.481 --> 00:26:36.314
<v Speaker 1>guy didn't think he was going to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's wife and family probably </v>

581
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:39.950
<v Speaker 1>didn't even think he was going to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>

582
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.720
<v Speaker 1>They probably got into a heated argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

583
00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.900
<v Speaker 1>they're stupid and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

584
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.110
<v Speaker 1>he's a Guinea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

585
00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.240
<v Speaker 1>that's my people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do stupid.</v>

586
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Your people to Ganny era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do stupid shit.</v>

587
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:51.661
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

588
00:26:51.661 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 1>they're fiery people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those,</v>

589
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.473
<v Speaker 1>those fiery people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swore off Italian girls when I was 21 </v>

590
00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Italian girl.</v>

591
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Take a swing at me when I was 21,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

592
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.280
<v Speaker 1>that's it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

593
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.553
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hitting one back to fucking </v>

594
00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:10.160
<v Speaker 1>cookie sum some look at some men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some women are fucking crazy and I,</v>

595
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I believe in epigenetics and I see our </v>
<v Speaker 1>wacky.</v>

596
00:27:13.141 --> 00:27:15.860
<v Speaker 1>My fucking own kids are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's epogen genetics?</v>

597
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Epigenetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Willis.</v>

598
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Let's Google it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't bust up the,</v>

599
00:27:19.911 --> 00:27:21.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual definition,</v>

600
00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:22.104
<v Speaker 1>but essentially it's a bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way I'm using it is that there's </v>

601
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:28.890
<v Speaker 1>certain traits that are not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental traits,</v>

602
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.890
<v Speaker 1>they're inherited traits and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear it,</v>

603
00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:32.760
<v Speaker 1>we'll pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

604
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.953
<v Speaker 1>The study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the changes in organisms caused by the </v>

605
00:27:35.251 --> 00:27:36.084
<v Speaker 1>modification of gene expression rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the alteration of the genetic code </v>

606
00:27:39.601 --> 00:27:40.434
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This better was better words in that </v>

607
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.900
<v Speaker 1>there's better a better definition than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

608
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.740
<v Speaker 1>The study of heritable changes in gene </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>

609
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.160
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Active versus inactive genes that do not</v>

610
00:27:53.161 --> 00:27:55.740
<v Speaker 1>involve changes to the underlying DNA </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence.</v>

611
00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.920
<v Speaker 1>A change in the phenotype without a </v>
<v Speaker 1>change in the Geno type,</v>

612
00:27:58.921 --> 00:28:03.180
<v Speaker 1>which in turn affects how cells read the</v>
<v Speaker 1>jeans a great.</v>

613
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Now I know less about it.</v>

614
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 1>I think there's traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

615
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.310
<v Speaker 1>this is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

616
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.450
<v Speaker 1>this is a very controversial yet I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

617
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.300
<v Speaker 1>a fascinating field of study because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is they're,</v>

618
00:28:19.301 --> 00:28:24.301
<v Speaker 1>they're finding out that children that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are twins that are separated by,</v>

619
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:26.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're babies,</v>

620
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.360
<v Speaker 1>they go into different foster homes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're raised by different families,</v>

621
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:35.510
<v Speaker 1>have incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkably similar characteristics.</v>

622
00:28:35.821 --> 00:28:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loves and desires,</v>

623
00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:44.220
<v Speaker 1>like what they're interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly simple and they're suspecting</v>

624
00:28:44.221 --> 00:28:46.610
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

625
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.140
<v Speaker 1>we are a combination of nature and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nurture.</v>

626
00:28:49.141 --> 00:28:54.141
<v Speaker 1>I think that's safe to say and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there you certainly a lot of things</v>

627
00:28:54.991 --> 00:28:59.040
<v Speaker 1>happen to kids when they're young that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaped their life,</v>

628
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.903
<v Speaker 1>whether it's physical or sexual abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's exposure to violence or </v>

629
00:29:02.611 --> 00:29:06.990
<v Speaker 1>whether it's positive things like love </v>
<v Speaker 1>and encouragement and inspiration,</v>

630
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.393
<v Speaker 1>but there's certain information I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's transferred from the parent to </v>

631
00:29:12.631 --> 00:29:15.670
<v Speaker 1>the child while the child is in the womb</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when,</v>

632
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.730
<v Speaker 1>during,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the conception of the child.</v>

633
00:29:17.731 --> 00:29:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I think there's traits that come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the father and traits that come from the</v>

634
00:29:20.671 --> 00:29:22.050
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Biological,</v>

635
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.943
<v Speaker 1>biologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is undeniable across </v>

636
00:29:24.511 --> 00:29:27.870
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is why dogs like my dog</v>

637
00:29:27.871 --> 00:29:31.680
<v Speaker 1>has no fucking idea who his parents are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't give a shit.</v>

638
00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.440
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not looking for.</v>

639
00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Is that on 23 dot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

640
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I grabbed that leash and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we run into there and his.</v>

641
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.420
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay Movie?</v>

642
00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.440
<v Speaker 3>Watched it yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The three identical strangers.</v>

643
00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>

644
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:51.070
<v Speaker 3>but it's about this exact thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

645
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.193
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

646
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.193
<v Speaker 3>did you watch it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've started to like watch the trailers </v>

647
00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:55.654
<v Speaker 3>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a good waiter to come on </v>

648
00:29:57.821 --> 00:29:59.310
<v Speaker 3>Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on Netflix.</v>

649
00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your dog's not like wonder what my dad's</v>

650
00:30:02.201 --> 00:30:04.000
<v Speaker 3>doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did he leave me?</v>

651
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:04.953
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

652
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopes gathering in the woods.</v>

653
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got certain instincts,</v>

654
00:30:10.151 --> 00:30:12.090
<v Speaker 1>like you lifts up his leg to Piss on </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

655
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.490
<v Speaker 1>smells things like the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he chases squirrels.</v>

656
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's things that are in.</v>

657
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.250
<v Speaker 1>He's a retriever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

658
00:30:18.251 --> 00:30:20.230
<v Speaker 1>He's a golden retriever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he brings things back.</v>

659
00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I had pit bulls before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll bring things back,</v>

660
00:30:24.161 --> 00:30:26.630
<v Speaker 1>you got to teach them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to bring things back and</v>

661
00:30:26.631 --> 00:30:27.464
<v Speaker 1>they definitely don't want to let go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they want to do is play tug of war </v>

662
00:30:29.351 --> 00:30:30.184
<v Speaker 1>with shit like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he lets things go and it's natural </v>

663
00:30:32.501 --> 00:30:33.610
<v Speaker 1>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That soft mouth.</v>

664
00:30:33.611 --> 00:30:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a black lab.</v>

665
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:36.463
<v Speaker 1>Does the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hold things gently because they're </v>

666
00:30:38.111 --> 00:30:41.620
<v Speaker 1>used to retrieving ducks and animal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pheasants that people shoot.</v>

667
00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:43.030
<v Speaker 1>That's what they were raised for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

668
00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.250
<v Speaker 1>So he brings things back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I get him up in the morning,</v>

669
00:30:45.251 --> 00:30:46.084
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stays in this little room and when I </v>

670
00:30:48.491 --> 00:30:51.700
<v Speaker 1>get up in the morning at seven to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids to school and all that stuff,</v>

671
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.760
<v Speaker 1>when I open up the door he whines like </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

672
00:30:54.761 --> 00:30:56.140
<v Speaker 1>He gets crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wags his tail.</v>

673
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.710
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the first thing he does is pick up a</v>

674
00:30:59.711 --> 00:31:00.544
<v Speaker 1>toy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He picks up stuff to him when it comes </v>

675
00:31:02.171 --> 00:31:03.910
<v Speaker 1>to me with a stuffed animal in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

676
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Like this</v>

677
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.650
<v Speaker 3>is not something that we taught him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is something.</v>

678
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.980
<v Speaker 3>And Golden retrievers all around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world doing the same exact thing.</v>

679
00:31:10.981 --> 00:31:11.950
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All around the world.</v>

680
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.500
<v Speaker 3>All around the same exact thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's certain traits.</v>

681
00:31:14.501 --> 00:31:15.334
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

682
00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:18.750
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that Italians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

683
00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:20.660
<v Speaker 1>my people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my people.</v>

684
00:31:20.661 --> 00:31:22.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying this about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

685
00:31:22.071 --> 00:31:23.660
<v Speaker 1>And Yours too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm mostly Italian.</v>

686
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.590
<v Speaker 1>They're savage folk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a fact,</v>

687
00:31:27.591 --> 00:31:28.760
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a fact.</v>

688
00:31:28.761 --> 00:31:30.020
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a streak,</v>

689
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.090
<v Speaker 1>a streak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to the Romans.</v>

690
00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely 100 percent believe that.</v>

691
00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:36.723
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are certain civilizations </v>

692
00:31:38.241 --> 00:31:40.640
<v Speaker 1>that have a longer history of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized and,</v>

693
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:44.270
<v Speaker 1>and less violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think when you are,</v>

694
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.273
<v Speaker 1>were you dealing with folks that have in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real history of violence in their </v>

695
00:31:51.531 --> 00:31:52.364
<v Speaker 1>culture and that this translates </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation to generation and transfers </v>

696
00:31:56.871 --> 00:32:00.860
<v Speaker 1>down to the children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this guy is part of that.</v>

697
00:32:00.861 --> 00:32:01.694
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a coincidence that the Italian </v>

698
00:32:04.551 --> 00:32:06.080
<v Speaker 1>mob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so ruthlessly brutal.</v>

699
00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:07.800
<v Speaker 1>What did the Russian mob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

700
00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.230
<v Speaker 3>sleep brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me,</v>

701
00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.050
<v Speaker 3>know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely that part of it.</v>

702
00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.370
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the other part of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

703
00:32:13.371 --> 00:32:14.660
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

704
00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:16.123
<v Speaker 3>there's the nurture part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what was going on in this </v>

705
00:32:19.551 --> 00:32:21.220
<v Speaker 3>guy's life that you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

706
00:32:21.221 --> 00:32:24.410
<v Speaker 3>so here we have two Italian brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

707
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:25.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Raised the same way.</v>

708
00:32:25.791 --> 00:32:27.840
<v Speaker 3>Italian hot streak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those things together.</v>

709
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.670
<v Speaker 3>One brother decided to burn the house </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and slow to the family.</v>

710
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.673
<v Speaker 3>The other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an Italian guy didn't have that in his </v>

711
00:32:34.401 --> 00:32:35.020
<v Speaker 3>to do list,</v>

712
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:39.470
<v Speaker 1>but not necessarily because I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they planned it out or if he did just</v>

713
00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:40.270
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

714
00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:43.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean he had a knife on him and a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's one of those crazy asshole</v>

715
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.660
<v Speaker 4>that brought a knife and a gun </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>

716
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:45.883
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they were in business together and </v>

717
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:49.574
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in business together and it's </v>

718
00:32:50.231 --> 00:32:51.064
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get crazy and they get real </v>

719
00:32:51.891 --> 00:32:52.724
<v Speaker 4>resentful and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think one person's not doing their </v>

720
00:32:54.951 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 4>fair share.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One person fucks up a deal or one person</v>

721
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.800
<v Speaker 4>costing them money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now who knows?</v>

722
00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:03.790
<v Speaker 4>But how the fuck did he kill each other?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's no.</v>

723
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:04.633
<v Speaker 4>I have a baby man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you stab an eight year old </v>

724
00:33:06.111 --> 00:33:06.711
<v Speaker 4>daughter?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

725
00:33:06.711 --> 00:33:08.590
<v Speaker 4>you take it in your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

726
00:33:08.591 --> 00:33:11.230
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the Italians also like wine,</v>

727
00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:12.123
<v Speaker 4>more wine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please soon as drunk give you one of </v>

728
00:33:15.691 --> 00:33:19.920
<v Speaker 4>these zero percent alcohol Heineken's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's supposed to be the most delicious.</v>

729
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.780
<v Speaker 4>I've never had it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we'll try one of these.</v>

730
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.000
<v Speaker 4>I supposed to be the most delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nonalcoholic beer.</v>

731
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.980
<v Speaker 4>Not recommended.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said that if you want to try,</v>

732
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.140
<v Speaker 4>I'll try nonalcoholic beer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't suck.</v>

733
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.020
<v Speaker 4>Get this a Heineken zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zero.</v>

734
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:36.540
<v Speaker 4>So Heineken's zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zero.</v>

735
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:37.620
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to be the shit.</v>

736
00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.173
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

737
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:46.370
<v Speaker 4>Tastes like Heineken does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's literally no difference.</v>

738
00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:49.260
<v Speaker 4>Pretty damn good for nonalcoholic beer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't have that weird.</v>

739
00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm lying to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Funk to it.</v>

740
00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:53.913
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have that a weird after </v>

741
00:33:55.091 --> 00:33:56.740
<v Speaker 4>taste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I was a junkie,</v>

742
00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:01.600
<v Speaker 4>I would not want to try great opiate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Free heroin.</v>

743
00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:07.670
<v Speaker 4>It tastes just like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just seems like it'd be a smart move,</v>

744
00:34:08.791 --> 00:34:12.060
<v Speaker 4>but alcoholics will drink nonalcoholic </v>
<v Speaker 4>beer.</v>

745
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:15.780
<v Speaker 4>Walk into a liquor store by this non </v>
<v Speaker 4>alcoholic guy.</v>

746
00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:19.500
<v Speaker 4>But you literally at the gate of Hell </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

747
00:34:19.501 --> 00:34:20.334
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fucking demons are reached and </v>

748
00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:24.261
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

749
00:34:24.261 --> 00:34:24.601
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

750
00:34:24.601 --> 00:34:25.434
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

751
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:31.140
<v Speaker 4>Zero zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me just test myself or clean or cool</v>

752
00:34:31.141 --> 00:34:34.770
<v Speaker 4>with taking cbd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like is that a good question?</v>

753
00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the marijuana thing is different because</v>

754
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.240
<v Speaker 4>I think for the vast majority of human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings,</v>

755
00:34:39.241 --> 00:34:41.100
<v Speaker 4>obviously there's a lot of biological </v>
<v Speaker 4>diversity,</v>

756
00:34:41.101 --> 00:34:44.040
<v Speaker 4>but for the vast majority of human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings,</v>

757
00:34:44.041 --> 00:34:46.500
<v Speaker 4>I do not think that marijuana is </v>
<v Speaker 4>physically addictive.</v>

758
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.500
<v Speaker 4>I think it's entirely possible that for </v>
<v Speaker 4>some people it is,</v>

759
00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:53.790
<v Speaker 4>but I think for the vast majority of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people it is not physically addictive.</v>

760
00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:56.580
<v Speaker 4>It's more psychologically addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's a different thing.</v>

761
00:34:56.581 --> 00:34:58.830
<v Speaker 4>So if they're taking cbd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're.</v>

762
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean it depends on how they're taking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they're rolling up a CBD joint,</v>

763
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.970
<v Speaker 4>CBD,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a little extra,</v>

764
00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:06.843
<v Speaker 4>do they do that for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but doesn't some cbd have a little bit </v>

765
00:35:11.011 --> 00:35:13.110
<v Speaker 4>of thc to go with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of it.</v>

766
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.393
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this shed has the tiniest amount of </v>

767
00:35:16.261 --> 00:35:18.480
<v Speaker 4>alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his alcohol free,</v>

768
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.420
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's like what are the </v>
<v Speaker 4>calories?</v>

769
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.670
<v Speaker 4>Zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>zero point zero,</v>

770
00:35:23.671 --> 00:35:27.720
<v Speaker 4>four alcohol free beer with natural </v>
<v Speaker 4>flavoring.</v>

771
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:28.583
<v Speaker 4>Do you know a Heineken's one of the few </v>
<v Speaker 4>beers that you can drink if you are a </v>

772
00:35:31.441 --> 00:35:33.360
<v Speaker 4>celiac?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does not.</v>

773
00:35:33.361 --> 00:35:35.730
<v Speaker 4>Have wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a wheat based beer,</v>

774
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.270
<v Speaker 4>so if you're gluten you can drink </v>
<v Speaker 4>heineken,</v>

775
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:41.040
<v Speaker 4>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe not if you're Celiac,</v>

776
00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.250
<v Speaker 4>but definitely if you're gluten free,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not bad.</v>

777
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

778
00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 4>That's not bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not bad,</v>

779
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.730
<v Speaker 4>but calories of standard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Half the calories of a standard beer.</v>

780
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 4>So those other calories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just pure alcohol I guess.</v>

781
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:55.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

782
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.720
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

783
00:35:57.721 --> 00:36:01.470
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's one episode of the Opiod,</v>

784
00:36:01.471 --> 00:36:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember this.</v>

785
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:07.170
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot about this.</v>

786
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:11.280
<v Speaker 4>We gave this gal who she had this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

787
00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.440
<v Speaker 4>I think it was her name was stocker </v>
<v Speaker 4>patty.</v>

788
00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.720
<v Speaker 4>I think that was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember we gave this crazy.</v>

789
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:20.090
<v Speaker 4>You know how radio shows have these </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulars that always come to the studio?</v>

790
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.033
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

791
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.110
<v Speaker 4>Well they gave this one gal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a breath strip,</v>

792
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:30.140
<v Speaker 4>like a standard listerine breast trip </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this was back in the day when I used</v>

793
00:36:31.381 --> 00:36:36.381
<v Speaker 4>to get pot breath strips that would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would fuck you up so hard.</v>

794
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.183
<v Speaker 4>I remember I gave a half a one to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Thompson girl and we flew to Florida do </v>

795
00:36:40.591 --> 00:36:42.870
<v Speaker 4>gigs together and by the time we landed </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

796
00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:43.704
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to tell you something I almost </v>

797
00:36:44.671 --> 00:36:45.180
<v Speaker 4>didn't make.</v>

798
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.510
<v Speaker 4>It was almost telling these people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>turn this flight around.</v>

799
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:53.040
<v Speaker 4>Started freaking out half of a breast </v>
<v Speaker 4>job.</v>

800
00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:55.740
<v Speaker 4>We'll put you in an alternative </v>
<v Speaker 4>dimension.</v>

801
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:56.603
<v Speaker 4>It was so strong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we gave this gal a regular breast </v>

802
00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:02.160
<v Speaker 4>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a video of it online.</v>

803
00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.210
<v Speaker 4>It's like an hour long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't vet had no.</v>

804
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:07.783
<v Speaker 4>I had no wheat and no red.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gave her this breath strip and then he </v>

805
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:16.360
<v Speaker 4>proceeded to like to talk to her and she</v>
<v Speaker 4>was talking about hi.</v>

806
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.110
<v Speaker 4>She was and she's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She couldn't go anywhere,</v>

807
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:23.040
<v Speaker 4>but we all knew that she was sober.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was.</v>

808
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.870
<v Speaker 4>When you're a person who's like a whack </v>
<v Speaker 4>pack or from this high,</v>

809
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.840
<v Speaker 4>there's something is an issue that's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>being resolved.</v>

810
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:31.723
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes it hard to listen to frankly </v>

811
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:38.040
<v Speaker 4>is not a widow and actualized human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

812
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.240
<v Speaker 4>That would be the table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not an actualized human being.</v>

813
00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.760
<v Speaker 4>Someone who's got their shit together </v>
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>

814
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.673
<v Speaker 4>they're reading self help books and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking getting up at five and doing </v>

815
00:37:46.081 --> 00:37:46.820
<v Speaker 4>yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

816
00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:47.510
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

817
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.250
<v Speaker 4>It just trying to get through the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're barely getting through.</v>

818
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.550
<v Speaker 4>I found this thing that makes them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That they cling to.</v>

819
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:57.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those characteristics are fascinating to</v>

820
00:37:57.391 --> 00:37:59.700
<v Speaker 4>me because you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you find them in other things.</v>

821
00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:00.873
<v Speaker 4>Would you be those characteristics of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people that find something to </v>

822
00:38:04.201 --> 00:38:07.620
<v Speaker 4>belong to and then they become a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They become a part of that thing.</v>

823
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:10.530
<v Speaker 4>You would find those people at pool </v>
<v Speaker 4>halls.</v>

824
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.900
<v Speaker 4>You'll find those people at martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 4>places.</v>

825
00:38:12.901 --> 00:38:14.880
<v Speaker 4>You find those people that hang out at </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy clubs.</v>

826
00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.660
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're a little off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they find a thing.</v>

827
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:19.523
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That becomes the thing that they do all </v>

828
00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:23.760
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if they're not like the comedian,</v>

829
00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:27.870
<v Speaker 4>they'll hang out at the comedy so we </v>
<v Speaker 4>know those folks for sure,</v>

830
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:29.460
<v Speaker 4>and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally get it.</v>

831
00:38:29.461 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's community.</v>

832
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:32.220
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just wanting to belong somewhere.</v>

833
00:38:32.221 --> 00:38:33.054
<v Speaker 4>We all want that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just that's where I go and I know those </v>

834
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 4>faces</v>

835
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.560
<v Speaker 2>and they know me and maybe I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally a part of it,</v>

836
00:38:38.561 --> 00:38:42.800
<v Speaker 2>but I can go to the pool hall and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like I went,</v>

837
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:43.870
<v Speaker 2>I was wanted</v>

838
00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:44.923
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pool hall was a perfect place for </v>

839
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:50.800
<v Speaker 1>that because it was a hangout like a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people weren't playing,</v>

840
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.800
<v Speaker 1>so if you had like three or four tables </v>
<v Speaker 1>going there,</v>

841
00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:58.930
<v Speaker 1>so three or four tables would be like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>six or eight people playing pool,</v>

842
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.050
<v Speaker 1>but there might also be five or six </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just hanging out.</v>

843
00:39:02.051 --> 00:39:02.884
<v Speaker 1>Maybe playing cards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe be just buying coffee and maybe </v>

844
00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:08.200
<v Speaker 1>ordering a sandwich or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and just sitting there eating.</v>

845
00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:11.570
<v Speaker 2>It's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading a whole article about that</v>

846
00:39:11.571 --> 00:39:12.404
<v Speaker 2>by David Brooks the other day and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that that's economically we're </v>

847
00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:21.260
<v Speaker 2>richer than we've ever been as a country</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even in the last couple of years,</v>

848
00:39:21.261 --> 00:39:22.094
<v Speaker 2>like poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everyone's standard of living has </v>

849
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:27.530
<v Speaker 2>gone up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I wasn't really clear on.</v>

850
00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:29.810
<v Speaker 2>I thought that only the rich people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

851
00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.673
<v Speaker 2>We're were getting Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody was kind of being lifted </v>

852
00:39:34.101 --> 00:39:36.650
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're unhappier than ever before and</v>

853
00:39:36.651 --> 00:39:37.484
<v Speaker 2>the life expectancy is lower than ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>before and we're killing ourselves at </v>

854
00:39:39.921 --> 00:39:44.450
<v Speaker 2>rates that are higher than ever before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was saying that it's that lack of</v>

855
00:39:44.451 --> 00:39:47.960
<v Speaker 2>community that we don't go to church </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

856
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:52.990
<v Speaker 2>We don't belong to those things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave us meaning everyday in our town and</v>

857
00:39:53.271 --> 00:39:56.350
<v Speaker 2>used to go to church and you'd go to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pool hall.</v>

858
00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:57.203
<v Speaker 2>You go to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need that sense of belonging and </v>

859
00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.313
<v Speaker 2>work is a big part of it and people now </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in this gig economy and they're </v>

860
00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.830
<v Speaker 2>working uber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're working seamless,</v>

861
00:40:06.831 --> 00:40:08.420
<v Speaker 2>they're doing different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're isolated,</v>

862
00:40:08.421 --> 00:40:11.510
<v Speaker 2>they're by themselves and I'm working </v>
<v Speaker 2>with other people and it's.</v>

863
00:40:11.511 --> 00:40:12.344
<v Speaker 2>He really believes that it's that lack </v>
<v Speaker 2>of community and that lack of </v>

864
00:40:15.681 --> 00:40:19.220
<v Speaker 2>institutions is why we're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very unhappy as a,</v>

865
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:20.330
<v Speaker 2>as a country right now.</v>

866
00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.600
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense to me as a person who's a</v>

867
00:40:23.601 --> 00:40:27.230
<v Speaker 1>part of a vital community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a comedian.</v>

868
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:28.463
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to Jeff Ross was here the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day with Dave attell and one of </v>

869
00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:32.000
<v Speaker 1>the things that he said that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>struck with me,</v>

870
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.133
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost feel like I'm a comedian more </v>

871
00:40:34.491 --> 00:40:37.190
<v Speaker 1>than I'm an American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I going to comedian first?</v>

872
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.320
<v Speaker 1>American second?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

873
00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:40.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

874
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.673
<v Speaker 1>if you were at the airport and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run into Dave attell or whoever it </v>

875
00:40:45.531 --> 00:40:46.370
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

876
00:40:46.371 --> 00:40:50.720
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's a light upon them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes down from heaven.</v>

877
00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

878
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.020
<v Speaker 2>just embrace them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I always,</v>

879
00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:59.350
<v Speaker 2>I would always get suspicious of comics </v>
<v Speaker 2>who didn't embrace me.</v>

880
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Like as soon as you home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was like,</v>

881
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.140
<v Speaker 2>there's something weird with it.</v>

882
00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:03.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like horror comics that don't </v>

883
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.700
<v Speaker 1>have any comic friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

884
00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.613
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking real strange and they're always </v>

885
00:41:10.371 --> 00:41:11.500
<v Speaker 1>super selfish.</v>

886
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.191
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

887
00:41:12.191 --> 00:41:13.024
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even figure out exactly what it </v>

888
00:41:14.771 --> 00:41:15.604
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just like,</v>

889
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.080
<v Speaker 2>I know that's not one of the good ones.</v>

890
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:18.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if someone's like a </v>

891
00:41:18.601 --> 00:41:19.434
<v Speaker 1>successful comedian that's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have the opportunity to hang </v>

892
00:41:21.931 --> 00:41:23.720
<v Speaker 1>out with some of the most fun people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

893
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.700
<v Speaker 1>You're a peer of theirs and you give </v>
<v Speaker 1>them a pass.</v>

894
00:41:26.701 --> 00:41:27.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

895
00:41:27.961 --> 00:41:28.620
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

896
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:29.453
<v Speaker 2>I did this gig in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Colorado once and just by chance it </v>

897
00:41:33.351 --> 00:41:34.184
<v Speaker 2>was like this corporate thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was another comic on the bill </v>

898
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:37.430
<v Speaker 2>who I won't mention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

899
00:41:37.431 --> 00:41:38.001
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

900
00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:38.834
<v Speaker 2>We're in the middle of like nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at least there's another comedian </v>

901
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:44.060
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did his set split.</v>

902
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Didn't talk to me just like there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

903
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

904
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.460
<v Speaker 2>your dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

905
00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.151
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's play.</v>

906
00:41:50.151 --> 00:41:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Let's just split.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

907
00:41:53.351 --> 00:41:55.150
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy's weird that guys,</v>

908
00:41:55.151 --> 00:41:57.470
<v Speaker 2>there's something and I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

909
00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.310
<v Speaker 1>It's common now than it was back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

910
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:03.510
<v Speaker 1>And this was another thing that I talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about with the,</v>

911
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.410
<v Speaker 1>with jeff and Dave as we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about comradery,</v>

912
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.040
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

913
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.330
<v Speaker 1>there's less competition now than there </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever was before.</v>

914
00:42:11.331 --> 00:42:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Because before there was only a limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of tonight's show slots.</v>

915
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.810
<v Speaker 1>There was a limited number of sitcoms it</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be on.</v>

916
00:42:17.811 --> 00:42:20.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's what everybody wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wanted their own Sitcom.</v>

917
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to be on the tonight </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

918
00:42:22.521 --> 00:42:23.354
<v Speaker 1>And there are very few of those very few</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody was competing for these </v>

919
00:42:26.061 --> 00:42:29.530
<v Speaker 1>very limited slots and there's very few </v>
<v Speaker 1>hbo specials there was,</v>

920
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.413
<v Speaker 1>was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't a lot and there was a lot </v>

921
00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.120
<v Speaker 1>of us and so it led to a lot of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>jealousy,</v>

922
00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:39.650
<v Speaker 1>a lot of clawing and scratching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see thanks to many things.</v>

923
00:42:39.651 --> 00:42:40.484
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to youtube initially then </v>

924
00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:46.580
<v Speaker 1>podcasts and then Netflix.</v>

958
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:19.220
<v Speaker 2>He's such A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

959
00:44:19.221 --> 00:44:20.054
<v Speaker 2>he's just one of those.</v>

960
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.680

964
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:30.833
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's leader of the charge because he's </v>

965
00:44:33.241 --> 00:44:37.650
<v Speaker 1>the most reckless and wild and and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>more so now.</v>

966
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Now that he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix special,</v>

<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

969
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:45.330
<v Speaker 1>He is a fucking monster right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

970
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:46.463
<v Speaker 1>he's peaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's better than he was before and he </v>

971
00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:48.930
<v Speaker 1>was the best before.</v>

972
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a great thing.</v>

973
00:44:50.881 --> 00:44:51.714
<v Speaker 2>Like when you go to any club and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you come in and you just see whatever </v>

974
00:44:55.051 --> 00:44:56.670
<v Speaker 2>random people are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

975
00:44:56.671 --> 00:44:57.504
<v Speaker 2>my wife was a comedian before we had </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids and the first thing she wants to </v>

976
00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:03.400
<v Speaker 2>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she asked when I come back as who?</v>

977
00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:05.220
<v Speaker 2>Who was there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who did you say?</v>

978
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.241
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

979
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:07.920
<v Speaker 2>he's so Steve Byrne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the whatever,</v>

980
00:45:07.921 --> 00:45:08.520
<v Speaker 2>and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

981
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.290
<v Speaker 2>she wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she doesn't,</v>

982
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:12.030
<v Speaker 2>she's not part of the community like she</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

983
00:45:12.031 --> 00:45:12.864
<v Speaker 2>but she doesn't get the visit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like she misses that sense and </v>

984
00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:16.383
<v Speaker 2>we're very lucky to have that as grown </v>
<v Speaker 2>men to be able to like walk into this </v>

985
00:45:20.341 --> 00:45:22.710
<v Speaker 2>very fun community that you're a part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

986
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:23.791
<v Speaker 2>It gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>

987
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:26.250
<v Speaker 2>it gives you a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of belonging.</v>

988
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's what a lot of people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have nowadays.</v>

989
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:30.200
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

990
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:31.913
<v Speaker 2>according to David Brooks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the reason for everybody's </v>

991
00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:34.680
<v Speaker 2>malaise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

992
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.863
<v Speaker 1>Let me something too though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's weird living in places </v>

993
00:45:38.601 --> 00:45:41.810
<v Speaker 1>where you don't know your neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking weird.</v>

994
00:45:41.811 --> 00:45:42.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

995
00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:43.693
<v Speaker 1>Norton was telling me that he lives in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this big apartment building in New York </v>

996
00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.250
<v Speaker 1>City and I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

997
00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.330
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be hundreds of people living</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that building,</v>

998
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:52.790
<v Speaker 1>these huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge building.</v>

999
00:45:52.791 --> 00:45:53.624
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no worries.</v>

1000
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:55.240
<v Speaker 1>No anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're here.</v>

1001
00:45:55.241 --> 00:45:56.360
<v Speaker 1>It says no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't know anybody.</v>

1002
00:45:56.361 --> 00:45:57.620
<v Speaker 1>He says he tried to say hi to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor.</v>

1003
00:45:57.621 --> 00:45:59.150
<v Speaker 1>They looked at him like he's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>murderer.</v>

1004
00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's friendly to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So weird.</v>

1005
00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:05.930
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too loud.</v>

1006
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Stop making noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody does to people.</v>

1007
00:46:08.331 --> 00:46:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Bang on the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>banging on the floor,</v>

1008
00:46:10.071 --> 00:46:11.300
<v Speaker 1>banging in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conflict.</v>

1009
00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing and it's weird,</v>

1010
00:46:14.091 --> 00:46:15.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1011
00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.400
<v Speaker 2>my youngest wants to go to church and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how old?</v>

1012
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:24.130
<v Speaker 2>13.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because friends what does,</v>

1013
00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:29.090
<v Speaker 2>maybe she has more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's more of a sensitivity and like she</v>

1014
00:46:29.091 --> 00:46:31.730
<v Speaker 2>knows there's something other than </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something spiritual going on.</v>

1015
00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.593
<v Speaker 2>Mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that might've been what kicked </v>

1016
00:46:35.801 --> 00:46:38.760
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1017
00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.273
<v Speaker 2>and she's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's searching a little bit and she </v>

1018
00:46:42.471 --> 00:46:44.990
<v Speaker 2>wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She likes being able to sit someplace in</v>

1019
00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:49.730
<v Speaker 2>a and we go and it's not like when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kid,</v>

1020
00:46:49.731 --> 00:46:52.220
<v Speaker 2>like when I was a kid and we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholic,</v>

1021
00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:54.860
<v Speaker 2>the place was packed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you couldn't find parking.</v>

1022
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:55.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1023
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:57.860
<v Speaker 2>it was a big deal that my father would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

1024
00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.420
<v Speaker 2>we're going early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

1025
00:46:59.421 --> 00:47:01.640
<v Speaker 2>get out of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to get a spot.</v>

1026
00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not walking from the back.</v>

1027
00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.230
<v Speaker 2>And it was like a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like you kind of roll up,</v>

1028
00:47:06.231 --> 00:47:09.620
<v Speaker 2>it's half full and there's nobody there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1029
00:47:09.621 --> 00:47:10.454
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course the Catholic Church has a lot </v>

1030
00:47:12.141 --> 00:47:15.320
<v Speaker 2>of problems and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But every but every.</v>

1031
00:47:15.321 --> 00:47:16.154
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all these religions have had a </v>

1032
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:19.790
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little kerfuffle.</v>

1033
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Have a lot like the Catholic church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1034
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:25.460
<v Speaker 2>the Catholic church is the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst.</v>

1035
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.170
<v Speaker 2>But the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1036
00:47:27.171 --> 00:47:28.820
<v Speaker 2>but don't let me get sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

1037
00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:30.283
<v Speaker 2>the thing is we know so much now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're able to see that all these </v>

1038
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:36.160
<v Speaker 2>institutions are flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's problems with all of them.</v>

1039
00:47:36.161 --> 00:47:37.570
<v Speaker 2>We used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people used to think,</v>

1040
00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:40.710
<v Speaker 2>my grandmother just thought churches the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best and this is the best one.</v>

1041
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:41.563
<v Speaker 2>They didn't ask questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we know everything and we know that </v>

1042
00:47:44.231 --> 00:47:45.064
<v Speaker 2>all these institutions are flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we're making the mistake </v>

1043
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:50.590
<v Speaker 2>that you can't be a part of a political </v>
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>

1044
00:47:50.591 --> 00:47:53.620
<v Speaker 2>You can't be a part of a community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be a part of the thing if it's</v>

1045
00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:56.050
<v Speaker 2>not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a way to live.</v>

1046
00:47:56.051 --> 00:47:59.290
<v Speaker 2>You gotta kind of be a little ignorant </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to show up,</v>

1047
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.370
<v Speaker 2>you got to kind of not be ignorant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but allow things to be flood</v>

1048
00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.530
<v Speaker 1>or start a new one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on.</v>

1049
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:07.783
<v Speaker 1>I mean the the right way to address the </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues of a flawed institution and not </v>

1050
00:48:13.161 --> 00:48:13.994
<v Speaker 1>just accept them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to try to create a new institution </v>

1051
00:48:16.641 --> 00:48:18.350
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't have as many flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what we.</v>

1052
00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:21.290
<v Speaker 1>That's not what we did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our founding fathers did.</v>

1053
00:48:21.291 --> 00:48:23.540
<v Speaker 1>When they established the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>of America,</v>

1054
00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:24.403
<v Speaker 1>the idea was to establish a place where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an experiment in self </v>

1055
00:48:28.731 --> 00:48:32.870
<v Speaker 1>government and that's never existed </v>
<v Speaker 1>before in the world and this is what the</v>

1056
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:35.330
<v Speaker 1>United States represents to the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world outside of us.</v>

1057
00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is what we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1058
00:48:38.301 --> 00:48:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I keep saying we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not we,</v>

1059
00:48:39.741 --> 00:48:40.574
<v Speaker 1>but with the people that established the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States did was they broke the </v>

1060
00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:49.421
<v Speaker 1>mold as to how a world superpower or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1061
00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:50.473
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a super power that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how a country could exist and then </v>

1062
00:48:52.611 --> 00:48:53.444
<v Speaker 1>that country.</v>

1063
00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:54.403
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a coincidence that </v>

1064
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.333
<v Speaker 1>Adam just a couple hundred years that </v>
<v Speaker 1>country emerged the greatest superpower </v>

1065
00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.333
<v Speaker 1>of the world's ever known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that freedom allows </v>

1066
00:49:02.031 --> 00:49:05.510
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented activity in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation,</v>

1067
00:49:05.511 --> 00:49:06.344
<v Speaker 1>in terms of creativity and not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppressed and not being in total fear </v>

1068
00:49:10.101 --> 00:49:12.530
<v Speaker 1>for your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for any form of descent.</v>

1069
00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.870
<v Speaker 1>So any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is.</v>

1070
00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:19.900
<v Speaker 1>This goes back to not just religion but </v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of any group,</v>

1071
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:21.681
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

1072
00:49:21.681 --> 00:49:25.760
<v Speaker 1>any group that's in control of any sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a situation.</v>

1073
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:28.550
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you suppress all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1074
00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:29.923
<v Speaker 1>you limit their ability to contribute </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what is existed all </v>

1075
00:49:34.851 --> 00:49:37.610
<v Speaker 1>throughout Europe and would existed all </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout Asia,</v>

1076
00:49:37.611 --> 00:49:39.320
<v Speaker 1>all throughout the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1077
00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.620
<v Speaker 1>When the United States came along and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then when the United States came along,</v>

1078
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:46.670
<v Speaker 1>all the sudden you have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented development and growth and</v>

1079
00:49:46.671 --> 00:49:48.770
<v Speaker 1>this one place where people are allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be free.</v>

1080
00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:49.933
<v Speaker 1>Where we support free expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We we support free religious freedom of </v>

1081
00:49:55.161 --> 00:49:59.270
<v Speaker 1>religion and we separate church and </v>
<v Speaker 1>state and this is one of the reasons why</v>

1082
00:49:59.271 --> 00:50:00.104
<v Speaker 1>these things are so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you get like religious </v>

1083
00:50:01.611 --> 00:50:05.150
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalists Wackos that say this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country was founded on Christian values,</v>

1084
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:06.703
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if you're a peaceful </v>

1085
00:50:08.661 --> 00:50:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a peaceful Buddhist,</v>

1086
00:50:11.241 --> 00:50:14.000
<v Speaker 1>if you're a peaceful mormon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

1087
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.983
<v Speaker 1>we should all embrace each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should allow each other 100 percent </v>

1088
00:50:17.631 --> 00:50:18.464
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as someone starts </v>

1089
00:50:19.071 --> 00:50:22.970
<v Speaker 1>restricting that freedom and restricting</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's ability to express themselves,</v>

1090
00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.013
<v Speaker 1>you run into real problems because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't let these things play out in </v>

1091
00:50:26.931 --> 00:50:27.764
<v Speaker 1>their order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't let ideas play out where </v>

1092
00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:32.690
<v Speaker 1>people get to examine those ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

1093
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:33.703
<v Speaker 1>Like look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at some of the more </v>

1094
00:50:34.581 --> 00:50:35.414
<v Speaker 1>suppressive areas of the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is that these people </v>

1095
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:39.743
<v Speaker 1>live not just as many real problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the real problems is these </v>

1096
00:50:41.901 --> 00:50:42.734
<v Speaker 1>people live in fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no real freedom of </v>

1097
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:45.344
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also this real desire for </v>

1098
00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:53.690
<v Speaker 1>conformity is real desire to establish </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are a part of the group that is</v>

1099
00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:54.943
<v Speaker 1>one of the good ones that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>abide by the rules and you are going to </v>

1100
00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:01.340
<v Speaker 1>show everyone else that you were a part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this group,</v>

1101
00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.353
<v Speaker 1>whether it means throwing gay people off</v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings or throwing rocks at women's </v>

1102
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:07.220
<v Speaker 1>shelters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

1103
00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:10.190
<v Speaker 2>I was just gonna say like your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually depends on you conforming.</v>

1104
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:12.530
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with my friend the other day who's</v>

1105
00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:16.520
<v Speaker 2>gay and he was saying that he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped the chest one.</v>

1106
00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Just come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

1107
00:51:18.441 --> 00:51:21.320
<v Speaker 2>shout it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it really,</v>

1108
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:23.900
<v Speaker 2>how close is close?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comes over your house.</v>

1109
00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.490
<v Speaker 2>So close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1110
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize he can't go to half of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet as an open gay man.</v>

1111
00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't go to Russia.</v>

1112
00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:36.740
<v Speaker 2>He can't go to all of the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's parts of age like they will kill</v>

1113
00:51:36.741 --> 00:51:38.960
<v Speaker 2>you if you're gay in those areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1114
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1115
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:42.853
<v Speaker 2>what's going to make a city flourish </v>
<v Speaker 2>then gay people coming in with bold </v>

1116
00:51:47.601 --> 00:51:49.390
<v Speaker 2>ideas and let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1117
00:51:49.391 --> 00:51:52.310
<v Speaker 2>I saw them change parts of New York like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was nobody's business.</v>

1118
00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also I think that like the,</v>

1119
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:57.380
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's great about gay folks is when gay</v>

1120
00:51:57.381 --> 00:51:59.810
<v Speaker 1>folks are embraced and they're allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be themselves,</v>

1121
00:51:59.811 --> 00:52:01.490
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can express that,</v>

1122
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:04.010
<v Speaker 1>and then you get to see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a.</v>

1123
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.093
<v Speaker 1>there's such a giant spectrum of the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>people behave and think and the things </v>

1124
00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:11.630
<v Speaker 1>that they love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't allow people to express</v>

1125
00:52:11.631 --> 00:52:14.660
<v Speaker 1>their position on that spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't even know it exists.</v>

1126
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:16.003
<v Speaker 1>Then you create all sorts of deviance </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're forcing them into some </v>

1127
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.473
<v Speaker 1>unnatural pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things that I think </v>

1128
00:52:22.311 --> 00:52:23.144
<v Speaker 1>about the Catholic church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the problem is that </v>

1129
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:29.030
<v Speaker 1>these people are suppressed sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like incredibly suppressed,</v>

1130
00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:29.893
<v Speaker 1>not just suppressed in terms of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're homosexual or </v>

1131
00:52:32.451 --> 00:52:34.430
<v Speaker 1>heterosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no sex.</v>

1132
00:52:34.431 --> 00:52:35.910
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to have any sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1133
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how's it going to come out?</v>

1134
00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.430
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane</v>

1135
00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:43.060
<v Speaker 1>denial of the fact that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink water</v>

1136
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:48.150
<v Speaker 2>and it's so upsetting because I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of searching a little bit because I</v>

1137
00:52:48.441 --> 00:52:52.310
<v Speaker 2>was raised Catholic and I did like going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have what she has.</v>

1138
00:52:52.311 --> 00:52:53.144
<v Speaker 2>I did like going and sitting in the Pew </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Sunday was different from the other </v>

1139
00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.093
<v Speaker 2>days and I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to hear people talk about being </v>

1140
00:52:59.991 --> 00:53:00.824
<v Speaker 2>nice to each other and I got to see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people from my town who you saw running </v>

1141
00:53:03.441 --> 00:53:04.274
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now they're just sitting there </v>

1142
00:53:04.551 --> 00:53:05.384
<v Speaker 2>quietly and praying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was goodness to it and they went </v>

1143
00:53:08.871 --> 00:53:09.704
<v Speaker 2>out and fed the homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was good stuff that came from it </v>

1144
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.000
<v Speaker 2>and she wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

1145
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:16.410
<v Speaker 2>And now you're sitting in an institution</v>
<v Speaker 2>though the,</v>

1146
00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:18.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the backstory of what's going on.</v>

1147
00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:21.590
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1148
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 2>how do you sit there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you sit there said</v>

1149
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.840
<v Speaker 3>to her last night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we should just go to yoga,</v>

1150
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 3>satisfy your spiritual side with wacky </v>
<v Speaker 3>to men.</v>

1151
00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:35.550
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1152
00:53:35.551 --> 00:53:39.090
<v Speaker 3>I go to a Bikram Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to hot yoga,</v>

1153
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.430
<v Speaker 3>hot yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that guy,</v>

1154
00:53:41.431 --> 00:53:43.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's allowed to come in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country.</v>

1155
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.863
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not.</v>

1156
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:49.970
<v Speaker 3>The guy who made big room now know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy not think he's best case.</v>

1157
00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.050
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got a little rapey.</v>

1158
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely got a little.</v>

1159
00:53:56.370 --> 00:54:01.370
<v Speaker 1>He took advantage of his privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his position,</v>

1160
00:54:01.441 --> 00:54:02.640
<v Speaker 1>our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1161
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:04.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could say power,</v>

1162
00:54:04.861 --> 00:54:07.170
<v Speaker 1>but the reverence that people had </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards him,</v>

1163
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:11.430
<v Speaker 1>they felt like he was a guru and so he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would get these girls alone and he would</v>

1164
00:54:11.431 --> 00:54:15.470
<v Speaker 1>make them suck tank or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think per seat,</v>

1165
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.930
<v Speaker 1>now this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting this very dangerous waters,</v>

1166
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:23.850
<v Speaker 1>but I was having a conversation with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman who is a.</v>

1167
00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:26.790
<v Speaker 1>she's actually an instructor and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1168
00:54:26.791 --> 00:54:29.460
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy is definitely creepy,</v>

1169
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:30.623
<v Speaker 1>but let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those girls not only knew what </v>

1170
00:54:34.861 --> 00:54:37.230
<v Speaker 1>he was about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they wanted to be with him.</v>

1171
00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:38.483
<v Speaker 1>They want him to be with him because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his power and because he represented </v>

1172
00:54:41.221 --> 00:54:42.054
<v Speaker 1>something special to them and then when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he just shot a load in their mouth and </v>

1173
00:54:45.901 --> 00:54:46.734
<v Speaker 1>kicked him to the curb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they became angry and decided they </v>

1174
00:54:49.051 --> 00:54:49.884
<v Speaker 1>were molested.</v>

1175
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.053
<v Speaker 1>They went into it willingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know if she's accurate or </v>

1176
00:54:53.521 --> 00:54:56.130
<v Speaker 1>inaccurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not there and I'm not a woman,</v>

1177
00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:01.400
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that people have like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember women throwing,</v>

1178
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.620
<v Speaker 1>throwing themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but making it very clear that they were.</v>

1179
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:12.030
<v Speaker 1>They had deep admiration for my martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts instructor when I was,</v>

1180
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.120
<v Speaker 1>when I was a young kid and I was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing taekwondo.</v>

1181
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.313
<v Speaker 1>I remember these women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were so in awe of my martial arts </v>

1182
00:55:19.501 --> 00:55:20.334
<v Speaker 1>instructor because he represented a </v>
<v Speaker 1>master of something that they were </v>

1183
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:24.773
<v Speaker 1>deeply enamored by it and I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>also what happens with these yoga </v>

1184
00:55:28.021 --> 00:55:28.510
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1185
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:30.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's seductive.</v>

1186
00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:34.930
<v Speaker 3>It's seductive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also with something like that,</v>

1187
00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:37.330
<v Speaker 3>it's very physical and mental and </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual.</v>

1188
00:55:37.331 --> 00:55:40.330
<v Speaker 3>It's sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual like it is.</v>

1189
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:41.250
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1190
00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:43.660
<v Speaker 3>I've never had any sex with anybody in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my class,</v>

1191
00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:47.170
<v Speaker 3>but I'm telling you when everybody's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there sweating and,</v>

1192
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:48.023
<v Speaker 3>and almost naked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wearing these little fucking shorts </v>

1193
00:55:50.531 --> 00:55:52.110
<v Speaker 3>and the girls were wearing these little </v>
<v Speaker 3>shorts and,</v>

1194
00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:54.820
<v Speaker 3>and the teacher goes around and she like</v>
<v Speaker 3>calls you out.</v>

1195
00:55:54.821 --> 00:55:55.421
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1196
00:55:55.421 --> 00:55:56.430
<v Speaker 3>she likes me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1197
00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:57.420
<v Speaker 3>I can undo</v>

1198
00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:58.253
<v Speaker 1>Stan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How some of those people get intimate </v>

1199
00:56:00.151 --> 00:56:02.230
<v Speaker 1>with each other after this is all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're,</v>

1200
00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.200
<v Speaker 1>they're so close to being naked</v>

1201
00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:07.250
<v Speaker 3>wedding together and your friend is </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1202
00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:08.420
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that,</v>

1203
00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:11.570
<v Speaker 3>there were some women I'm sure who </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to be with him,</v>

1204
00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:14.720
<v Speaker 3>but he's not dismissing any rap shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>either,</v>

1205
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:15.583
<v Speaker 3>but it's his responsibility because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>has the power and knows what he's </v>

1206
00:56:17.841 --> 00:56:20.240
<v Speaker 3>wielding like in a workplace kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1207
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:23.000
<v Speaker 3>It's up to you to be the one who puts </v>
<v Speaker 3>the brakes on it.</v>

1208
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets interesting.</v>

1209
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:26.083
<v Speaker 4>He does not seem to think that he does </v>
<v Speaker 4>have any responsibility at all for the </v>

1210
00:56:29.621 --> 00:56:32.260
<v Speaker 4>people that are working for him teaching</v>
<v Speaker 4>these classes.</v>

1211
00:56:32.261 --> 00:56:35.180
<v Speaker 4>And like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did this hbo documentary.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It was fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did this hbo interview about him.</v>

1213
00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 4>It was so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the big guy.</v>

1214
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:41.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1216

<v Speaker 4>He says this tv,</v>

1217
00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:51.130

<v Speaker 4>So he's fully aware.</v>

1218
00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:55.680
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fully aware of his crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>he was.</v>

1220
00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:03.240
<v Speaker 4>He was dismissing the idea that he would</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever sexually assault anyone.</v>

1221
00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:04.683
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would I do that when these women </v>

1281
01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:23.180
<v Speaker 4>So that spiritual thing like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's.</v>

1282
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:24.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1283
01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:28.580
<v Speaker 4>It's like the problem with it is you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>still an animal,</v>

1284
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:30.490
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the animal.</v>

1285
01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.910
<v Speaker 4>It's like we were talking about before </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the wolves gone,</v>

1286
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:36.840
<v Speaker 4>these surplus kills and they kill all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these elk and they don't eat them again.</v>

1287
01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.240
<v Speaker 4>Wyoming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a recent issue,</v>

1288
01:00:38.241 --> 01:00:39.074
<v Speaker 4>there was 18 elk that were killed by </v>
<v Speaker 4>wolves in these surplus killings is a </v>

1289
01:00:42.621 --> 01:00:43.550
<v Speaker 4>real tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1290
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:46.610
<v Speaker 4>These walls can't help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just their instincts.</v>

1291
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:51.200
<v Speaker 4>So his instincts as a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has instincts to procreate,</v>

1292
01:00:51.201 --> 01:00:52.034
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>His instincts to respond to women that </v>

1293
01:00:54.291 --> 01:00:57.910
<v Speaker 4>are sexually attracted to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he teaches these classes in front of</v>

1294
01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:01.280
<v Speaker 4>hundreds and thousands of people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody loves and adores him.</v>

1295
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.413
<v Speaker 4>Soon he fucked up twisted brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything that he said there made </v>

1296
01:01:05.091 --> 01:01:07.430
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My favorite part of it was that woman,</v>

1297
01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:08.420
<v Speaker 4>Andrea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when she,</v>

1298
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:10.960
<v Speaker 4>when she clarified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying,</v>

1299
01:01:10.961 --> 01:01:14.600
<v Speaker 4>you're saying that for women have </v>
<v Speaker 4>committed to it like,</v>

1300
01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:17.810
<v Speaker 4>I want this motherfucker has to be clear</v>
<v Speaker 4>on this nonsense.</v>

1301
01:01:17.811 --> 01:01:21.000
<v Speaker 4>I like how she's there is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't even change her expressions.</v>

1302
01:01:21.001 --> 01:01:22.580
<v Speaker 4>She's just like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying?</v>

1303
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:23.391
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1304
01:01:23.391 --> 01:01:24.224
<v Speaker 4>look at that girl right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's standing on top of a woman's hips </v>

1305
01:01:27.361 --> 01:01:30.440
<v Speaker 4>as she's bent over backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That girl is like,</v>

1306
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:33.350
<v Speaker 4>he wants me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He standing over me.</v>

1307
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:36.470
<v Speaker 4>I've taken a lot of yoga classes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody ever stood on my hips.</v>

1308
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.180
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey bro,</v>

1309
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.433

<v Speaker 4>and they come over and they like push </v>

<v Speaker 4>your legs down and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1311
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:44.630
<v Speaker 4>well it's a little depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

1312
01:01:44.631 --> 01:01:47.450
<v Speaker 4>I just spilled assistant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spelled wine.</v>

1313
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.040
<v Speaker 4>Leave it there bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let it sink in.</v>

1314
01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.650
<v Speaker 4>That's good for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Patina.</v>

1315
01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:53.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm learning those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those terms,</v>

1316
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:56.640
<v Speaker 4>the Patina.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there.</v>

1317
01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.960
<v Speaker 4>So when you're in the church,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Church of Yoga,</v>

1318
01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:04.070
<v Speaker 4>home or real and you're abusing your </v>
<v Speaker 4>power,</v>

1319
01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:08.270
<v Speaker 4>that's a different animal because you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing abusing with children.</v>

1320
01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.013
<v Speaker 4>It's a totally different animal and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've taken six year olds and abusing </v>

1321
01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:13.820
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a different animal.</v>

1322
01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.033
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like there's levels to this </v>

1323
01:02:16.401 --> 01:02:16.851
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1324
01:02:16.851 --> 01:02:19.110
<v Speaker 4>Like the guy killing his brother is </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrific to me.</v>

1325
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 4>The guy killing his</v>

1326
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:20.873
<v Speaker 1>brother's wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more horrific guy killing his brother's </v>

1327
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>wife and then kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Impossible.</v>

1328
01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Demonic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what you were saying earlier,</v>

1329
01:02:27.361 --> 01:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>like do you believe in good or evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I believe in it,</v>

1330
01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:31.224
<v Speaker 1>but if it did exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it exists in the minds of men exist in </v>

1331
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>that time,</v>

1332
01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a no or.</v>

1333
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1334
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.433
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this bit that I did on my last </v>

1335
01:02:41.331 --> 01:02:42.164
<v Speaker 1>special and it was about men's rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups and I was trying to figure out a </v>

1336
01:02:47.331 --> 01:02:52.010
<v Speaker 1>way to say this and make it be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so true that I said men commit.</v>

1337
01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Most of the murderer men commit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the rape men cause all the war.</v>

1338
01:02:58.070 --> 01:02:58.903
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are facts like the most horrific </v>

1339
01:03:00.891 --> 01:03:02.540
<v Speaker 1>things in our life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our war,</v>

1340
01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.130
<v Speaker 1>murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rape,</v>

1341
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:05.023
<v Speaker 1>those are the most horrific things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of life means death pales in </v>

1342
01:03:08.211 --> 01:03:11.300
<v Speaker 1>comparison and I think men steal more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than women too,</v>

1343
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:14.570
<v Speaker 1>but that that's the evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

1344
01:03:14.571 --> 01:03:15.404
<v Speaker 1>If there was a demon and the demon came </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to earth and there's only three </v>

1345
01:03:17.691 --> 01:03:20.120
<v Speaker 1>things that it could get you to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would get you to rape,</v>

1346
01:03:20.121 --> 01:03:21.630
<v Speaker 1>murder and caused war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1347
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:24.590
<v Speaker 1>So if a demon was real demon would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

1348
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1349
01:03:26.051 --> 01:03:28.340
<v Speaker 1>I said this as a joke that I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminists,</v>

1350
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:29.450
<v Speaker 1>like in the special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1351
01:03:29.451 --> 01:03:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was a feminist,</v>

1352
01:03:30.771 --> 01:03:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I'd be one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1353
01:03:32.121 --> 01:03:34.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't be one as a man because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not real,</v>

1354
01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:37.310
<v Speaker 1>because like male feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're just tricksters.</v>

1355
01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:40.760
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show me a male feminist that can pick up</v>

1356
01:03:40.761 --> 01:03:45.380
<v Speaker 1>heavy things and run really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't exist this,</v>

1357
01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.740
<v Speaker 1>you have a limited parameter where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to be a male feminist,</v>

1358
01:03:48.741 --> 01:03:50.000
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I get it,</v>

1359
01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:53.750
<v Speaker 1>but when I look at the actions of men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're an objective person,</v>

1360
01:03:53.751 --> 01:03:57.050
<v Speaker 1>you take yourself out of the human race </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you look at all,</v>

1361
01:03:57.170 --> 01:04:01.850
<v Speaker 1>all human beings and you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horror that meant not that women haven't</v>

1362
01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.713
<v Speaker 1>done awful shit and falsely accused </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and killed their kids and women </v>

1363
01:04:06.531 --> 01:04:07.700
<v Speaker 1>have done all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1364
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:08.543
<v Speaker 1>Some women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>

1365
01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>But the vast majority of horrors I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been</v>

1366
01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.090
<v Speaker 3>had been committed by men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1367
01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.220
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1368
01:04:16.221 --> 01:04:17.790
<v Speaker 3>It's a very primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1369
01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:18.843
<v Speaker 3>a way to look at the world that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>good and evil and it exists in these </v>

1370
01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:23.900
<v Speaker 3>certain ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

1371
01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.060
<v Speaker 3>That's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1372
01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:26.550
<v Speaker 3>But hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That Toki crazy.</v>

1373
01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried that I won't be funnier </v>
<v Speaker 3>after I do this.</v>

1374
01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.470
<v Speaker 3>Let's see me pick up the slack.</v>

1375
01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Did you like Elon Musk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a Goddamn parent.</v>

1378
01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.260
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's going for three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is that Jamie has hip problem.</v>

1379
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.950
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1380
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:48.950
<v Speaker 3>if you see a video of the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she hits the wrong button.</v>

1381
01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:53.640
<v Speaker 3>Like biggie smalls over there in a cloud</v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

1382
01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:55.253
<v Speaker 3>What's amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing to me is that this is now a 100 </v>

1383
01:04:56.911 --> 01:04:59.730
<v Speaker 3>percent legal here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still not federally.</v>

1384
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1385
01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:04.290
<v Speaker 3>that's what was funny about the Eland </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing when Elan smoked it here.</v>

1386
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.500
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's totally legal.</v>

1387
01:05:07.501 --> 01:05:08.334
<v Speaker 3>It's totally okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in everyone's minds they're still </v>

1388
01:05:09.991 --> 01:05:10.501
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1389
01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:12.180
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1390
01:05:12.181 --> 01:05:13.990
<v Speaker 3>Well they need to let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is why.</v>

1391
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't</v>

1392
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:15.740
<v Speaker 1>need to let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're on your side.</v>

1393
01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:16.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1394
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on like the,</v>

1395
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good people of government,</v>

1396
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:24.240
<v Speaker 1>law enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire department,</v>

1397
01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good people.</v>

1398
01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>If I'm on your side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1399
01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a stoner.</v>

1400
01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.073
<v Speaker 1>I'm on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on your side a thousand million </v>

1401
01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:31.640
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

1402
01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:32.473
<v Speaker 2>And making it legal actually helps all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because now you don't have to go </v>

1403
01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.220
<v Speaker 2>out and fight these phony war is against</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1404
01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.093
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes people more compassionate and </v>

1405
01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.713
<v Speaker 1>it makes people look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything else you can abuse </v>

1406
01:05:44.851 --> 01:05:46.050
<v Speaker 1>beating off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1407
01:05:46.051 --> 01:05:49.760
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was a million dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>a drop $1,000,000</v>

1408
01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:52.490
<v Speaker 1>for one drop of my sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1409
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:55.770
<v Speaker 1>if you're a person that gets obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with masturbation,</v>

1410
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>like you could ruin your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1411
01:05:58.210 --> 01:06:02.610
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are legitimate porn </v>
<v Speaker 1>addictions where they watch porn eight,</v>

1412
01:06:02.611 --> 01:06:04.450
<v Speaker 1>10 hours a day and they can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1413
01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.850
<v Speaker 1>This is like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1414
01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:08.820
<v Speaker 1>I think you can ruin yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar.</v>

1415
01:06:08.821 --> 01:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>You can ruin yourself with food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can ruin yourself with,</v>

1416
01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.080
<v Speaker 1>with laziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

1417
01:06:13.110 --> 01:06:15.480
<v Speaker 1>You can get into a habit where you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get up.</v>

1418
01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:16.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1419
01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:19.710
<v Speaker 1>you can get into a comfort zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just want to take baths.</v>

1420
01:06:19.711 --> 01:06:22.370
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do shit like.</v>

1421
01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1422
01:06:23.011 --> 01:06:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1423
01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:24.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

1424
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Did Roseanne say she did that after all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of her bullshit went down,</v>

1425
01:06:28.021 --> 01:06:30.000
<v Speaker 1>she has gotten the bath all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drank wine.</v>

1426
01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Was that this is their safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I apologize,</v>

1427
01:06:34.231 --> 01:06:35.064
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't</v>

1428
01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.020
<v Speaker 2>so um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1429
01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I know it's a very basic way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've been talking about good and</v>

1430
01:06:40.291 --> 01:06:44.820
<v Speaker 2>evil since the time of the men were able</v>
<v Speaker 2>and women were able to,</v>

1431
01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:47.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write and philosophize and.</v>

1432
01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:48.780
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1433
01:06:48.781 --> 01:06:49.614
<v Speaker 2>it just seems to me lately like I've see</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels to me like evil and good is </v>

1434
01:06:54.451 --> 01:06:58.950
<v Speaker 2>actually a force that we're struggling </v>
<v Speaker 2>with and I know there's,</v>

1435
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:03.720
<v Speaker 2>I know like some people would say that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a primitive way of thinking,</v>

1436
01:07:03.721 --> 01:07:06.410
<v Speaker 2>but I do kind of feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1437
01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:11.960
<v Speaker 2>it actually is a very real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tangible thing.</v>

1438
01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:14.760
<v Speaker 2>And that.</v>

1439
01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:18.330
<v Speaker 1>What makes you think this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your personal feelings?</v>

1440
01:07:18.331 --> 01:07:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Is it based on like your intuition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it?</v>

1441
01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1442
01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.510
<v Speaker 2>it's intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a vibe.</v>

1443
01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.433
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like a maybe because I'm </v>

1444
01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:32.440
<v Speaker 2>showing up at church and kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>searching a little bit.</v>

1445
01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:33.363
<v Speaker 2>Myself and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am very much about good people doing </v>

1446
01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:40.030
<v Speaker 2>good things and I've just been kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious of it,</v>

1447
01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:44.920
<v Speaker 2>but then there's always like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this rise of evil that comes up like all</v>

1448
01:07:44.921 --> 01:07:45.754
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden white supremacists are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These riots are these horrible things </v>

1449
01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:50.980
<v Speaker 2>against people in different parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and it's.</v>

1450
01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:54.280
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's an ongoing struggle</v>

1451
01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:55.133
<v Speaker 1>look almost like why hasn't caught up </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet to the way you look at the world </v>

1452
01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.070
<v Speaker 1>where a lot of people look at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people look at the world like,</v>

1453
01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:03.540
<v Speaker 1>like if Tom Papa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were in charge,</v>

1454
01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:04.374
<v Speaker 1>and if you had to push all the buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would sort of decide how people </v>

1455
01:08:07.801 --> 01:08:09.810
<v Speaker 1>behaved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that was a possible thing.</v>

1456
01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:10.673
<v Speaker 1>Of course you'd have one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you do is eliminate all the </v>

1457
01:08:12.031 --> 01:08:14.640
<v Speaker 1>violence and all the horrors of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1458
01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if.</v>

1459
01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.690
<v Speaker 2>And then also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to cut you off,</v>

1460
01:08:17.691 --> 01:08:18.524
<v Speaker 2>but you also see the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those hires are done by these men </v>

1461
01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:25.280
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who when you sit in like kind of analyze</v>

1462
01:08:25.281 --> 01:08:26.114
<v Speaker 2>them and they've been the victims of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of things and there's like genetic </v>

1463
01:08:28.941 --> 01:08:33.170
<v Speaker 2>victimization and social and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so where's that coming from?</v>

1464
01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.033
<v Speaker 2>Why are these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kid that could have been okay ends </v>

1465
01:08:36.771 --> 01:08:37.604
<v Speaker 2>up in this life of crime and ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>murdering somebody and where's that </v>

1466
01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:40.964
<v Speaker 2>coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this just a genetic mutation or is </v>

1467
01:08:42.801 --> 01:08:45.980
<v Speaker 2>there like a force of good and evil?</v>

1468
01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:47.373
<v Speaker 1>I think we're still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're still dealing with the echoes of </v>

1469
01:08:49.661 --> 01:08:50.494
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I really firmly believe and </v>

1470
01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:53.613
<v Speaker 1>I think also the way maybe you and I are</v>
<v Speaker 1>having this conversation the way a lot </v>

1471
01:08:56.951 --> 01:08:59.860
<v Speaker 1>of people are having these conversations</v>
<v Speaker 1>today just like us,</v>

1472
01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.013
<v Speaker 1>but basically the same sort of rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>people sitting around with no agenda </v>

1473
01:09:05.651 --> 01:09:06.910
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does this exist?</v>

1474
01:09:07.050 --> 01:09:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Why does all the horrors of life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1475
01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Why is all this injustice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that there?</v>

1476
01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is it.</v>

1477
01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:19.710
<v Speaker 1>We haven't been here that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just really think that that's real and</v>

1478
01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to absorb that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1479
01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.153
<v Speaker 1>Our time spent in modern civilization </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus the time of life on earth is a </v>

1480
01:09:28.391 --> 01:09:29.920
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The time on life,</v>

1481
01:09:29.921 --> 01:09:32.920
<v Speaker 1>on earth and in relationship to the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the universe is a joke.</v>

1482
01:09:32.921 --> 01:09:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The numbers are insane.</v>

1483
01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:35.533
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We literally were monkeys just a couple </v>

1484
01:09:38.531 --> 01:09:39.400
<v Speaker 1>of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1485
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:44.350
<v Speaker 1>But the bit that I have my act about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States being founded in 1776,</v>

1486
01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:49.390
<v Speaker 1>that's three people go behind her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's three people go really is.</v>

1487
01:09:49.391 --> 01:09:50.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing.</v>

1488
01:09:50.141 --> 01:09:50.974
<v Speaker 1>So three people go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were these creatures that had to </v>

1489
01:09:56.081 --> 01:10:01.081
<v Speaker 1>make fire to stay warm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have electricity.</v>

1490
01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.080
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have engines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1491
01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:03.963
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made boats at a trees and they use </v>

1492
01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:06.634
<v Speaker 1>the wind to drift across the ocean while</v>
<v Speaker 1>staring at the stars with the fucking </v>

1493
01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:11.900
<v Speaker 1>gigantic harp looking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1494
01:10:11.901 --> 01:10:13.180
<v Speaker 1>What was the thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A sextant?</v>

1495
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:14.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing that they use to figure out </v>

1496
01:10:16.751 --> 01:10:19.030
<v Speaker 1>where the other ones are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a trust that these motherfuckers</v>

1497
01:10:19.031 --> 01:10:21.130
<v Speaker 1>had mapped out the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1498
01:10:21.190 --> 01:10:23.950
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could make it across the ocean and a</v>

1499
01:10:23.951 --> 01:10:25.750
<v Speaker 1>lot of people died of scurvy along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1500
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

1501
01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Not long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so God damned recent.</v>

1502
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:32.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was listening to Dan Carlin's </v>

1503
01:10:33.791 --> 01:10:37.180
<v Speaker 1>hardcore history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best podcasts ever to be,</v>

1504
01:10:37.210 --> 01:10:38.043
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has this thing on the mon goals </v>

1505
01:10:41.591 --> 01:10:42.424
<v Speaker 1>called the wrath of the cons and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaked me out is not just how crazy </v>

1506
01:10:45.821 --> 01:10:46.654
<v Speaker 1>that world was back then and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable damage and destruction the </v>

1507
01:10:50.951 --> 01:10:51.784
<v Speaker 1>Mongols created and how they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquered empires just moved across the </v>

1508
01:10:55.241 --> 01:10:57.310
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed millions and millions of people,</v>

1509
01:10:57.430 --> 01:11:01.870
<v Speaker 1>but it was really fucked up was I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google does to make sure I'm not wrong.</v>

1510
01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that was only like 1200 BC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that was that long ago.</v>

1511
01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1512
01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:13.060
<v Speaker 1>It's really recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really recent.</v>

1513
01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I think Gingiss Kahn died in the $1,200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>

1514
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:20.710
<v Speaker 1>100 add add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1515
01:11:20.711 --> 01:11:22.720
<v Speaker 1>well did I say BC?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually met a day.</v>

1516
01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:24.043
<v Speaker 1>I said BC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really did mean a dj in the more </v>

1517
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:27.870
<v Speaker 1>recent 800 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little stone.</v>

1518
01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Folks are a lot more recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that 1200,</v>

1519
01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:32.401
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1200,</v>

1520
01:11:32.401 --> 01:11:35.040
<v Speaker 1>so c would still be still be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking recent,</v>

1521
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:37.320
<v Speaker 1>but 1,280,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I meant to say.</v>

1522
01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So recent.</v>

1523
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:43.770
<v Speaker 1>That's just not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're starting to make wine and sour.</v>

1524
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Does it go the other way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other way?</v>

1525
01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:48.443
<v Speaker 1>Seven Ninety two 70 to 792 years ago a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy killed 50 million people during his </v>

1526
01:11:55.381 --> 01:11:57.320
<v Speaker 1>lifetime with his actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1527
01:11:57.450 --> 01:11:59.640
<v Speaker 1>They changed the carbon footprint of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1528
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

1529
01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:05.170
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you're saying it's,</v>

1530
01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:07.453
<v Speaker 1>you're saying it's more surprising that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing this kind of stuff and that </v>

1531
01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:10.854
<v Speaker 1>we have electric cars and medicine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this other kind of like it's more </v>

1532
01:12:13.231 --> 01:12:14.064
<v Speaker 1>surprising that we're doing that than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people are running around </v>

1533
01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:18.540
<v Speaker 1>killing each other.</v>

1534
01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi Germany,</v>

1535
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.710
<v Speaker 1>that was 19 forties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1536
01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:25.850
<v Speaker 1>That's maybe crazier than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1537
01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:28.240
<v Speaker 1>if you and Carla and has some great </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff on that too,</v>

1538
01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:30.270
<v Speaker 1>in the history of World War One and </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War Two,</v>

1539
01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.670
<v Speaker 1>but if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1540
01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:37.050
<v Speaker 1>you're watching a documentary on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you watch those people move around.</v>

1541
01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Especially that one that you showed me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

1542
01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:41.490
<v Speaker 1>that's been digitally remastered when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it in color,</v>

1543
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.440
<v Speaker 1>is that Ken?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it Ken Burns it to that?</v>

1544
01:12:43.441 --> 01:12:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1545
01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:45.683
<v Speaker 1>They digitally remastered some footage </v>
<v Speaker 1>from World War One and you get to watch </v>

1546
01:12:48.421 --> 01:12:51.320
<v Speaker 1>these people move around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in real time you realized like,</v>

1547
01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are just people.</v>

1548
01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:56.910
<v Speaker 1>They're just just like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know and this is 100 years ago,</v>

1549
01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:58.133
<v Speaker 1>years ago were involved in this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass war and then a few years later </v>

1550
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:03.870
<v Speaker 1>involved another crazy ass war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1551
01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:06.060
<v Speaker 1>So why can't we figure it out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1552
01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

1553
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Will is present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1554
01:13:08.911 --> 01:13:09.744
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it used to be the only way that </v>

1555
01:13:11.371 --> 01:13:12.204
<v Speaker 1>people got by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think killing each other and I think </v>

1556
01:13:15.031 --> 01:13:15.864
<v Speaker 1>from going from small groups of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>which like in these small groups of </v>

1557
01:13:19.471 --> 01:13:22.830
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have interpersonal conflicts.</v>

1558
01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.470
<v Speaker 1>They would have fights with members in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tribe,</v>

1559
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:29.400
<v Speaker 1>but they would sort it out and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>would probably be some sort of rule that</v>

1560
01:13:29.401 --> 01:13:30.234
<v Speaker 1>they would all try to live by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they would get invaded by </v>

1561
01:13:32.851 --> 01:13:33.684
<v Speaker 1>people that didn't have anything and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll look for your stuff and they came </v>

1562
01:13:36.091 --> 01:13:39.240
<v Speaker 1>over the top of the hill and they killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they raped and they.</v>

1563
01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:42.750
<v Speaker 1>They stole women and they just did that </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long ass time.</v>

1564
01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did that for a long ass time.</v>

1565
01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:48.960
<v Speaker 1>This was the history of the steps like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1566
01:13:48.961 --> 01:13:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Dan Carlin maps out in this wrath of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>con thing makes you go,</v>

1567
01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:53.431
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>

1568
01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:58.431
<v Speaker 1>imagine being born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just imagine how crazy that meant.</v>

1569
01:13:59.041 --> 01:13:59.874
<v Speaker 1>Being a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seeing arrows flying around and </v>

1570
01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:03.323
<v Speaker 1>people call it open to people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>lighting people on fire and launching </v>

1571
01:14:06.391 --> 01:14:11.391
<v Speaker 1>them onto roofs with catapults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the footage for world war one,</v>

1572
01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1573
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:16.180
<v Speaker 4>look how they digitally remastered it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Peter Jackson movie,</v>

1574
01:14:16.181 --> 01:14:17.620
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or a documentary.</v>

1575
01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:18.454
<v Speaker 4>That's the craziest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you look at history and you think </v>

1576
01:14:19.901 --> 01:14:20.411
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that was.</v>

1577
01:14:20.411 --> 01:14:21.250
<v Speaker 4>Then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1578
01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:23.130
<v Speaker 4>they're just us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just happened to be there.</v>

1579
01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:25.040
<v Speaker 4>Really no different than you and me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1580
01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:28.750
<v Speaker 4>we haven't been here this long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We haven't been here this long.</v>

1581
01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:32.140
<v Speaker 4>This is the thing like people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>looked like this,</v>

1582
01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:36.160
<v Speaker 4>that awaring like uniforms and that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1583
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:39.970
<v Speaker 4>have like decent stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nice wheels to their wagons.</v>

1584
01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:43.380
<v Speaker 4>That's real recent man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1585
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:44.223
<v Speaker 4>I know it's recent as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's been a bunch of different </v>

1586
01:14:46.811 --> 01:14:48.810
<v Speaker 4>ways that people have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1587
01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:52.420
<v Speaker 4>but even if you go back to Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it isn't the act of like,</v>

1588
01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:53.403
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we know like that guy who lit his </v>

1589
01:14:54.851 --> 01:14:55.684
<v Speaker 4>house on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that is a just instinctually we </v>

1590
01:15:00.011 --> 01:15:02.800
<v Speaker 4>know and have known during even all this</v>
<v Speaker 4>history,</v>

1591
01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:05.680
<v Speaker 4>we've known that that is evil like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1592
01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:08.050
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's insanely selfish.</v>

1593
01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.213
<v Speaker 4>It's not like we went from having to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like eat each other and that we're </v>

1594
01:15:11.051 --> 01:15:13.210
<v Speaker 4>trying to get our act together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1595
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:15.670
<v Speaker 4>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all know that.</v>

1596
01:15:15.671 --> 01:15:18.850
<v Speaker 4>That is such a evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>evil thing.</v>

1597
01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:22.480
<v Speaker 4>I think it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we have to fight it.</v>

1598
01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:23.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1599
01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.290
<v Speaker 4>it is evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's ego that's causing that,</v>

1600
01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:28.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy didn't want to go to jail.</v>

1601
01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:28.893
<v Speaker 4>It didn't want to shoot himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't want to kill himself and didn't </v>

1602
01:15:31.601 --> 01:15:32.434
<v Speaker 4>want to go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he decided he was gonna kill a bunch </v>

1603
01:15:34.421 --> 01:15:36.750
<v Speaker 4>of people to make up a story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1604
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:39.460
<v Speaker 4>he had a plot and this plot was to save </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself,</v>

1605
01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:40.733
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's when people get trapped in a </v>

1606
01:15:43.181 --> 01:15:47.410
<v Speaker 4>situation where they're allowed to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>decisions and they're allowed to,</v>

1607
01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.940
<v Speaker 4>if not allowed to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if they choose to make decisions and</v>

1608
01:15:51.941 --> 01:15:52.774
<v Speaker 4>those decisions are horrific and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to somehow or another justify </v>

1609
01:15:55.631 --> 01:15:57.940
<v Speaker 4>those decisions because they never look </v>
<v Speaker 4>at their own behavior.</v>

1610
01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:58.803
<v Speaker 4>They always judge other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a pattern that people fall into </v>

1611
01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.520
<v Speaker 4>when they're always looking for other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to always be wrong.</v>

1612
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:05.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they never grow.</v>

1613
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:06.423
<v Speaker 4>And so like a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you so psychotic that he could kill </v>

1614
01:16:09.551 --> 01:16:10.384
<v Speaker 4>somebody and then he has this decision </v>
<v Speaker 4>to make this decision is to kill the </v>

1615
01:16:13.601 --> 01:16:16.570
<v Speaker 4>wife and the kids still like he's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>always got to be right.</v>

1616
01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.160
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he's always,</v>

1617
01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.650
<v Speaker 4>he's got it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's trying to cover his tracks,</v>

1618
01:16:20.651 --> 01:16:21.484
<v Speaker 4>he's trying to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>always like this is the type of person </v>

1619
01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:26.260
<v Speaker 4>that could do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1620
01:16:26.261 --> 01:16:27.094
<v Speaker 4>this is a horrific pattern of thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it might have been triggered by the </v>

1621
01:16:29.171 --> 01:16:30.004
<v Speaker 4>murder itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's just a chemical flip in his </v>

1622
01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:33.250
<v Speaker 4>brain that says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I can kill people.</v>

1623
01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.193
<v Speaker 4>Like he hasn't done it as whole life and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just going into the subway and </v>

1624
01:16:36.521 --> 01:16:37.354
<v Speaker 4>getting a sandwich with all the stuff on</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and just be like watching the Monday </v>

1625
01:16:41.621 --> 01:16:43.810
<v Speaker 4>night football and then the next week </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

1626
01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.120
<v Speaker 4>something flips in his brain is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1627
01:16:46.121 --> 01:16:46.954
<v Speaker 4>now I can kill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's the people that I </v>

1628
01:16:49.151 --> 01:16:51.850
<v Speaker 4>know and love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in a fit of rage,</v>

1629
01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:54.580
<v Speaker 4>in a fit of rage if does something </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrific.</v>

1630
01:16:54.670 --> 01:16:55.503
<v Speaker 4>And then I think he's one of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that tries to justify his </v>

1631
01:16:57.611 --> 01:16:58.444
<v Speaker 4>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it just tries to figure out a way </v>

1632
01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:02.253
<v Speaker 4>where he can justify it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be in hell anyway </v>

1633
01:17:06.131 --> 01:17:08.140
<v Speaker 4>because the guy's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1634
01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:09.250
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd probably</v>

1635
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 3>been thinking that deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could.</v>

1636
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:15.230
<v Speaker 3>You think we're crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

1637
01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:17.420
<v Speaker 3>they come up with justification,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we came from,</v>

1638
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:20.570
<v Speaker 3>like we said before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an Italian dude like us,</v>

1639
01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:23.330
<v Speaker 3>but he could've also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know if he's medicated.</v>

1640
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:27.230
<v Speaker 3>Do we know that that's a brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemistry.</v>

1641
01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.720
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1642
01:17:29.721 --> 01:17:31.920
<v Speaker 3>He could have been on something which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1643
01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes people do horrific things.</v>

1644
01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.810
<v Speaker 3>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you believe in Karma?</v>

1645
01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I think for sure that when you put </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy out there,</v>

1646
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:43.703
<v Speaker 1>it affects things around you in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way people interact with you and </v>

1647
01:17:47.581 --> 01:17:51.120
<v Speaker 1>that in turn affects the way they will </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with other people as well.</v>

1648
01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.800
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1649
01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:53.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount,</v>

1650
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:55.660
<v Speaker 3>there's an energy you put out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1651
01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:56.613
<v Speaker 3>you could call it that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that makes it sound like you've got </v>

1652
01:17:57.851 --> 01:17:59.980
<v Speaker 3>a crystal in your pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1653
01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:02.000
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Energy.</v>

1654
01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:06.040
<v Speaker 3>Real energy is a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a real right.</v>

1655
01:18:06.041 --> 01:18:06.874
<v Speaker 3>If I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was a murderer and came and sat in </v>

1656
01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.233
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'd be a different vibe than what </v>

1657
01:18:12.431 --> 01:18:13.850
<v Speaker 3>you're feeling from me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1658
01:18:13.851 --> 01:18:14.990
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1659
01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:16.380
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1660
01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:17.373
<v Speaker 3>A chronic masturbator well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also people that are off and then </v>

1661
01:18:22.571 --> 01:18:25.270
<v Speaker 3>struggling with the fact that they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>done something awful.</v>

1662
01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.740
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like an energy to that.</v>

1663
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:29.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like constantly being on edge </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>

1664
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:31.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every crime and punishment.</v>

1665
01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:34.210
<v Speaker 3>That's still CFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never read that.</v>

1666
01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should read it.</v>

1667
01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:40.020
<v Speaker 3>It's so he kills someone in the East </v>
<v Speaker 3>carrying the guilt.</v>

1668
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Latest description of the Gulf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just carrying that thing.</v>

1669
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:45.670
<v Speaker 3>Now that guy is going to admit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy,</v>

1670
01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:47.253
<v Speaker 3>but you don't think there's Karma just </v>
<v Speaker 3>for like you do something bad and </v>

1671
01:18:49.690 --> 01:18:50.490
<v Speaker 3>something bad will happen.</v>

1672
01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:54.060
<v Speaker 1>I think a genuinely believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is no crystals in my pocket,</v>

1673
01:18:54.061 --> 01:18:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I genuinely believe that if you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you know to be awful,</v>

1674
01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.470
<v Speaker 1>that that has an equal effect coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>back at you,</v>

1675
01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:06.003
<v Speaker 1>like whatever bad that you've put out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of like doing something evil to a </v>

1676
01:19:10.951 --> 01:19:11.784
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you feel personally about </v>

1677
01:19:14.491 --> 01:19:17.970
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will take an equal blow.</v>

1678
01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.970
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where does that come from?</v>

1679
01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:24.150
<v Speaker 1>I think comes from your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>introspective thinking.</v>

1680
01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:26.790
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And worse,</v>

1681
01:19:26.791 --> 01:19:28.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might even feel worse than that per.</v>

1682
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:29.303
<v Speaker 1>You'd say something rude to a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you're tired and then you </v>

1683
01:19:31.771 --> 01:19:33.060
<v Speaker 1>realize you said some rude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying,</v>

1684
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:35.830
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did I do that?</v>

1685
01:19:35.831 --> 01:19:36.664
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they could be like Tom Papa's </v>

1686
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:39.330
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

1687
01:19:39.331 --> 01:19:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I just am so tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1688
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:42.540
<v Speaker 1>And you'd just asked me something </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

1689
01:19:42.541 --> 01:19:43.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1690
01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:47.000
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to turn that around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1691
01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:49.950
<v Speaker 1>So you might hate yourself more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they even get mad at you.</v>

1692
01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:53.010
<v Speaker 3>So Karma is really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with the energy.</v>

1693
01:19:53.011 --> 01:19:55.800
<v Speaker 3>It's not the universe saying now </v>
<v Speaker 3>something bad's going to happen to you.</v>

1694
01:19:56.010 --> 01:20:00.060
<v Speaker 3>You're kind of creating it with your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>actions and your own stuff.</v>

1695
01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.233
<v Speaker 1>I think it's real dangerous when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend that we have any sort of real </v>

1696
01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:06.093
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the events that take place in the </v>

1697
01:20:09.391 --> 01:20:11.700
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you start to say like someone,</v>

1698
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:13.770
<v Speaker 1>something happened to someone because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karma.</v>

1699
01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:15.323
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with saying that is what </v>

1700
01:20:17.431 --> 01:20:20.460
<v Speaker 1>about babies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about babies with leukemia?</v>

1701
01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Were they bad babies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

1702
01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Why did they get cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why they die young?</v>

1703
01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Why did they die in car accidents?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1704
01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:31.460
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've never done anything bad there,</v>

1705
01:20:31.730 --> 01:20:36.290
<v Speaker 2>but that's where you could say that bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit happens to us all,</v>

1706
01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.570
<v Speaker 2>but can you create more bad shit</v>

1707
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:40.663
<v Speaker 1>possible co two and it's also entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that you're creating more bad </v>

1708
01:20:44.511 --> 01:20:45.344
<v Speaker 1>shit but feeling bad about yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've done bad shit so you </v>

1709
01:20:48.441 --> 01:20:51.170
<v Speaker 1>create more of this negative energy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you carry around with you.</v>

1710
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:55.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that's entirely possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that we also have this weird</v>

1711
01:20:55.370 --> 01:20:57.530
<v Speaker 1>need to define things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1712
01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:02.770
<v Speaker 1>and I think that we're looking to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that we're calling Karma and we're</v>

1713
01:21:02.961 --> 01:21:03.794
<v Speaker 1>saying that this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is definite correlation between </v>

1714
01:21:06.231 --> 01:21:07.064
<v Speaker 1>action and reaction and between the good</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put out there and the good that </v>

1715
01:21:09.711 --> 01:21:14.711
<v Speaker 1>comes back and my take is that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely something going on,</v>

1716
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:16.123
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we should define it </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet because I don't think we really </v>

1717
01:21:18.291 --> 01:21:19.124
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think as soon as we box it up and </v>

1718
01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:25.160
<v Speaker 1>say it's this thing and this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute reaction that the world has.</v>

1719
01:21:25.161 --> 01:21:27.050
<v Speaker 1>When you put good out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good comes back.</v>

1720
01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Good people die all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>

1721
01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Good people die.</v>

1722
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I think there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is an energy.</v>

1723
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1724
01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:38.900
<v Speaker 2>we know it from the work that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's both.</v>

1725
01:21:38.901 --> 01:21:39.734
<v Speaker 2>When you stand on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an energy in that room that </v>

1726
01:21:42.351 --> 01:21:43.184
<v Speaker 2>transference between you and the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are out there and you're playing </v>

1727
01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:49.010
<v Speaker 2>with it and it's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very real thing.</v>

1728
01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like hypnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1729
01:21:50.161 --> 01:21:50.994
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1730
01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1731
01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:55.670
<v Speaker 2>And and then they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can reverse hip,</v>

1732
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.863
<v Speaker 2>hypnotize you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could bring this other energy the </v>

1733
01:21:58.431 --> 01:21:59.264
<v Speaker 2>other way so that there is this energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all of us out there and running </v>

1734
01:22:03.111 --> 01:22:03.944
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that far to think then there </v>

1735
01:22:06.801 --> 01:22:10.820
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be good energy and there's bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy and there's an.</v>

1736
01:22:10.821 --> 01:22:11.654
<v Speaker 2>Is that ultimately good and evil?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it is all generated from human </v>

1737
01:22:15.921 --> 01:22:16.754
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if you educated everyone and they </v>

1738
01:22:18.111 --> 01:22:18.944
<v Speaker 2>could all be kind and try and come at it</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way we could actually feel that </v>

1739
01:22:21.621 --> 01:22:22.454
<v Speaker 2>there was more good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just more good coming from </v>

1740
01:22:24.171 --> 01:22:25.130
<v Speaker 2>people I don't know.</v>

1741
01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:25.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to get really spacey with </v>

1742
01:22:26.921 --> 01:22:29.020
<v Speaker 1>this really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really spacey,</v>

1743
01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:32.410
<v Speaker 1>it's the holidays you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1744
01:22:32.411 --> 01:22:34.990
<v Speaker 1>well what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What exactly are people doing?</v>

1745
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:37.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are people doing?</v>

1746
01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:39.040
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1747
01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:43.150
<v Speaker 1>what's our purpose to be being here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at us from an outside perspective,</v>

1748
01:22:43.151 --> 01:22:43.984
<v Speaker 1>like pretend you're not a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at all the people like </v>

1749
01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.880
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're moving really fast.</v>

1750
01:22:48.890 --> 01:22:49.723
<v Speaker 1>They're spending most of their time </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing things they don't want to do and </v>

1751
01:22:51.701 --> 01:22:52.534
<v Speaker 1>they're buying stuff bustling around </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're throwing all this money </v>

1752
01:22:55.091 --> 01:22:57.220
<v Speaker 1>at stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stuff keeps getting better,</v>

1753
01:22:57.221 --> 01:22:58.054
<v Speaker 1>so every year the stuff keeps getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complex and more capable and more </v>

1754
01:23:01.361 --> 01:23:04.720
<v Speaker 1>high tech and more space age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is bananas,</v>

1755
01:23:04.721 --> 01:23:05.554
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to watch her and call me fucking Dick </v>

1756
01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Tracy man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1757
01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:09.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that as people keep going on and on </v>

1758
01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:12.190
<v Speaker 1>and on and on with this stuff.</v>

1759
01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:13.473
<v Speaker 1>This is where we need some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy behind this innovation and a lot </v>

1760
01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:22.720
<v Speaker 1>of the energy is conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conflict and resolution.</v>

1761
01:23:22.721 --> 01:23:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Conflict and resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conflict and victory,</v>

1762
01:23:25.571 --> 01:23:26.404
<v Speaker 1>victory and defeat and the defeat makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>your work harder and and there's all </v>

1763
01:23:29.561 --> 01:23:33.940
<v Speaker 1>these interacting forces that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly moving together.</v>

1764
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:35.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended this.</v>

1765
01:23:36.490 --> 01:23:37.323
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is expressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The success of this little game has </v>

1766
01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:44.230
<v Speaker 1>expressed in material possessions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The success in this game is expressed in</v>

1767
01:23:44.231 --> 01:23:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Hamptons mansions and private jets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bentleys and Pam.</v>

1768
01:23:48.761 --> 01:23:49.594
<v Speaker 1>I'm winning this fucking crazy game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>OPS and there's a lot of value and </v>

1769
01:23:54.221 --> 01:23:55.054
<v Speaker 1>winning the crazy game who stopped so we</v>
<v Speaker 1>let these people acquire all this stuff </v>

1770
01:23:58.061 --> 01:24:01.830
<v Speaker 1>and you've got all these diamonds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>

1771
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.943
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is forcing more stuff to be made </v>

1772
01:24:06.821 --> 01:24:09.940
<v Speaker 1>better and more innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will eventually,</v>

1773
01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.790
<v Speaker 1>and this is where it gets spacious of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all waiting for this part.</v>

1774
01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:14.253
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be what people become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are going to become some sort of </v>

1775
01:24:16.661 --> 01:24:17.494
<v Speaker 1>symbiotic organism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that's tied into electronics </v>

1776
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:21.483
<v Speaker 1>and that it's happening now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening slowly and we're making </v>

1777
01:24:24.911 --> 01:24:26.800
<v Speaker 1>it with stuff and as we keep making </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1778
01:24:26.801 --> 01:24:27.634
<v Speaker 1>it's eventually going to get to a part </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the thing you would like to do </v>

1779
01:24:29.681 --> 01:24:33.310
<v Speaker 1>more than anything is have enhanced your</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience on earth.</v>

1780
01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to take pictures.</v>

1781
01:24:35.561 --> 01:24:36.041
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1782
01:24:36.041 --> 01:24:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to email people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1783
01:24:37.481 --> 01:24:38.110
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1784
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:41.200
<v Speaker 1>but I also want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to make my experience on earth</v>

1785
01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:42.034
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then we're going to have to </v>

1786
01:24:43.391 --> 01:24:44.650
<v Speaker 1>integrate with your circuitry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>

1787
01:24:44.651 --> 01:24:46.270
<v Speaker 1>papa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then live forever.</v>

1788
01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:48.243
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what the organisms are </v>

1789
01:24:49.091 --> 01:24:49.924
<v Speaker 1>trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to get rid of the monkey </v>

1790
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:54.970
<v Speaker 1>that wants to start the wars all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1791
01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:56.913
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's enlightenment that towards the end </v>

1792
01:24:59.050 --> 01:24:59.883
<v Speaker 1>of our goofy ass system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil living there would be a great </v>

1793
01:25:04.121 --> 01:25:04.954
<v Speaker 1>science fiction movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if this is the future and they </v>

1794
01:25:06.791 --> 01:25:07.624
<v Speaker 1>probably were already made it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if only some people went on board </v>

1795
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:13.240
<v Speaker 1>with a new enlightenment that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>from these headsets.</v>

1796
01:25:13.570 --> 01:25:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Like remember the dude from Star Trek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blind guy from sesame street.</v>

1797
01:25:18.850 --> 01:25:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Remember he was used to be on sesame </v>
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

1798
01:25:20.471 --> 01:25:20.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1799
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:23.600
<v Speaker 1>that he was the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lavar Burton Rainbow Boulevard.</v>

1800
01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reading Rainbow,</v>

1801
01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:25.451
<v Speaker 1>Lavar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burton,</v>

1802
01:25:25.451 --> 01:25:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Barbara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1803
01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have those things on it.</v>

1804
01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.133
<v Speaker 1>There's only like 10 of them for what if</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one bought into most people bought </v>

1805
01:25:32.951 --> 01:25:37.630
<v Speaker 1>into it and those things completely cure</v>
<v Speaker 1>you of any evil.</v>

1806
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:41.800
<v Speaker 1>It just moving along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that uh,</v>

1807
01:25:42.910 --> 01:25:44.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was,</v>

1808
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:46.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe there is no purpose to us being </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1809
01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:52.040
<v Speaker 1>but you got that shit for pep boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a filter.</v>

1810
01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:55.503
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool air filter at the top of the </v>

1811
01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.950
<v Speaker 1>muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1812
01:26:00.190 --> 01:26:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a 69 chevy.</v>

1813
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:03.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You bought,</v>

1814
01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:07.100
<v Speaker 3>you bought that at the auto parts store </v>
<v Speaker 3>and put it in your dose.</v>

1815
01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Yoda Corola dope old ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1816
01:26:09.311 --> 01:26:14.311
<v Speaker 3>When they fucking unscrew the chrome </v>
<v Speaker 3>hubcap filter down.</v>

1817
01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:20.140
<v Speaker 3>I always liked a good wing man and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't remember man.</v>

1818
01:26:21.021 --> 01:26:23.150
<v Speaker 3>These people today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't remember what gas smells like.</v>

1819
01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:25.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could fix your own car.</v>

1820
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:28.700
<v Speaker 3>You could open it up and with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>screwdriver and a high school education,</v>

1821
01:26:28.701 --> 01:26:29.534
<v Speaker 3>fix your automobile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was never smart enough or </v>

1822
01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:34.760
<v Speaker 3>knowledgeable enough to fix my own car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I could do little things.</v>

1823
01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:38.360
<v Speaker 3>I can change my oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Changed to a lot of things with old.</v>

1824
01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:42.410
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did the brakes once I did the brakes,</v>

1825
01:26:42.411 --> 01:26:44.000
<v Speaker 3>hit the brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a bold move.</v>

1826
01:26:44.001 --> 01:26:45.530
<v Speaker 3>What if you're wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was poor.</v>

1827
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:49.550
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just been buying brake pads.</v>

1828
01:26:49.551 --> 01:26:51.370
<v Speaker 3>Was a lot cheaper than having some </v>
<v Speaker 3>guidance.</v>

1829
01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Did you put it up on a Jack?</v>

1830
01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:54.793
<v Speaker 3>How'd you put it up on a jack and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cinderblock that held it underneath and </v>

1831
01:26:59.530 --> 01:27:00.770
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was nice.</v>

1832
01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.520
<v Speaker 3>It was a light little car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little pads.</v>

1833
01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:03.763
<v Speaker 3>Put them in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably had to get it fixed after </v>

1834
01:27:05.121 --> 01:27:05.954
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1835
01:27:06.230 --> 01:27:07.610
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could fix stuff.</v>

1836
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:09.290
<v Speaker 3>There was like a time when you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

1837
01:27:09.650 --> 01:27:11.900
<v Speaker 3>And you felt good about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1838
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:13.303
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had to choose between one of </v>

1839
01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:16.364
<v Speaker 3>those fucking rickety ship boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a rhinoceros on roller </v>

1840
01:27:19.311 --> 01:27:23.790
<v Speaker 3>skates versus your Tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1841
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:25.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way things can go.</v>

1842
01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:26.690
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1843
01:27:26.691 --> 01:27:27.524
<v Speaker 3>and I wouldn't put.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't put my kids in one of those </v>

1844
01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.310
<v Speaker 3>that we're driving around in those death</v>
<v Speaker 3>traps.</v>

1845
01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Do like no steering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No airbags.</v>

1846
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Hydroplane at the drop of a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1847
01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:40.430
<v Speaker 3>Just spinning around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So engine heavy.</v>

1848
01:27:40.431 --> 01:27:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Remember it was a big ass engine's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the front.</v>

1849
01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:45.240
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know what I'm asking.</v>

1850
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:46.123
<v Speaker 3>Would just slide all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so easy to slide your car back </v>

1851
01:27:48.621 --> 01:27:50.870
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was totally beat with your friends.</v>

1852
01:27:50.871 --> 01:27:55.580
<v Speaker 3>Just like spinning out and they figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>out how to balance them.</v>

1853
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:57.680
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the big deal.</v>

1854
01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:01.040
<v Speaker 3>Like if you take a tesla or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you buy a fucking camry.</v>

1855
01:28:01.041 --> 01:28:01.874
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That camera handles better than a 69 </v>

1856
01:28:05.181 --> 01:28:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Camaro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>

1857
01:28:08.410 --> 01:28:12.590
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't like to see what the death </v>
<v Speaker 3>rates are better a on the roads now with</v>

1858
01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.990
<v Speaker 3>like new cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be.</v>

1859
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:17.970
<v Speaker 3>It's probably much better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're.</v>

1860
01:28:18.010 --> 01:28:22.460
<v Speaker 3>They're much safer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're also much faster too.</v>

1861
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:23.743
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have to drive very fast </v>

1862
01:28:24.851 --> 01:28:27.620
<v Speaker 3>for it to be fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know how to make stuff.</v>

1863
01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:31.000
<v Speaker 3>Everything was glass just filled with </v>
<v Speaker 3>gasoline.</v>

1864
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:35.540
<v Speaker 3>That and fucking sparks and fumes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fumes were everywhere.</v>

1865
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:38.700
<v Speaker 3>Driving be getting high from the fumes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1866
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.530
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1867
01:28:40.670 --> 01:28:41.503
<v Speaker 3>for a fireplace company in the summer in</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Jersey and it was in a truck and </v>

1868
01:28:45.050 --> 01:28:45.883
<v Speaker 3>we're in this truck and traffic of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>New Jersey turnpike right by Newark </v>

1869
01:28:48.261 --> 01:28:51.740
<v Speaker 3>airport and just the fumes from </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything from the city,</v>

1870
01:28:51.741 --> 01:28:52.574
<v Speaker 3>from a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was just arinze in the humidity </v>

1871
01:28:55.161 --> 01:28:56.570
<v Speaker 3>of New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1872
01:28:56.571 --> 01:28:59.180
<v Speaker 3>if I get cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is gonna be the day that it,</v>

1873
01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:01.160
<v Speaker 3>that it hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it makes people crazy.</v>

1874
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:02.123
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like</v>

1875
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:06.690
<v Speaker 4>throwing alcohol and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So freedom that dust all day.</v>

1876
01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:07.583
<v Speaker 4>So disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pull up a video of the sound of the </v>

1877
01:29:09.991 --> 01:29:10.824
<v Speaker 4>exhaust of a 1969 Camaro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is something to somethings the </v>

1878
01:29:17.641 --> 01:29:20.820
<v Speaker 4>smell of gas is a good smell slot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just that man,</v>

1908
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:58.303
<v Speaker 4>you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I guarantee you if you were next </v>

1909
01:31:00.291 --> 01:31:02.570
<v Speaker 4>door and he just walked over and looked </v>
<v Speaker 4>at it,</v>

1910
01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:07.840
<v Speaker 4>it would catch you in its bell would </v>
<v Speaker 4>cross the street.</v>

1911
01:31:09.191 --> 01:31:11.420
<v Speaker 4>It's just rack it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

1912
01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:13.520
<v Speaker 4>Why is your car after be so loud?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1913
01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.050
<v Speaker 4>but if you're right next to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1914
01:31:15.051 --> 01:31:18.110
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1969 and you'll start walking around.</v>

1915
01:31:18.111 --> 01:31:21.020
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's beautiful.</v>

1916
01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:22.753
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't make a car like that today </v>

1917
01:31:24.171 --> 01:31:26.210
<v Speaker 4>because it's not even remotely </v>
<v Speaker 4>aerodynamic.</v>

1918
01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:29.510
<v Speaker 4>Hammock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuel efficient.</v>

1919
01:31:29.511 --> 01:31:32.240
<v Speaker 4>It's not safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a pitiful man.</v>

1920
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:33.103
<v Speaker 4>They nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They hit the sweet spot in art and </v>

1921
01:31:35.391 --> 01:31:36.224
<v Speaker 4>engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the one part of the American </v>

1922
01:31:38.271 --> 01:31:40.160
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Recklessness.</v>

1923
01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:45.200
<v Speaker 4>That's what drives everything that there</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that element of balls to the wall.</v>

1924
01:31:45.201 --> 01:31:46.034
<v Speaker 4>Let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's discover and you could get good </v>

1925
01:31:47.721 --> 01:31:48.680
<v Speaker 4>things out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1926
01:31:48.681 --> 01:31:53.090
<v Speaker 4>But imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine something that's far inferior to</v>

1927
01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:53.924
<v Speaker 4>the modern alternative but makes you </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel in a way the modern alternative </v>

1928
01:31:58.220 --> 01:31:59.740
<v Speaker 4>isn't capable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Feeling</v>

1929
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:05.520
<v Speaker 1>like if you see in 1969,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like done up Mustang Gt.</v>

1930
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:08.260
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

1932
01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:14.260

<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was the 1970?</v>

1933
01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Was it a boss?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

1934
01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:17.733
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty nine was like a boss and then </v>

1935
01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:20.373
<v Speaker 1>earlier than that they made those </v>
<v Speaker 1>eleanor cars for that gone in 60 </v>

1936
01:32:23.141 --> 01:32:24.280
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think those were 19,</v>

1937
01:32:24.281 --> 01:32:25.690
<v Speaker 1>67,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so really not there.</v>

1938
01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:26.533
<v Speaker 1>That body style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you looked at one of those next </v>

1939
01:32:29.621 --> 01:32:34.210
<v Speaker 1>to a 2018 mustang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 2018 mustangs look fucking great.</v>

1940
01:32:34.330 --> 01:32:35.920
<v Speaker 1>They look great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it right there.</v>

1941
01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:37.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a mock one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1942
01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:37.871
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's John Rice dude.</v>

1944
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:44.200
<v Speaker 1>There's a company that's making these </v>
<v Speaker 1>now too.</v>

1945
01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:45.473
<v Speaker 1>They're called classic recreation's and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making these brand new versions </v>

1946
01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:53.260
<v Speaker 1>of that car they take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take 19,</v>

1947
01:32:53.261 --> 01:32:57.050
<v Speaker 1>69 mustangs and they rebuild them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they give him like real break,</v>

1948
01:32:57.051 --> 01:33:01.870
<v Speaker 1>so they stopped good modern suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make it so you can drive it around.</v>

1949
01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>

1950
01:33:04.571 --> 01:33:05.404
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1951
01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:07.043
<v Speaker 3>That makes a lot of sense because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just pretty mustang bad ass </v>

1952
01:33:11.551 --> 01:33:12.990
<v Speaker 3>tires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's when you at</v>

1953
01:33:13.150 --> 01:33:15.210
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How beautiful is that?</v>

1954
01:33:15.810 --> 01:33:18.180
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like anything that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can buy that's modern.</v>

1955
01:33:18.230 --> 01:33:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Like there's nothing remotely close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1956
01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:23.910
<v Speaker 1>That's like vinyl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just right there.</v>

1957
01:33:23.911 --> 01:33:26.580
<v Speaker 1>They just nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck they did</v>

1958
01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:29.110
<v Speaker 3>all these years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>

1959
01:33:29.111 --> 01:33:30.220
<v Speaker 3>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They nailed it.</v>

1960
01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they nailed it for,</v>

1961
01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:34.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain,</v>

1962
01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:39.120
<v Speaker 3>a lunkhead from New Jersey that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that for you.</v>

1963
01:33:39.850 --> 01:33:41.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

1964
01:33:42.010 --> 01:33:42.843
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you don't know if young </v>

1965
01:33:48.281 --> 01:33:49.960
<v Speaker 3>people would like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1966
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:54.610
<v Speaker 3>They're like to start arresting them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they don't like young boys don't look</v>

1967
01:33:54.611 --> 01:33:55.444
<v Speaker 3>down Mustang and say good God credible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they don't do that then they should </v>

1968
01:34:00.011 --> 01:34:02.140
<v Speaker 3>probably go to jail somewhere that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty hot.</v>

1969
01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.460
<v Speaker 3>That's incredibly good looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's stupid.</v>

1970
01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:07.750
<v Speaker 3>But it's also stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1971
01:34:07.751 --> 01:34:08.584
<v Speaker 3>So sir,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just metal right in your chest </v>

1972
01:34:10.721 --> 01:34:11.890
<v Speaker 3>cavity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1973
01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:15.520
<v Speaker 3>no airbag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to do more push of last just in</v>

1974
01:34:15.521 --> 01:34:18.370
<v Speaker 3>your face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably a little bit of that.</v>

1975
01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:19.793
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a chunk in a car accident and </v>

1976
01:34:20.831 --> 01:34:23.830
<v Speaker 3>drive carefully and it's a wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to behold.</v>

1977
01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:24.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My buddy had his bad mustang when we </v>

1978
01:34:26.941 --> 01:34:27.774
<v Speaker 3>were in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you saw something like that but </v>

1979
01:34:29.471 --> 01:34:31.030
<v Speaker 3>it had airbags,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be cool with it then.</v>

1980
01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:31.901
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1981
01:34:31.901 --> 01:34:32.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm cool with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1982
01:34:32.891 --> 01:34:33.724
<v Speaker 3>I'm just busting Paul's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's a look at that little </v>

1983
01:34:35.831 --> 01:34:37.630
<v Speaker 3>orange thing in the middle that looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>closer to what?</v>

1984
01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:40.360
<v Speaker 3>I had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A 76 Toyota Corolla.</v>

1985
01:34:40.361 --> 01:34:41.194
<v Speaker 3>Call that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call up in 1976 Toyota Corolla with a </v>

1986
01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:50.770
<v Speaker 3>with a a racing stripes along the side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that bad boy.</v>

1987
01:34:50.771 --> 01:34:52.300
<v Speaker 3>Look at that orange one in the second </v>
<v Speaker 3>row.</v>

1988
01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.870
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a 1984 Honda accord.</v>

1989
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:01.050
<v Speaker 2>80 four Honda accord with stuttering </v>
<v Speaker 2>spark.</v>

1990
01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.590
<v Speaker 2>That's the 79.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need the 76.</v>

1991
01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Those are cool little cars though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

1992
01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:10.580
<v Speaker 2>I could fix that car at those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was doing the brakes on.</v>

1993
01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like one of those.</v>

1994
01:35:12.801 --> 01:35:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was white.</v>

1995
01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Nice little shitty carbon legend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1996
01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:21.380
<v Speaker 1>it's just like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh know what man?</v>

1997
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those fucking cars drive forever.</v>

1998
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1999
01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

2000
01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:30.230
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how reliable Honda's are.</v>

2001
01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so insane.</v>

2002
01:35:31.621 --> 01:35:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Toyota Toyota's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2003
01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:36.780
<v Speaker 2>Just go forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just having that crummy car.</v>

2004
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:39.150
<v Speaker 2>It was a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

2005
01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.400
<v Speaker 2>So you think back to your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2006
01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:45.840
<v Speaker 2>your point of view of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are these people doing here?</v>

2007
01:35:46.230 --> 01:35:47.820
<v Speaker 2>So they're building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked where you were going,</v>

2008
01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.200
<v Speaker 2>making stuff for what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd,</v>

2009
01:35:50.201 --> 01:35:51.034
<v Speaker 2>because everything's electronically </v>
<v Speaker 2>based and is this all instinct is or is </v>

2010
01:35:53.791 --> 01:35:54.624
<v Speaker 2>it being steered by something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just finding our way in the dark and </v>

2011
01:35:58.201 --> 01:36:01.170
<v Speaker 2>this is what's coming out or is there </v>
<v Speaker 2>some plan?</v>

2012
01:36:02.250 --> 01:36:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a heavy question.</v>

2013
01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:06.880
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to know if there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>

2014
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

2015
01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I get why some would be suspicious that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be,</v>

2016
01:36:10.930 --> 01:36:14.620
<v Speaker 1>but if you just see the whole nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2017
01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:18.580
<v Speaker 1>with the starting off of the tribal </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and the invasions of the others</v>

2018
01:36:18.581 --> 01:36:20.770
<v Speaker 1>and the wars that have taken place sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of nonstop,</v>

2019
01:36:20.771 --> 01:36:21.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2020
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:26.430
<v Speaker 1>You get this hyper competitive team </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented thing broken into countries.</v>

2021
01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:28.713
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that with that and this like </v>

2022
01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:33.790
<v Speaker 1>constant competition in this constant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then inside your country,</v>

2023
01:36:33.791 --> 01:36:34.624
<v Speaker 1>this constant competition economically </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody just striving to achieve </v>

2024
01:36:38.081 --> 01:36:40.600
<v Speaker 1>and do better and get crazier and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>

2025
01:36:40.601 --> 01:36:41.434
<v Speaker 1>And this is all leading to us just </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuing to buy stuff like everybody </v>

2026
01:36:45.911 --> 01:36:50.000
<v Speaker 1>that is involved in this as buying the </v>

<v Speaker 1>technology is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean if the ultimate threats always </v>

2058
01:38:11.130 --> 01:38:13.270
<v Speaker 1>violence and war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2059
01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:14.333
<v Speaker 1>That's the ultimate threat to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organism and the organism can commit </v>

2060
01:38:17.011 --> 01:38:20.520
<v Speaker 1>violence and war against each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why we make doors and gates and</v>

2061
01:38:20.970 --> 01:38:23.010
<v Speaker 1>stuff to keep those things at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2062
01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:24.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the most fascinating things </v>

2063
01:38:27.391 --> 01:38:29.310
<v Speaker 1>that people don't address.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what would,</v>

2064
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:33.480
<v Speaker 1>what would cause a person to snap?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no real concrete,</v>

2065
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:36.143
<v Speaker 1>no concrete answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is the difference </v>

2066
01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:41.513
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm asking this honestly killing </v>

2067
01:38:45.690 --> 01:38:48.450
<v Speaker 1>when you're hunting and killing a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

2068
01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:51.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be a giant difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of where you fell.</v>

2069
01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could you articulate it though?</v>

2070
01:38:53.370 --> 01:38:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2071
01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I've never killed a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would,</v>

2072
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:58.640
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2073
01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:03.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would have to be some horrific</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where you're battling for your</v>

2074
01:39:03.511 --> 01:39:06.150
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which people do that.</v>

2075
01:39:06.170 --> 01:39:07.630
<v Speaker 1>It does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2076
01:39:07.730 --> 01:39:12.730
<v Speaker 1>we were all aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst possible scenario we would all</v>

2077
01:39:12.781 --> 01:39:13.614
<v Speaker 1>like to think that everybody that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet that's of sound mind should be our </v>

2078
01:39:18.931 --> 01:39:19.764
<v Speaker 1>brothers and sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we should all get along whether </v>

2079
01:39:22.531 --> 01:39:23.364
<v Speaker 1>you agree or disagree about certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>political issues or certain social </v>

2080
01:39:27.241 --> 01:39:28.074
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we should be able to talk through </v>

2081
01:39:28.951 --> 01:39:29.784
<v Speaker 1>that as a community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like always hold at the top that </v>

2082
01:39:33.181 --> 01:39:36.690
<v Speaker 1>we're all in this together and if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's possible,</v>

2083
01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:37.553
<v Speaker 1>I think that's possible and I think we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could still satisfy this fucked up </v>

2084
01:39:40.591 --> 01:39:42.690
<v Speaker 1>desire that we have to constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete.</v>

2085
01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.033
<v Speaker 1>We can temper that with what I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important thing is finding </v>

2086
01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:50.640
<v Speaker 1>something that you're passionate at </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think you and I are really,</v>

2087
01:39:50.641 --> 01:39:54.120
<v Speaker 1>really lucky that we found stand up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>through stand up.</v>

2088
01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:54.953
<v Speaker 1>We found this thing that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate at and we have a good time </v>

2089
01:39:56.970 --> 01:39:59.700
<v Speaker 1>and we have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't have that,</v>

2090
01:40:00.090 --> 01:40:00.923
<v Speaker 1>so like if I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were offered a job as a </v>

2091
01:40:03.610 --> 01:40:06.480
<v Speaker 1>stockbroker and this is a guaranteed </v>
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>

2092
01:40:06.481 --> 01:40:08.580
<v Speaker 1>you have a guaranteed contract for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next 20 years,</v>

2093
01:40:08.581 --> 01:40:10.770
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make five times as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you make doing stand up.</v>

2094
01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:13.620
<v Speaker 1>You can't do standup anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would never take that.</v>

2095
01:40:14.090 --> 01:40:14.923
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2096
01:40:15.570 --> 01:40:18.570
<v Speaker 1>So even though you're a guy who does </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2097
01:40:18.571 --> 01:40:19.404
<v Speaker 1>you're not a business person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a guy following your passion and </v>

2098
01:40:22.231 --> 01:40:25.050
<v Speaker 1>it's allowed you to live a nice life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't.</v>

2099
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:26.183
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same as a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of people are doing is just </v>

2100
01:40:29.701 --> 01:40:30.534
<v Speaker 1>chasing the money so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the passion doesn't exist and they can </v>

2101
01:40:33.031 --> 01:40:36.630
<v Speaker 1>manufacture that passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to like some desire to see</v>

2102
01:40:36.631 --> 01:40:37.464
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their team kick ass because their </v>

2103
01:40:39.241 --> 01:40:40.530
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

2104
01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:42.363
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be really that they are into </v>

2105
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:46.010
<v Speaker 1>succeeding in the business world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's their passion.</v>

2106
01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:47.700
<v Speaker 1>They liked a lot of people that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2107
01:40:48.210 --> 01:40:49.043
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same as a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 1>David Cho who's like a professional </v>

2108
01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:55.360
<v Speaker 1>artist who's making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

2109
01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:58.720
<v Speaker 1>He just follows his passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does what he wants.</v>

2110
01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:02.590
<v Speaker 1>There's a different kind of achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a feeling that he has the way he</v>

2111
01:41:02.591 --> 01:41:03.424
<v Speaker 1>interfaces with what he does for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>living that's different than what a lot </v>

2112
01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:07.024
<v Speaker 1>of people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would imagine that artists would </v>

2113
01:41:08.591 --> 01:41:09.424
<v Speaker 1>probably be less inclined to go crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and spend all their money on stuff and </v>

2114
01:41:13.571 --> 01:41:14.404
<v Speaker 1>buy things that make them look better or</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them feel better about the fact </v>

2115
01:41:17.201 --> 01:41:19.370
<v Speaker 1>that they work because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to fill a hole that.</v>

2116
01:41:19.770 --> 01:41:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're just,</v>

2117
01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:24.460
<v Speaker 1>you have a job for a company that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really give a fuck about.</v>

2118
01:41:24.461 --> 01:41:26.950
<v Speaker 1>You don't really give a fuck about </v>
<v Speaker 1>styrofoam coolers.</v>

2119
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:28.263
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really don't give a fuck about </v>

2120
01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:29.900
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2121
01:41:30.010 --> 01:41:33.030
<v Speaker 1>those rubber bands that people buy when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have causes.</v>

2122
01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't give a fuck about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

2123
01:41:34.901 --> 01:41:37.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just a fucking guy who does it.</v>

2124
01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Your Business and you're there at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2125
01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:39.201
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2126
01:41:39.201 --> 01:41:40.034
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can give them to you for 1796 if we </v>

2127
01:41:41.291 --> 01:41:44.010
<v Speaker 1>can work this through Bob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a thousand bucks.</v>

2128
01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Want to be there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2129
01:41:46.450 --> 01:41:47.283
<v Speaker 1>I want to be fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy wants to be doing something </v>

2130
01:41:49.121 --> 01:41:49.954
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2131
01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:51.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2132
01:41:51.061 --> 01:41:54.190
<v Speaker 1>you're insanely fortunate that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that in your life.</v>

2133
01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:54.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2134
01:41:54.650 --> 01:41:57.530
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think those people look.</v>

2135
01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.990
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have jobs that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not into,</v>

2136
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.770
<v Speaker 2>but the reason we're lucky is that our </v>
<v Speaker 2>job is our passion.</v>

2137
01:42:04.190 --> 01:42:06.740
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have the job that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're maybe not into,</v>

2138
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:09.620
<v Speaker 2>but they love this other stuff that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2139
01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:14.660
<v Speaker 2>They love being with their family and </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep teaching soccer or they love skiing</v>

2140
01:42:14.661 --> 01:42:16.790
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their passion is something else.</v>

2141
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:20.540
<v Speaker 2>It like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're lucky that our passion is our work</v>

2142
01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:23.480
<v Speaker 2>to combine those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a very,</v>

2143
01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:24.710
<v Speaker 2>very unique thing.</v>

2144
01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:25.653
<v Speaker 1>It's the most insanely lucky thing ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that for people that are </v>

2145
01:42:30.101 --> 01:42:32.980
<v Speaker 1>like hyper competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't find a thing that they really</v>

2146
01:42:32.981 --> 01:42:34.690
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it really,</v>

2147
01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:38.890
<v Speaker 1>for many of them becomes about pursuing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best stuff.</v>

2148
01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you.</v>

2149
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:45.270
<v Speaker 1>This is what fuels so many people for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like these status symbols or like if you</v>

2150
01:42:45.431 --> 01:42:46.264
<v Speaker 1>have an iphone eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a kid sees you with an iphone eight </v>

2151
01:42:48.641 --> 01:42:52.740
<v Speaker 1>and they got an iphone 10 period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weird.</v>

2152
01:42:53.050 --> 01:42:55.270
<v Speaker 1>They can basically do the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2153
01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Has a fucking killer camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iphone eight,</v>

2154
01:42:59.051 --> 01:43:02.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the battery's pretty similar to our</v>

2155
01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:06.670
<v Speaker 1>tiny amy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for status seeking people,</v>

2156
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:09.040
<v Speaker 1>it's very important that you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>latest stuff.</v>

2157
01:43:09.041 --> 01:43:09.874
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't be walking around with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like David tells the other day with an </v>

2158
01:43:11.531 --> 01:43:15.820
<v Speaker 1>iphone to burst out laughing </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

2159
01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:17.650
<v Speaker 1>He got on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twitter is hilarious.</v>

2160
01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:19.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing about a tell.</v>

2161
01:43:19.710 --> 01:43:21.690
<v Speaker 1>It is a searching for status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

2162
01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:22.810
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2163
01:43:22.810 --> 01:43:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like a monk you that way.</v>

2164
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:25.740
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2165
01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:27.520
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's smart.</v>

2166
01:43:28.170 --> 01:43:29.620
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy.</v>

2167
01:43:29.621 --> 01:43:30.454
<v Speaker 1>He knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows what's healthy for them and </v>

2168
01:43:31.601 --> 01:43:33.970
<v Speaker 1>what's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So other than the cigarettes.</v>

2169
01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put all his other stuff.</v>

2170
01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.233

<v Speaker 3>because we're a big piece of poop that a</v>

2286
01:48:51.170 --> 01:48:53.430
<v Speaker 3>big duty copter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a weird rock.</v>

2287
01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:56.130
<v Speaker 3>I think now they said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2288
01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:56.993
<v Speaker 3>some like legit people said that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed speed and went in different </v>

2289
01:49:00.271 --> 01:49:01.180
<v Speaker 3>directions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>

2290
01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:03.510
<v Speaker 3>legit people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scientists.</v>

2291
01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:06.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>them guys said that it was a,</v>

2292
01:49:06.630 --> 01:49:08.730
<v Speaker 3>it could be something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could be.</v>

2293
01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:13.710
<v Speaker 3>What does Neil Degrassi say about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not talking right now.</v>

2294
01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:18.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little bit of a kerfuffle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kerfuffle.</v>

2295
01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:22.370
<v Speaker 3>What's his gym?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard scientists say aliens.</v>

2296
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Makes Bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interstellar object.</v>

2297
01:49:25.710 --> 01:49:26.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that.</v>

2298
01:49:26.791 --> 01:49:29.570
<v Speaker 3>And then I saw someone refuting </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists.</v>

2299
01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:32.040
<v Speaker 3>Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one wants to believe more than me,</v>

2300
01:49:32.041 --> 01:49:33.890
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on Joe.</v>

2301
01:49:33.891 --> 01:49:34.800
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2302
01:49:34.801 --> 01:49:37.830
<v Speaker 3>if I was going to mask my spaceship to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fly through the galaxy,</v>

2303
01:49:37.831 --> 01:49:39.450
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely make it look like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>big rock.</v>

2304
01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:41.340
<v Speaker 3>Big Asteroid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2305
01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't you driving through space?</v>
<v Speaker 3>May.</v>

2306
01:49:45.230 --> 01:49:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Maybe what they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2307
01:49:46.441 --> 01:49:47.950
<v Speaker 3>if we just make this thing</v>

2308
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:52.170
<v Speaker 1>drive by them and don't change speeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll have no idea.</v>

2309
01:49:52.230 --> 01:49:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Just destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be psyched that we missed them.</v>

2310
01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:55.793
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good call.</v>

2311
01:49:55.810 --> 01:49:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Good call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone just hits the gas.</v>

2312
01:49:58.751 --> 01:50:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fucking taking too long.</v>

2313
01:50:04.290 --> 01:50:07.780
<v Speaker 1>You got the fucking cops are behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Dave Shit.</v>

2314
01:50:07.870 --> 01:50:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave.</v>

2315
01:50:08.831 --> 01:50:11.440
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take all told you 65.</v>

2316
01:50:11.550 --> 01:50:12.383
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start throwing this weed out the </v>

2317
01:50:14.561 --> 01:50:15.394
<v Speaker 1>window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be so hard to believe a </v>

2318
01:50:17.230 --> 01:50:20.170
<v Speaker 1>space rock traveling through space?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the move,</v>

2319
01:50:20.171 --> 01:50:20.831
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2320
01:50:20.831 --> 01:50:23.530
<v Speaker 1>if they're so advanced they can travel </v>
<v Speaker 1>through galaxies.</v>

2321
01:50:23.531 --> 01:50:25.660
<v Speaker 1>They can make this shit look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything they want it to.</v>

2322
01:50:25.890 --> 01:50:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you doll it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Radiation pressure.</v>

2323
01:50:29.650 --> 01:50:32.020
<v Speaker 1>The only thing celebrating floors would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

2324
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no air and space,</v>

2325
01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:37.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wouldn't be aerodynamics.</v>

2326
01:50:37.091 --> 01:50:38.140
<v Speaker 1>What would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Momentum.</v>

2327
01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:39.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go down a little bit.</v>

2328
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:40.423
<v Speaker 2>I think it answers your question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If radiation pressure is the </v>

2329
01:50:42.311 --> 01:50:43.144
<v Speaker 2>accelerating forest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then own moma represents a new class of </v>

2330
01:50:48.431 --> 01:50:51.250
<v Speaker 2>thin interstellar material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2331
01:50:51.490 --> 01:50:53.680
<v Speaker 2>It has a different thing that it's using</v>
<v Speaker 2>for energy.</v>

2332
01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:58.990
<v Speaker 2>But as to what may have produced this </v>
<v Speaker 2>previously unseen material,</v>

2333
01:50:58.991 --> 01:50:59.824
<v Speaker 2>it could have emerged naturally from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>debris of the planet forming disc in a </v>

2334
01:51:02.831 --> 01:51:06.070
<v Speaker 2>distant solar system going through yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>an unknown process.</v>

2335
01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:07.653
<v Speaker 2>They've got a whole nother way to make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went from Toyota Corollas to this </v>

2336
01:51:10.211 --> 01:51:11.044
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2337
01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if that's what we find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing though,</v>

2338
01:51:15.650 --> 01:51:16.910
<v Speaker 1>that's what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2339
01:51:16.911 --> 01:51:17.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2340
01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:18.353
<v Speaker 1>like a rock a rock is not smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't necessarily need this </v>

2341
01:51:21.471 --> 01:51:22.304
<v Speaker 1>where I'm stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of many places where I'm </v>

2342
01:51:25.371 --> 01:51:26.204
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't necessarily need to be </v>

2343
01:51:27.531 --> 01:51:28.460
<v Speaker 1>aerodynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2344
01:51:28.461 --> 01:51:31.160
<v Speaker 1>because it's not going through air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vacuum of space.</v>

2345
01:51:31.190 --> 01:51:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2346
01:51:32.510 --> 01:51:35.270
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not wrong there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could actually look like a rock.</v>

2347
01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:36.193
<v Speaker 1>It comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only issue would be getting it into </v>

2348
01:51:37.101 --> 01:51:37.791
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2349
01:51:37.791 --> 01:51:38.624
<v Speaker 1>The aerodynamics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that you shooting it from a </v>

2350
01:51:40.701 --> 01:51:42.890
<v Speaker 1>planet with an atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2351
01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:45.230
<v Speaker 1>gravity not be talking about this way </v>
<v Speaker 1>too stupid.</v>

2352
01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:48.733
<v Speaker 1>If you shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're launching it from Earth into </v>

2353
01:51:51.111 --> 01:51:51.621
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2354
01:51:51.621 --> 01:51:52.454
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you had it encased in like this </v>

2355
01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:58.400
<v Speaker 1>outer area?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like the space shuttle is,</v>

2356
01:51:58.820 --> 01:51:59.653
<v Speaker 1>but then once you get to a place you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could jettison the outside of it just </v>

2357
01:52:02.901 --> 01:52:05.540
<v Speaker 1>like they get rid of those booster </v>
<v Speaker 1>rockets,</v>

2358
01:52:06.230 --> 01:52:08.210
<v Speaker 1>they just fall into the bucket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrate land on people,</v>

2359
01:52:08.211 --> 01:52:13.211
<v Speaker 1>whether fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has to happen.</v>

2360
01:52:13.450 --> 01:52:14.283
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting killed by a booster rocket flat </v>

2361
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:18.810
<v Speaker 1>space that you in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't integrate,</v>

2362
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:20.383
<v Speaker 1>but then they could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could release the shell and then </v>

2363
01:52:22.161 --> 01:52:22.994
<v Speaker 1>they would just have the rock and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock would move through space and it </v>

2364
01:52:25.371 --> 01:52:27.430
<v Speaker 1>didn't matter what shape it was because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the vacuum</v>

2365
01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:31.440
<v Speaker 2>or just get it up into orbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>orbit the space station.</v>

2366
01:52:31.441 --> 01:52:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Go and build it in pieces and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>launch it for sure.</v>

2367
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:35.703
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when that commander,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Hadfield gentleman was on the </v>

2368
01:52:38.171 --> 01:52:39.004
<v Speaker 1>podcast and he was talking about some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of magnet that they have that </v>

2369
01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:45.220
<v Speaker 1>collects subatomic</v>

2370
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:47.143
<v Speaker 4>out there in the galaxy and that we only</v>
<v Speaker 4>know five percent of what the universe </v>

2371
01:52:50.841 --> 01:52:52.220
<v Speaker 4>is made out of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2372
01:52:52.290 --> 01:52:55.010
<v Speaker 4>Talking about things like dark matter </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was five percent.</v>

2373
01:52:55.011 --> 01:52:55.844
<v Speaker 4>It's the guys scientists space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a real legit astronaut coming back from </v>

2374
01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:04.280
<v Speaker 4>six months in space or whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was there for and telling us this.</v>

2375
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:05.143
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow what we've talked about that like </v>

2376
01:53:08.570 --> 01:53:11.240
<v Speaker 4>you can hang with those guys for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little while and then you're like,</v>

2377
01:53:11.241 --> 01:53:14.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand what's happening now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also the.</v>

2378
01:53:14.450 --> 01:53:16.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing what we do know,</v>

2379
01:53:16.610 --> 01:53:17.443
<v Speaker 4>amazing that they can send a guy to </v>
<v Speaker 4>space and have them fly around the ISS </v>

2380
01:53:20.931 --> 01:53:21.711
<v Speaker 4>or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2381
01:53:21.711 --> 01:53:22.544
<v Speaker 4>I mean we'll talk about what you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying about why are we here and what </v>

2382
01:53:25.281 --> 01:53:27.920
<v Speaker 4>are we doing like we haven't developed </v>
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>

2383
01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:32.540
<v Speaker 4>Something that you can go the speed of </v>
<v Speaker 4>light we haven't,</v>

2384
01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.660
<v Speaker 4>but if we do then the whole universe is </v>
<v Speaker 4>open to us.</v>

2385
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:36.883
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the struggle of developing all </v>

2386
01:53:38.631 --> 01:53:42.320
<v Speaker 4>this stuff is to get to a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 4>level where we can really go.</v>

2387
01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:45.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they think the speed of </v>
<v Speaker 4>light is even good enough.</v>

2388
01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:46.420
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2389
01:53:46.450 --> 01:53:47.320
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dammit,</v>

2390
01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:48.163
<v Speaker 4>that was my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that like if you wanted to have </v>

2391
01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:56.240
<v Speaker 4>options available as to what planet </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna colonize,</v>

2392
01:53:56.770 --> 01:53:59.210
<v Speaker 4>you gotta have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what?</v>

2393
01:53:59.211 --> 01:54:00.044
<v Speaker 4>If you land on a planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did he land on a planet and it's </v>

2394
01:54:02.271 --> 01:54:02.631
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2395
01:54:02.631 --> 01:54:04.460
<v Speaker 4>it's 74 degrees out guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys,</v>

2396
01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:07.070
<v Speaker 4>it's all oxygen and nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like earth.</v>

2397
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:08.480
<v Speaker 4>Come on out here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on out here.</v>

2398
01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:13.430
<v Speaker 4>But it's only been like that for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years and then cycle is really fucked up</v>

2399
01:54:13.431 --> 01:54:16.670
<v Speaker 4>like 30 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be a nice age.</v>

2400
01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:17.783
<v Speaker 4>It will be for all the people have moved</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and they're going to freeze to </v>

2401
01:54:19.581 --> 01:54:20.980
<v Speaker 4>death is going to be no food at all.</v>

2402
01:54:21.310 --> 01:54:22.143
<v Speaker 4>Planet doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's all our science led us to </v>

2403
01:54:25.851 --> 01:54:28.100
<v Speaker 4>that I don't even know if we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>predict.</v>

2404
01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:29.353
<v Speaker 4>Here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can they accurately predict the </v>

2405
01:54:32.721 --> 01:54:33.554
<v Speaker 4>atmosphere and the conditions and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the temperature would be if a planet is </v>

2406
01:54:37.341 --> 01:54:38.174
<v Speaker 4>from a son,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like did they have a calculation where </v>

2407
01:54:39.381 --> 01:54:40.214
<v Speaker 4>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh this sun is this amount of big and </v>

2408
01:54:42.291 --> 01:54:43.124
<v Speaker 4>this planet is this far away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's definitely going to stay within </v>

2409
01:54:45.381 --> 01:54:47.660
<v Speaker 4>a certain temperature range for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire time that the planet.</v>

2410
01:54:47.690 --> 01:54:50.240
<v Speaker 4>Did they know that like within like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>death range?</v>

2411
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:55.040
<v Speaker 4>I think they must.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Death range is 40 degrees bro.</v>

2412
01:54:55.470 --> 01:54:56.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get to 140.</v>

2413
01:54:56.691 --> 01:54:57.311
<v Speaker 4>That's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2414
01:54:57.311 --> 01:54:58.190
<v Speaker 4>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2415
01:54:58.250 --> 01:55:00.860
<v Speaker 4>So like $100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred 40.</v>

2416
01:55:00.861 --> 01:55:02.450
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2417
01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:04.940
<v Speaker 4>You live in a sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to run out of water.</v>

2418
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:06.440
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think we're going to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2419
01:55:06.610 --> 01:55:07.443
<v Speaker 4>We're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're definitely not figuring it out </v>

2420
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:13.040
<v Speaker 4>because we're saying this amount of big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not even helping.</v>

2421
01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:16.970
<v Speaker 4>We're confusing the pro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but seriously think about that just as a</v>

2422
01:55:16.971 --> 01:55:19.190
<v Speaker 4>concept.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe that is it.</v>

2423
01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's baby all this like you keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>

2424
01:55:22.710 --> 01:55:23.543
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you talked a lot about all the robots </v>

2425
01:55:24.741 --> 01:55:26.000
<v Speaker 4>and the things that are moving us </v>
<v Speaker 4>forward,</v>

2426
01:55:26.001 --> 01:55:26.781
<v Speaker 4>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But why?</v>

2427
01:55:26.781 --> 01:55:29.690
<v Speaker 4>But why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had the cocoon theory before,</v>

2428
01:55:29.691 --> 01:55:33.080
<v Speaker 4>but maybe that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's so we can really go.</v>

2429
01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:33.973
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had the cocoon theory for quite a </v>

2430
01:55:35.171 --> 01:55:36.004
<v Speaker 4>while where I think that we are like </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of an electronic caterpillar </v>

2431
01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:43.950
<v Speaker 4>that's building some cocoon</v>

2432
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:46.670
<v Speaker 1>and then a butterfly is going to emerge </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when,</v>

2433
01:55:47.170 --> 01:55:49.950
<v Speaker 1>when as a collective like will all be </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of this.</v>

2434
01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:55.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean just the innovation and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers and the Ai and our integration</v>

2435
01:55:55.141 --> 01:55:55.974
<v Speaker 1>with them that eventually it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get smarter and crazier and </v>

2436
01:55:57.991 --> 01:56:01.770
<v Speaker 1>weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's only a matter of time before</v>

2437
01:56:01.771 --> 01:56:04.110
<v Speaker 1>they make something that resembles a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

2438
01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:09.930
<v Speaker 1>It sounds to a insular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2439
01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:13.800
<v Speaker 1>it sounds too insular that it would just</v>
<v Speaker 1>be for us to stay here on earth.</v>

2440
01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:15.113
<v Speaker 1>The universe is so vast that there may.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more likely that we're </v>

2441
01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:24.240
<v Speaker 1>going to go out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good idea.</v>

2442
01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:26.850
<v Speaker 1>This is the sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a sewer.</v>

2443
01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it though?</v>

2444
01:56:27.841 --> 01:56:28.770
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2445
01:56:28.771 --> 01:56:29.840
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's parts that.</v>

2446
01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:30.301
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2447
01:56:30.301 --> 01:56:31.134
<v Speaker 1>We have a lovely life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever been to Utah to skip or you </v>

2448
01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:35.660
<v Speaker 1>look at the stars or look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>

2449
01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:38.280
<v Speaker 1>beautiful clouds in the sky on a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>like today.</v>

2450
01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh my lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go outside.</v>

2451
01:56:40.630 --> 01:56:41.463
<v Speaker 1>This clouds float around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just gives you a just right amount of </v>

2452
01:56:43.141 --> 01:56:45.740
<v Speaker 1>sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of contrast is the best.</v>

2453
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why would,</v>

2454
01:56:47.010 --> 01:56:47.843
<v Speaker 1>how could you say this is a sewer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because so many parts that are </v>

2455
01:56:50.221 --> 01:56:54.150
<v Speaker 1>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many parts,</v>

2456
01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:55.560
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

2457
01:56:55.560 --> 01:57:00.180
<v Speaker 1>not so many parts because we still have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this evil,</v>

2458
01:57:00.270 --> 01:57:01.103
<v Speaker 1>this other stuff that's clog at each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and knocking each other and it's </v>

2459
01:57:03.511 --> 01:57:04.740
<v Speaker 1>still filled with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2460
01:57:04.741 --> 01:57:06.510
<v Speaker 1>but a murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not right here.</v>

2461
01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Not right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only in certain spots.</v>

2462
01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:10.553
<v Speaker 1>So this is the other thing that we tend </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do because we have 7 billion people </v>

2463
01:57:13.801 --> 01:57:16.300
<v Speaker 1>on the planet and cameras on all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2464
01:57:16.650 --> 01:57:17.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's got a camera and we're </v>

2465
01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:19.073
<v Speaker 1>exchanging these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're catching stories from an an </v>

2466
01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:26.540
<v Speaker 1>unimaginable number of humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2467
01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:28.650
<v Speaker 1>And so even if we're looking at just our</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

2468
01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:30.270
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people just to La.</v>

2469
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:31.520
<v Speaker 1>So many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's $20,</v>

2470
01:57:31.530 --> 01:57:32.760
<v Speaker 1>million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

2471
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:37.790
<v Speaker 1>What's really amazing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing is not just how far human beings</v>

2472
01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:42.090
<v Speaker 1>have come over the last hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200,</v>

2473
01:57:42.091 --> 01:57:45.270
<v Speaker 1>300 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's really amazing is if you just</v>

2474
01:57:45.271 --> 01:57:48.690
<v Speaker 1>look at the actual numbers of times that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people interact with each other,</v>

2475
01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:51.000
<v Speaker 1>how few of them are violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2476
01:57:51.150 --> 01:57:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Especially in a place like America in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2018.</v>

2477
01:57:54.930 --> 01:57:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I think about that on the freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All so many people because it just.</v>

2478
01:57:57.590 --> 01:58:01.230
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're all pretty much acting in an</v>

2479
01:58:01.231 --> 01:58:04.110
<v Speaker 1>orderly fashion to preserve themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and others.</v>

2480
01:58:04.170 --> 01:58:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2481
01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:06.433
<v Speaker 1>You ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every now and then you have someone </v>

2482
01:58:07.591 --> 01:58:09.930
<v Speaker 1>that's just crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just violates all the rules.</v>

2483
01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:11.093
<v Speaker 1>Just weaving in traffic drive at 150 </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour in a residential </v>

2484
01:58:13.951 --> 01:58:16.410
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just a mutation.</v>

2485
01:58:16.830 --> 01:58:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's just a mutation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2486
01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:19.673
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is in the same way those </v>

2487
01:58:21.781 --> 01:58:25.230
<v Speaker 1>things exists in like a biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

2488
01:58:25.231 --> 01:58:25.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2489
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:27.660
<v Speaker 1>You can get these little diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bugs.</v>

2490
01:58:27.690 --> 01:58:29.500
<v Speaker 1>It's little things that are off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2491
01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:31.260
<v Speaker 1>and then you have an immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The battles,</v>

2492
01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:32.280
<v Speaker 1>the bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2493
01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:33.473
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see stuff about </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees are and there's like </v>

2494
01:58:37.051 --> 01:58:38.790
<v Speaker 1>everyone's getting along trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>their thing,</v>

2495
01:58:38.791 --> 01:58:41.100
<v Speaker 1>their struggles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's a real mutation.</v>

2496
01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:42.153
<v Speaker 1>Like there's someone that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one that kills the rest of them </v>

2497
01:58:43.901 --> 01:58:45.810
<v Speaker 1>and won't be part of the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2498
01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:46.673
<v Speaker 1>that's what we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have these kind of like renegade </v>

2499
01:58:50.410 --> 01:58:51.243
<v Speaker 1>mutations run by evil swipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should all go back to what's </v>

2500
01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.530
<v Speaker 1>interesting is done in large groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2501
01:58:56.531 --> 01:59:00.190
<v Speaker 1>And all of us together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way we interact with each other</v>

2502
01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:01.233
<v Speaker 1>is generally nonviolent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever these large groups will decide </v>

2503
01:59:06.730 --> 01:59:07.960
<v Speaker 1>by whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2504
01:59:08.050 --> 01:59:11.800
<v Speaker 1>whoever's in charge to attack other </v>
<v Speaker 1>large groups.</v>

2505
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:16.300
<v Speaker 1>And this is where the big death comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

2506
01:59:16.301 --> 01:59:16.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2507
01:59:16.570 --> 01:59:19.630
<v Speaker 1>This is where the real toll comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>in war.</v>

2508
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2509
01:59:20.741 --> 01:59:21.574
<v Speaker 1>but if you looked at the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities of people from one side or </v>

2510
01:59:25.001 --> 01:59:28.240
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the groups themselves together,</v>

2511
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:31.000
<v Speaker 1>how much are they really in conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>with those other people?</v>

2512
01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:32.133
<v Speaker 1>Probably not nearly as much as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are in charge would want </v>

2513
01:59:34.841 --> 01:59:35.800
<v Speaker 1>them to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which.</v>

2514
01:59:35.810 --> 01:59:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is that.</v>

2515
01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:38.553
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the mutation is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>charge because you take two groups that </v>

2516
01:59:42.161 --> 01:59:42.994
<v Speaker 1>are at war and you put them together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just hanging out drinking beer </v>

2517
01:59:44.591 --> 01:59:46.000
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all the same age.</v>

2518
01:59:46.001 --> 01:59:47.950
<v Speaker 1>There was probably have a great time </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

2519
01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:51.040
<v Speaker 1>They're leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk them into leaders or the mutation.</v>

2520
01:59:51.041 --> 01:59:51.874
<v Speaker 1>That's when things get scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's the Hitler leader or you </v>

2521
01:59:54.670 --> 01:59:57.420
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea do whatever the Russians do,</v>

2522
01:59:57.580 --> 01:59:58.413
<v Speaker 1>dating places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're talking people into invading </v>

2523
02:00:00.191 --> 02:00:01.024
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

2524
02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:05.440
<v Speaker 1>That's some slip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every justification.</v>

2525
02:00:05.441 --> 02:00:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2526
02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:07.810
<v Speaker 1>that's where the world gets very </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>

2527
02:00:07.811 --> 02:00:12.100
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's interesting that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in those groups,</v>

2528
02:00:12.490 --> 02:00:13.323
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all come from all over the world or all </v>

2529
02:00:14.771 --> 02:00:16.940
<v Speaker 1>over the country list all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different place in,</v>

2530
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:18.730
<v Speaker 1>they're brought together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2531
02:00:18.731 --> 02:00:19.564
<v Speaker 1>But look how we've progressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's fewer of those kinds of </v>

2532
02:00:21.431 --> 02:00:23.590
<v Speaker 1>conflicts now than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2533
02:00:23.591 --> 02:00:24.424
<v Speaker 1>But you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of other people would </v>

2534
02:00:26.111 --> 02:00:27.640
<v Speaker 1>like it to be zero amount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2535
02:00:27.670 --> 02:00:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Donald,</v>

2536
02:00:28.630 --> 02:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's ever gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

2537
02:00:30.011 --> 02:00:30.844
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing to say because you </v>

2538
02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:33.513
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would like everybody to be in a good </v>

2539
02:00:34.661 --> 02:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>place in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll,</v>

2540
02:00:36.630 --> 02:00:37.463
<v Speaker 1>I almost wonder if like many things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like this push of good things </v>

2541
02:00:41.591 --> 02:00:43.690
<v Speaker 1>happening in band things positive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>

2542
02:00:43.691 --> 02:00:44.524
<v Speaker 1>and that this battle between the two of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them is what creates all this momentum </v>

2543
02:00:47.801 --> 02:00:48.634
<v Speaker 1>and all this movement.</v>

2544
02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:51.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're back to the good and evil.</v>

2545
02:00:51.401 --> 02:00:53.260
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we should go back to church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2546
02:00:53.970 --> 02:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>the priests did some weird stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe we.</v>

2547
02:00:57.480 --> 02:00:59.800
<v Speaker 1>It's good people in there more than evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2548
02:00:59.950 --> 02:01:00.783
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is with that church in </v>

2549
02:01:03.041 --> 02:01:03.874
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still shielding the people that </v>

2550
02:01:06.011 --> 02:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>have done terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2551
02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just no denying that there's.</v>

2552
02:01:10.090 --> 02:01:10.923
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at everything that's come </v>

2553
02:01:13.181 --> 02:01:14.650
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no denying that.</v>

2554
02:01:14.820 --> 02:01:18.580
<v Speaker 1>That's super unfortunate because I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of the people that are</v>

2555
02:01:18.581 --> 02:01:22.270
<v Speaker 1>involved in the religion that aren't the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are pedophiles,</v>

2556
02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I think they're very good people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably think about it the same way.</v>

2557
02:01:25.631 --> 02:01:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your daughter would like to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

2558
02:01:27.290 --> 02:01:31.780
<v Speaker 1>that some place where people can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and they exchange affection and</v>

2559
02:01:31.781 --> 02:01:32.614
<v Speaker 1>comradery and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this acceptance of something higher </v>

2560
02:01:35.261 --> 02:01:38.650
<v Speaker 1>than them that holds them to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard and wants to be good people.</v>

2561
02:01:38.651 --> 02:01:40.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's for everybody.</v>

2562
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:40.963
<v Speaker 3>Good for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it wasn't for all that kid </v>

2563
02:01:42.681 --> 02:01:45.860
<v Speaker 3>fucking oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kid fucking just ruined all that.</v>

2564
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:47.060
<v Speaker 3>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2565
02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.910
<v Speaker 3>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a sad,</v>

2566
02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:51.470
<v Speaker 3>sad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google this,</v>

2567
02:01:51.471 --> 02:01:52.304
<v Speaker 3>because I've said this many times and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never bothered looking at it up </v>

2568
02:01:56.040 --> 02:01:58.660
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why we can get another bottle</v>

2569
02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:02.040
<v Speaker 3>that if you want to get fucked up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>holidays.</v>

2570
02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so holidays,</v>

2571
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:06.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

2572
02:02:06.290 --> 02:02:08.270
<v Speaker 3>lot of sediment in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What were we just talking about?</v>

2573
02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:09.853
<v Speaker 3>Good and evil and the priests and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>why they're ruining your own use to go </v>

2574
02:02:13.611 --> 02:02:14.510
<v Speaker 3>get that video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look.</v>

2575
02:02:14.511 --> 02:02:15.860
<v Speaker 3>Something up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You haven't looked before.</v>

2576
02:02:15.890 --> 02:02:17.450
<v Speaker 3>Reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2577
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:18.430
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

2578
02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:20.203
<v Speaker 3>Thought that was gone forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I voted the reason why they forced </v>

2579
02:02:23.930 --> 02:02:27.710
<v Speaker 3>priest to be celibate because what I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>heard.</v>

2580
02:02:28.090 --> 02:02:29.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it?</v>

2581
02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:30.913
<v Speaker 3>This is not no scholarly work of my own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember even reading the </v>

2582
02:02:34.821 --> 02:02:35.120
<v Speaker 3>article.</v>

2583
02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:39.300
<v Speaker 3>I think somebody told it to me that </v>
<v Speaker 3>priests were banging too many chips.</v>

2584
02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might've said it in that way.</v>

2585
02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:44.770
<v Speaker 3>Too many chicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2586
02:02:44.780 --> 02:02:46.760
<v Speaker 3>They made a mess out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which I think.</v>

2587
02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:48.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think it is?</v>

2588
02:02:48.621 --> 02:02:52.160
<v Speaker 3>I think it was property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that when priests,</v>

2589
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:57.430
<v Speaker 3>priests owned property and if they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>married and he died,</v>

2590
02:02:57.740 --> 02:02:58.573
<v Speaker 3>she would keep the property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there was no woman involved and he </v>

2591
02:03:02.031 --> 02:03:02.864
<v Speaker 3>owned the property and he couldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a woman and he swore that he was </v>

2592
02:03:06.141 --> 02:03:09.500
<v Speaker 3>just with Jesus when he died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the property went to the church.</v>

2593
02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:12.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2594
02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:13.730
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2595
02:03:13.730 --> 02:03:15.740
<v Speaker 3>which is not much of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2596
02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:18.170
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wow.</v>

2597
02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:19.123
<v Speaker 3>That whole other part of Catholicism is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing that bumps me all the </v>

2598
02:03:21.531 --> 02:03:22.640
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go to the Vatican,</v>

2599
02:03:22.650 --> 02:03:23.510
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2600
02:03:23.511 --> 02:03:26.000
<v Speaker 3>this is beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what were they?</v>

2601
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.550
<v Speaker 3>Get all this art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where'd they get all these bills?</v>

2602
02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:34.180
<v Speaker 3>The pillaging of fuck of religions where</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit stolen from a time where people</v>

2603
02:03:35.121 --> 02:03:39.800
<v Speaker 3>are starving in the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this is how powerful religion is.</v>

2604
02:03:39.801 --> 02:03:40.634
<v Speaker 3>This is how powerful this pull is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>search for good and to be a part of </v>

2605
02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:48.560
<v Speaker 3>something is in light of those things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you see the wealth.</v>

2606
02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:49.993
<v Speaker 3>It's like going into like a pirate ship </v>
<v Speaker 3>and seeing all the shit that they got </v>

2607
02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:54.950
<v Speaker 3>and then knowing what they do with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>

2608
02:03:55.940 --> 02:03:59.450
<v Speaker 3>both those things are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should just say,</v>

2609
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:01.040
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be.</v>

2610
02:04:01.070 --> 02:04:02.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be a part of this at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

2611
02:04:03.110 --> 02:04:04.170
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2612
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:08.570
<v Speaker 3>the other part of it is so strong that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually will kind of say,</v>

2613
02:04:08.571 --> 02:04:09.171
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2614
02:04:09.171 --> 02:04:09.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2615
02:04:09.890 --> 02:04:11.510
<v Speaker 3>but I'm still going to go to mass on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunday.</v>

2616
02:04:11.810 --> 02:04:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2617
02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:15.260
<v Speaker 3>what that means is you think that even </v>
<v Speaker 3>if a priest is bad,</v>

2618
02:04:15.261 --> 02:04:17.940
<v Speaker 3>that the religion is still good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2619
02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:18.590
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2620
02:04:18.590 --> 02:04:19.423
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea is that this is like a bad guy </v>

2621
02:04:21.111 --> 02:04:21.944
<v Speaker 3>who lost his way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of human beings that are </v>

2622
02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:25.813
<v Speaker 3>flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got a lot of them are drunk two men who </v>

2623
02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:32.630
<v Speaker 3>read my grandma's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2624
02:04:32.890 --> 02:04:34.730
<v Speaker 3>my grandma's eulogy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2625
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:37.250

<v Speaker 3>He kept calling her Geraldine.</v>

2626
02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:38.473
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2627
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:40.220
<v Speaker 1>they had to correct them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Josephine,</v>

2628
02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:41.073
<v Speaker 1>like he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was saying all these great things </v>

2629
02:04:42.301 --> 02:04:43.134
<v Speaker 1>about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know who he was and he had </v>

2630
02:04:45.151 --> 02:04:46.260
<v Speaker 1>those Jim Blossoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2631
02:04:46.261 --> 02:04:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Jamie brought it into the bottle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine.</v>

2632
02:04:47.670 --> 02:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike savage,</v>

2633
02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:49.740
<v Speaker 1>savage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

2634
02:04:49.860 --> 02:04:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2635
02:04:51.901 --> 02:04:52.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2636
02:04:52.530 --> 02:04:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2637
02:04:53.611 --> 02:04:54.444
<v Speaker 1>you take a guy and you put them in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>position where he can't have a </v>

2638
02:04:56.341 --> 02:04:59.400
<v Speaker 1>companion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not allowed to have a love.</v>

2639
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.800
<v Speaker 1>He can't have a wife or a husband or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2640
02:05:01.801 --> 02:05:02.634
<v Speaker 1>You can't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowable thing fighting </v>

2641
02:05:04.620 --> 02:05:05.453
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a kid that I went to high </v>

2642
02:05:06.751 --> 02:05:08.460
<v Speaker 1>school with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2643
02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:10.790
<v Speaker 1>became a priest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all knew.</v>

2644
02:05:11.970 --> 02:05:15.180
<v Speaker 1>We all knew like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a thing you knew like,</v>

2645
02:05:15.210 --> 02:05:16.500
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why it's going to be a priest.</v>

2646
02:05:16.530 --> 02:05:17.311
<v Speaker 1>We get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2647
02:05:17.311 --> 02:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what a lot of people say.</v>

2648
02:05:18.580 --> 02:05:19.413
<v Speaker 1>It's like that the church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other side of the church doesn't </v>

2649
02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:22.914
<v Speaker 1>create pedophiles that like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution attracts them because they </v>

2650
02:05:26.671 --> 02:05:28.350
<v Speaker 1>know they'll be safe there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2651
02:05:28.351 --> 02:05:29.184
<v Speaker 1>it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also possible that so many of </v>

2652
02:05:31.231 --> 02:05:32.064
<v Speaker 1>them that are active in the church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what this guy's story </v>

2653
02:05:34.111 --> 02:05:35.310
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I barely knew him,</v>

2654
02:05:35.850 --> 02:05:38.850
<v Speaker 1>but that he could have been molested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean is not.</v>

2655
02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:43.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not a small number of kids that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were molested to very large,</v>

2656
02:05:43.150 --> 02:05:43.983
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you would never mean who the fuck </v>

2657
02:05:46.231 --> 02:05:47.064
<v Speaker 1>understands what that would be like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a young boy to have that happen to </v>

2658
02:05:51.001 --> 02:05:51.834
<v Speaker 1>you and then get groomed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>indoctrinated into being a part of this </v>

2659
02:05:55.111 --> 02:05:57.330
<v Speaker 1>thing that does that other young boys in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

2660
02:05:57.610 --> 02:06:00.420
<v Speaker 1>So your whole reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has to be with some of them are,</v>

2661
02:06:00.630 --> 02:06:03.770
<v Speaker 1>and they're all doing this under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blanket of this thing called the church.</v>

2662
02:06:03.790 --> 02:06:04.623
<v Speaker 1>Then when the church finds out about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the church moves people to all these </v>

2663
02:06:06.781 --> 02:06:07.614
<v Speaker 1>different various places and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get these new victims and this </v>

2664
02:06:11.821 --> 02:06:13.350
<v Speaker 1>happens over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2665
02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:16.740
<v Speaker 1>this was one of the things that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying about benedict about.</v>

2666
02:06:16.741 --> 02:06:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one who before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

2667
02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had actively done that.</v>

2668
02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:24.260
<v Speaker 1>He adapted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was stolen people.</v>

2669
02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a part of that.</v>

2670
02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:28.440
<v Speaker 1>So bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so bad,</v>

2671
02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:33.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's such a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was married Catholic priests there.</v>

2672
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps 120 in the US already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's how well it was this a new thing.</v>

2673
02:06:38.540 --> 02:06:40.620
<v Speaker 1>The other article I found that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 200.</v>

2674
02:06:41.190 --> 02:06:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As of 1980,</v>

2675
02:06:43.441 --> 02:06:48.441
<v Speaker 1>there was a rule change or an adoption </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a rule change that allowed it.</v>

2676
02:06:48.540 --> 02:06:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Why does it say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it say eastern only?</v>

2677
02:06:50.490 --> 02:06:51.323
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it's saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was something in the story of the video </v>

2678
02:06:53.161 --> 02:06:54.790
<v Speaker 1>that was going to just kind of pause it </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2679
02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Why is he eastern Catholic like East </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coast,</v>

2680
02:06:57.391 --> 02:06:58.830

<v Speaker 1>west coast?</v>

2681
02:06:58.831 --> 02:06:59.664
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Mexicans are not by the Catholic </v>

2682
02:07:04.441 --> 02:07:08.070
<v Speaker 1>homes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>married in the United States.</v>

2685
02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:17.513
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be great to policy change by </v>

2686
02:07:19.771 --> 02:07:20.604
<v Speaker 1>Pope John Paul the second in 1980,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which offered a path for married </v>

2687
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:24.263
<v Speaker 1>Episcopal priest to continue their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ministry after converting to </v>

2688
02:07:26.941 --> 02:07:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2689
02:07:28.741 --> 02:07:32.970
<v Speaker 1>so you have to be a priest already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Episcopalian,</v>

2690
02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:36.460
<v Speaker 1>and then you're allowed to have a wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>and kids if you're Episcopalian,</v>

2691

<v Speaker 3>A convert to Catholicism right there.</v>

2693
02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:45.600
<v Speaker 3>Like Cat Catholicism is the only one </v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't allow them to have sex.</v>

2694
02:07:45.850 --> 02:07:46.630
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:52.953
<v Speaker 3>cut the shit we were at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are actually at mass and he was </v>

2698
02:07:55.421 --> 02:07:56.254
<v Speaker 3>talking about there was one thing from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the gospel that was talking about being </v>

2699
02:07:59.921 --> 02:08:01.360
<v Speaker 3>married,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being with a woman,</v>

2700
02:08:01.690 --> 02:08:04.540
<v Speaker 3>and then he finishes his answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cheers.</v>

2701
02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:06.940
<v Speaker 3>Happy holiday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He finishes the,</v>

2702
02:08:06.941 --> 02:08:08.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he finishes the,</v>

2703
02:08:09.260 --> 02:08:10.093
<v Speaker 3>a sermon and then the reading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he goes into a sermon all about </v>

2704
02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:17.680
<v Speaker 3>being with a woman and this is a man </v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't come close to that.</v>

2705
02:08:18.090 --> 02:08:18.923
<v Speaker 3>This is a man that has no experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be so much better for the </v>

2706
02:08:21.791 --> 02:08:24.010
<v Speaker 3>church if he wasn't married man with </v>
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

2707
02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:26.980
<v Speaker 3>And then he could really talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>being in a family like,</v>

2708
02:08:26.981 --> 02:08:27.814
<v Speaker 3>who are you?</v>

<v Speaker 3>a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was an adult,</v>

2712
02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:39.760
<v Speaker 3>but I would be curious to be there to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a husband and wife sitting there in this</v>

2713

<v Speaker 4>to go on that Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though they hate it.</v>

2792
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:38.450
<v Speaker 4>Important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The limelight is a gym.</v>

2793
02:12:38.451 --> 02:12:42.360
<v Speaker 4>Now you have the limelight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was a fishbone at the line.</v>

2794
02:12:42.510 --> 02:12:45.590
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the limelight does the dance club?</v>

2795
02:12:45.591 --> 02:12:47.510
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is now a fitness.</v>

2796
02:12:47.930 --> 02:12:50.510
<v Speaker 4>It was a church.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell what it was a market too.</v>

2797
02:12:50.511 --> 02:12:52.790
<v Speaker 4>It was a church.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a rock club,</v>

2798
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:53.743
<v Speaker 4>so it doesn't last.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They started selling shit and sell that </v>

2799
02:12:55.851 --> 02:12:56.461
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that.</v>

2800
02:12:56.461 --> 02:12:57.171
<v Speaker 4>It's your house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom.</v>

2801
02:12:57.171 --> 02:12:58.004
<v Speaker 4>Papa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that would inspire you to get your </v>

2802
02:12:59.691 --> 02:13:01.250
<v Speaker 4>party rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Live in a church.</v>

2803
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:03.560
<v Speaker 4>It's the gym now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do.</v>

2804
02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:05.540
<v Speaker 4>I would work out and that church all </v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

2805
02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:09.380
<v Speaker 4>That would be my spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if I had a gym at my house,</v>

2806
02:13:09.470 --> 02:13:12.830
<v Speaker 4>I would definitely go to that gym just </v>
<v Speaker 4>to feel the juice.</v>

2807
02:13:13.700 --> 02:13:16.020
<v Speaker 4>Like I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say I tell people all the time,</v>

2808
02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:19.430
<v Speaker 4>she always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like working out like at my studio,</v>

2809
02:13:19.431 --> 02:13:20.264
<v Speaker 4>but I like going to places too because </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you go to a place like there's a </v>

2810
02:13:24.321 --> 02:13:27.260
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of juice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know you're in a new spot.</v>

2811
02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:30.050
<v Speaker 4>People around you that you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2812
02:13:30.051 --> 02:13:32.880
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're out and it's also as a comic,</v>

2813
02:13:32.881 --> 02:13:37.881
<v Speaker 4>I think social interaction is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>least respected ingredients to our weird</v>

2814
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:44.340
<v Speaker 4>sort of a stew of things that come </v>
<v Speaker 4>together and make a bit.</v>

2815
02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.800
<v Speaker 4>You got to fill the well with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with those experiences.</v>

2816
02:13:46.801 --> 02:13:47.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to talk to people.</v>

2817
02:13:48.290 --> 02:13:50.940
<v Speaker 4>It's like reading or just being out in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

2818
02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:52.180
<v Speaker 4>It's important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2819
02:13:52.230 --> 02:13:52.660
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2820
02:13:52.660 --> 02:13:55.920
<v Speaker 4>it just all like all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like reading is one thing you needed to,</v>

2821
02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:58.170
<v Speaker 4>but I think like interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2822
02:13:58.171 --> 02:14:00.420
<v Speaker 4>it's just too goddamn gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So important.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am the,</v>

2824
02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:06.480

<v Speaker 2>You're isolated and because I have to </v>

2854
02:15:27.451 --> 02:15:29.880
<v Speaker 2>write this monologue each week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need inspiration.</v>

2855
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:33.300
<v Speaker 2>I really want to shine a light on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>good people out in the country.</v>

2856
02:15:34.230 --> 02:15:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I started talking to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't take my headphones out.</v>

2857
02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:38.093
<v Speaker 2>I talked to the driver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to the people next to me if </v>

2858
02:15:39.751 --> 02:15:43.830
<v Speaker 2>they want to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is talking about filling the well</v>

2859
02:15:43.831 --> 02:15:45.760
<v Speaker 2>for your comedic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2860
02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:49.140
<v Speaker 2>toolbox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the greatest thing in the world.</v>

2861
02:15:49.490 --> 02:15:52.590
<v Speaker 2>There's billions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all are unique.</v>

2862
02:15:52.591 --> 02:15:56.040
<v Speaker 2>They all have a story to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's foolish.</v>

2863
02:15:56.070 --> 02:15:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Let's be as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to talk to these.</v>

2864
02:15:57.940 --> 02:16:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Be Harsh here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not all</v>

2865
02:16:00.580 --> 02:16:02.110
<v Speaker 4>have a story to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of them,</v>

2866
02:16:02.111 --> 02:16:03.910
<v Speaker 4>they might have a story to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't want to hear it.</v>

2867
02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:05.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some are bad,</v>

2868
02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:11.040
<v Speaker 4>some are disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking story has a story.</v>

2869
02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:14.860
<v Speaker 4>Got a deal that you're going to get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of stories.</v>

2870
02:16:14.890 --> 02:16:16.720
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be coming your way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do though.</v>

2871
02:16:16.750 --> 02:16:18.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even like the biggest slug,</v>

2872
02:16:18.821 --> 02:16:19.654
<v Speaker 4>you'll find.</v>

2873
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:22.850
<v Speaker 2>You talked to them about their family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about their childhood,</v>

2874
02:16:22.851 --> 02:16:24.480
<v Speaker 2>about where they're growing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up with.</v>

2875
02:16:24.990 --> 02:16:26.180
<v Speaker 2>There is a story there.</v>

2876
02:16:26.290 --> 02:16:27.123
<v Speaker 4>Here's his way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take the biggest loser that ever </v>

2877
02:16:30.131 --> 02:16:33.790
<v Speaker 4>existed on planet earth and if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>discovered him on Mars,</v>

2878
02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:38.820
<v Speaker 4>it's the biggest store in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Cow.</v>

2879
02:16:40.670 --> 02:16:41.503
<v Speaker 4>This true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some guy wearing a doggy mass jerking </v>

2880
02:16:45.281 --> 02:16:46.114
<v Speaker 4>off with a bathrobe on on Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be like the most important </v>

2881
02:16:48.821 --> 02:16:51.940
<v Speaker 4>thing that's ever happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on the CNN fuck out.</v>

2882
02:16:51.941 --> 02:16:56.190
<v Speaker 4>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this can't be real closer.</v>

2883
02:16:56.240 --> 02:17:01.240
<v Speaker 4>I show you I'm real old man with donkey </v>
<v Speaker 4>ass beaten off.</v>

2884
02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:03.033
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you found an old man with a </v>

2885
02:17:03.911 --> 02:17:08.911
<v Speaker 4>donkey mask beaten off in Venice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm still impressed.</v>

2886
02:17:09.010 --> 02:17:13.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm still shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I said Tom Papa,</v>

2887
02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:17.530
<v Speaker 4>get your life savings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you say yes or no?</v>

2888
02:17:17.590 --> 02:17:18.423
<v Speaker 4>There is currently a man with a donkey </v>
<v Speaker 4>mask on wearing a bathrobe jerking off </v>

2889
02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:25.150
<v Speaker 4>in Venice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2890
02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:26.890
<v Speaker 4>You might.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might want to lean.</v>

2891
02:17:26.891 --> 02:17:27.740
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might.</v>

2892
02:17:28.450 --> 02:17:30.880
<v Speaker 4>If they're bringing it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be super suspicious.</v>

2893
02:17:30.881 --> 02:17:32.080
<v Speaker 4>They'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's your question.</v>

2894
02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:33.840
<v Speaker 4>Favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not An underdog on that.</v>

2895
02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:36.790
<v Speaker 4>My question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My question is,</v>

2896
02:17:36.791 --> 02:17:39.340
<v Speaker 4>do you think that it ever happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>

2897
02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:40.953
<v Speaker 4>Everything you can think of is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>confident that someone has jerked off </v>

2898
02:17:43.510 --> 02:17:47.530
<v Speaker 4>with a donkey mask on 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a hotel bathrobe.</v>

2899
02:17:47.590 --> 02:17:49.450
<v Speaker 4>Especially in Venice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all about masks.</v>

2900
02:17:49.630 --> 02:17:51.910
<v Speaker 4>In Venice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 100 percent confident that I can say</v>

2901
02:17:51.911 --> 02:17:53.800
<v Speaker 4>historically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

2902
02:17:54.010 --> 02:17:55.720
<v Speaker 4>Everything you can think of as having a </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech,</v>

2903
02:17:55.721 --> 02:17:56.441
<v Speaker 4>not Venice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Italy.</v>

2904
02:17:56.441 --> 02:17:57.710
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Venice beach.</v>

2905
02:17:57.711 --> 02:17:58.320
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2906
02:17:58.320 --> 02:17:58.780
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2907
02:17:58.780 --> 02:17:59.613
<v Speaker 4>No Venice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2908
02:17:59.630 --> 02:18:02.580
<v Speaker 4>Venice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Italy with all the bright.</v>

2909
02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:04.870
<v Speaker 4>With all the Catholic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2910
02:18:05.650 --> 02:18:07.480
<v Speaker 4>And Post the water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get nine people panic.</v>

2911
02:18:08.610 --> 02:18:10.360
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I ask you guys a question?</v>

2912
02:18:10.690 --> 02:18:13.300
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2913
02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:14.453
<v Speaker 4>backed away at the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast when I was talking about wine </v>

2914
02:18:16.661 --> 02:18:20.380
<v Speaker 4>and trying to learn about it and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one thing I don't know about wine is</v>

2915
02:18:20.381 --> 02:18:22.810
<v Speaker 4>when I do drink it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never feel that drunk.</v>

2916
02:18:23.710 --> 02:18:26.950
<v Speaker 4>And we've had a bottle and a half now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do I seem drunk?</v>

2917
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:28.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you seem pretty fucked up.</v>

2918
02:18:28.241 --> 02:18:29.440
<v Speaker 4>Don't tell me anything you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell me.</v>

2919
02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:35.830
<v Speaker 4>Do I seem that different from before?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you were also fucked up too,</v>

2920
02:18:35.831 --> 02:18:37.060
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2921
02:18:37.090 --> 02:18:38.350
<v Speaker 4>you seem fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2922
02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:40.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I always get home and I'm like,</v>

2923
02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:44.620
<v Speaker 4>I have to say I was kept my shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>together pretty good.</v>

2924
02:18:45.130 --> 02:18:46.480
<v Speaker 4>And then I wake up the next morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2925
02:18:46.481 --> 02:18:47.314
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

2926
02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:48.610
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2927
02:18:48.611 --> 02:18:51.850
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you'll hear yourself like on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast if you get really lit.</v>

2928
02:18:52.030 --> 02:18:54.100
<v Speaker 4>Like when we did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sober October podcast,</v>

2929
02:18:54.101 --> 02:18:56.320
<v Speaker 4>I saw one of the clips realized that </v>
<v Speaker 4>truck.</v>

2930
02:18:56.330 --> 02:18:57.490
<v Speaker 4>We were words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw the clip.</v>

2931
02:18:57.491 --> 02:18:58.600
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

2932
02:18:58.601 --> 02:19:00.970
<v Speaker 4>We were blasted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're in orbit.</v>

2933
02:19:00.971 --> 02:19:02.130
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2934
02:19:03.330 --> 02:19:05.860
<v Speaker 4>I was listening to myself talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're so hammered.</v>

2935
02:19:06.390 --> 02:19:07.223
<v Speaker 4>It's so stupid because I want to be like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a gentleman that can drink and alcohol </v>

2936
02:19:10.571 --> 02:19:12.310
<v Speaker 4>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sir,</v>

2937
02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:13.810
<v Speaker 4>if that is your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have achieved it.</v>

2938
02:19:13.870 --> 02:19:14.703
<v Speaker 4>Cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cheers.</v>

2939
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:16.480
<v Speaker 4>Happy holidays.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was certainly a.</v>

2940
02:19:16.580 --> 02:19:18.740
<v Speaker 4>because you don't seem and you did more </v>
<v Speaker 4>than I did.</v>

2941
02:19:20.940 --> 02:19:22.960
<v Speaker 4>And you see them exactly the same as </v>
<v Speaker 4>when we started.</v>

2942
02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:24.460
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're projecting.</v>

2943
02:19:24.550 --> 02:19:26.950
<v Speaker 4>There was one point when after you </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoked a lot,</v>

2944
02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:29.000
<v Speaker 4>you were going to need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I did more than you.</v>

2945
02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:31.260
<v Speaker 4>I can tell it was a bit of a body high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2946
02:19:31.261 --> 02:19:36.261
<v Speaker 4>that weight is strong as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's benefit to it.</v>

2947
02:19:38.090 --> 02:19:38.923
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you should do everything </v>

2948
02:19:40.401 --> 02:19:41.900
<v Speaker 4>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think there's benefit.</v>

2949
02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:44.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you should exercise all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time either.</v>

2950
02:19:45.050 --> 02:19:45.883
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was flying back from New York </v>

2951
02:19:47.301 --> 02:19:50.750
<v Speaker 4>yesterday and knew he had this when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was on the flight,</v>

2952
02:19:50.751 --> 02:19:53.210
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking it would be so nice to </v>
<v Speaker 4>bring a bottle of wine,</v>

2953
02:19:53.490 --> 02:19:56.480
<v Speaker 4>just chill with the guys and this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be so happy.</v>

2954
02:19:56.481 --> 02:19:58.310
<v Speaker 4>And now that we're in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2955
02:19:58.400 --> 02:19:59.233
<v Speaker 4>So happy.</v>

2956
02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:02.240
<v Speaker 4>So happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good place.</v>

2957
02:20:02.450 --> 02:20:04.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm worried about Jamie's hips,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie's hips,</v>

2958
02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:06.310
<v Speaker 4>so bugging,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that.</v>

2959
02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:07.153
<v Speaker 4>So the soul right actually helped a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really slant on it and breathe in and </v>

2960
02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:11.751
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2961
02:20:11.751 --> 02:20:13.840
<v Speaker 4>I have not used that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bought two of them.</v>

2962
02:20:13.841 --> 02:20:15.650
<v Speaker 4>I bought one for the House and one for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the gym,</v>

2963
02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:16.783
<v Speaker 4>but that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called a so right for your so ass </v>

2964
02:20:19.390 --> 02:20:20.223
<v Speaker 4>muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you lay on it and have it like </v>

2965
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:25.970
<v Speaker 4>massage your inner gut area and works </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

2966
02:20:25.971 --> 02:20:29.810
<v Speaker 4>Apparently that's like a muscle that </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets knotted up on people and I had,</v>

2967
02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:32.940
<v Speaker 4>I definitely got it get knotted up on me</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was a.</v>

2968
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:33.823
<v Speaker 4>I was running a little too often,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was running like four or five days a </v>

2969
02:20:37.701 --> 02:20:39.050
<v Speaker 4>week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was starting to not up.</v>

2970
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:42.830
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a foam roller,</v>

2971
02:20:42.831 --> 02:20:43.664
<v Speaker 4>but like if you could have an elbow on </v>
<v Speaker 4>that phone and you lay on it on your </v>

2972
02:20:49.251 --> 02:20:51.200
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a couple of different spots too.</v>

2973
02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:53.210
<v Speaker 4>They have like a spot in your shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the front.</v>

2974
02:20:53.211 --> 02:20:54.370
<v Speaker 4>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2975
02:20:54.380 --> 02:20:55.790
<v Speaker 4>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My pelvis area.</v>

2976
02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:57.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that looks nice but it helped.</v>

2977
02:20:57.311 --> 02:20:58.190
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel good?</v>

2978
02:20:58.250 --> 02:20:59.660
<v Speaker 4>That looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2979
02:20:59.661 --> 02:21:00.890
<v Speaker 4>you got to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

2980
02:21:00.930 --> 02:21:04.520
<v Speaker 4>The human bodies all manipulatable </v>
<v Speaker 4>malleable.</v>

2981
02:21:04.580 --> 02:21:06.440
<v Speaker 4>That's why yoga is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2982
02:21:06.500 --> 02:21:08.480
<v Speaker 4>Stretching in general like all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2983
02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:09.733
<v Speaker 4>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's just so weird how like deep </v>

2984
02:21:11.331 --> 02:21:12.164
<v Speaker 4>tissue massage and all that stuff works </v>
<v Speaker 4>and how your body's like pliable stuff </v>

2985
02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:19.150
<v Speaker 4>loose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

2986
02:21:19.151 --> 02:21:21.500
<v Speaker 4>Some things up and someone is really </v>
<v Speaker 4>good at it.</v>

2987
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:23.450
<v Speaker 4>If you get a Gao and knows how to use </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2988
02:21:23.451 --> 02:21:27.910
<v Speaker 4>Elbows and you needed a man fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uhm,</v>

2989
02:21:28.310 --> 02:21:30.980
<v Speaker 4>I started running with my dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with my lab.</v>

2990
02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:32.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2991
02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:35.570
<v Speaker 4>but I run on the road and the sidewalk </v>
<v Speaker 4>is um.</v>

2992
02:21:35.930 --> 02:21:37.130
<v Speaker 4>Do you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2993
02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:38.473
<v Speaker 4>I feel so guilty sometimes that it's got</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little paws out just running on the </v>

2994
02:21:41.721 --> 02:21:42.554
<v Speaker 4>road.</v>

2995
02:21:42.620 --> 02:21:45.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it hot?</v>

2996
02:21:45.410 --> 02:21:49.160
<v Speaker 4>You worried about like the hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's the hardness of it.</v>

2997
02:21:49.980 --> 02:21:51.620
<v Speaker 4>Which streets?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>

2998
02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:53.180
<v Speaker 4>I never thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem unhappy.</v>

2999
02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:54.770
<v Speaker 4>She seems like she's having a blast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

3000
02:21:54.771 --> 02:21:56.660
<v Speaker 4>Well it's definitely not as good as </v>
<v Speaker 4>running the dirt.</v>

3001
02:21:57.170 --> 02:21:57.860
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3002
02:21:57.860 --> 02:21:59.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean probably for us either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3003
02:21:59.870 --> 02:22:00.950
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3004
02:22:00.980 --> 02:22:02.330
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

3005
02:22:02.610 --> 02:22:03.443
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not as much give and whenever I </v>

3006
02:22:04.491 --> 02:22:06.590
<v Speaker 4>see people running in the cities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

3007
02:22:06.591 --> 02:22:08.360
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to exercise?</v>

3008
02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:11.180
<v Speaker 4>You decided to make this whole world </v>
<v Speaker 4>your gym.</v>

3009
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:15.410
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw her the other day.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Amen.</v>

3017
02:22:36.570 --> 02:22:37.403
<v Speaker 4>That's why I like robbing though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I like running because as </v>

3018
02:22:39.151 --> 02:22:39.984
<v Speaker 4>soon as you go out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it and the other nice body </v>

<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>

3082
02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:49.300
<v Speaker 4>don't go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ted saying,</v>

3083
02:25:51.070 --> 02:25:51.903
<v Speaker 4>if a friend tried to ask me if they </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that they should exercise that </v>

3084
02:25:56.261 --> 02:25:58.050
<v Speaker 4>right to freedom and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3085
02:25:58.060 --> 02:25:58.893
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get harassed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to get harassed like I w </v>

3086
02:26:01.090 --> 02:26:01.923
<v Speaker 4>would you wear like Bikini underwear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Walked through a gay neighborhood on </v>

3087
02:26:06.011 --> 02:26:07.840
<v Speaker 4>Saturday night at 10:30</v>
<v Speaker 4>PM.</v>

3088
02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:08.943
<v Speaker 4>When the ecstasy just kicked in to dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a piece of meat to how good do </v>

3089
02:26:15.761 --> 02:26:20.140
<v Speaker 4>you think you'd feel walking through </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a super duper gay neighborhood with</v>

3090
02:26:20.141 --> 02:26:25.141
<v Speaker 4>like little bikini briefs on sandbars </v>
<v Speaker 4>Santa and for whatever reason,</v>

3091
02:26:25.841 --> 02:26:28.000
<v Speaker 4>you obviously shave your chest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny.</v>

3092
02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:32.260
<v Speaker 4>Maybe your chest is smooth as baby but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But your back has hair on it.</v>

3093
02:26:32.290 --> 02:26:35.320
<v Speaker 4>It's funny because you're setting it up </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a predatory kind of scenario,</v>

3094
02:26:35.321 --> 02:26:38.810
<v Speaker 4>but all I'm thinking is would they think</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was okay with like,</v>

3095
02:26:39.170 --> 02:26:40.003
<v Speaker 4>would they like me?</v>

3096
02:26:42.220 --> 02:26:43.570
<v Speaker 4>Would you be pumped?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her disgusted?</v>

3097
02:26:43.690 --> 02:26:45.730
<v Speaker 4>You'd know you'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't want the hassle.</v>

3098
02:26:45.850 --> 02:26:47.360
<v Speaker 4>That's what I tell my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3099
02:26:47.370 --> 02:26:48.203
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand that there's like a cool </v>

3100
02:26:51.430 --> 02:26:56.430
<v Speaker 4>movement now and it's a time when women </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be able to go out there and dress</v>

3101
02:26:56.721 --> 02:26:58.180
<v Speaker 4>the way you want to dress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not their problem.</v>

3102
02:26:58.181 --> 02:27:00.610
<v Speaker 4>It's the guy's problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's correct the guys rather than us.</v>

3103
02:27:00.730 --> 02:27:01.690
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that,</v>

3104
02:27:02.110 --> 02:27:04.600
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of guys that hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>been corrected yet.</v>

3105
02:27:04.810 --> 02:27:08.200
<v Speaker 4>Who are going to hassle you and follow </v>
<v Speaker 4>you in the parking lot.</v>

3106
02:27:08.470 --> 02:27:09.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the problem.</v>

3107
02:27:10.030 --> 02:27:12.550
<v Speaker 4>Those guys aren't woke once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's all.</v>

3108
02:27:12.551 --> 02:27:13.130
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

3109
02:27:13.130 --> 02:27:13.963
<v Speaker 4>It'll be dangerous word to use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like people are going to market </v>

3110
02:27:16.390 --> 02:27:18.100
<v Speaker 4>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woke woke.</v>

3111
02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:18.993
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3112
02:27:20.411 --> 02:27:23.920
<v Speaker 4>unironically super slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see a trap coming.</v>

3113

3115
02:27:27.850 --> 02:27:29.560
<v Speaker 4>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know where this leads.</v>

3116
02:27:32.110 --> 02:27:33.540
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how I feel.</v>

3117
02:27:33.541 --> 02:27:34.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see that woke thing.</v>

3121
02:27:40.450 --> 02:27:42.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes from my 16 year old,</v>

3122
02:27:42.491 --> 02:27:44.500
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kids today,</v>

3123

<v Speaker 4>It means your brain is open.</v>

3124
02:27:48.341 --> 02:27:50.470
<v Speaker 4>You're open to stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your problem is.</v>

3125
02:27:50.471 --> 02:27:54.850
<v Speaker 4>There's no real quantification.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no real.</v>

3126
02:27:55.090 --> 02:27:58.300
<v Speaker 4>There's no test you take to show that if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're woke.</v>

3127
02:27:58.560 --> 02:27:59.300
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3128
02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:00.133
<v Speaker 4>Like if you want to be a mathematician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to fucking show that you know </v>

3129
02:28:03.370 --> 02:28:05.470
<v Speaker 4>how to do math.</v>

3133
02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:14.830
<v Speaker 4>phd in mathematics.</v>

02:28:17.530 --> 02:28:19.360
<v Speaker 4>I know how this stuff works.</v>

3137
02:28:19.420 --> 02:28:21.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but wokeness,</v>

3138
02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:23.480
<v Speaker 4>anybody can claim to be a master of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wokeness.</v>

3139
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:27.080
<v Speaker 4>It's like Kung Fu without fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very dangerous.</v>

3140
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:27.943
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's defined what's woke and what's </v>

3141
02:28:29.541 --> 02:28:31.960
<v Speaker 4>preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's defined what's,</v>

3142
02:28:32.020 --> 02:28:35.060
<v Speaker 4>what's just not racist and sexist and </v>
<v Speaker 4>not homophobic,</v>

3143
02:28:35.061 --> 02:28:39.860
<v Speaker 4>but open minded and aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>failings and the misgivings of all sides</v>

3144
02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:42.190
<v Speaker 4>of us and with no bias.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3145
02:28:42.290 --> 02:28:42.800
<v Speaker 4>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3146
02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:44.600
<v Speaker 4>because it doesn't seem like it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that woke?</v>

3147
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:45.463
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>

3148
02:28:45.530 --> 02:28:47.540
<v Speaker 4>I think you just described what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought it was.</v>

3149
02:28:47.541 --> 02:28:49.610
<v Speaker 4>I would like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but too many people could jump in.</v>

3150
02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:50.653
<v Speaker 4>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no real clear understanding of </v>

3151
02:28:53.571 --> 02:28:56.960
<v Speaker 4>like what makes it constitutes someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>being like,</v>

3152
02:28:56.990 --> 02:28:57.823
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many of those boxes do you have to </v>

3153

<v Speaker 4>check it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like stopped Tom?</v>

3154
02:29:00.831 --> 02:29:03.950
<v Speaker 4>Papa had a woke academy and you took </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people.</v>

3155
02:29:04.810 --> 02:29:08.990
<v Speaker 4>It would just been to you like bread or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not like bread claiming wokeness.</v>

3156
02:29:09.350 --> 02:29:13.610
<v Speaker 4>Super slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's his 62 New York Times magazine or</v>

<v Speaker 4>into talking the way that made them seem</v>

3166
02:29:40.821 --> 02:29:41.654
<v Speaker 4>more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say it the way I would say </v>

<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>

3196
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:57.620
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're woke,</v>

3197
02:30:57.890 --> 02:30:58.830
<v Speaker 4>you dig it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3198
02:30:58.840 --> 02:30:59.960
<v Speaker 4>If you're woke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you dig it.</v>

3199
02:31:00.290 --> 02:31:01.580
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sums it up,</v>

3200
02:31:01.581 --> 02:31:03.110
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're woke,</v>

3201
02:31:03.140 --> 02:31:05.600
<v Speaker 4>you dig it after a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>how'd you find this?</v>

3202
02:31:05.601 --> 02:31:07.020
<v Speaker 4>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come back to that typed in.</v>

3203
02:31:07.560 --> 02:31:10.250
<v Speaker 4>It's like know your meme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

3204
02:31:10.310 --> 02:31:13.220
<v Speaker 4>So the meme of the word woke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3205
02:31:13.970 --> 02:31:15.920
<v Speaker 4>Look at that little image though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scroll back up.</v>

3206
02:31:15.921 --> 02:31:17.960
<v Speaker 4>So it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so strange.</v>

3207
02:31:17.961 --> 02:31:20.130
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shift was contemporary.</v>

3208
02:31:20.470 --> 02:31:23.100
<v Speaker 4>Like if that was your world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like imagine if hipsters all of a sudden</v>

3209
02:31:23.101 --> 02:31:24.840
<v Speaker 4>started wearing tails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So their jackets,</v>

3210
02:31:27.390 --> 02:31:32.390
<v Speaker 4>they just decided this is the next level</v>
<v Speaker 4>of bow ties and those tails.</v>

3211
02:31:32.980 --> 02:31:36.720
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be surprising because that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>all about just doing what you guys don't</v>

3212
02:31:36.721 --> 02:31:40.080
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what a weird look though.</v>

3213
02:31:40.250 --> 02:31:41.700
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is so weird.</v>

3214
02:31:42.270 --> 02:31:44.010
<v Speaker 4>That's a look that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3215
02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:47.460
<v Speaker 4>so like the guy in the center,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like those two guys,</v>

3216
02:31:47.461 --> 02:31:49.950
<v Speaker 4>both of Gods in the center.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those guys will fly today.</v>

3217
02:31:50.190 --> 02:31:52.560
<v Speaker 4>Oh totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy in the left that looks like he's</v>

3218
02:31:52.561 --> 02:31:54.930
<v Speaker 4>dressed like he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That looks like me on the road,</v>

3219
02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:57.473
<v Speaker 4>but he looks like he's an acquaintance </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tarantino movie or something like he's </v>

3220
02:32:00.030 --> 02:32:02.280
<v Speaker 4>reservoir dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's totally normal.</v>

3221
02:32:02.281 --> 02:32:04.530
<v Speaker 4>Really blend the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Black suit tie,</v>

3222
02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:05.633
<v Speaker 4>that'll door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can go to any restaurant anywhere and </v>

3223
02:32:07.741 --> 02:32:09.300
<v Speaker 4>no one would even bat an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>

3224
02:32:09.301 --> 02:32:11.310
<v Speaker 4>Whoa sir,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I help you?</v>

3225
02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:12.233
<v Speaker 4>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in with the gun image guy next to </v>

3226
02:32:14.641 --> 02:32:16.770
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But those two guys on the end,</v>

3227
02:32:17.100 --> 02:32:18.540
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what in the fuck are they?</v>

3228
02:32:18.570 --> 02:32:19.403
<v Speaker 4>He's got a coat with tails and those </v>
<v Speaker 4>pants that are like flat across your </v>

3229
02:32:24.031 --> 02:32:25.950
<v Speaker 4>crotch where it looks like you have no </v>
<v Speaker 4>privates.</v>

3230
02:32:25.980 --> 02:32:30.090
<v Speaker 4>Here's a good way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if you're dating a gal and a guy</v>

3231
02:32:30.100 --> 02:32:32.300
<v Speaker 4>come over and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're really gonna.</v>

3232
02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:34.050
<v Speaker 4>Love my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an amazing guy.</v>

3233
02:32:34.350 --> 02:32:39.350
<v Speaker 4>He's real old school and dressed like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that with coat tails.</v>

3234
02:32:41.311 --> 02:32:43.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you start feeling like you're like,</v>

3235
02:32:43.381 --> 02:32:44.214
<v Speaker 4>you're in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get out and he's got a handlebar </v>

3236
02:32:46.441 --> 02:32:48.330
<v Speaker 4>mustache.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got tails.</v>

3237
02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:49.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weird,</v>

3238
02:32:49.290 --> 02:32:51.300
<v Speaker 4>weird pants with the going to funny </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoes.</v>

3239
02:32:51.301 --> 02:32:52.134
<v Speaker 4>You see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get Out.</v>

3240
02:32:52.370 --> 02:32:53.203
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I finally watched it during sober </v>

3241
02:32:54.451 --> 02:32:55.141
<v Speaker 4>October.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3242
02:32:55.141 --> 02:32:56.640
<v Speaker 4>you did?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking fantastic.</v>

3243
02:32:56.670 --> 02:32:57.503
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

3244
02:32:57.520 --> 02:33:00.570
<v Speaker 4>But that's what you'd be thinking if </v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy was dressed like that,</v>

3245
02:33:00.730 --> 02:33:01.563
<v Speaker 4>but the daughter was going to lead you </v>
<v Speaker 4>to something and you have to run for </v>

3246
02:33:03.091 --> 02:33:03.924
<v Speaker 4>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it is weird how like that suit has </v>

3247
02:33:07.531 --> 02:33:11.430
<v Speaker 4>lasted a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well this was 1960,</v>

3248
02:33:11.431 --> 02:33:15.240
<v Speaker 4>so I'm assuming that it was mocking the </v>
<v Speaker 4>style of old.</v>

3249
02:33:15.270 --> 02:33:16.103
<v Speaker 4>So by the time 1960 rolled around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guys in the middle where trust </v>

3250
02:33:18.271 --> 02:33:20.110
<v Speaker 4>contemporary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the guys at the end,</v>

3251
02:33:20.111 --> 02:33:22.590
<v Speaker 4>they're like making fun of people the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way they used to dress.</v>

3252
02:33:22.680 --> 02:33:24.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kind of in a way or at least that's what</v>

3253
02:33:24.901 --> 02:33:26.820
<v Speaker 4>represents those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3254
02:33:26.950 --> 02:33:27.783
<v Speaker 4>It just defines their time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy was probably around the 18 </v>

3255
02:33:30.001 --> 02:33:33.090
<v Speaker 4>hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where were those other guys are?</v>

3256
02:33:33.900 --> 02:33:36.690
<v Speaker 4>Do you know who those guys are?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe Noah Webster.</v>

3257
02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:38.470
<v Speaker 4>Webster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Webster dictionary.</v>

3258
02:33:38.471 --> 02:33:40.650
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's got the pen and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>scratching his head.</v>

3259
02:33:40.651 --> 02:33:44.980
<v Speaker 4>Is that guys putting out his slang?</v>
<v Speaker 4>His slang is making websites.</v>

3260
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:46.580
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

3261
02:33:46.650 --> 02:33:47.483
<v Speaker 4>that's not how you really say it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it would be like the urban </v>

3262
02:33:49.441 --> 02:33:50.310
<v Speaker 4>dictionary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3263
02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:52.650
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie and I sometimes get confused.</v>

3264
02:33:52.651 --> 02:33:53.484
<v Speaker 4>We have to pull up the urban dictionary </v>
<v Speaker 4>and find out what the real word of a </v>

3265
02:33:55.640 --> 02:33:57.570
<v Speaker 4>word means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's pull up woke.</v>

3266
02:33:58.090 --> 02:34:00.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>represented today.</v>

3267
02:34:01.290 --> 02:34:04.470
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No disrespect.</v>

3268
02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:05.513
<v Speaker 4>No cultural appropriation intended.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that it was invented actually </v>

3269
02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:11.400
<v Speaker 4>in the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really weird.</v>

3270
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:14.010
<v Speaker 4>It was just making a comeback,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking around when I typed in,</v>

3271
02:34:14.011 --> 02:34:15.980
<v Speaker 4>like what is woke to see if there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything and she,</v>

3272
02:34:15.990 --> 02:34:18.110
<v Speaker 4>if you dig it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you was saying</v>

3273
02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:18.993
<v Speaker 1>were knowledgeable about your community </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world with the willingness to </v>

3274
02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:26.640
<v Speaker 1>access and critique systems of </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppression a.</v>

3275
02:34:26.830 --> 02:34:30.310
<v Speaker 1>well that part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

3276
02:34:30.311 --> 02:34:33.490
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for sure if it really is a system</v>

3277
02:34:33.491 --> 02:34:34.324
<v Speaker 1>of oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do we decide what's the system </v>

3278
02:34:36.461 --> 02:34:40.330
<v Speaker 1>of oppression and what is sounds like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need Jordan Peterson,</v>

3279
02:34:40.331 --> 02:34:45.331
<v Speaker 1>weird human behavior that represents </v>
<v Speaker 1>that interact with each other on a grand</v>

3280
02:34:47.291 --> 02:34:48.910
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just,</v>

3281
02:34:48.911 --> 02:34:49.744
<v Speaker 1>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some legitimate systems of </v>

3282
02:34:53.591 --> 02:34:54.660
<v Speaker 1>oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3283
02:34:54.661 --> 02:34:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Real.</v>

3284
02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:58.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like figuring out which one it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3285
02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but putting that in,</v>

3286
02:35:00.820 --> 02:35:01.653
<v Speaker 1>that's what woke is like how do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you define what the system's </v>

3287
02:35:06.330 --> 02:35:07.000
<v Speaker 1>like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does,</v>

3288
02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:08.770
<v Speaker 1>where does the line get drawn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3289
02:35:08.910 --> 02:35:13.910
<v Speaker 1>It was the line like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do women have certain jobs?</v>

3290
02:35:15.701 --> 02:35:16.534
<v Speaker 1>White men have certain jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of that is because of </v>

3291
02:35:18.341 --> 02:35:19.670
<v Speaker 1>influence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of that,</v>

3292
02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:20.583
<v Speaker 1>because of their choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of that is just because of </v>

3293
02:35:22.181 --> 02:35:25.870
<v Speaker 1>natural proclivities towards certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

3294
02:35:26.100 --> 02:35:26.933
<v Speaker 2>Well then you're talking about people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are coming after the hierarchy and </v>

3295
02:35:30.481 --> 02:35:31.314
<v Speaker 2>if they're coming up to the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's to say that those people are in </v>

3296
02:35:33.871 --> 02:35:36.300
<v Speaker 2>part of the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Jordan Peterson.</v>

3297
02:35:36.301 --> 02:35:38.070
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like hammers.</v>

3298
02:35:38.071 --> 02:35:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3299
02:35:38.770 --> 02:35:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Well then what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you saying?</v>

3300
02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you buying into the hierarchy?</v>

3301
02:35:45.260 --> 02:35:48.800
<v Speaker 2>You're loved like the exasperations in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his ways.</v>

3302
02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:49.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>

3303
02:35:49.980 --> 02:35:53.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like then this true that that woke </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition was like,</v>

3304
02:35:53.220 --> 02:35:53.881
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>

3305
02:35:53.881 --> 02:35:54.714
<v Speaker 2>This is all about being nice and kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at the end it's about </v>

3306
02:35:56.461 --> 02:35:57.420
<v Speaker 2>attacking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3307
02:35:57.421 --> 02:35:58.380
<v Speaker 2>But here's the bad crazy.</v>

3308
02:35:58.380 --> 02:36:01.320
<v Speaker 1>The thing is the end part about </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking is where it gets weird because</v>

3309
02:36:02.700 --> 02:36:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson is the guy who gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly attacked,</v>

3310
02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:07.050
<v Speaker 1>misrepresented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

3311
02:36:07.090 --> 02:36:07.923
<v Speaker 1>Especially in terms of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is somehow or another a racist </v>

3312
02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:12.990
<v Speaker 1>because some racist like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that argument.</v>

3313
02:36:13.020 --> 02:36:14.730
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argument doesn't make any sense.</v>

3314
02:36:15.150 --> 02:36:17.220
<v Speaker 1>He's not a racist by any stretch of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

3315
02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:19.250
<v Speaker 1>He believes in individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3316
02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:23.550
<v Speaker 1>he's more Ian Rand then it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never say that.</v>

3317
02:36:23.551 --> 02:36:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know her name's Ian Rand,</v>

3318
02:36:25.141 --> 02:36:26.370
<v Speaker 1>but I always say I grind</v>

3319
02:36:26.830 --> 02:36:30.210
<v Speaker 2>really like a natural instinct to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>it up,</v>

3320
02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:31.193
<v Speaker 2>but it really is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His thing is it's like the power of the </v>

3321
02:36:33.721 --> 02:36:36.900
<v Speaker 2>individual and responsibility and doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>your thing and he's.</v>

3322
02:36:36.970 --> 02:36:37.790
<v Speaker 2>He's understanding.</v>

3323
02:36:37.790 --> 02:36:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Of course during this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course he's under attack,</v>

3324
02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:42.590
<v Speaker 1>but he's also under celebration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3325
02:36:42.650 --> 02:36:45.420
<v Speaker 1>he's under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been celebrated as well as attack,</v>

3326
02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:46.273
<v Speaker 1>but much more celebrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's under celebration more that he's </v>

3327
02:36:48.111 --> 02:36:49.070
<v Speaker 1>under attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

3328
02:36:49.071 --> 02:36:53.000
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to hear that viewpoint </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated in such a clear,</v>

3329
02:36:53.450 --> 02:36:56.420
<v Speaker 1>concise way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a genuine sweetheart of a guy.</v>

3330
02:36:56.810 --> 02:36:58.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if people knew him.</v>

3331
02:36:58.580 --> 02:36:59.413
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the thing is some of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>views are very powerful and polarizing </v>

3332
02:37:04.041 --> 02:37:09.041
<v Speaker 1>to some folks who have a specific idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of how things are and what things should</v>

3333
02:37:09.380 --> 02:37:12.950
<v Speaker 1>be and what would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What represents Transphobia,</v>

3334
02:37:13.010 --> 02:37:15.010
<v Speaker 1>what represents sexism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3335
02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:15.853
<v Speaker 1>these are all fascinating discussions as</v>
<v Speaker 1>long as everybody's just being rational </v>

3336
02:37:19.431 --> 02:37:20.140
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3337
02:37:20.140 --> 02:37:21.830
<v Speaker 1>and being honest about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3338
02:37:22.220 --> 02:37:23.350
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's moving,</v>

3339
02:37:24.090 --> 02:37:24.923
<v Speaker 1>it's moving the discussion forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you should hear all sides and </v>

3340
02:37:27.291 --> 02:37:29.870
<v Speaker 1>you should hear what he's saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3341
02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:33.910
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways is very true and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>real and it's like,</v>

3342
02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:34.873
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the presentation of it in these </v>

3343
02:37:35.871 --> 02:37:36.704
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's very brave because he </v>

3344
02:37:39.801 --> 02:37:44.090
<v Speaker 1>knows that anything he says there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a shitstorm in response.</v>

3345
02:37:44.300 --> 02:37:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very brave in that respect,</v>

3346
02:37:46.431 --> 02:37:47.264
<v Speaker 1>but it's also very brave in that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>done a tremendous amount of research on </v>

3347
02:37:51.591 --> 02:37:52.424
<v Speaker 1>all these different subjects he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about and when he talks about </v>

3348
02:37:54.921 --> 02:37:55.754
<v Speaker 1>something from a scientific perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not talking about it because it </v>

3349
02:37:57.741 --> 02:37:58.574
<v Speaker 1>aligns with his beliefs and he will in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact highlight things that don't align </v>

3350
02:38:01.731 --> 02:38:05.480
<v Speaker 1>with his beliefs and show that he has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole in some of his thinking.</v>

3351
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:06.110
<v Speaker 1>He'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>

3352
02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:08.450
<v Speaker 1>he'll pause in midsentence and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3353
02:38:08.451 --> 02:38:11.210
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he does.</v>

3354
02:38:11.450 --> 02:38:13.730
<v Speaker 1>He has a hundred percent of intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>honesty.</v>

3355
02:38:13.790 --> 02:38:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>

3356
02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:16.333
<v Speaker 1>he's not scared to take on this system </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the way people think and behave and </v>

3357
02:38:23.870 --> 02:38:27.020
<v Speaker 1>this system works both for really </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive,</v>

3358
02:38:27.050 --> 02:38:27.883
<v Speaker 1>open minded people that support most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that you and I probably </v>

3359
02:38:31.401 --> 02:38:32.234
<v Speaker 1>support and it also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The system is also in place for people </v>

3360
02:38:34.491 --> 02:38:35.324
<v Speaker 1>that have more stringent conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints and we have to look at </v>

3361
02:38:38.841 --> 02:38:39.260
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

3362
02:38:39.260 --> 02:38:40.093
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to debate whether someone's </v>

3363
02:38:41.901 --> 02:38:43.830
<v Speaker 1>opinions or one thing or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3364
02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:45.650
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you 100 percent.</v>

3365
02:38:45.740 --> 02:38:46.573
<v Speaker 1>The problem is when you start calling </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone a racist and calling someone a </v>

3366
02:38:49.131 --> 02:38:49.964
<v Speaker 1>racist because you think that racists </v>
<v Speaker 1>like him or calling someone the sexist </v>

3367
02:38:52.910 --> 02:38:57.050
<v Speaker 1>because you think that sexist like him </v>
<v Speaker 1>or because he say's says things that you</v>

3368
02:38:57.051 --> 02:38:57.884
<v Speaker 1>don't agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't agree with them and you </v>

3369
02:38:59.751 --> 02:39:04.340
<v Speaker 1>just dismissed them at this as this </v>
<v Speaker 1>really shallow sexist opinion.</v>

3370
02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:06.650
<v Speaker 1>The problem is other people got to read </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying.</v>

3371
02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:07.693
<v Speaker 1>They're going to look into it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to seem silly because the guy has </v>

3372
02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:15.440
<v Speaker 1>volumes and volumes and volumes that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could read and that he has books.</v>

3373
02:39:15.441 --> 02:39:18.200
<v Speaker 1>He has all these different lectures </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he discusses these things,</v>

3374
02:39:18.410 --> 02:39:21.230
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're discussing these things and really</v>

3375
02:39:21.231 --> 02:39:24.530
<v Speaker 1>complex and well thought out ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

3376
02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:26.810
<v Speaker 1>You can't say his race and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunate.</v>

3377
02:39:26.811 --> 02:39:29.510
<v Speaker 1>What's unfortunate is that he presents </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>

3378
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:33.970
<v Speaker 1>We should then our responsibility is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with the stuff,</v>

3379
02:39:34.190 --> 02:39:38.210
<v Speaker 1>deal with the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what does it matter who he is,</v>

3380
02:39:38.211 --> 02:39:41.180
<v Speaker 1>how he talks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he is and who cares,</v>

3381
02:39:41.210 --> 02:39:44.870
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is the idea is what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should all then,</v>

3382
02:39:45.260 --> 02:39:46.130
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

3383
02:39:46.220 --> 02:39:47.053
<v Speaker 1>Take it whether you like it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it and then wrestle that idea and </v>

3384
02:39:50.181 --> 02:39:51.014
<v Speaker 1>move it for 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also have to be aware that </v>

3385
02:39:53.061 --> 02:39:53.894
<v Speaker 1>there's a real problem and calling </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone a monster is not a monster </v>

3386
02:39:57.080 --> 02:39:58.850
<v Speaker 1>because then when real monsters come </v>
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>

3387
02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:00.840
<v Speaker 1>you already used that word up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3388
02:40:01.180 --> 02:40:02.013
<v Speaker 1>That's this is like you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful because there's real racist in </v>

3389
02:40:04.641 --> 02:40:06.020
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's real bad people,</v>

3390
02:40:06.410 --> 02:40:09.080
<v Speaker 1>so calling someone a bad person just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't agree with them,</v>

3391
02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:10.153
<v Speaker 1>you fall into a very slippery </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological trap and a lot of times </v>

3392
02:40:12.681 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 1>people it just to get attention.</v>

3393
02:40:14.370 --> 02:40:15.720
<v Speaker 1>They want to throw their hat into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ring.</v>

3394
02:40:15.870 --> 02:40:17.050
<v Speaker 1>They want their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

3395
02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:18.640
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their say they want,</v>

3396
02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:20.940
<v Speaker 1>they want to get it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to make an impact.</v>

3397
02:40:20.941 --> 02:40:22.140
<v Speaker 1>They want that love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3398
02:40:22.150 --> 02:40:22.983
<v Speaker 1>They want to be part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be part of the discussion and </v>

3399
02:40:24.541 --> 02:40:27.360
<v Speaker 1>they might have very strong beliefs that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think are correct,</v>

3400
02:40:27.540 --> 02:40:29.760
<v Speaker 1>but I guarantee if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>

3401
02:40:29.810 --> 02:40:32.040
<v Speaker 1>those strong beliefs are that Jordan is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a racist,</v>

3402
02:40:32.490 --> 02:40:35.480
<v Speaker 1>you don't know him well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you could write in.</v>

3403
02:40:35.610 --> 02:40:36.443
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you're really familiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of the things that he says </v>

3404
02:40:38.731 --> 02:40:41.100
<v Speaker 1>about race because he doesn't say </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything racist.</v>

3405
02:40:41.101 --> 02:40:42.890
<v Speaker 1>He talks in terms of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3406
02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:45.870
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he always emphasizes individuals.</v>

3407
02:40:47.250 --> 02:40:48.270
<v Speaker 1>The most important thing</v>

3408
02:40:48.270 --> 02:40:49.770
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Ian ran thing.</v>

3409
02:40:49.990 --> 02:40:51.600
<v Speaker 2>It's not about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3410
02:40:51.601 --> 02:40:52.434
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about the person you responsible </v>

3411
02:40:55.141 --> 02:40:55.974
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you doing you despite whatever comes at </v>

3412
02:40:58.141 --> 02:40:59.970
<v Speaker 2>you because everything's always going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come at you.</v>

3413
02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an.</v>

3414
02:41:00.450 --> 02:41:03.690
<v Speaker 1>And it's not a denial of racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Racism is fucking horrible.</v>

3415
02:41:03.691 --> 02:41:04.530
<v Speaker 1>But what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

3416
02:41:04.531 --> 02:41:05.364
<v Speaker 1>is saying that we can all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can all figure out a better way to </v>

3417
02:41:08.401 --> 02:41:12.750
<v Speaker 1>navigate this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the shitty way that racists and bad</v>

3418
02:41:12.751 --> 02:41:14.000
<v Speaker 1>people have done in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3419
02:41:15.100 --> 02:41:16.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of racist.</v>

3420
02:41:17.260 --> 02:41:18.093
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to put African Americans in my </v>

3421
02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Christmas village.</v>

3438
02:42:13.411 --> 02:42:14.244
<v Speaker 2>the culture of like a Alfalfa kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>representations of kids and slave </v>

<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I went through my grandmother's </v>

3441

02:44:29.141 --> 02:44:29.974
<v Speaker 4>There was another murder case and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>confiscated the Alexa because they know </v>

3488
02:44:33.850 --> 02:44:37.750
<v Speaker 4>the Alexa will have information from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>last four days up to the murder.</v>

<v Speaker 4>so this is.</v>

3493
02:44:45.131 --> 02:44:47.530
<v Speaker 4>What is this a doll that you could make </v>
<v Speaker 4>a slave?</v>

<v Speaker 4>play mobile or something to push the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lego rip off.</v>

3496
02:44:54.161 --> 02:44:56.110
<v Speaker 4>He's got lego hands chain around his </v>
<v Speaker 4>neck.</v>

3497
02:44:56.111 --> 02:44:58.000
<v Speaker 4>I'd be mad if I bought that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was a Lego.</v>

3498
02:44:58.300 --> 02:45:01.210
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like even if you were a kid,</v>

3499
02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:02.290
<v Speaker 4>your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

3500
02:45:02.291 --> 02:45:03.940
<v Speaker 4>I want Lego's and your parents brought </v>
<v Speaker 4>you that.</v>

3501
02:45:03.941 --> 02:45:04.421
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Wack ass.</v>

3503
02:45:08.930 --> 02:45:09.763
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to represent a pirate who </v>
<v Speaker 4>was formerly a slave in historical </v>

3504
02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:13.633
<v Speaker 4>context.</v>

3505
02:45:16.150 --> 02:45:16.983
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to write that sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then to make a new lego was a former </v>

3506
02:45:21.311 --> 02:45:24.490
<v Speaker 4>slave in a historical context on that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

3507
02:45:24.491 --> 02:45:25.324
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that means present a </v>

3508
02:45:27.311 --> 02:45:31.150
<v Speaker 4>pirate who was a former slave in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>historical context.</v>

3509
02:45:31.151 --> 02:45:33.400
<v Speaker 4>That means he escaped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

3510
02:45:33.401 --> 02:45:35.610
<v Speaker 4>but it's a weird way to put it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

3511
02:45:36.100 --> 02:45:41.100
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so ridiculous.</v>

3512
02:45:42.730 --> 02:45:45.280
<v Speaker 4>Racist Toi instructions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the news title.</v>

3513
02:45:46.570 --> 02:45:49.510

<v Speaker 4>We could get away with that.</v>

3518
02:46:05.470 --> 02:46:09.220
<v Speaker 4>We can make them kind of brownish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy looked like he had a tan.</v>

3519
02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:11.270

3537
02:46:50.570 --> 02:46:52.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm just asking tradition because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>grew up there.</v>

3538
02:46:52.670 --> 02:46:53.360
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3539
02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:56.360
<v Speaker 4>I never grew up that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You did church when you were a kid?</v>

3540
02:46:56.361 --> 02:46:56.901
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did,</v>

3541
02:46:56.901 --> 02:46:59.900
<v Speaker 4>but it was for a very short amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time to say I grew up that way.</v>

3542
02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:03.260
<v Speaker 4>It would be hard because it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was out by the time I was out of first</v>

3543
02:47:03.261 --> 02:47:04.850
<v Speaker 4>grade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3544
02:47:04.851 --> 02:47:07.130
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about putting me back in </v>
<v Speaker 4>for second grade,</v>

3545
02:47:07.131 --> 02:47:11.800
<v Speaker 4>but we moved from New Jersey to San </v>
<v Speaker 4>Francisco and uh,</v>

3546
02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:15.590
<v Speaker 4>we didn't find a Catholic school on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scale of Catholic schools.</v>

3547
02:47:15.591 --> 02:47:18.050
<v Speaker 4>Cost money to went to public school </v>
<v Speaker 4>after that.</v>

3548
02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:20.780
<v Speaker 4>But I was just done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hated it.</v>

3549
02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:23.900
<v Speaker 4>I was in fear of those fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3550
02:47:23.930 --> 02:47:26.090
<v Speaker 4>And your parents didn't take you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>church or make you go?</v>

3551
02:47:26.180 --> 02:47:27.013
<v Speaker 4>They did a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the idea was back then that if </v>

3552
02:47:29.061 --> 02:47:31.340
<v Speaker 4>you had kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wanted kids go to Catholic school,</v>

3553
02:47:31.610 --> 02:47:33.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that did that in</v>

3554
02:47:33.561 --> 02:47:34.880
<v Speaker 4>that neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was little,</v>

3555
02:47:34.881 --> 02:47:38.180
<v Speaker 4>it was just a normal thing you did and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were more strict and too.</v>

3556
02:47:38.181 --> 02:47:40.760
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing that was for sure though,</v>

3557
02:47:41.010 --> 02:47:44.210
<v Speaker 4>like I had a conversation with my mom </v>
<v Speaker 4>bought at once.</v>

3558
02:47:44.510 --> 02:47:45.201
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3559
02:47:45.201 --> 02:47:47.540
<v Speaker 4>your grades were way better when you and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a Catholic school.</v>

3560
02:47:47.570 --> 02:47:48.141
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3561
02:47:48.141 --> 02:47:50.990
<v Speaker 4>because it was fucking terrified to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

3562
02:47:51.020 --> 02:47:52.700
<v Speaker 4>They beat the shit out of you want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>live like that.</v>

3563
02:47:52.701 --> 02:47:54.980
<v Speaker 4>They never beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I definitely threatened me.</v>

3564
02:47:55.100 --> 02:47:55.761
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3565
02:47:55.761 --> 02:47:57.560
<v Speaker 4>They threatened to make me sit on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nail,</v>

3566
02:47:58.140 --> 02:48:00.220
<v Speaker 4>going to have to sit on a nail and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3567
02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:02.180
<v Speaker 4>in the closet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stay here all night.</v>

3568
02:48:02.181 --> 02:48:03.014
<v Speaker 4>I hope you brought your blanket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like really mean when you're </v>

3569
02:48:05.001 --> 02:48:06.860
<v Speaker 4>like a little six year old kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3570
02:48:06.861 --> 02:48:08.660
<v Speaker 4>that's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a weird,</v>

3571
02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:09.793
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we stuck with these people for nine </v>

3572
02:48:11.271 --> 02:48:16.160
<v Speaker 4>months and to also for me it's like my </v>
<v Speaker 4>parents were splitting up at the time,</v>

3573
02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:20.900
<v Speaker 4>so it was very confusing and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted things to have order to them,</v>

3574
02:48:20.901 --> 02:48:22.670
<v Speaker 4>so I wanted God to make sense.</v>

3575
02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:26.800
<v Speaker 4>I remember annoying people with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like six years old.</v>

3576
02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:29.390
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know any people talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>what God wants.</v>

3577
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.823
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>

3578
02:48:31.010 --> 02:48:32.750
<v Speaker 4>God says this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God wants that.</v>

3579
02:48:32.770 --> 02:48:33.470
<v Speaker 4>Like I would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3580
02:48:33.470 --> 02:48:34.303
<v Speaker 4>you would bug six years old because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a little kid who's dealing with my </v>

3581
02:48:37.401 --> 02:48:40.390
<v Speaker 4>parents splitting up and there didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>seem to be any order in the world and it</v>

3582
02:48:40.391 --> 02:48:41.630
<v Speaker 4>was very nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3583
02:48:42.050 --> 02:48:44.960
<v Speaker 4>So when I find when I went to Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 4>school,</v>

3584
02:48:44.961 --> 02:48:46.060
<v Speaker 4>when I first got there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

3585
02:48:46.110 --> 02:48:48.350
<v Speaker 4>I was happy that I was going to go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Catholic school,</v>

3586
02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:53.560
<v Speaker 4>but then as I experienced it at six </v>
<v Speaker 4>years old,</v>

3587
02:48:55.970 --> 02:48:57.290
<v Speaker 4>I started going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is ridiculous.</v>

3588
02:48:57.291 --> 02:48:58.540
<v Speaker 4>This doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3589
02:48:58.550 --> 02:49:00.140
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people are so mean.</v>

3590
02:49:00.570 --> 02:49:02.930
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're obviously being mean and nasty.</v>

3591
02:49:02.931 --> 02:49:03.764
<v Speaker 4>They're not comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was seeking as a six year old </v>

3592
02:49:05.751 --> 02:49:07.740
<v Speaker 4>comparing them to weigh like my was.</v>

3593
02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:08.583
<v Speaker 4>My mother was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are these ladies were nasty being </v>

3594
02:49:11.590 --> 02:49:12.720
<v Speaker 4>so mean and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

3595
02:49:12.721 --> 02:49:14.340
<v Speaker 4>they don't represent God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

3596
02:49:14.341 --> 02:49:15.174
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you could see kids getting in </v>

3597
02:49:18.301 --> 02:49:19.134
<v Speaker 4>trouble because their parents hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>paid for their lunch or these and there </v>

3598
02:49:21.580 --> 02:49:22.413
<v Speaker 4>was like this really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you tell your father to get that money </v>

3599
02:49:24.901 --> 02:49:25.734
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there was a weirdness to it that </v>

3600
02:49:27.061 --> 02:49:27.894
<v Speaker 4>just didn't seem loving or it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>seem like what I thought of when I </v>

3601
02:49:30.781 --> 02:49:31.530
<v Speaker 4>thought of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3602
02:49:31.530 --> 02:49:34.500
<v Speaker 4>Christ and when I thought of it seemed </v>
<v Speaker 4>to me like,</v>

3603
02:49:34.530 --> 02:49:37.170
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a dark little trap.</v>

3604
02:49:37.890 --> 02:49:38.723
<v Speaker 4>Get sucked into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's what's remarkable about that </v>

3605
02:49:41.371 --> 02:49:45.420
<v Speaker 4>is not just the age but that you went </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a really,</v>

3606
02:49:45.421 --> 02:49:46.254
<v Speaker 4>really meeting it in a very real way </v>
<v Speaker 4>because what was happening with your </v>

3607
02:49:48.271 --> 02:49:53.010
<v Speaker 4>family to like normally you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>turn that quickly.</v>

3608
02:49:53.150 --> 02:49:55.950
<v Speaker 4>Like within a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like by the time I was.</v>

3609
02:49:56.500 --> 02:49:57.333
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was over by the time I was out of </v>

3610
02:49:58.771 --> 02:49:59.604
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Usually that change doesn't happen for </v>

3611
02:50:01.290 --> 02:50:02.123
<v Speaker 4>15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years outside of beating me or doing </v>

3612
02:50:06.091 --> 02:50:07.510
<v Speaker 4>something sexual to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3613
02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:09.990
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mind fuck of dealing with those mean</v>

3614
02:50:09.991 --> 02:50:13.380
<v Speaker 4>nasty ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scared the shit out of me were crying.</v>

3615
02:50:13.381 --> 02:50:15.300
<v Speaker 4>They were calling me a baby because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was crying.</v>

3616
02:50:15.710 --> 02:50:16.800
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

3617
02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:17.753
<v Speaker 4>just not knowing how to deal with human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being when you're a six year old and </v>

3618
02:50:20.191 --> 02:50:22.620
<v Speaker 4>this is going down and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what have I done?</v>

3619
02:50:22.621 --> 02:50:23.454
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I went from always being with my </v>

3620
02:50:24.991 --> 02:50:27.840
<v Speaker 4>mom or being with my grandma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my grandfather.</v>

3621
02:50:27.841 --> 02:50:28.674
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything was cool and then all the </v>

3622
02:50:29.461 --> 02:50:31.800
<v Speaker 4>sudden you go in school and this is what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing in school.</v>

3623
02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:34.010
<v Speaker 4>I didn't go to kindergarten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to first grade.</v>

3624
02:50:34.010 --> 02:50:34.843
<v Speaker 4>It was the first thing I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so all of a sudden the first grade is </v>

3625
02:50:37.231 --> 02:50:40.170
<v Speaker 4>like instantaneously being connected to </v>
<v Speaker 4>these crazy ladies.</v>

3626
02:50:40.260 --> 02:50:41.220
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3627
02:50:41.250 --> 02:50:42.830
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>poor.</v>

3628
02:50:42.870 --> 02:50:43.703
<v Speaker 4>And then I would think about them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we'll kind of like </v>

3629
02:50:48.250 --> 02:50:49.083
<v Speaker 4>thinking about why this will mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember being six years old thinking </v>

3630
02:50:51.061 --> 02:50:52.520
<v Speaker 4>this right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like,</v>

3631
02:50:52.590 --> 02:50:54.510
<v Speaker 4>nobody probably loves them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't get.</v>

3632
02:50:54.600 --> 02:50:57.900
<v Speaker 4>They don't have a family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a boyfriend.</v>

3633
02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:00.120
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think at the time they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a girlfriend,</v>

3634
02:51:00.121 --> 02:51:03.540
<v Speaker 4>but maybe they do Holla,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for sure they didn't.</v>

3635
02:51:03.870 --> 02:51:06.540
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing was that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

3636
02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:09.240
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No connection with another human being.</v>

3637
02:51:09.430 --> 02:51:12.990
<v Speaker 4>What would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lonelier or more angered inducing.</v>

3638
02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:14.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just dark.</v>

3639
02:51:14.550 --> 02:51:16.200
<v Speaker 4>There weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There weren't loving people.</v>

3640
02:51:16.230 --> 02:51:19.410
<v Speaker 4>You know any of your children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They ask about it.</v>

3641
02:51:19.750 --> 02:51:20.910
<v Speaker 4>They didn't even bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

3642
02:51:20.990 --> 02:51:24.970
<v Speaker 4>we've talked about God and I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My.</v>

3643
02:51:25.040 --> 02:51:29.460
<v Speaker 4>My basic take is Jordan Peterson said </v>
<v Speaker 4>something really lovely.</v>

3644
02:51:29.820 --> 02:51:34.820
<v Speaker 4>He said he behaves as if God is real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He behaves as if God exists.</v>

3645
02:51:35.790 --> 02:51:36.623
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that he believes God exists because </v>

3646
02:51:38.010 --> 02:51:41.490
<v Speaker 4>that's sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a bit of an intellectual trap where</v>

3647
02:51:41.630 --> 02:51:43.020
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you believe God exists?</v>

3648
02:51:43.021 --> 02:51:43.780
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3649
02:51:43.780 --> 02:51:46.500
<v Speaker 4>define God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you're in the weeds.</v>

3650
02:51:46.540 --> 02:51:48.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because do you think that.</v>

3651
02:51:48.241 --> 02:51:50.040
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's a city in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>clouds.</v>

3652
02:51:50.130 --> 02:51:51.620
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't right now.</v>

3653
02:51:51.640 --> 02:51:54.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think that there's an energy</v>

3654
02:51:54.391 --> 02:51:55.224
<v Speaker 4>like we were talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible that there's something </v>

3655
02:51:57.451 --> 02:51:58.650
<v Speaker 4>bigger than all of this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3656
02:51:58.651 --> 02:52:01.980
<v Speaker 4>this bigger than everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you talk to an aunt and said,</v>

3657
02:52:01.981 --> 02:52:03.000
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think their cities,</v>

3658
02:52:03.001 --> 02:52:04.550
<v Speaker 4>its skyscrapers and airplanes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3659
02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:06.170
<v Speaker 4>what are you fucking moron?</v>

3660
02:52:06.200 --> 02:52:07.001
<v Speaker 1>Get out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

3661
02:52:07.001 --> 02:52:07.834
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to drag this dead bug around </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking anyway for your fucking galaxy </v>

3662
02:52:12.191 --> 02:52:13.024
<v Speaker 1>talk universe talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck out of here with your five </v>

3663
02:52:15.401 --> 02:52:18.190
<v Speaker 1>g pitch at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragging this bug.</v>

3664
02:52:19.690 --> 02:52:20.523
<v Speaker 1>I mean in our perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're talking about things like </v>

3665
02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:26.920
<v Speaker 1>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so small,</v>

3666
02:52:27.240 --> 02:52:31.570
<v Speaker 1>we're the way we interface with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So crude even though it's amazing.</v>

3667
02:52:32.110 --> 02:52:32.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I liked the idea of the not going </v>

3668
02:52:35.381 --> 02:52:38.680
<v Speaker 2>into the whole intellectual discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>about God,</v>

3669
02:52:38.681 --> 02:52:40.420
<v Speaker 2>but just like just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3670
02:52:41.140 --> 02:52:43.180
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of act like he does exist.</v>

3671
02:52:43.210 --> 02:52:44.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a great way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does make you.</v>

3672
02:52:44.621 --> 02:52:47.830
<v Speaker 2>It does make you act a little kinder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3673
02:52:48.140 --> 02:52:49.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like a parent figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3674
02:52:49.930 --> 02:52:50.763
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to do this because it's </v>

3675
02:52:52.301 --> 02:52:53.410
<v Speaker 2>going to make them unhappy.</v>

3676
02:52:53.670 --> 02:52:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I try to do what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I'm at my best,</v>

3677
02:52:58.170 --> 02:53:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I try to treat people as if they're me </v>
<v Speaker 1>living another life.</v>

3678
02:53:01.110 --> 02:53:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Treat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Treat people as if they're just,</v>

3679
02:53:03.300 --> 02:53:06.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think people as a bother or don't.</v>

3680
02:53:06.570 --> 02:53:08.010
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do,</v>

3681
02:53:08.011 --> 02:53:08.844
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're busy or when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have your kids with you or when you're </v>

3682
02:53:11.091 --> 02:53:13.710
<v Speaker 1>trying to get something done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do.</v>

3683
02:53:14.010 --> 02:53:14.843
<v Speaker 2>I try and walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk around thinking everybody is </v>

3684
02:53:17.550 --> 02:53:19.970
<v Speaker 2>drowning it insecurity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3685
02:53:20.430 --> 02:53:25.430
<v Speaker 2>That really kind of makes me give people</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pass in the biggest and smallest ways.</v>

3686
02:53:27.900 --> 02:53:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Everybody when you see people hustling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do whenever businessman,</v>

3687
02:53:32.330 --> 02:53:33.163
<v Speaker 2>businesswoman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like she's on top of her game </v>

3688
02:53:35.430 --> 02:53:36.750
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on the subway,</v>

3689
02:53:36.751 --> 02:53:37.584
<v Speaker 2>who was obviously going someplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to go with no money in </v>

3690
02:53:39.511 --> 02:53:40.344
<v Speaker 2>their pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you realize we're all just drowning </v>

3691
02:53:44.041 --> 02:53:44.874
<v Speaker 2>and insecurity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just makes you just give them a </v>

3692
02:53:47.821 --> 02:53:52.800
<v Speaker 2>little bit of a a pass that that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>where my head's at,</v>

3693
02:53:52.801 --> 02:53:53.634
<v Speaker 2>been at lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great place to keep your head </v>

3694
02:53:55.920 --> 02:53:58.710
<v Speaker 2>because we all are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's balled up everyone.</v>

3695
02:53:58.711 --> 02:54:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Even the person you admire the most is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3696
02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:02.700
<v Speaker 2>ah Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3697
02:54:02.740 --> 02:54:03.573
<v Speaker 1>you know we were talking about earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the traps that you fall into is </v>

3698
02:54:05.920 --> 02:54:06.753
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to achieve and do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're also fall into traps even when </v>

3699
02:54:09.611 --> 02:54:13.730
<v Speaker 1>things that you love and you can get so </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught up in a,</v>

3700
02:54:13.860 --> 02:54:14.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that you love that you kind </v>

3701
02:54:16.811 --> 02:54:21.460
<v Speaker 1>of forget to keep your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3702
02:54:21.470 --> 02:54:22.240
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3703
02:54:22.240 --> 02:54:23.110
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3704
02:54:23.170 --> 02:54:24.003
<v Speaker 1>when you're at your best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What feeling or keep that in close </v>

3705
02:54:26.561 --> 02:54:27.500
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3706
02:54:27.560 --> 02:54:28.393
<v Speaker 1>I feel like getting away from you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're too tired because you're </v>

3707
02:54:30.581 --> 02:54:33.460
<v Speaker 1>working too much because he pulled that </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

3708
02:54:33.540 --> 02:54:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep.</v>

3709
02:54:34.210 --> 02:54:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Keep it at close range where you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating at your best,</v>

3710
02:54:37.420 --> 02:54:39.310
<v Speaker 1>but be respectful of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3711
02:54:39.311 --> 02:54:41.470
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is something that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been guilty of in the past.</v>

3712
02:54:41.830 --> 02:54:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't respectful of the energy that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>required to be at your best.</v>

3713
02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:49.210
<v Speaker 1>I just figured I'll just do all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

3714
02:54:49.230 --> 02:54:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you only.</v>

3715
02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:51.633
<v Speaker 1>I really firmly believe you only have so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much bandwidth in a day and this is </v>

3716
02:54:54.760 --> 02:54:57.610
<v Speaker 1>coming from a person who pushes their </v>
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth too hard all the time.</v>

3717
02:54:58.060 --> 02:55:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I think you only have so much in a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you get to a certain state,</v>

3718
02:55:02.590 --> 02:55:03.423
<v Speaker 1>you up diminishing a lot and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you want up diminishing a lot of </v>

3719
02:55:07.791 --> 02:55:09.230
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the other things that you do,</v>

3720
02:55:09.350 --> 02:55:11.420
<v Speaker 1>like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have like seven things cooking in</v>

3721
02:55:11.421 --> 02:55:13.940
<v Speaker 1>the background on your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to move as fast.</v>

3722
02:55:14.230 --> 02:55:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly actually does work that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>some computers,</v>

3723
02:55:17.390 --> 02:55:19.640
<v Speaker 1>but people do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have too many things.</v>

3724
02:55:19.641 --> 02:55:20.474
<v Speaker 1>Cooking.</v>

3725
02:55:20.490 --> 02:55:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all do all the time.</v>

3726
02:55:21.991 --> 02:55:26.370
<v Speaker 2>All the time and then you take 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes of transcendental meditation and</v>

3727
02:55:26.371 --> 02:55:31.371
<v Speaker 2>take your nervous system and put it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>restart to and just let it wash out.</v>

3728
02:55:33.060 --> 02:55:34.720
<v Speaker 2>You hypnotize me Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing in hand,</v>

3729
02:55:34.721 --> 02:55:36.840
<v Speaker 2>it's freaking me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let it wash out.</v>

3730
02:55:37.140 --> 02:55:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Twenty minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3731
02:55:38.490 --> 02:55:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Because we're all under that all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3732
02:55:40.441 --> 02:55:41.274
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent frazzled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter how hard you're pushing or </v>

3733
02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:48.090
<v Speaker 2>just coasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three o'clock in the afternoon,</v>

3734
02:55:48.091 --> 02:55:49.110
<v Speaker 2>2:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the afternoon,</v>

3735
02:55:49.111 --> 02:55:50.340
<v Speaker 2>4:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the afternoon.</v>

3736
02:55:50.610 --> 02:55:52.260
<v Speaker 2>That nervous system is shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3737
02:55:52.450 --> 02:55:54.040
<v Speaker 2>We're all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you.</v>

3738
02:55:54.070 --> 02:55:55.590
<v Speaker 2>Twenty minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>

3739
02:55:55.980 --> 02:55:56.813
<v Speaker 2>Talk me through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take your nervous system and it's </v>

3740
02:55:58.830 --> 02:55:59.663
<v Speaker 2>the result of it is you come out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've rebooted the system and you can </v>

3741
02:56:04.321 --> 02:56:07.350
<v Speaker 2>now have a good part of the second part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your day.</v>

3742
02:56:07.420 --> 02:56:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a technique used?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you use an APP?</v>

3743
02:56:09.810 --> 02:56:10.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to.</v>

3744
02:56:12.050 --> 02:56:15.300
<v Speaker 2>I went to a transcendental meditation </v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher.</v>

3745
02:56:15.430 --> 02:56:19.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in without the hippy dippy.</v>

3746
02:56:20.250 --> 02:56:24.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the biggest part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It literally makes you realize just what</v>

3747
02:56:24.421 --> 02:56:25.254
<v Speaker 2>you said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all just frazzled and running out </v>

3748
02:56:26.791 --> 02:56:28.080
<v Speaker 2>of steam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At a certain point,</v>

3749
02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:29.513
<v Speaker 2>your nervous system is shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff that's happened just </v>

3750
02:56:32.551 --> 02:56:35.010
<v Speaker 2>between 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 3:00,</v>

3751
02:56:35.011 --> 02:56:35.844
<v Speaker 2>whatever would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're that nervous system has been </v>

3752
02:56:37.921 --> 02:56:40.620
<v Speaker 2>dealing with a ton of stimulus all day </v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

3753
02:56:41.670 --> 02:56:46.670
<v Speaker 2>That meditation gives you a reboot and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can it.</v>

3754
02:56:47.100 --> 02:56:51.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like a needed thing that's better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than sleep that you.</v>

3755
02:56:52.150 --> 02:56:57.150
<v Speaker 2>You're actually a yearns for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

3756
02:56:57.180 --> 02:57:02.180
<v Speaker 2>since I really started dialing it in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it in the best way I can describe it</v>

3757
02:57:03.211 --> 02:57:06.780
<v Speaker 2>as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It added another four hours to my day.</v>

3758
02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3759
02:57:09.570 --> 02:57:10.403
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I would just be limping across </v>

3760
02:57:13.171 --> 02:57:14.970
<v Speaker 2>the finish line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be exhausted,</v>

3761
02:57:14.971 --> 02:57:19.860
<v Speaker 2>I'd be trying to do and with motivation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I work really hard.</v>

3762
02:57:19.861 --> 02:57:20.694
<v Speaker 2>I would push through and get to maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>two hours more of what I needed to </v>

3763
02:57:25.950 --> 02:57:26.783
<v Speaker 2>accomplish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you do this effortlessly without </v>

3764
02:57:31.020 --> 02:57:34.440
<v Speaker 2>struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to just sell like I did between</v>

3765
02:57:34.680 --> 02:57:37.100
<v Speaker 2>nine and 12 that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3766
02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hundred percent.</v>

3767
02:57:39.340 --> 02:57:40.173
<v Speaker 1>Do you think by using this practice your</v>
<v Speaker 1>alleviating tension so you're more </v>

3768
02:57:45.821 --> 02:57:48.610
<v Speaker 1>efficient with your energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what makes you?</v>

3769
02:57:48.690 --> 02:57:50.220
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really is.</v>

3770
02:57:50.880 --> 02:57:51.713
<v Speaker 2>It really is taking this nervous system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is dealing with the outside world </v>

3771
02:57:55.530 --> 02:58:00.530
<v Speaker 2>all the time and just giving it a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>practical way to shut down flat line and</v>

3772
02:58:05.731 --> 02:58:07.020
<v Speaker 2>then come back on the grid.</v>

3773
02:58:07.410 --> 02:58:10.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3774
02:58:11.590 --> 02:58:16.420
<v Speaker 2>and it it like your physical body needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>a rest.</v>

3775
02:58:16.450 --> 02:58:17.283
<v Speaker 2>Your things need to be rebooted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your nervous system is kind of this </v>

3776
02:58:21.251 --> 02:58:24.280
<v Speaker 2>thing that operates all the time that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not really that conscious of.</v>

3777
02:58:24.310 --> 02:58:25.143
<v Speaker 2>We're not really that aware of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How hard it's working and this is a way </v>

3778
02:58:27.941 --> 02:58:31.960
<v Speaker 2>to pay attention to it and give it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance to regenerate.</v>

3779
02:58:32.080 --> 02:58:33.850
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting and it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>been doing this,</v>

3780
02:58:34.200 --> 02:58:37.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meditated for like since college,</v>

3781
02:58:37.271 --> 02:58:42.271
<v Speaker 2>just out of reading books and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably about three years ago,</v>

3782
02:58:43.690 --> 02:58:44.523
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend said who always did </v>

3783
02:58:47.320 --> 02:58:49.300
<v Speaker 2>transcendental meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3784
02:58:49.330 --> 02:58:51.430
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just see if it dials you in.</v>

3785
02:58:52.080 --> 02:58:55.000
<v Speaker 2>It actually the stuff you are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you talk about meditating,</v>

3786
02:58:55.001 --> 02:58:55.834
<v Speaker 2>it sounds more laborious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like you're doing too much </v>

3787
02:58:58.181 --> 02:59:00.430
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go talk to this guy.</v>

3788
02:59:00.460 --> 02:59:03.160
<v Speaker 2>And I did for like three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four sessions.</v>

3789
02:59:03.160 --> 02:59:03.993
<v Speaker 2>I went and talked to this guy here in la</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a transcendental meditation </v>

3790
02:59:07.181 --> 02:59:12.181
<v Speaker 2>teacher and he just explained it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dialed me in on it.</v>

3791
02:59:12.520 --> 02:59:15.580
<v Speaker 2>And for the last three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four years I've been just,</v>

3792
02:59:15.610 --> 02:59:18.880
<v Speaker 2>I haven't missed a day and three or four</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

3793
02:59:18.900 --> 02:59:19.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

3794
02:59:19.670 --> 02:59:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven days,</v>

3795
02:59:21.580 --> 02:59:23.080
<v Speaker 2>seven days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no cheat day.</v>

3796
02:59:23.490 --> 02:59:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Cheat Day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long?</v>

3797
02:59:24.911 --> 02:59:25.744
<v Speaker 2>No need for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the opposite of what you want from </v>

3798
02:59:27.761 --> 02:59:29.470
<v Speaker 2>a cheat day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 20 minutes.</v>

3799
02:59:29.740 --> 02:59:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Where if you can get to in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the best.</v>

3800
02:59:32.081 --> 02:59:34.420
<v Speaker 2>If you can get one in the morning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one in the afternoon,</v>

3801
02:59:34.990 --> 02:59:36.970
<v Speaker 2>then you're like superman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3802
02:59:37.210 --> 02:59:40.210
<v Speaker 2>But if you can get one in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

3803
02:59:40.240 --> 02:59:42.090
<v Speaker 2>start to finish how long?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty,</v>

3804
02:59:42.150 --> 02:59:43.390
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>

3805
02:59:43.391 --> 02:59:45.130
<v Speaker 2>And you do this everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyday.</v>

3806
02:59:46.040 --> 02:59:48.010
<v Speaker 2>Everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that makes sense man.</v>

3807
02:59:48.220 --> 02:59:50.110
<v Speaker 2>Because a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the things that people remark about</v>

3808
02:59:50.111 --> 02:59:52.570
<v Speaker 2>you is how easy going you are.</v>

3809
02:59:52.630 --> 02:59:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Like the like people have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3810
02:59:54.191 --> 02:59:56.910
<v Speaker 2>I love and Tom Papa was on your podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's so easy.</v>

3811
02:59:56.930 --> 02:59:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Go like did you guys Gel so well </v>
<v Speaker 2>together?</v>

3812
02:59:59.140 --> 03:00:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Flow together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're tuned into president together,</v>

3813
03:00:04.600 --> 03:00:06.070
<v Speaker 2>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're both,</v>

3814
03:00:06.340 --> 03:00:10.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of not struggling and that's</v>

3815
03:00:10.361 --> 03:00:13.960
<v Speaker 2>what it teaches you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just see this is a big roaring river</v>

3816
03:00:14.950 --> 03:00:16.870
<v Speaker 2>and it lets you just kinda go </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath,</v>

3817
03:00:16.871 --> 03:00:18.850
<v Speaker 2>catch your breath and then come back up </v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

3818
03:00:19.420 --> 03:00:20.253
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel that way when you exercise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like when you exercise you </v>

3819
03:00:23.051 --> 03:00:26.140
<v Speaker 2>get into like a zone and you reset your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain?</v>

3820
03:00:26.170 --> 03:00:27.850
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel less.</v>

3821
03:00:28.300 --> 03:00:33.300
<v Speaker 2>I feel less depressed when I exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I'm in a funk and I'm like and I</v>

3822
03:00:33.400 --> 03:00:34.690
<v Speaker 2>go for a run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3823
03:00:34.750 --> 03:00:36.280
<v Speaker 2>my day's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3824
03:00:36.281 --> 03:00:37.490
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a.</v>

3825
03:00:37.550 --> 03:00:39.850
<v Speaker 2>That funk is trying to hold on to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control too.</v>

3826
03:00:39.851 --> 03:00:40.930
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3827
03:00:41.080 --> 03:00:42.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's tricking your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3828
03:00:42.910 --> 03:00:44.380
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today I was like,</v>

3829
03:00:44.410 --> 03:00:46.450
<v Speaker 2>let me just put these God damn shoes on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go run.</v>

3830
03:00:46.570 --> 03:00:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3831
03:00:47.770 --> 03:00:50.080
<v Speaker 2>you feel so good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the meditation is different.</v>

3832
03:00:50.650 --> 03:00:54.580
<v Speaker 2>The meditation is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the run will give me energy.</v>

3833
03:00:54.581 --> 03:00:56.120
<v Speaker 2>I won't feel so shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3834
03:00:56.340 --> 03:00:57.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel good.</v>

3835
03:00:57.761 --> 03:00:59.950
<v Speaker 2>I feel alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3836
03:01:00.310 --> 03:01:01.143
<v Speaker 3>but the meditation in a very subtle way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five hours later when you're faced with </v>

3837
03:01:07.601 --> 03:01:08.434
<v Speaker 3>a stressful situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't feel as stressed as you </v>

3838
03:01:10.631 --> 03:01:15.100
<v Speaker 3>normally would because it's just you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>near your nervous system,</v>

3839
03:01:15.101 --> 03:01:17.860
<v Speaker 3>which is very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has Been rebooted,</v>

3840
03:01:17.880 --> 03:01:20.410
<v Speaker 3>is now able to go and deal with another </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

3841
03:01:21.970 --> 03:01:23.440
<v Speaker 3>You should go see him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll give you the name of the guy.</v>

3843
03:01:25.481 --> 03:01:27.130
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3844
03:01:27.131 --> 03:01:28.840

<v Speaker 3>It's not the one sperm guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not about him.</v>

3846
03:01:32.201 --> 03:01:34.150
<v Speaker 3>One minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about a religion.</v>

3847

<v Speaker 3>little practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very.</v>

03:01:44.130 --> 03:01:47.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not hippy dippy.</v>

03:02:37.571 --> 03:02:40.930
<v Speaker 3>with some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many they have,</v>

3878
03:02:40.990 --> 03:02:43.330
<v Speaker 3>but I think they use all float lab stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3879
03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:46.900
<v Speaker 3>That would be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's another interesting thing?</v>

3880
03:02:47.350 --> 03:02:50.230
<v Speaker 3>If you get the morning one in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how sometimes you wake up,</v>

3881
03:02:50.920 --> 03:02:52.630
<v Speaker 3>you've slept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you went to bed at 11,</v>

3882
03:02:52.770 --> 03:02:54.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're up at seven,</v>

3883
03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:57.670
<v Speaker 3>but you're exhausted because your </v>
<v Speaker 3>night's sleep is restless.</v>

3884
03:02:57.671 --> 03:02:59.920
<v Speaker 3>You've got up to pee a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

3885
03:03:00.730 --> 03:03:03.430
<v Speaker 3>You look back at your bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a disaster.</v>

3886
03:03:05.020 --> 03:03:09.280
<v Speaker 3>You do those 20 minutes before you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>about your day,</v>

3887
03:03:09.430 --> 03:03:12.100
<v Speaker 3>just before the kids get up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just get 20 minutes in.</v>

3888
03:03:12.910 --> 03:03:16.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like a you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was more valuable than what you tried</v>

3889
03:03:16.541 --> 03:03:17.374
<v Speaker 3>to accomplish in that eight hours </v>
<v Speaker 3>spinning around in the sheets like </v>

3890
03:03:21.670 --> 03:03:23.290
<v Speaker 3>especially for someone like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3891
03:03:23.291 --> 03:03:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Who's job is to create things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3892
03:03:25.720 --> 03:03:26.553
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To put your mindset and to put into a </v>

3893
03:03:27.911 --> 03:03:32.020
<v Speaker 3>particular place is super beneficial if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just creating things all on time.</v>

3894
03:03:32.110 --> 03:03:34.540
<v Speaker 3>Totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's for everybody.</v>

3895
03:03:34.630 --> 03:03:35.021
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3896
03:03:35.021 --> 03:03:36.520
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's literally like,</v>

3897
03:03:36.610 --> 03:03:37.443
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all just human beings just </v>

3898
03:03:39.221 --> 03:03:40.054
<v Speaker 3>struggling everyday going out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing all this stuff and it's like you </v>

3899
03:03:43.001 --> 03:03:47.740
<v Speaker 3>could be a single mom living in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>city,</v>

3900
03:03:47.860 --> 03:03:50.140
<v Speaker 3>taking the bus to work after dealing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your kids and go.</v>

3901
03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Her nervous system is being bombarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3902
03:03:54.910 --> 03:03:57.980
<v Speaker 3>20 minutes just kind of sit in there</v>

3903
03:03:57.980 --> 03:03:58.813
<v Speaker 2>on the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do it on the bus by your with </v>

3904
03:04:00.951 --> 03:04:05.420
<v Speaker 2>all this other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a a pristine thing.</v>

3905
03:04:05.450 --> 03:04:08.570
<v Speaker 2>It's not a hippie thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an.</v>

3906
03:04:09.180 --> 03:04:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna say elegant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is kind of elegant.</v>

3907
03:04:12.171 --> 03:04:17.171
<v Speaker 2>It's not a special thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is just like a,</v>

3908
03:04:17.500 --> 03:04:21.590
<v Speaker 2>like a controlled that in a way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll.</v>

3909
03:04:21.770 --> 03:04:25.670
<v Speaker 2>It just gives you more to go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all,</v>

3910
03:04:25.730 --> 03:04:27.170
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what you're creating,</v>

3911
03:04:27.171 --> 03:04:31.070
<v Speaker 2>no matter what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all under assault all the time,</v>

3912
03:04:31.730 --> 03:04:32.563
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3913
03:04:32.690 --> 03:04:33.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3914
03:04:34.570 --> 03:04:35.403
<v Speaker 2>don't equate it to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's like bombardments of energy </v>

3915
03:04:37.551 --> 03:04:39.410
<v Speaker 2>and stuff that's coming after you all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

3916
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:42.380
<v Speaker 2>You have to kind of tend to the system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's dealing with it</v>

3917
03:04:42.490 --> 03:04:47.490
<v Speaker 1>that I think anything that gives you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective reshift or reboot is great.</v>

3918
03:04:47.800 --> 03:04:48.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything,</v>

3919
03:04:48.990 --> 03:04:52.820
<v Speaker 1>whether it's going for a swim in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean and whatever the fuck it is.</v>

3920
03:04:53.180 --> 03:04:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Something that gives you a perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>reboot.</v>

3921
03:04:55.480 --> 03:04:57.860
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get caught in some pretty gross ruts.</v>

3922
03:04:59.270 --> 03:05:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reboot is a cool way to say it.</v>

3923
03:05:01.250 --> 03:05:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think um,</v>

3924
03:05:02.900 --> 03:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>we have these views of the world sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this,</v>

3925
03:05:09.031 --> 03:05:09.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

3926
03:05:09.740 --> 03:05:12.380
<v Speaker 1>these patterns that we sort of recognize</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we see them,</v>

3927
03:05:12.590 --> 03:05:13.423
<v Speaker 1>they're out there and we get locked into</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and we're just visiting the same </v>

3928
03:05:16.731 --> 03:05:20.330
<v Speaker 1>websites and seeing the same people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the same things every day.</v>

3929
03:05:20.750 --> 03:05:22.730
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you need something </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

3930
03:05:23.210 --> 03:05:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3931
03:05:24.940 --> 03:05:25.773
<v Speaker 1>The knock you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need something that gets you to </v>

3932
03:05:27.441 --> 03:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>think about other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3933
03:05:29.990 --> 03:05:32.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's going to a place that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I travel so good.</v>

3934
03:05:33.080 --> 03:05:34.790
<v Speaker 1>I used to never get traveled when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a kid.</v>

3935
03:05:34.980 --> 03:05:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

3936
03:05:35.841 --> 03:05:37.850
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck wants to travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like being home,</v>

3937
03:05:38.330 --> 03:05:39.680
<v Speaker 1>but one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do like being home,</v>

3938
03:05:39.681 --> 03:05:40.514
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things about travel is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows you to experience the feel of </v>

3939
03:05:43.071 --> 03:05:43.904
<v Speaker 1>someone's culture in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're walking through the streets </v>

3940
03:05:45.921 --> 03:05:47.210
<v Speaker 1>of Cologne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

3941
03:05:47.450 --> 03:05:48.410
<v Speaker 1>like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3942
03:05:48.411 --> 03:05:50.420
<v Speaker 1>this is how these people live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3943
03:05:50.740 --> 03:05:53.270
<v Speaker 1>We walked through the streets of Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes you to of yourself.</v>

3944
03:05:53.300 --> 03:05:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you this.</v>

3945
03:05:55.130 --> 03:05:55.963
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you this appreciation that </v>

3946
03:05:57.591 --> 03:06:00.050
<v Speaker 1>there's different rules over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are still people.</v>

3947
03:06:00.051 --> 03:06:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Modern people just like you and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of your ancestors came from here,</v>

3948
03:06:04.490 --> 03:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>but here they are where there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>different rules.</v>

3949
03:06:06.140 --> 03:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Millions of millions of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they got people that are coming</v>

3950
03:06:08.781 --> 03:06:11.180
<v Speaker 1>into them from Africa and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

3951
03:06:11.181 --> 03:06:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Like this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess this whole thing is fascinating.</v>

3952
03:06:14.421 --> 03:06:16.550
<v Speaker 1>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then were around,</v>

3953
03:06:16.551 --> 03:06:17.384
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pompei and you've seen the ruins that </v>

3954
03:06:19.670 --> 03:06:22.220
<v Speaker 1>mount vesuvius erupted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed all these people,</v>

3955
03:06:22.221 --> 03:06:23.870
<v Speaker 1>and you're wandering through all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

3956
03:06:23.871 --> 03:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Like this is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3957
03:06:25.281 --> 03:06:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3958
03:06:25.440 --> 03:06:26.273
<v Speaker 2>It's a long way from thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>three apps that you sit on your phone </v>

3959
03:06:30.121 --> 03:06:30.954
<v Speaker 2>every day and get your news and get your</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and check your instagram and </v>

3960
03:06:32.960 --> 03:06:33.793
<v Speaker 2>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole nother whole nother </v>

3961
03:06:35.131 --> 03:06:35.964
<v Speaker 2>mindblower Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole universe of other stuff to </v>

3962
03:06:38.131 --> 03:06:40.830
<v Speaker 2>think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I love walking in New York,</v>

3963
03:06:41.100 --> 03:06:41.933
<v Speaker 2>like you have your routines of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're walking on the other side </v>

3964
03:06:44.431 --> 03:06:46.380
<v Speaker 2>of the street and go the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

3965
03:06:46.500 --> 03:06:48.630
<v Speaker 2>You're a wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole nother world,</v>

3966
03:06:52.230 --> 03:06:57.230
<v Speaker 2>but really it's just literally like when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're your run with your dog and you if</v>

3967
03:06:57.541 --> 03:07:01.470
<v Speaker 2>you just look the other way from when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you normally are like doing your thing.</v>

3968
03:07:02.010 --> 03:07:05.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole nother perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole nother world.</v>

3969
03:07:05.071 --> 03:07:06.470
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3970
03:07:06.630 --> 03:07:08.790
<v Speaker 2>But literally just looking the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

3971
03:07:08.791 --> 03:07:11.880
<v Speaker 2>running the other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this true,</v>

3972
03:07:12.120 --> 03:07:12.953
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a small thing because we liked </v>

3973
03:07:15.691 --> 03:07:20.370
<v Speaker 2>the order we like that provides calm and</v>
<v Speaker 2>safety.</v>

3974
03:07:20.850 --> 03:07:22.710
<v Speaker 2>If you're just going that same route all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

3975
03:07:23.160 --> 03:07:25.470
<v Speaker 2>but then there's a limit I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you end up.</v>

3976
03:07:26.190 --> 03:07:29.400
<v Speaker 2>It starts acting negatively on your life</v>

3977
03:07:29.840 --> 03:07:30.673
<v Speaker 1>and your height.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're just a constant vagabond </v>

3978
03:07:31.880 --> 03:07:34.210
<v Speaker 1>traveling around the globe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably not.</v>

3979
03:07:34.240 --> 03:07:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Not Positive either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3980
03:07:35.570 --> 03:07:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always going on.</v>

3981
03:07:37.180 --> 03:07:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Never having a home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love home.</v>

3982
03:07:39.440 --> 03:07:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love home too.</v>

3983
03:07:40.700 --> 03:07:44.270
<v Speaker 2>I love home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so weird in a.</v>

3984
03:07:44.270 --> 03:07:47.840
<v Speaker 2>In a career where we have to travel so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

3985
03:07:48.370 --> 03:07:49.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one thing that I love to say like </v>

3986
03:07:52.220 --> 03:07:53.053
<v Speaker 1>equated to good knievel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that there's some weird sort of </v>

3987
03:07:55.271 --> 03:07:56.104
<v Speaker 1>balance in this life and that we do </v>
<v Speaker 1>really have to experience negative </v>

3988
03:07:59.501 --> 03:08:01.960
<v Speaker 1>things to appreciate positive things for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they really are.</v>

3989
03:08:02.290 --> 03:08:05.020
<v Speaker 1>If everything is positive,</v>

<v Speaker 4>as a child.</v>

4106
03:12:50.770 --> 03:12:51.603
<v Speaker 4>I'd go to this bookstore and their big </v>
<v Speaker 4>comic books and I buy these little rich </v>

4107
03:12:56.210 --> 03:12:58.400
<v Speaker 4>richie rich comic books and go home and </v>
<v Speaker 4>read them.</v>

4108
03:12:58.570 --> 03:13:03.320

<v Speaker 4>album.</v>

4112

<v Speaker 4>Gucci Mane.</v>

03:13:15.020 --> 03:13:15.980
<v Speaker 4>Richie rich.</v>

<v Speaker 4>want to be Richie.</v>

4126
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:54.140
