<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee.</v>

6
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still.</v>

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.680
<v Speaker 1>But still though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say it.</v>

8
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:16.720
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he'll say rise.</v>

9
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>He gets out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

10
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:18.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have bet you money.</v>

11
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen it right away.</v>

12
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it immediately.</v>

13
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Pretty Dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is dope.</v>

14
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Just sent those in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's a bad motherfucker.</v>

15
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sell this shit.</v>

16
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a great hip hop album I listened to </v>

17
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.260
<v Speaker 1>in high school and they use one of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>quotes,</v>

18
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.260
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

19
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing oneself is really hard to do.</v>

20
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:43.971
<v Speaker 1>I can use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can use really fancy movements and </v>

21
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>show you really crazy things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to honestly express myself,</v>

22
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>that is really hard to do.</v>

23
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a beautiful little sound clip </v>

24
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.220
<v Speaker 1>before they start the song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like just him talking to </v>

25
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.891
<v Speaker 1>someone isn't an humbling when someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>dies really young like he does and they </v>

26
00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>did way more in their life than you ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

27
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Makes me sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

28
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stop and think about it.</v>

29
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Like who the fuck else has had that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an impact and you know,</v>

30
00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>he died in what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1970 something in the seventies.</v>

31
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was young.</v>

32
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was like 30 or 31 or 32 or </v>

33
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.531
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out how old Bruce Lee was when he </v>

34
00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I was listening to Hendrix</v>

35
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>last night on the way the studio or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the comedy store.</v>

36
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 1>You have one of my 33 and he died when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was 27.</v>

37
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.480
<v Speaker 1>How much Hendrix music is there out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and he died when he was 27 here.</v>

38
00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:39.481
<v Speaker 1>But then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think he'd be happy with what's </v>

39
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:41.991
<v Speaker 1>going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I always find that like what would </v>

40
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:42.660
<v Speaker 1>they be doing today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That trips me up.</v>

41
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you can't do that.</v>

42
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

43
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:46.030
<v Speaker 1>but that'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

44
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>they had such like a because right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's guys that lasted a long time and</v>

45
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:54.471
<v Speaker 1>they either like or making garbage or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're slowly still making cool shit </v>

46
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 1>here and there whenever they want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 1>There's the variety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

48
00:01:57.571 --> 00:02:00.750
<v Speaker 1>And then there's people that just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to hear their new shit.</v>

49
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the rolling stones.</v>

50
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

51
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start me up.</v>

52
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to hear like new rolling </v>

53
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.680
<v Speaker 1>stones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One's called car tire.</v>

54
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Don't play that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't play that.</v>

55
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that weird though?</v>

56
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Because they're all time greats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 1>But if they started playing some song </v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't heard,</v>

58
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck is all this.</v>

59
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

60
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Yesterday I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was running,</v>

61
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>they had this thing called the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>

62
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a post NBA League for players to </v>

63
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.961
<v Speaker 1>play in once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I retire it was just three on </v>

64
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:35.271
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really sad to watch guys that </v>

65
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:35.271
<v Speaker 1>have been retired for like 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>who've been because you're like,</v>

66
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.250
<v Speaker 1>this is just bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

67
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like say you want to just remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>them when they were amazing,</v>

68
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 1>but now they're just old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too old to be.</v>

69
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:43.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like circusy,</v>

70
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:48.621
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people are showing up just to like </v>

71
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:48.621
<v Speaker 1>see those names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're there.</v>

72
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>It's really bad to watch how old they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

73
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is no minimum.</v>

74
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be retired from the league </v>

75
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 1>to play in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

76
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean the average age has got to be 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe seat.</v>

77
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the athlete.</v>

78
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Like Hopkins was fighting in his forties</v>
<v Speaker 1>at his best.</v>

79
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Different though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Basketball is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a young man's game.</v>

81
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

82
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:16.981
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about it that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a hard to watch and I'll do with </v>

83
00:03:16.981 --> 00:03:19.711
<v Speaker 1>gray hair missing free throws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird guy who used to be </v>

84
00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you're saying,</v>

85
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:25.741
<v Speaker 1>but I disagree in the fact that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>even sadder watching an old guy get the </v>

86
00:03:25.741 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>fuck beat out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Used to be good.</v>

87
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sad.</v>

88
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.910
<v Speaker 1>That's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But fighting.</v>

89
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.950
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's still probably fights because </v>

90
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.950
<v Speaker 1>he loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

91
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for the money.</v>

92
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>It's for money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean they fight because they love the </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>

94
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>but they get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it from us.</v>

95
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>But these guys are doing the big three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way they enjoy it anymore.</v>

96
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know?</v>

97
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just looked so sad.</v>

98
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>So sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that.</v>

99
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I think with basketball too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wear and tear on the knees so that </v>

100
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.100
<v Speaker 1>your back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your knees,</v>

101
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>everything left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

102
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right when you walked.</v>

103
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy named Glen Davis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Baby Davis and he was.</v>

104
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>He always had like big problems in </v>
<v Speaker 1>league being so heavy on his,</v>

105
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>on his knees and his back and it's even </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse there.</v>

106
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 1>He fell once during it and rolled around</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like five minutes.</v>

107
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.510
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so sad to watch like this.</v>

108
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>And their cameras are just focusing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

109
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>And rapaport is doing the announcing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Rob Portman.</v>

110
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing.</v>

111
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>He's doing the interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird,</v>

112
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

113
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 1>He's like a 80 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 year old yet.</v>

114
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.040
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his career is on this crazy revival </v>

115
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.790
<v Speaker 1>train and it's almost like he is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to young rappaport style.</v>

116
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.820
<v Speaker 1>He's a funny dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

117
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's hilarious.</v>

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 1>we tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any sports skills.</v>

235
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you fell out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you could just use you as the </v>

236
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 1>bowl and fall out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just feel what happens when you fall</v>

237
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:32.130
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kick you out,</v>

238
00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:37.131
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't play anymore else other than </v>

239
00:09:37.131 --> 00:09:37.131
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the game's over now.</v>

240
00:09:37.131 --> 00:09:37.131
<v Speaker 1>But they have two other players on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>bench that they rotate.</v>

241
00:09:37.131 --> 00:09:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we would have you fall as hard as </v>

242
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:42.050
<v Speaker 1>you can to really fuck up their best </v>
<v Speaker 1>players.</v>

243
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

244
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:48.501
<v Speaker 1>That strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Jamie and I would have to bang </v>

245
00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:48.501
<v Speaker 1>it out way to Dickie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they have that?</v>

246
00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 1>They have that in hockey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The NBA,</v>

247
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.580
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Mba and guys get pissed because it </v>

248
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:55.580
<v Speaker 1>ruins their career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It costs millions of dollars.</v>

249
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean heck heck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A shack was the original,</v>

250
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 1>like they used to foul shack so because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew what would they can do to stop</v>

251
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:02.880
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking truck,</v>

252
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.240
<v Speaker 1>so he would just get the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would tomahawk them as hard as they</v>

253
00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:07.470
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

255
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.860
<v Speaker 1>And he used to complain about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was funny because because you know,</v>

256
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 1>couch sports fans are always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

259
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.890
<v Speaker 1>But another huge dude that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing their arms as hard as they can </v>

260
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.160
<v Speaker 1>all gain duty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets totally fucked up from that.</v>

264
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.230

<v Speaker 1>but Shaq was just the biggest guy that's</v>

265
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 1>ever played with so much agility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I shake his hand,</v>

266
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

267
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.740
<v Speaker 1>It's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a desk.</v>

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:38.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like shit.</v>

269

<v Speaker 1>he was a huge fear factor fan.</v>

272
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.040
<v Speaker 1>So he did like a whole episode where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>co hosted it with me and he stood next </v>

273

276
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.280
<v Speaker 1>almost standing next to him like this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an eight year old hanging out with </v>

307
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was no weight limitations,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Child child and a grown man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Was it at movie awards or something like</v>

314
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:26.821
<v Speaker 1>that with him next to me and where I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewing him for this thing and he </v>

315
00:12:26.821 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 1>will always be the roast one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>

316
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 1>a Bieber and I'm in and I'm doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a microphone,</v>

317
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>like full extension with it and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bending down still.</v>

318
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.810
<v Speaker 1>You still have to doug?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like it checked.</v>

319
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird that like the UFC has</v>
<v Speaker 1>a weight limit.</v>

320
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.630
<v Speaker 1>What's the top out to 65?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

321
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

322
00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

323
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Does it get these super heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super heavy?</v>

324
00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:52.711
<v Speaker 1>We've never had a super heavy fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but super heavyweight is to 65 and </v>

325
00:12:52.711 --> 00:12:52.711
<v Speaker 1>above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

326
00:12:52.711 --> 00:12:57.151
<v Speaker 1>who's the heaviest fighter that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>fought to 65 when they weigh in after </v>

327
00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:59.980
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably brock brock was cut and wait to</v>

328
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:02.640
<v Speaker 1>make to 65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't he around 300 pounds?</v>

329
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.750
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking insane.</v>

330
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:09.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's a different kind of 300 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 37 foot one.</v>

331
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.010
<v Speaker 1>His shoes are 22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>22.</v>

332
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:16.600
<v Speaker 1>They're almost to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His foot is two feet.</v>

333
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.600
<v Speaker 1>That's his foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all fucking bit.</v>

334
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His foot to two feet,</v>

335
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like a guy like that could never </v>

336
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:25.720
<v Speaker 1>fight in the UFC because you probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't make two 65.</v>

337
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.980
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he did,</v>

338
00:13:26.981 --> 00:13:31.300
<v Speaker 1>he'd be fucking zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero fat.</v>

339
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:36.500
<v Speaker 1>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder about how because he's so </v>

340
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:36.500
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have to lose 75 pounds.</v>

341
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

342
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.720
<v Speaker 1>They say 3:30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what he weighed?</v>

343
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>3:30.</v>

344
00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.310
<v Speaker 1>It looked like as a rookie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

345
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 1>He was so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So big.</v>

346
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.620
<v Speaker 1>And he's a kid right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

347
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.570
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 20 or 19 or 20 years old,</v>

348
00:13:49.571 --> 00:13:50.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That God.</v>

349
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

381
00:15:04.181 --> 00:15:04.730
<v Speaker 2>because he used to date Vicky Lewis,</v>

466
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:42.411
<v Speaker 1>I think they're both for charity today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one for fortnight and then another </v>

467
00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:42.411
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

468
00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:44.130
<v Speaker 1>that's just like a called [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we've talked about before,</v>

469
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.680
<v Speaker 1>a million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long do they have to play?</v>

470
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.390
<v Speaker 1>It might be like a two or three hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>tournament.</v>

471
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.990
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking unreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much money in video games now.</v>

472
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Parents used to tell their kids and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>play video games like you don't.</v>

473
00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a loser and they still have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit in their head,</v>

474
00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more money in it.</v>

475
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Then like most games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you make people make careers out of</v>

476
00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.230
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if there were a tennis player?</v>

477
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bobby's a pro tennis player,</v>

478
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.660

<v Speaker 1>out timmy.</v>

479
00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Over there I was making a billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars playing fortnite hands.</v>

480
00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This all day.</v>

481
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.540
<v Speaker 1>I do it all at Iowa guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a friend of my old roommate,</v>

482
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:23.541
<v Speaker 1>my first roommate in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like a PR professional online </v>

483
00:19:23.541 --> 00:19:23.541
<v Speaker 1>Gamer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought I was like,</v>

484

<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dude fatality reached out to us,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to get them on.</v>

486
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I figured out he's still playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the greatest quick player or one </v>

487
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.340
<v Speaker 1>of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say.</v>

488
00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.760
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a few of those guys.</v>

489
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.440
<v Speaker 1>He was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old is he now?</v>

490
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Probably in his late thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

491
00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds great.</v>

492
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.540
<v Speaker 1>What is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always know what the.</v>

493
00:19:45.541 --> 00:19:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what they do when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>quit all that shit.</v>

494
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Just just breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just chilling,</v>

495
00:19:50.111 --> 00:19:52.740
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the radiation they'd been absorbing.</v>

496
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.810
<v Speaker 1>He's working at FRY's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sat in front of that screen is.</v>

497
00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Hi Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All your cells are mutated.</v>

498
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Some of them now I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some of them are smart enough </v>

499
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.421
<v Speaker 1>now that they realized the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how quick arises and how quick the fall </v>

500
00:20:08.421 --> 00:20:12.861
<v Speaker 1>might be that they're just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>banking money and just riding it out to </v>

501
00:20:12.861 --> 00:20:12.861
<v Speaker 1>see how long it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

502
00:20:12.861 --> 00:20:16.821
<v Speaker 1>But it's Kinda like Kinda like how </v>
<v Speaker 1>engulf you only get paid paid if you </v>

503
00:20:16.821 --> 00:20:19.280
<v Speaker 1>win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now not a lot of these guys can bank all</v>

504
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.070
<v Speaker 1>that money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

505
00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:21.780
<v Speaker 1>They still got to have something to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>after it's done.</v>

506
00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:27.660
<v Speaker 1>That's the best bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But time majority of guys are just </v>

507
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:27.960
<v Speaker 1>making a lady I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this the way.</v>

508
00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:29.640
<v Speaker 1>It's different though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to pay a coach.</v>

509
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.100
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just at home in their part.</v>

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.200
<v Speaker 1>In some cases their parent's house still</v>
<v Speaker 1>most cases where it might just by their </v>

511
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:36.270
<v Speaker 1>parent's new house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be their goal.</v>

512
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:41.300
<v Speaker 1>They buy their parents house and kick </v>
<v Speaker 1>them the fuck out that's happening by </v>

702
00:28:47.291 --> 00:28:48.070
<v Speaker 4>any sense.</v>

703
00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.340

<v Speaker 1>great fuck.</v>

711
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.400
<v Speaker 1>It rips me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's funny how he found this niche </v>

712
00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.010
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this,</v>

713
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:51.730
<v Speaker 1>this new thing of like face swap with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

714
00:29:51.731 --> 00:29:52.630
<v Speaker 1>It's Pr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

715
00:29:52.631 --> 00:29:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect because his impressions are</v>

716
00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:55.210
<v Speaker 1>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

717
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:58.450
<v Speaker 1>that's so fucking Bill Maher is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

718
00:29:58.451 --> 00:30:00.760
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really creepy when I see.</v>

719
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:01.420
<v Speaker 1>When you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

720
00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:06.421
<v Speaker 1>that's bill Maher behind the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swap doing the voice when he does the </v>

721
00:30:06.431 --> 00:30:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Kim and Kanye talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to each other with Caitlin.</v>

722
00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant,</v>

723
00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:11.830
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking.</v>

724
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.110
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He found he found the perfect group,</v>

725
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.680
<v Speaker 1>but I love the fact that there's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>new thing that people can do.</v>

726
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:18.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

727
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.930
<v Speaker 1>this face swap thing is like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely new way of doing sketches,</v>

728
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.460
<v Speaker 1>making characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

729
00:30:24.461 --> 00:30:29.461
<v Speaker 1>It's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost funny earlier because you </v>

730
00:30:29.461 --> 00:30:31.150
<v Speaker 1>know that he's behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

731
00:30:31.151 --> 00:30:34.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're in on it so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet it's so good.</v>

732
00:30:34.841 --> 00:30:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Like when he does like Kim and Kanye </v>
<v Speaker 1>West,</v>

733
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.390
<v Speaker 5>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dad,</v>

734
00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm lost in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit,</v>

735
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.210
<v Speaker 5>look around you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you say?</v>

736
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.960
<v Speaker 5>There's a washing machine is a weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>white box.</v>

737
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:52.990
<v Speaker 5>What is that white box?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's so perfect.</v>

738
00:30:55.431 --> 00:31:00.431
<v Speaker 5>It's like clueless family that's so </v>
<v Speaker 5>wealthy that they completely detached </v>

739
00:31:00.431 --> 00:31:01.770
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is that white box?</v>

740
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.850
<v Speaker 5>Really mad now</v>

741
00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I just love that these technologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>

742
00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.920
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of youtube people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

743
00:31:10.921 --> 00:31:12.720
<v Speaker 1>They're doing ladies weird youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

744
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.650
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people doing it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like he but he's found a,</v>

745
00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:19.770
<v Speaker 1>like a real specifically funny niche </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's.</v>

746
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Because he's related to the characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of times when people are </v>

747
00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.711
<v Speaker 1>thrown characters together and sketches </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just kinda so cheaply done </v>

748
00:31:27.711 --> 00:31:30.681
<v Speaker 1>and they don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't mean comedic base that </v>

749
00:31:30.681 --> 00:31:31.230
<v Speaker 1>just like weird to be fucking goofy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

750
00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:33.540
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to have some kind of basement.</v>

751
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a few people that do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kid loves this lady,</v>

752

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:17.250
<v Speaker 2>He does give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't give a fuck at the same </v>

933
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:17.250
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like secretly.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

936
00:39:18.161 --> 00:39:20.860
<v Speaker 2>He gets disgusted with themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what he enjoys.</v>

937
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.840
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he should be free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>

938
00:39:22.841 --> 00:39:23.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a,</v>

939
00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.530
<v Speaker 2>there's some guy I was reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

940
00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Some guy was doing something on anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>shame things as a doctor.</v>

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.250
<v Speaker 2>Like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shame was like is his thing.</v>

942
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:38.310
<v Speaker 2>But that shame is a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's things that people are </v>

943
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.390
<v Speaker 2>ashamed of that we're not ashamed of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all like sex,</v>

944
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 2>like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like normal sex,</v>

945
00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:48.601
<v Speaker 2>like say if your wife's walking around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the house at a pair of shorts and you </v>

946
00:39:48.601 --> 00:39:48.601
<v Speaker 2>grab her ass and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

947
00:39:48.601 --> 00:39:53.070
<v Speaker 2>and she turns around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she smiles at you and the two of you </v>

948
00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:53.070
<v Speaker 2>start banging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

949
00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

950
00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Are you married?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to love each other.</v>

951
00:39:54.791 --> 00:39:56.350
<v Speaker 2>You've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're attracted to each other.</v>

952
00:39:56.351 --> 00:39:57.310
<v Speaker 2>It's all normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

953
00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:02.430
<v Speaker 2>But if you lived in like a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious household where she supposed </v>

954
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.650
<v Speaker 2>to be dressed like a fucking table </v>
<v Speaker 2>cloth,</v>

955
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.070
<v Speaker 2>that would be a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would,</v>

956
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.370
<v Speaker 2>she would feel awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would feel ashamed.</v>

957
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.730
<v Speaker 2>So it's like what causes shame?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cultural acceptance.</v>

958
00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>

959
00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.450
<v Speaker 2>and the building blocks of how your </v>
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>

960
00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:15.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

961
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Like some people get shamed for from </v>
<v Speaker 2>their parents for stuff that's they </v>

962
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:20.670
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't feel ashamed about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can get away with it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No one except transracial.</v>

1036

<v Speaker 1>Rachel Doles out.</v>

1038
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Just that one line that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to cross no fucking way,</v>

1039
00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.030
<v Speaker 1>which is meanwhile it is one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>realistic lines.</v>

1040
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.730
<v Speaker 1>This is why totally human beings came </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Africa.</v>

1041
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.680
<v Speaker 1>All of them will also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Race.</v>

1042
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Race has a lot to do with culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1043
00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:25.970
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1044
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:28.360
<v Speaker 1>literally all human beings came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

1045
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.840
<v Speaker 1>That is the cradle of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:35.000
<v Speaker 1>So we're all African.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why can't you pretend to be African?</v>

1047
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Why can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't you just be it?</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name pretending.</v>

1049
00:43:38.411 --> 00:43:39.950

1051
00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:45.020
<v Speaker 1>that's more on the other side of when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people say like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You get your cellulite picks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that there's a new show on </v>

1096
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Netflix and they're trying to take off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>

1097
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:28.850
<v Speaker 1>It's about a girl who used to be fat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then she got skinny and she's getting </v>

1098
00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:28.850
<v Speaker 1>revenge on everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking.</v>

1099
00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:29.610
<v Speaker 1>What's that called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to watch.</v>

1100
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
<v Speaker 1>How would they take that off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds even if you find it as some </v>

1101
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.970
<v Speaker 1>really pretty girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's going back to all the people that </v>

1102
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.970
<v Speaker 1>talk shit to her when she was young </v>
<v Speaker 1>about being fast.</v>

1103
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:39.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't really pay attention to 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

1104
00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.300
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were very angry about it.</v>

1105
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:45.510
<v Speaker 1>About the premise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why fat shaming.</v>

1106
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh Gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you know about fat shaming?</v>

1107
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.820
<v Speaker 1>What is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

1108
00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.830
<v Speaker 1>That girl Debbie Ryan fat phobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney is.</v>

1109
00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fat foot.</v>

1110
00:45:58.891 --> 00:45:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

1111
00:45:59.971 --> 00:46:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Let me read that.</v>

1112
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:05.340
<v Speaker 2>Fat phobic Netflix series supports </v>
<v Speaker 2>damaging stereotypes for young women.</v>

1113
00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1114
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:10.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you guys this really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really clearly.</v>

1115
00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:12.990
<v Speaker 2>If your children are fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're eating too much sugar.</v>

1116
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's a fact.</v>

1117
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1118
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Or try but don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't just call people fat phobic of </v>

1119
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:26.931
<v Speaker 2>your children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of nonsense that's </v>

1120
00:46:26.931 --> 00:46:28.200
<v Speaker 2>involved in people's bodies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>education and the.</v>

1121
00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:32.010
<v Speaker 2>The big one is what they eat has no </v>
<v Speaker 2>bearing on what they look like.</v>

1122
00:46:32.011 --> 00:46:33.050
<v Speaker 2>That is horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1123
00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:38.060
<v Speaker 2>it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have giant fat people in the </v>

1124
00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.200
<v Speaker 2>twenties and you go back and look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking people in the twenties.</v>

1125
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:45.500
<v Speaker 2>They were all starving to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were all skinny and the bread they </v>

1126
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:45.500
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what someone fucking told me,</v>

1127
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson told me this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to look up.</v>

1128
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Look this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm emulsifiers.</v>

1129
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:55.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm also fires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was reading something about a </v>

1130
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:58.761
<v Speaker 2>most of fires that are used in fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>rising yeast and in a lot of bread </v>

1131
00:46:58.761 --> 00:47:03.231
<v Speaker 2>products are responsible for leaky gut </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have an impact on people's,</v>

1132
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivities to gluten.</v>

1133
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:11.310
<v Speaker 2>And he was saying that like emulsifiers </v>
<v Speaker 2>or basically like fucking shampoo,</v>

1134
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have oil in the water of your,</v>

1135
00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:19.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your wash some dishes and all that </v>

1136
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.340
<v Speaker 2>greasy oil and you pour some dishwashing</v>
<v Speaker 2>soap in there and the water he goes,</v>

1137
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:24.330
<v Speaker 2>that's in food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a similar quality</v>

1138
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:29.400
<v Speaker 1>and that's a cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's causing all these like a </v>

1139
00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:29.800
<v Speaker 1>gluten allergies and just a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different that are causing it.</v>

1140
00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 1>One</v>

1141
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 2>of them is the more complex glutens </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it used to be that you would get</v>

1142
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:37.420
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you had wheat you would have,</v>

1143
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:41.560
<v Speaker 2>it's like old wheat was like a small </v>
<v Speaker 2>little sort of grain.</v>

1144
00:47:41.561 --> 00:47:46.561
<v Speaker 2>It was a smaller plant and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started changing it and as they </v>

1145
00:47:46.561 --> 00:47:48.670
<v Speaker 2>started changing and selectively </v>
<v Speaker 2>breeding it,</v>

1146
00:47:48.671 --> 00:47:52.150
<v Speaker 2>what they started doing it as making it </v>
<v Speaker 2>thicker and more dense and,</v>

1147
00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.610
<v Speaker 2>and that way you get a much higher yield</v>
<v Speaker 2>per acre.</v>

1148
00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:59.710
<v Speaker 2>But in doing so they also made it more </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult for your body to process.</v>

1149
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1150
00:48:01.031 --> 00:48:06.031
<v Speaker 2>but he was saying that it's also the </v>
<v Speaker 2>uses fast rising yeast and that there's </v>

1151
00:48:06.031 --> 00:48:07.720
<v Speaker 2>emulsifiers in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm also,</v>

1152
00:48:07.721 --> 00:48:09.670
<v Speaker 2>fires are apparently terrible for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

1153
00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:15.240
<v Speaker 2>which makes sense because you go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Italy and I know you like to go </v>

1154
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.420
<v Speaker 2>to Italy and you eat some of that funk </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pasta over there.</v>

1155
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.800
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make you feel the same.</v>

1156
00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:18.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

1157
00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.030
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually don't feel as thick.</v>

1158
00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:25.120
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel way thicker when I feel dumpy </v>

1159
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:25.120
<v Speaker 1>when I eat it back home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1160

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.930
<v Speaker 1>better if you feel better when you need </v>

1183
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:22.331
<v Speaker 1>premise of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know like the plot I guess would be one </v>

1184
00:49:22.581 --> 00:49:25.490
<v Speaker 1>of the fat show used to be fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she lost weight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's all she lost the weight.</v>

1187
00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so fucked up.</v>

1188
00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:37.370

<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

1189
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Who punched her in the face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her Dad's eating cake.</v>

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Stop eating cake.</v>

1192
00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.550
<v Speaker 1>That's just stupid premise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

1193

<v Speaker 1>people who hurt her.</v>

<v Speaker 9>I don't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not going to go to a black.</v>

1285
00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 9>I puked and then I woke up again in the </v>
<v Speaker 9>hospital.</v>

1286
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.770
<v Speaker 9>That was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That was the worst one I ever had.</v>

<v Speaker 9>vertebrae and the doctor kept saying how</v>

1288
00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:38.250
<v Speaker 9>was inches of pressure away from </v>
<v Speaker 9>cracking from bringing my fucking neck </v>

1289
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:40.200
<v Speaker 9>because all of my weight went one way.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That was bad.</v>

1290
00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:42.600
<v Speaker 9>Football was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Football was helmet to helmet.</v>

1291
00:53:42.601 --> 00:53:45.090
<v Speaker 9>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That shit sucks.</v>

1292
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:50.091
<v Speaker 9>I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was kicking the ball because our </v>

1293
00:53:50.091 --> 00:53:50.091
<v Speaker 9>kicker was hurt and the kid over snapped</v>
<v Speaker 9>and went right over my head.</v>

1294
00:53:50.091 --> 00:53:51.030
<v Speaker 9>I went and grabbed me.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Soon as I turned around,</v>

1295
00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.930
<v Speaker 9>I got fucking locked and then a guy in </v>
<v Speaker 9>the sideline goes,</v>

1300
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:04.740
<v Speaker 2>I got smoked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look like a fucking rag.</v>

<v Speaker 9>It's.</v>

1302
00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:10.480
<v Speaker 9>It's a weird thing when people cheer.</v>
<v Speaker 9>When someone gets gravely injured.</v>

1303
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:15.510
<v Speaker 9>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>People love it because it's because you </v>

1304
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.510
<v Speaker 9>[inaudible] the force of it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh shit.</v>

1305
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:17.710
<v Speaker 9>It looks incredible to see.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let me think about fights.</v>

1306
00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.610
<v Speaker 9>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1308
00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.180
<v Speaker 9>you can't believe you're watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's why the human,</v>

1309
00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:26.700
<v Speaker 9>the human emotion of like</v>

1310
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:30.590
<v Speaker 2>it could be fucking dead soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the most disturbing ones I ever saw</v>

1311
00:54:30.591 --> 00:54:35.591
<v Speaker 2>was Francis and knocked out Alistair </v>
<v Speaker 2>overeem with this fucking left hook </v>

1312

1314
00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:48.170
<v Speaker 2>fucking her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he literally flatlined.</v>

1315
00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just flatlined leg legs,</v>

1316
00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:54.740
<v Speaker 2>spread out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>toes curled one punch.</v>

1317
00:54:54.741 --> 00:54:59.741
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so powerful and so horrific that </v>

1318
00:54:59.741 --> 00:54:59.741
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1319
00:54:59.741 --> 00:55:00.930
<v Speaker 2>you can't help but go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1321
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:09.430
<v Speaker 2>but see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are cheering for someone getting </v>

1322
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.430
<v Speaker 2>horribly injured.</v>

1323
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.430
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I had a moment at,</v>

1324
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:12.200
<v Speaker 9>at UFC two to five and that's what it </v>
<v Speaker 9>was in Chicago.</v>

1325
00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:17.260
<v Speaker 9>I had a moment where I'm sitting on the </v>
<v Speaker 9>floor and I was looking around and Tony </v>

1326
00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:17.770
<v Speaker 9>and I were um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1327
00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:18.440
<v Speaker 9>it was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it was,</v>

1328
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:20.300
<v Speaker 9>it was between fights and Tony and Tony </v>
<v Speaker 9>goes,</v>

1329
00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.160
<v Speaker 9>this fucking awesome man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I go,</v>

1330
00:55:22.161 --> 00:55:24.620
<v Speaker 9>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And as I'm looking around it like soaked</v>

1331
00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:29.621
<v Speaker 9>for a second in me that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this is so a hit like historic in nature</v>

1332
00:55:29.901 --> 00:55:32.750
<v Speaker 9>of like people gathering to watch people</v>
<v Speaker 9>fight.</v>

1333
00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:37.780
<v Speaker 9>It was so like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it brought me to this weird place of </v>

1334
00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:40.961
<v Speaker 9>like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>isn't this insane to think that all </v>

1335
00:55:40.961 --> 00:55:43.260
<v Speaker 9>these humans are just coming to watch </v>
<v Speaker 9>these two athletes just grapple at one </v>

1336
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:43.520
<v Speaker 9>another?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was just,</v>

1337
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:45.530
<v Speaker 9>it was interesting because the other </v>
<v Speaker 9>sporting events don't,</v>

1338
00:55:45.531 --> 00:55:46.730
<v Speaker 9>don't hit,</v>
<v Speaker 9>didn't hit me like that.</v>

1339
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.950
<v Speaker 9>But when remember when you were a kid </v>
<v Speaker 9>and the kids would decide we're going to</v>

1340
00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:51.750
<v Speaker 9>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 9>one wants to watch.</v>

1341
00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:53.720
<v Speaker 9>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Everybody gathered around.</v>

1342
00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:58.780
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was way more exciting than what was </v>

1343
00:55:58.780 --> 00:55:58.780
<v Speaker 9>going on in the stupid classrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There was,</v>

1344
00:55:58.780 --> 00:55:58.990
<v Speaker 9>there was little,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there was a little area in,</v>

1345
00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:01.400
<v Speaker 9>in my high school that people fought at </v>
<v Speaker 9>this like little secret guard.</v>

1346
00:56:01.401 --> 00:56:02.600
<v Speaker 9>It was like a place that you could get </v>
<v Speaker 9>to,</v>

1347
00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:04.490
<v Speaker 9>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 9>And people love.</v>

1348
00:56:04.491 --> 00:56:05.410
<v Speaker 9>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They set up fighting.</v>

1349
00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.700
<v Speaker 9>Two dudes fought over this one girl.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They were both fucking and,</v>

1350
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:10.280
<v Speaker 9>and she was there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That was,</v>

1351
00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:15.460
<v Speaker 9>that was even more fucking brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The the kid that they thought was going </v>

1352
00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:15.590
<v Speaker 9>to win,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he was.</v>

1353
00:56:15.591 --> 00:56:17.360
<v Speaker 9>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean he was just a tough kid,</v>

1354
00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:18.380
<v Speaker 9>but he had.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He had,</v>

1355
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:19.370
<v Speaker 9>it was the middle of winter.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'll,</v>

1356

<v Speaker 9>and he had really bad acne and the other</v>

1357
00:56:22.191 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 9>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 9>every time landed a punch.</v>

1358
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.680
<v Speaker 1>You would see the redness get worse in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his acne,</v>

1359
00:56:26.681 --> 00:56:28.450
<v Speaker 1>in the blood start coming out of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>

<v Speaker 1>zit blood as rough as it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight.</v>

1363
00:56:39.791 --> 00:56:41.620
<v Speaker 1>but you also get your ass kicked.</v>

<v Speaker 1>which was even more fucking brash </v>

1365
00:56:46.621 --> 00:56:46.621
<v Speaker 1>occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how girls are such assholes.</v>

1366
00:56:46.621 --> 00:56:47.950
<v Speaker 1>She stood there and watched these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>dickheads fight over her shit.</v>

1367
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:49.720

<v Speaker 1>Michael Douglas claimed you have </v>

1619
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.950
<v Speaker 1>terminal cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the story behind that?</v>

1620
01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:02.470
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killer responded.</v>

1621
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can read that quicker.</v>

1622
01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.680
<v Speaker 1>He was probably trying to help me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

1623
01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>

1624
01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the screen got filled</v>

1625
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:21.310
<v Speaker 2>with all of these popups for possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>new videos that you want to watch while </v>

1626
01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:22.380
<v Speaker 2>you're watching a video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1627
01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:26.300
<v Speaker 2>I did have a healing of cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my tongue is still swollen,</v>

1628
01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:31.360
<v Speaker 2>although healing all the time because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't sound my normal self yet.</v>

1629
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:34.010
<v Speaker 2>People think I may still be under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weather.</v>

1630
01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:37.910
<v Speaker 2>I like to refer to cancer as under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weather.</v>

1631
01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.070
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty bold leap.</v>

1632
01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.100
<v Speaker 2>But when he got really fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1633
01:08:42.101 --> 01:08:43.840
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the reasons why I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>

1634
01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:48.770
<v Speaker 2>but he was really unhealthy because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it wasn't just see what.</v>

1635
01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was just that he got </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>

1636
01:08:50.841 --> 01:08:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I think he also was like really fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up for awhile health wise in terms of he</v>

1637
01:08:55.821 --> 01:08:57.980
<v Speaker 2>just looked so different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bu's and chant.</v>

1638
01:08:58.190 --> 01:09:01.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two Thousand 15.</v>

1639
01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:02.720
<v Speaker 2>He was rushed to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1640
01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.410
<v Speaker 2>but this is before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but see before 2015,</v>

1641
01:09:06.411 --> 01:09:07.580
<v Speaker 2>he looks so strange there.</v>

1642
01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.860
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't look like the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1643
01:09:09.861 --> 01:09:14.861
<v Speaker 2>it looks like he's got a Bandana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks and it looks like he's got to </v>

1644
01:09:14.861 --> 01:09:16.800
<v Speaker 2>look at his left eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what.</v>

1645
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:17.870
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that say?</v>

1646
01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Scroll up to what is his left eye </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at and as you're looking at </v>

1647
01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:23.020
<v Speaker 2>someone choose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's got a nice tip.</v>

1648
01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Someone's got great shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looking at one ticket.</v>

1649
01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Left it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Geez,</v>

1650
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:31.490
<v Speaker 2>I'd love just that left head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Left to the juicy.</v>

1651
01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:34.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm running errands and London without </v>
<v Speaker 2>his trick.</v>

1652
01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:36.050
<v Speaker 2>A tracheotomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trey.</v>

1653
01:09:36.230 --> 01:09:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Trey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you say that?</v>

1654
01:09:37.041 --> 01:09:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Tracheotomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Craig asked me to.</v>

1655
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he did.</v>

1656
01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:41.270
<v Speaker 2>He had a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1657
01:09:41.271 --> 01:09:43.860
<v Speaker 2>that's why he's it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1658
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.440
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I mean when they say rumors.</v>

1659
01:09:45.441 --> 01:09:50.441
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do remember that he had denied it </v>

1660
01:09:50.441 --> 01:09:50.441
<v Speaker 2>heavily that he had cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a whole 2013.</v>

1661
01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Douglas for oral cancer.</v>

1662
01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck me.</v>

1663
01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:01.240
<v Speaker 2>I could douglas do them now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that whole thing about him </v>

1664
01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:01.240
<v Speaker 2>saying that he went down on his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his wife too much,</v>

1665
01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.600
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it like a big thing that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1666
01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:08.340
<v Speaker 2>he said that there was a rumor that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said find out what the story about that </v>

1667
01:10:09.441 --> 01:10:14.441
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should probably should clarify </v>

1668
01:10:14.441 --> 01:10:14.441
<v Speaker 2>because I want to know what she got </v>
<v Speaker 2>really mad at that apparently.</v>

1669
01:10:14.441 --> 01:10:14.441
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1670
01:10:14.441 --> 01:10:15.470
<v Speaker 2>because she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't got cancer pussy.</v>

1671
01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Imagine your wise pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So funky.</v>

1672
01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:21.260
<v Speaker 2>But people do get a lot of cancer from </v>
<v Speaker 2>throat cancer,</v>

1673
01:10:21.261 --> 01:10:22.940
<v Speaker 2>from HPV apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1674
01:10:22.941 --> 01:10:24.060
<v Speaker 2>that's real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1675
01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.080
<v Speaker 2>That's really from Lincoln.</v>

1676
01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1677
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:37.790
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even a lot of pussy venereal diseases </v>

1678
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:38.540
<v Speaker 2>are so weird because diseases that </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically come from sex.</v>

1679
01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Michael Douglas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1680
01:10:39.921 --> 01:10:43.490
<v Speaker 2>I was sorry for the effect of oral sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer comments on my wife.</v>

1681
01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did he say though?</v>

1682
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Inside regretted the embarrassment </v>
<v Speaker 2>caused to his wife Catherine Zeta Jones </v>

1683
01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:56.441
<v Speaker 2>by the revelation two years ago that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer may have been caused by </v>

1684
01:10:56.441 --> 01:10:57.290
<v Speaker 2>performing oral sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably just joking.</v>

1685
01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:02.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was that his illness </v>

1686
01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:03.560
<v Speaker 2>was a result of contracting the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>papilloma virus,</v>

1687
01:11:03.561 --> 01:11:08.450
<v Speaker 2>which experts believe can be brought on </v>
<v Speaker 2>by Cunnilingus.</v>

1688
01:11:08.451 --> 01:11:13.451
<v Speaker 2>I love that word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The store made headlines around the </v>

1689
01:11:13.451 --> 01:11:16.601
<v Speaker 2>world when Douglas was promoting his </v>
<v Speaker 2>emmy winning role in liberace bio pic </v>

1690
01:11:17.011 --> 01:11:20.610
<v Speaker 2>behind the candelabra after being </v>
<v Speaker 2>declared free of cancer.</v>

1691
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:22.500
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you ever see that movie,</v>

1692
01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:28.230
<v Speaker 2>Diaz and a fucking bit on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That unfortunately has been lost because</v>

1693
01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Joey Diaz has never really done a </v>
<v Speaker 2>special other than he didn't one special</v>

1694
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:37.010
<v Speaker 2>couple of years back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you to do a special on Joey Diaz,</v>

1695
01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:42.020
<v Speaker 2>what you really do need to have joey do </v>
<v Speaker 2>like five nights in a row and just turn </v>

1696
01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:46.971
<v Speaker 2>the cameras on every night and just let </v>
<v Speaker 2>them go loose and then fill it all and </v>

1697
01:11:46.971 --> 01:11:48.200
<v Speaker 2>then eventually you'll get that Joey </v>
<v Speaker 2>Diaz mom 100 percent.</v>

1698
01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Get that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you say,</v>

1699
01:11:50.041 --> 01:11:50.760
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey,</v>

1700
01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:54.210
<v Speaker 2>be yourself now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get on camera and guys clap it in.</v>

1701
01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:59.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just hard for a guy who's that wild</v>
<v Speaker 2>and loose to be wild and loose on demand</v>

1702
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:03.810
<v Speaker 2>with a bunch of lighting on and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to put makeup on him and everything</v>

1703
01:12:03.811 --> 01:12:06.960
<v Speaker 2>becomes artificial and it ruins the vibe</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what standup is.</v>

1704
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.390
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So unfortunately,</v>

1705
01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.700
<v Speaker 2>you know joey being the wild man that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1706
01:12:11.701 --> 01:12:15.480
<v Speaker 2>He's never a lot of his greatest bits </v>
<v Speaker 2>are never been captured,</v>

1707
01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:19.470
<v Speaker 2>but he had a Michael Douglas doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberace bit.</v>

1708
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:24.500
<v Speaker 2>That was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so good because if you're </v>

1709
01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:25.200

1867
01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:06.620
<v Speaker 2>it and he would also have to be </v>

1868
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:09.530
<v Speaker 2>like why he'd want to want.</v>

<v Speaker 9>We're watching Santina play with his </v>
<v Speaker 9>phone.</v>

1959
01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:38.160
<v Speaker 9>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're one of those no cases on your </v>

1960
01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:38.160
<v Speaker 9>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Fuck that.</v>

1961
01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:38.160
<v Speaker 9>What's the difference in risk taking </v>
<v Speaker 9>move.</v>

1962
01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:38.630
<v Speaker 9>But.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But what,</v>

1963
01:23:38.631 --> 01:23:39.600
<v Speaker 9>what?</v>
<v Speaker 9>What's gonna Happen?</v>

1964
01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:41.320
<v Speaker 9>That's gonna break.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But then I get a new one.</v>

1965
01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.810
<v Speaker 9>So first world,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but the apple care shit.</v>

1966
01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:48.460
<v Speaker 9>It's 90 bucks and you get a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But do you want it to get a new one?</v>

1967
01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:53.490
<v Speaker 9>Don't you want to just protect your </v>
<v Speaker 9>phone so you have to go to the fucking </v>

1968
01:23:53.490 --> 01:23:53.490
<v Speaker 9>apple store when you drop your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Here's my argument.</v>

1969
01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:54.980
<v Speaker 9>You have an argument for that here?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

1970
01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:56.260
<v Speaker 9>because everyone says it's white.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Look.</v>

1971
01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:58.990
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This is why I liked the sleekness.</v>

1972
01:23:58.991 --> 01:24:01.060
<v Speaker 9>The design,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the feel is beautiful.</v>

1973
01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:02.650
<v Speaker 9>Then we put cases on them and fuck them </v>
<v Speaker 9>up.</v>

1974
01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:04.170
<v Speaker 9>They brag about how thin and one of them</v>
<v Speaker 9>they are.</v>

1975
01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:09.180
<v Speaker 9>Then you shove a fucking case on it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It loses all the beauty and the </v>

1976
01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:12.781
<v Speaker 9>architecture of why I like the from </v>
<v Speaker 9>Steve Jobs was in love with the idea of </v>

1977
01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:14.200
<v Speaker 9>like the design of the phone and that's </v>
<v Speaker 9>what apple's whole stance used to be.</v>

1978
01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:19.380
<v Speaker 9>Sleekness design could thin like </v>
<v Speaker 9>everything about it was how sexy it was </v>

1979
01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:19.990
<v Speaker 9>and then we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

1980
01:24:19.991 --> 01:24:20.860
<v Speaker 9>put a fucking case on it.</v>

1981
01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:22.720
<v Speaker 9>So it never breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Still succeed with this case.</v>

1982
01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:25.840
<v Speaker 9>No chunky.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This sounds classist,</v>

1983
01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:28.870
<v Speaker 9>but like I have enough money.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You obviously way more than me,</v>

1984
01:24:28.871 --> 01:24:31.750
<v Speaker 9>but like you can afford to break it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so I just don't care if I.</v>

1985
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.170
<v Speaker 9>most Americans that like breaking a </v>
<v Speaker 9>phone is a big deal.</v>

1986
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:37.180
<v Speaker 9>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I can afford to buy a new phone.</v>

1987
01:24:37.181 --> 01:24:40.810
<v Speaker 9>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I know you're so first world.</v>

1988
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:41.950
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but that's fucking honest.</v>

1989
01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:43.290
<v Speaker 9>That's like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 9>everyone will go.</v>

2138
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:34.020

<v Speaker 1>fanny pack in the overhead compartment,</v>

2139
01:30:34.021 --> 01:30:36.720

<v Speaker 1>and put it in my pockets you could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then she couldn't say.</v>

01:30:45.721 --> 01:30:48.600
<v Speaker 1>this is a power move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever told me that before.</v>

2145
01:30:48.601 --> 01:30:50.730
<v Speaker 1>One Lady told me to take the fanny pack </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

2146
01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I think she was just anti fanny pack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see.</v>

2147
01:30:53.161 --> 01:30:58.161
<v Speaker 1>But you know this and Americans that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have experienced that know when you fly </v>

2148
01:30:58.161 --> 01:31:02.221
<v Speaker 1>in business or first they treat you like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fucking king and when you fly in the </v>

2149
01:31:02.221 --> 01:31:02.890
<v Speaker 1>bud of the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't give a fuck about true.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2151
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:08.070
<v Speaker 1>but she was doing that because she's fed</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with whatever her day was,</v>

2152
01:31:08.190 --> 01:31:09.900
<v Speaker 1>but most time they let you get away with</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2153
01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I think she was Chubby and she wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting Dick and that fancy.</v>

2154
01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:19.720

<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you said that.</v>

2157
01:31:24.090 --> 01:31:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I just need to know before I put my </v>
<v Speaker 1>fanny pack away just because of a lack </v>

2158
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:29.090
<v Speaker 1>of Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be great if she goes,</v>

2159
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:30.090
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2160
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:35.270
<v Speaker 1>And then just walked away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to give me some deck you can </v>

2161
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.310

<v Speaker 1>that stuck in their fucking heads.</v>

<v Speaker 1>do you know?</v>

2302
01:37:18.681 --> 01:37:19.860
<v Speaker 1>This article came out about redheads.</v>

2303
01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:24.880
<v Speaker 1>We produce our own vitamin D.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to at like twice the rate of a </v>

2304
01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:24.880
<v Speaker 1>normal human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2305
01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:27.170
<v Speaker 1>while you're so white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

2306
01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that white for a redhead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that bad.</v>

2307
01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:31.960
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking more pale than I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am you guys getting angry?</v>

2308
01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:34.460

<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

2309
01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2310
01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:38.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole reason why people got </v>
<v Speaker 1>white in the first place.</v>

2311
01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.390
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I read redheads,</v>

2312
01:37:39.391 --> 01:37:41.300
<v Speaker 1>pacifically producers more than any </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

2313
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:44.090
<v Speaker 1>We produce twice as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vitamin D is anybody else on the planet?</v>

2314
01:37:44.091 --> 01:37:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2315
01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:46.760
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's a correlation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you read heads.</v>

2316
01:37:46.761 --> 01:37:51.761
<v Speaker 1>Been happy because vitamin D is one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that fucks people up like in </v>

2317
01:37:51.761 --> 01:37:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

2318
01:37:51.970 --> 01:37:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

2319
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.160
<v Speaker 1>That's why they tell people the most red</v>
<v Speaker 1>heads are happy.</v>

2320
01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:00.320
<v Speaker 1>You think there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's a correlation </v>

2321
01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:00.320
<v Speaker 1>between A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2322
01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:00.320
<v Speaker 1>a lot of funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean Burger.</v>

2323
01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:02.270
<v Speaker 1>You Louie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three really funny redheads.</v>

2324
01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say this though,</v>

2325
01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:08.390
<v Speaker 1>the majority of American red had </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than European red heads </v>

2326
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:09.260
<v Speaker 1>because they grew up in dreary shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2327
01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:11.970
<v Speaker 1>So their conditions are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you have sun?</v>

2328
01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:17.180
<v Speaker 1>You live in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every state probably have massive </v>

2329
01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:17.180
<v Speaker 1>amounts of vitamin D.</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably too much.</v>

2330
01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone checked you out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

2331
01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:22.360
<v Speaker 1>this guy's dying a vitamin D.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's overdosing on vitamin D and d here.</v>

2337
01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:37.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean we make it ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we get it from exposure to a star.</v>

2338
01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:40.950
<v Speaker 1>You've read about these people that just</v>

01:41:54.130 --> 01:41:57.520
<v Speaker 1>What are the benefits of compression </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes for athletics?</v>

2417
01:41:57.521 --> 01:41:59.310
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some compression.</v>

2418
01:41:59.310 --> 01:42:02.550
<v Speaker 1>A salesman that fucking hit us up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just give rights to nine.</v>

2419
01:42:02.590 --> 01:42:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Our paragraph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started to shake for compression </v>

2420
01:42:08.051 --> 01:42:09.520
<v Speaker 1>socks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ties quick,</v>

2421
01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:14.580
<v Speaker 1>properly designed and fitted compression</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're prevent venous blood pooling </v>

2422
01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:16.840
<v Speaker 1>in the legs and improve leg symptoms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>decrease the risk of blood clots.</v>

2423
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's so much blood flow when </v>

2424
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.910
<v Speaker 1>you're working out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2425
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I highly doubt there's a lot of pooling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and athletes.</v>

2426
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:25.390
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I saw when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Thailand where they had stores,</v>

2427
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:26.500
<v Speaker 1>stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stores,</v>

2428
01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:31.920
<v Speaker 1>stores that were was all compression </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothing including face masks and </v>

2429
01:42:32.681 --> 01:42:33.490
<v Speaker 1>gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a.</v>

2430
01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:35.880
<v Speaker 1>that's just like a leather daddy suit </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that was like.</v>

2431
01:42:35.890 --> 01:42:39.430
<v Speaker 1>It was tan skin card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking strange,</v>

2432
01:42:39.431 --> 01:42:39.950
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>

2433
01:42:40.030 --> 01:42:41.260
<v Speaker 1>We're outside the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2434
01:42:41.261 --> 01:42:44.380
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

2435
01:42:44.410 --> 01:42:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Oppression shops through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had it for little kids.</v>

2436
01:42:47.170 --> 01:42:48.850
<v Speaker 1>No little masks.</v>

2437
01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:54.020
<v Speaker 1>A little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're getting into a weird </v>

2438
01:42:54.020 --> 01:42:54.020
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little pants,</v>

2439
01:42:54.020 --> 01:42:54.220
<v Speaker 1>little masks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little shirts.</v>

2440
01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:56.140
<v Speaker 1>It was real strange shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit is gross.</v>

2441
01:42:56.150 --> 01:42:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Then you get into a territory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something pervy.</v>

2442
01:42:58.060 --> 01:42:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it's people that eat too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>noodles.</v>

2443
01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:03.940
<v Speaker 1>You just eat all those carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just fed down.</v>

2444
01:43:04.050 --> 01:43:05.090
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people that travel.</v>

2445
01:43:05.091 --> 01:43:10.091
<v Speaker 1>My Dad used to work with this guy and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>would travel a lot and he always wore </v>

2446
01:43:10.091 --> 01:43:10.091
<v Speaker 1>compression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a bigger dude.</v>

2447
01:43:10.091 --> 01:43:14.580
<v Speaker 1>He wore compression sleeves and socks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff on planes because traveling a </v>

2448
01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:14.580
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why that piece.</v>

2449
01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:19.291
<v Speaker 1>Some people like it for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some people use compression </v>

2450
01:43:19.291 --> 01:43:21.421
<v Speaker 1>socks when they travel up there on </v>
<v Speaker 1>planes all the time because you do pool </v>

2451
01:43:21.421 --> 01:43:21.421
<v Speaker 1>and clot on planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2452
01:43:21.421 --> 01:43:25.470
<v Speaker 1>It happens to people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Pool and clot blood can pool on </v>

2453
01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:25.470
<v Speaker 1>planes very easily.</v>

2454
01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Don't you need to just go to the gym?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Lazy.</v>

2455
01:43:26.801 --> 01:43:31.801
<v Speaker 1>Fuck fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn fact fucking compression </v>

2456
01:43:31.801 --> 01:43:31.801
<v Speaker 1>shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to fix it.</v>

2457
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:32.980
<v Speaker 1>That's just wrong with your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If they,</v>

2461
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:44.310

<v Speaker 1>if they had an airline that you could </v>

2462
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.980
<v Speaker 1>work out on the fly and play a pay a </v>
<v Speaker 1>premium and had a gym in the back of the</v>

2463
01:43:44.981 --> 01:43:46.980
<v Speaker 1>plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on a commercial jet,</v>

2466
01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Kids start getting sucked through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>list.</v>

<v Speaker 2>All your own risk and you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the perfect bit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Cop goes flying through the whole floor </v>

2473
01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:14.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't lift weights there,</v>

2474
01:44:14.961 --> 01:44:16.580
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you can have machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2475
01:44:16.581 --> 01:44:21.581
<v Speaker 2>that'd be a cool machine.</v>

2476
01:44:21.581 --> 01:44:21.581
<v Speaker 2>resistance bands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Machines.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Those was like a cable cable machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>What does this,</v>

2479
01:44:24.561 --> 01:44:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on its way.</v>

2480
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:31.130
<v Speaker 2>What's Santina knows ahead of the curve </v>
<v Speaker 2>ahead of the modular modular planes.</v>

2481
01:44:31.131 --> 01:44:36.131
<v Speaker 2>I think that they've sort of the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of here in the flight exercise </v>

2482
01:44:36.131 --> 01:44:36.131
<v Speaker 2>project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>

2483
01:44:36.131 --> 01:44:38.330
<v Speaker 2>let's go up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we could read that inflight exercise.</v>

2484
01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Your next flight abroad could include a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim.</v>

2485
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:42.950
<v Speaker 2>When's this article published?</v>
<v Speaker 2>May,</v>

2486
01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:47.980
<v Speaker 2>may pose an Airbus project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is displaying a prototype flying jim </v>

2487
01:44:48.381 --> 01:44:49.940
<v Speaker 2>module,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the San Jose airport.</v>

2488
01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:54.170
<v Speaker 2>The modules can be used for spas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>napping pods or gaming center.</v>

2489
01:44:54.171 --> 01:44:56.090
<v Speaker 2>That's tight trans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop,</v>

2490
01:44:56.091 --> 01:44:57.050
<v Speaker 2>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop scrolling.</v>

2491
01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Transpose isn't the first to suggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>using cabin space for activities that </v>

2492
01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.070
<v Speaker 2>promote wellness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although such ideas are intriguing.</v>

2493
01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:09.400
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these concepts don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>account for the business model of air </v>

2494
01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:12.611
<v Speaker 2>travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Says Devin Lidl principle behind </v>

2495
01:45:12.611 --> 01:45:15.490
<v Speaker 2>strategist of fatigue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet he's what's called the fund stopper.</v>

2496
01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Devin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking fuck head.</v>

2497
01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:21.220
<v Speaker 2>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are sleep.</v>

2498
01:45:21.230 --> 01:45:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like a,</v>

2499
01:45:22.150 --> 01:45:23.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like rubber bands.</v>

2500
01:45:23.781 --> 01:45:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Like you do like yoga mats or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2501
01:45:29.150 --> 01:45:32.480
<v Speaker 2>That's Kinda cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that seems reasonable,</v>

2502
01:45:32.481 --> 01:45:37.481
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like so few people are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to use it that it's going to be one of </v>

2503
01:45:37.481 --> 01:45:37.730
<v Speaker 2>those things where after awhile it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

2504
01:45:37.731 --> 01:45:42.731
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember when we used to have a smoking </v>

2505
01:45:42.731 --> 01:45:42.731
<v Speaker 2>port at the back of the plane?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's going to be like.</v>

2506
01:45:42.731 --> 01:45:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Remember that used to have a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That shit's awesome.</v>

2508
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:52.030
<v Speaker 2>When we were flying to Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this one dude that went to </v>

2509
01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:53.120
<v Speaker 2>sleep immediately and he was an enormous</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

2551
01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2552
01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:21.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that sugar documentary claims </v>

2553
01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:21.870
<v Speaker 1>that it's in the revolution of corn </v>
<v Speaker 1>syrups.</v>

2554
01:47:21.871 --> 01:47:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Introduction into the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know though,</v>

2555
01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:26.880
<v Speaker 1>like when people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the transition,</v>

2556
01:47:27.110 --> 01:47:31.140
<v Speaker 1>what was a rare person like way back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day they got that fat,</v>

2557
01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:33.540
<v Speaker 1>like what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the six sixties in the seventies,</v>

2558
01:47:33.541 --> 01:47:36.210
<v Speaker 1>things started to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2559
01:47:36.330 --> 01:47:41.330
<v Speaker 1>I imagine when our technology boom </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the eighties as probably </v>

2560
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.330
<v Speaker 1>when it all started.</v>

2561
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Well it happened before that for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was also like sugary cereals and </v>

2562
01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:46.020
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2563
01:47:46.021 --> 01:47:47.430
<v Speaker 1>And doesn't that stuff introducing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>

2564
01:47:47.570 --> 01:47:50.610
<v Speaker 1>seventies were like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the end of like natural cereal?</v>

2565
01:47:50.670 --> 01:47:55.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had those sugary cereals in the </v>

2566
01:47:55.670 --> 01:47:55.670
<v Speaker 1>seventies for sure because I was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid,</v>

2567
01:47:55.670 --> 01:47:56.700
<v Speaker 1>a little kid in the seventies where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they are today.</v>

2568
01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cocoa puffs in like.</v>

2569
01:47:59.010 --> 01:48:04.010
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the amount of hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what it is comparatively </v>

2570
01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:06.411
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because now it's like 40 grams of </v>

2571
01:48:06.411 --> 01:48:06.411
<v Speaker 1>fucking cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2572
01:48:06.411 --> 01:48:06.411
<v Speaker 1>it's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the same.</v>

2573
01:48:06.411 --> 01:48:11.120
<v Speaker 1>He do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then do you think it's because they </v>

2574
01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:11.120
<v Speaker 1>were using cane sugar then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In different times?</v>

2575
01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I think people got fat even back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's expanded.</v>

2576
01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:15.840
<v Speaker 1>It's expanded to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2577
01:48:15.841 --> 01:48:18.720
<v Speaker 1>convenience to write those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get any fast food everywhere all</v>

2578
01:48:18.721 --> 01:48:19.050
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2579
01:48:19.530 --> 01:48:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four hours is brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

2580
01:48:21.331 --> 01:48:23.130

<v Speaker 1>They make their buttons.</v>

01:51:10.781 --> 01:51:13.510
<v Speaker 1>four and 100 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

2648
01:51:13.511 --> 01:51:18.511
<v Speaker 1>Not even a real guy for $100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not even a real guy.</v>

2649
01:51:22.690 --> 01:51:24.730
<v Speaker 1>That's a fake number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What year was that?</v>

2650
01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:27.580
<v Speaker 1>James Madison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy.</v>

2651
01:51:27.581 --> 01:51:32.320
<v Speaker 1>That's tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five for a 100 pound or pound grown man.</v>

2652
01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:34.180
<v Speaker 1>What did he eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Presidential term?</v>

2653
01:51:34.181 --> 01:51:34.520
<v Speaker 1>18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2654
01:51:34.521 --> 01:51:37.480
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 18 slash 17 people back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't have any food.</v>

2655
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I think the average height person </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably five,</v>

2656
01:51:39.011 --> 01:51:39.430
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

2657
01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:44.440
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they were always just dodge and </v>

2658
01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were a smaller,</v>

2659
01:51:44.621 --> 01:51:46.750
<v Speaker 1>the arrows that go over your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we didn't have to duck,</v>

2660
01:51:46.751 --> 01:51:47.530
<v Speaker 1>you can just stand there.</v>

2661
01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>

2662
01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:54.430
<v Speaker 1>That's not funny though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you if you.</v>

2663
01:51:54.431 --> 01:51:56.950
<v Speaker 1>If you had a sliding scale of the height</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the presidents,</v>

2664
01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:02.110
<v Speaker 1>but there was a thing about the civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>war where they said that,</v>

2665
01:52:02.111 --> 01:52:07.111
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average soldier in the civil war </v>

2666
01:52:07.111 --> 01:52:07.490
<v Speaker 1>weighed 125 pounds because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 17,</v>

2667
01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:09.580
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 years since they were kids.</v>

2668
01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the soldiers were like children.</v>

2669
01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

2670
01:52:12.911 --> 01:52:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the soldiers today or young,</v>

2671
01:52:14.951 --> 01:52:16.930
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use 18 as a standard,</v>

2672
01:52:16.931 --> 01:52:18.520
<v Speaker 1>but back in the day there wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking number.</v>

2673
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonder what the number was?</v>

2674
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Google the average size of a soldier in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the civil war.</v>

2675
01:52:25.001 --> 01:52:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it was 125 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2676
01:52:28.031 --> 01:52:32.380

<v Speaker 1>One 43.</v>

2682
01:52:38.930 --> 01:52:41.140
<v Speaker 1>The average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look up the Ed.</v>

2683
01:52:41.141 --> 01:52:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

2684
01:52:42.730 --> 01:52:44.810
<v Speaker 1>I spoke to quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a no.</v>

2685
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil war.</v>

2686
01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:49.910
<v Speaker 1>An average civil war soldier was white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>native born farmer,</v>

2687
01:52:49.911 --> 01:52:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Protestants single between 18 and 29 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stood about five,</v>

2688
01:52:53.070 --> 01:52:54.350
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1:43.</v>

2689
01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:55.690

2690
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:58.250
<v Speaker 1>It was smaller than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That also sounds very under 43.</v>

2691
01:52:58.251 --> 01:53:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Seems like a reasonable size for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time when there's no food,</v>

2692
01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:08.140
<v Speaker 1>but you're also talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't this like how could they </v>

2693
01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:10.451
<v Speaker 1>have been that organized?</v>

2694
01:53:10.451 --> 01:53:12.210

01:53:12.210 --> 01:53:12.210
<v Speaker 1>they weren't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go through the process.</v>

2696
01:53:12.210 --> 01:53:12.210
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

2698
01:53:16.511 --> 01:53:16.511
<v Speaker 1>size?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they've.</v>

2699
01:53:16.511 --> 01:53:16.940

<v Speaker 12>shootings in the school and into </v>

2762
01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:08.520
<v Speaker 12>university.</v>
<v Speaker 12>What do the liberal say is the solution?</v>

2763
01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:15.820
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they blame it on guns because the guns.</v>

2764
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:19.120
<v Speaker 12>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we've got sugar.</v>

2765
01:56:19.190 --> 01:56:24.190
<v Speaker 12>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 12>We started a program in Israel for </v>

2766
01:56:24.190 --> 01:56:26.450
<v Speaker 12>kindle guardians.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>

2767
01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:30.500
<v Speaker 12>We train them from the age 16 down to </v>
<v Speaker 12>the age three.</v>

2768
01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:31.600
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Well I.</v>

2769
01:56:31.601 --> 01:56:36.601
<v Speaker 13>I think it would be a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We'd been pushing something along this </v>

2770
01:56:36.601 --> 01:56:40.841
<v Speaker 13>line for years,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but really haven't gotten any traction </v>

2771
01:56:40.841 --> 01:56:43.571
<v Speaker 13>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We were thinking seventh or eighth </v>

2772
01:56:43.571 --> 01:56:43.571
<v Speaker 13>grade.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You're talking much younger than that.</v>

2773
01:56:43.571 --> 01:56:48.020
<v Speaker 12>My son was in the very first program.</v>
<v Speaker 12>May he rest in peace night doing what I </v>

2774
01:56:50.281 --> 01:56:50.730
<v Speaker 12>love.</v>

2775
01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:57.700
<v Speaker 13>Quite developed a conscious where you </v>
<v Speaker 13>you feel guilty about doing something </v>

2776
01:56:57.951 --> 01:57:00.590
<v Speaker 13>wrong that's developing that you're </v>
<v Speaker 13>learning right and wrong.</v>

2777
01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:02.150
<v Speaker 13>If they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 13>haven't developed that yet.</v>

2778
01:57:02.151 --> 01:57:07.151
<v Speaker 13>They could be very effective soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 13>This year in our state government,</v>

2779
01:57:08.090 --> 01:57:13.090
<v Speaker 13>they had a bill put in that would have </v>
<v Speaker 13>made it illegal for someone four years </v>

2780
01:57:13.551 --> 01:57:16.970
<v Speaker 13>old to 12 years old and have access to a</v>
<v Speaker 13>gun.</v>

2781
01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:17.920
<v Speaker 13>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 13>we,</v>

2782
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.910
<v Speaker 13>we killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We killed the bill.</v>

2783
01:57:20.230 --> 01:57:25.230
<v Speaker 12>They tried to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Four year old children benefit from </v>

2784
01:57:25.230 --> 01:57:25.870
<v Speaker 12>having access to guns.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yes.</v>

2785
01:57:26.230 --> 01:57:28.840
<v Speaker 12>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 12>What is the logic that these people come</v>

2786
01:57:28.841 --> 01:57:33.841
<v Speaker 12>up with?</v>
<v Speaker 12>May just think that children can't </v>

2787
01:57:33.841 --> 01:57:37.771
<v Speaker 12>handle them.</v>
<v Speaker 12>We want players who are really experts </v>

2788
01:57:37.771 --> 01:57:41.191
<v Speaker 12>at what they doing not play.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Also a checklist and we don't teach </v>

2789
01:57:41.191 --> 01:57:45.290
<v Speaker 12>toilets because they call it the </v>
<v Speaker 12>terrible twos for me.</v>

2790

<v Speaker 9>But what's really crazy is the makeup </v>

2792
01:57:55.880 --> 01:58:00.381
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let's look at the makeup that he's </v>

<v Speaker 9>Kingman,</v>

2795
01:58:02.251 --> 01:58:05.330
<v Speaker 9>Arizona and he tries to build a mosque </v>
<v Speaker 9>and they,</v>

<v Speaker 9>Kids like the flooding to watch him go.</v>

2901
02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:50.570
<v Speaker 9>It's not as bad as you're making it out </v>
<v Speaker 9>to be.</v>

2902
02:02:50.571 --> 02:02:51.050
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was,</v>

2903
02:02:51.150 --> 02:02:54.350
<v Speaker 9>I was born black and I'm liking it a lot</v>
<v Speaker 9>and one woman goes,</v>

2904
02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:59.920
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's disturbing because it's shocking </v>

2905
02:02:59.920 --> 02:02:59.920
<v Speaker 9>just to spring this on me,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I don't,</v>

2906
02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:04.301
<v Speaker 9>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not scared I could take on being </v>

2907
02:03:04.301 --> 02:03:04.301
<v Speaker 9>black.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'll just,</v>

2908
02:03:04.301 --> 02:03:04.301
<v Speaker 9>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>let's,</v>

2909
02:03:04.301 --> 02:03:04.301
<v Speaker 9>we'll see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

2910
02:03:04.301 --> 02:03:06.770
<v Speaker 9>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>turn credit.</v>

<v Speaker 9>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we'll just,</v>

2912
02:03:08.421 --> 02:03:10.220
<v Speaker 9>I'll just live with.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We'll just figure this out.</v>

2913
02:03:10.221 --> 02:03:11.000
<v Speaker 9>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

2914
02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:14.510
<v Speaker 9>it was insane that they bought into it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but also that that's how we did it.</v>

2915
02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:19.540
<v Speaker 9>We fucking made him sign beforehand and </v>
<v Speaker 9>then you paid them out and when it's </v>

2916
02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:22.811
<v Speaker 9>over we broke them off more money so </v>
<v Speaker 9>they wouldn't say no because they still </v>

2917
02:03:22.811 --> 02:03:23.470
<v Speaker 9>have the legal right to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm pulling that up.</v>

2918
02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:24.710
<v Speaker 9>You,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you pull it or I'm suing you.</v>

2919
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:29.830
<v Speaker 9>So once it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 9>did they understand that it was for </v>

2920
02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:30.230
<v Speaker 9>comedy central after,</v>
<v Speaker 9>after everything was said and done,</v>

2921
02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:35.290
<v Speaker 9>and then do they laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 9>A few did not laugh a few laps if you </v>

2922
02:03:36.150 --> 02:03:39.350
<v Speaker 9>people are not,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but that was one of my favorite bits.</v>

02:03:39.890 --> 02:03:43.130
<v Speaker 9>Melanin Mayo and man didn't work like a </v>
<v Speaker 9>charm.</v>

<v Speaker 9>this man needs is delicious.</v>

2925
02:03:45.650 --> 02:03:48.740
<v Speaker 9>It was fucking almonds or whatever with </v>
<v Speaker 9>a little brown dye in it.</v>

2926
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:54.370
<v Speaker 9>It's unconventional,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I really like so stupid.</v>

2927
02:03:54.590 --> 02:03:55.820
<v Speaker 9>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

2928
02:03:55.821 --> 02:03:56.810

<v Speaker 9>murdered a bit.</v>

2930
02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:03.640
<v Speaker 9>Seeing people think they're about to </v>
<v Speaker 9>turn black and they panic and the black </v>

2931
02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:03.800

<v Speaker 9>We put our,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 9>sheer is a great improv and he's in a </v>

2934
02:04:09.850 --> 02:04:14.561
<v Speaker 9>room filled with fucking white people </v>
<v Speaker 9>telling them they don't want to go </v>

2935
02:04:14.561 --> 02:04:14.561
<v Speaker 9>black.</v>

2936

2937
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:19.990
<v Speaker 9>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So he was saying that he used to be </v>

2938
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:19.990
<v Speaker 9>white.</v>
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

2939
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:23.120
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he's saying he was the representative </v>

2940
02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:23.150
<v Speaker 9>for the company.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We loved the idea.</v>

2941
02:04:23.180 --> 02:04:28.180
<v Speaker 9>We had images and video of people who </v>
<v Speaker 9>had turned black white people who had </v>

2942
02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:33.041
<v Speaker 9>turned black.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But you didn't tell him till after the </v>

2943
02:04:33.041 --> 02:04:33.041
<v Speaker 9>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's exactly right.</v>

2944
02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:35.690
<v Speaker 9>The food first.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Then we showed them how we said it was a</v>

2945
02:04:35.691 --> 02:04:38.370
<v Speaker 9>commercial because that was whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 9>is like a new commercial campaign for,</v>

2946
02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:40.770

<v Speaker 9>we're going to run along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What do you guys think?</v>

2949

<v Speaker 9>then they had a billboard that somebody </v>
<v Speaker 9>said he was doing stolen valor.</v>

3020
02:07:20.161 --> 02:07:21.570

02:07:21.571 --> 02:07:23.100
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>an injured soldier and an X.</v>

3022
02:07:23.190 --> 02:07:24.780
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There was an ad for him as an ex soldier</v>

3023
02:07:24.781 --> 02:07:27.360
<v Speaker 9>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And so that got a ton of fucking press.</v>

3024
02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:30.270
<v Speaker 9>A ton of press wasn't at the Sarah Palin</v>
<v Speaker 9>One?</v>

3025
02:07:30.650 --> 02:07:32.580
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I wasn't.</v>

3026
02:07:32.581 --> 02:07:33.480
<v Speaker 9>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You'd have to look it up.</v>

3027
02:07:33.481 --> 02:07:36.550
<v Speaker 9>I don't remember which one it was.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think it was a Sarah Pailin</v>

3028
02:07:36.550 --> 02:07:38.020
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a disabled veteran,</v>

3029
02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:39.730
<v Speaker 1>but they were saying right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stolen Valor.</v>

3030
02:07:39.731 --> 02:07:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Selling them out all the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3031
02:07:41.561 --> 02:07:43.210
<v Speaker 1>They were trying anything to discredit </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3032
02:07:43.390 --> 02:07:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a comedy series,</v>

3033
02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:50.880
<v Speaker 1>it's a sketch comedy series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell me a sketch character can't </v>

3034
02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:50.880
<v Speaker 1>play whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3035
02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:51.250
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

3036
02:07:51.330 --> 02:07:53.010
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like people get mad.</v>

3037
02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Say No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it's.</v>

3038
02:07:55.260 --> 02:07:58.360
<v Speaker 1>If you can play a character on a fee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can play a war hero in a film,</v>

3039
02:07:58.361 --> 02:08:01.540
<v Speaker 1>why can you play the opposite?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like born on the fourth of July.</v>

3040
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3041
02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:08.820
<v Speaker 1>What's so funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking that I think the </v>

3042
02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:08.820
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has what he is.</v>

3043
02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:11.270
<v Speaker 1>That is the the outright type guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3044
02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:12.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saying is a bunch of stuff like that.</v>

3045
02:08:12.941 --> 02:08:17.941
<v Speaker 1>And showtime countered the claim here </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the showtime counter.</v>

3046
02:08:20.201 --> 02:08:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Sacha Baron Cohen stolen valor claim.</v>

3047
02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the counter.</v>

3048
02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they.</v>

3049
02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Because it was made public as long </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement about it,</v>

3050
02:08:26.690 --> 02:08:31.690
<v Speaker 1>but widespread misinformation over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past week about the character of Billy </v>

3051
02:08:31.810 --> 02:08:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Wayne Reddick junior phd performed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>section.</v>

3052
02:08:33.161 --> 02:08:36.520
<v Speaker 1>What is the counter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they explained what happened.</v>

3053
02:08:36.521 --> 02:08:39.100
<v Speaker 1>They sort of said that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>misrepresent themselves.</v>

3054
02:08:39.101 --> 02:08:42.360
<v Speaker 1>They probably thought he was someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>riddick.</v>

3055
02:08:42.570 --> 02:08:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Riddick was asked by the senator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was disabled and he stated that he is</v>

3056
02:08:45.611 --> 02:08:48.190
<v Speaker 1>not an uses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mobility scooter to conserve energy.</v>

3057
02:08:48.191 --> 02:08:53.191
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bear Cohen never presented himself as a </v>

3058
02:08:53.191 --> 02:08:53.191
<v Speaker 1>veteran of the US military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former Alaskan governor,</v>

3059
02:08:53.191 --> 02:08:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Palin during the booking process </v>
<v Speaker 1>or during the filming of her interview.</v>

3060
02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there you go.</v>

3061
02:08:55.970 --> 02:08:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scroll down a little bit lower.</v>

3062
02:08:57.650 --> 02:09:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Says on Monday a conservative street </v>
<v Speaker 2>artists replaced a billboard near CBS </v>

<v Speaker 2>shirt.</v>

3065
02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:14.260
<v Speaker 2>The new billboard was kept caption sa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sacha Baron Cohen walks away with a hit </v>

3066
02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:18.380
<v Speaker 2>and a touch of stolen valor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Touch.</v>

3067
02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to say that it's a slight.</v>

3068
02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:21.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a slight at the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the troops.</v>

3069
02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:22.890

<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3070

<v Speaker 1>fought and served our country.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Truly sick.</v>

3075
02:09:39.410 --> 02:09:43.051

3079
02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:53.700
<v Speaker 2>that trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's just trying to game the system by </v>

3080
02:09:53.700 --> 02:09:57.570
<v Speaker 2>state and middle class Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get as many people in there as you </v>

3081
02:09:57.570 --> 02:10:01.501
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prevent Cohen's foreign commentaries </v>

3082
02:10:01.501 --> 02:10:05.260
<v Speaker 2>under the guise of interview questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign commentaries.</v>

3083
02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:09.700
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Under the guise of she's so dumb because</v>

3084
02:10:09.701 --> 02:10:12.460
<v Speaker 2>you imagine that lady almost became our </v>
<v Speaker 2>vice president.</v>

3085
02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck would they think?</v>

3086
02:10:15.611 --> 02:10:18.160
<v Speaker 2>And they had mccain could have won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3087
02:10:18.580 --> 02:10:19.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could have one.</v>

3088
02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was the anchor that fucking sunk </v>

3089
02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:24.760
<v Speaker 2>that book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea that they thought that that</v>

3090
02:10:24.761 --> 02:10:26.350
<v Speaker 2>was a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3091
02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:28.990
<v Speaker 2>she was a pawn man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was such an easy fucking pawn.</v>

3092
02:10:29.170 --> 02:10:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think shavers,</v>

3093
02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I think she was used as this little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this good looking cute item,</v>

3094
02:10:33.921 --> 02:10:34.030
<v Speaker 2>a</v>

3095
02:10:34.030 --> 02:10:39.030
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this middle American gun shooting she </v>

3096
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:41.651
<v Speaker 1>was upon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she was a play and it went too </v>

3097
02:10:41.651 --> 02:10:41.651
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was almost like they didn't know what</v>

3098
02:10:41.651 --> 02:10:41.870
<v Speaker 1>they had gotten themselves into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3099
02:10:41.871 --> 02:10:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I think they thought that was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>could been the.</v>

3100
02:10:44.450 --> 02:10:49.450
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those ingredients that could</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been brilliant or fucking the </v>

3101
02:10:49.450 --> 02:10:49.760
<v Speaker 1>dumbest Shit on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was the governor of Alaska.</v>

3102
02:10:49.790 --> 02:10:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured,</v>

3103
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:52.390
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a good looking woman.</v>

3104
02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:54.710
<v Speaker 1>She's the governor of a state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a mom.</v>

3105
02:10:54.711 --> 02:10:56.540
<v Speaker 1>She shoots guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disabled child.</v>

3106
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:58.490
<v Speaker 1>She had all the things that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3107
02:10:58.491 --> 02:11:00.380
<v Speaker 1>what a good pr push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3108
02:11:00.410 --> 02:11:02.810
<v Speaker 1>There was a disabled child while she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

3109
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3110
02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:05.930
<v Speaker 1>She gave birth like almost like while </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was.</v>

3111
02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:06.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3112
02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:08.210
<v Speaker 1>I think she already had had a disabled </v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

3113
02:11:08.690 --> 02:11:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I think she had had a disabled kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her,</v>

3114
02:11:10.711 --> 02:11:12.530
<v Speaker 1>her other son was a veteran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right or,</v>

3115
02:11:12.590 --> 02:11:13.220
<v Speaker 1>or right.</v>

3116
02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:17.790
<v Speaker 1>And so she had all these things lined up</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were perfect for America.</v>

3117
02:11:17.791 --> 02:11:22.791
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so good when they started </v>

3118
02:11:22.791 --> 02:11:22.791
<v Speaker 1>interviewing her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

3119
02:11:22.791 --> 02:11:23.480
<v Speaker 1>what newspapers do you read?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>

3120
02:11:23.481 --> 02:11:24.620
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>

3121
02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:27.920
<v Speaker 1>I can see Russia from my front porch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember though,</v>

3122
02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:29.090
<v Speaker 1>a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See Russia?</v>

3123
02:11:29.530 --> 02:11:31.040
<v Speaker 1>That was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look right across.</v>

3124
02:11:31.041 --> 02:11:32.880
<v Speaker 1>I see Russia from my porch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>

3125
02:11:33.190 --> 02:11:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Those were like soundbites for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for America to be like she fucked.</v>

3126
02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:39.560
<v Speaker 1>But trump does the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just does it in a.</v>

3127
02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:40.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3128
02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:40.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3129
02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:41.450
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>

3130
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:43.490
<v Speaker 1>I heard about that again the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was listening to,</v>

3131
02:11:43.491 --> 02:11:44.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3132
02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:47.120
<v Speaker 1>it's called the satire paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Revisionist history.</v>

3133
02:11:47.150 --> 02:11:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Malcolm Gladwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were talking about this,</v>

3134
02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:54.240
<v Speaker 1>the therapy incident and a Tina fey </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually said that and everyone thinks </v>

3135
02:11:54.681 --> 02:11:55.910
<v Speaker 1>that's their appeal and actually said </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3136
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:59.120
<v Speaker 1>It came from the snl spoof and </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely got attributed to her.</v>

3137
02:11:59.121 --> 02:12:04.121
<v Speaker 1>And genius also ruined that whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she could see it from her front </v>

3138
02:12:04.121 --> 02:12:04.880
<v Speaker 1>porch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was from a sketch.</v>

3139
02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:07.760
<v Speaker 1>That's not what she did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say something about,</v>

3140
02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.290
<v Speaker 1>she said something about Russia being </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3141
02:12:09.291 --> 02:12:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Her neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did say something about Russia being</v>

3142
02:12:12.081 --> 02:12:13.880
<v Speaker 1>closely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're going to come through Alaska.</v>

3143
02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:17.270
<v Speaker 1>She did say something preposterous like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3144
02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:22.300
<v Speaker 1>If Russia came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would go through her right on </v>

3145
02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:26.950
<v Speaker 1>snopes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't the best place to not be </v>

3146
02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:28.721
<v Speaker 1>looking things up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like they have the article about it </v>

3147
02:12:28.721 --> 02:12:28.721
<v Speaker 1>and it says that this came from an snl </v>
<v Speaker 1>skit.</v>

3148
02:12:28.721 --> 02:12:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well instead of googling that,</v>

3149
02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:33.890
<v Speaker 1>just google Peyton's comment on being </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to Russia.</v>

3150
02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said it sounds like what?</v>

3151
02:12:35.031 --> 02:12:40.031
<v Speaker 1>I googled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I googled Sarah Pailin restaurant from </v>

3152
02:12:40.031 --> 02:12:40.031
<v Speaker 1>my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

3153
02:12:40.031 --> 02:12:40.031
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3154
02:12:40.031 --> 02:12:40.031
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that statement.</v>

3155
02:12:40.031 --> 02:12:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Russia from my house say Pailin on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

3156
02:12:42.531 --> 02:12:45.140
<v Speaker 1>being close to Alaska because she did </v>
<v Speaker 1>say something.</v>

3157
02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:47.090
<v Speaker 1>She didn't say something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

3158
02:12:47.110 --> 02:12:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't as toy said something </v>

3159
02:12:52.110 --> 02:12:52.110
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous enough that people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3160
02:12:52.110 --> 02:12:56.390
<v Speaker 1>What are you saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where through your </v>

3161
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.390
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood they got the influence to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make that sketch.</v>

3162
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:57.290
<v Speaker 1>They're going to fly in jets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dummy.</v>

3163
02:12:57.590 --> 02:13:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Take a walk right across thinking here's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's in Alaska.</v>

3164
02:13:03.450 --> 02:13:05.130
<v Speaker 1>But I think she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that was just,</v>

3165
02:13:05.150 --> 02:13:07.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose as she tweeted,</v>

3166
02:13:07.011 --> 02:13:11.110
<v Speaker 1>remember I can keep an eye on them from </v>
<v Speaker 1>here that her being like,</v>

3167
02:13:11.150 --> 02:13:13.460
<v Speaker 1>let's basically that's the statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also.</v>

3168
02:13:13.461 --> 02:13:18.461
<v Speaker 1>But I think this comes on the heels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>her publicly during at press at some </v>

3169
02:13:18.461 --> 02:13:22.961
<v Speaker 1>point had said something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of like how when trump says </v>

3170
02:13:22.961 --> 02:13:22.961
<v Speaker 1>something once he repeats it over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

3171
02:13:22.961 --> 02:13:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have watched those clips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll say the same.</v>

3172
02:13:24.650 --> 02:13:27.090
<v Speaker 1>The same anecdote because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3173
02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:32.220
<v Speaker 1>it starts to drain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The swamp wasn't once I was a thousand </v>

3174
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:32.460
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've to Tom Arnold last night.</v>

3175
02:13:32.490 --> 02:13:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I know Tom Arnold was backstage and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>just got the trump tapes.</v>

3176
02:13:35.611 --> 02:13:39.870
<v Speaker 1>He said we got a gang of tapes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said there's some crazy shit.</v>

3177
02:13:40.220 --> 02:13:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

3178
02:13:40.861 --> 02:13:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to disclose anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3179
02:13:42.450 --> 02:13:44.490
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said there is a tape.</v>

3180
02:13:45.550 --> 02:13:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3181
02:13:46.230 --> 02:13:50.780
<v Speaker 1>He said there's a tape of him saying the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart and word is repeated.</v>

3182
02:13:50.900 --> 02:13:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I just made you a face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was surprised at that for some </v>

3183
02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:55.900
<v Speaker 1>reason your brain.</v>

3184
02:13:58.230 --> 02:14:01.580
<v Speaker 1>He said it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that the tapes are crazy and not</v>

3185
02:14:01.581 --> 02:14:03.270
<v Speaker 1>putting them out again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's vice vice.</v>

3186
02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said people are turning on him </v>

3187
02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:11.510
<v Speaker 1>left and right because he doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>loyalty to those people that are around </v>

3188
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:14.841
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So apparently those people are turning </v>

3189
02:14:14.841 --> 02:14:14.841
<v Speaker 1>on him left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And testifying and,</v>

3190
02:14:14.841 --> 02:14:17.280
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving up evidence and information.</v>

3191
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody realizes it's a sinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ship.</v>

3192
02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:21.540
<v Speaker 1>We were talking last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>This guy's got three more years of this.</v>

3196
02:14:27.010 --> 02:14:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Saw The news yesterday about the call </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Colin has the tape and he said that</v>

02:19:47.060 --> 02:19:48.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't.</v>

3334
02:19:48.350 --> 02:19:49.640
<v Speaker 1>What does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it say about cat?</v>

3335
02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:52.570
<v Speaker 1>He played some concerts in America in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last couple of days.</v>

3336
02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:55.750
<v Speaker 1>A lot back recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who let them back in Obama,</v>

3337
02:19:55.760 --> 02:20:00.760
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim hope that Kenyon article in </v>

3338
02:20:01.311 --> 02:20:03.530
<v Speaker 1>the New Yorker about his comeback last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

3339
02:20:03.650 --> 02:20:06.170
<v Speaker 1>So last year he got let back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3340
02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm much so it was before trump,</v>

3341
02:20:09.260 --> 02:20:12.170
<v Speaker 1>so it was probably one of Obama's last </v>
<v Speaker 1>moves and office for sure.</v>

3342
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Let them back in from on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them.</v>

3343
02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Fuck the Donald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gotta go.</v>

3344
02:20:16.761 --> 02:20:17.580
<v Speaker 1>We gotta go to a cat.</v>

3345
02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:20.430
<v Speaker 1>It's shown up knowing God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go cat.</v>

3346
02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:25.750
<v Speaker 1>So it was within a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you won't come back now that </v>

3347
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:27.350
<v Speaker 1>trump's president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for money.</v>

3348
02:20:27.351 --> 02:20:29.150
<v Speaker 1>He'll fucking go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's your last year.</v>

3349
02:20:29.151 --> 02:20:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was the last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last year was last year.</v>

3350
02:20:32.151 --> 02:20:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying now the trump is around.</v>

3351
02:20:33.801 --> 02:20:36.200
<v Speaker 1>He probably won't come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny.</v>

3352
02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Where was he living?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did it say where he was?</v>

3353
02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Just doesn't say specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3354
02:20:40.371 --> 02:20:42.810
<v Speaker 1>he was on the fucking news on the Lam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That cat was gone.</v>

3355
02:20:42.811 --> 02:20:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in Libya or some shit.</v>

3356
02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold up in a compound in a cave and </v>

3357
02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:49.180
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a weird move.</v>

3358
02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy who sings,</v>

3359
02:20:49.340 --> 02:20:51.470
<v Speaker 1>he's like really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pc Sof.</v>

3360
02:20:52.100 --> 02:20:55.160
<v Speaker 1>He's trained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whole fucking shit was out of picking up</v>

3361
02:20:55.161 --> 02:20:57.380
<v Speaker 1>people from coast to coast of the peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>train.</v>

3362
02:20:57.530 --> 02:21:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people that believe that Islam </v>

3363
02:21:02.530 --> 02:21:02.530
<v Speaker 1>is the religion of peace.</v>

3364
02:21:02.530 --> 02:21:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The southern.</v>

3365
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:07.870
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people believe in that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe he thinks he's on the path to </v>

3366
02:21:07.870 --> 02:21:12.140
<v Speaker 1>peace and I think Islam is probably like</v>
<v Speaker 1>every other religion,</v>

3367
02:21:12.340 --> 02:21:17.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's factions of Christianity that </v>

3368
02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:17.340
<v Speaker 1>are wonderful people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3369
02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Really calm and sweet and loving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a lot out of it.</v>

3370
02:21:18.951 --> 02:21:22.250
<v Speaker 1>And then just people that are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking loons and the serpent handlers.</v>

3371
02:21:22.310 --> 02:21:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those fucking people as Christians.</v>

3372
02:21:25.701 --> 02:21:30.701
<v Speaker 1>Those are my favorite Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones with the snake protect me from </v>

3373
02:21:31.161 --> 02:21:33.250
<v Speaker 1>the serpent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The snake,</v>

3374
02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:38.560
<v Speaker 1>the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My whole family had been surfing </v>

3375
02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:38.560
<v Speaker 1>handlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sense Wade was sweater.</v>

3376
02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:41.240
<v Speaker 1>We've been a part of the serpent culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>serpent or serpent?</v>

3377
02:21:41.241 --> 02:21:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Paypal and they use poisonous snakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3378
02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't there a documentary on serpent </v>

3379
02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:48.320
<v Speaker 1>handlers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a documentary that I</v>

3380
02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:50.630
<v Speaker 1>have on my queue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have so much shit.</v>

3381
02:21:50.631 --> 02:21:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to watch the students.</v>

3382
02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:55.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm so behind on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to walk away.</v>

3383
02:21:55.580 --> 02:21:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm only in wild wild country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only on episode four.</v>

3384
02:21:59.540 --> 02:22:00.590
<v Speaker 1>I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good,</v>

3385
02:22:00.591 --> 02:22:04.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's slow at the big chunks of slow </v>
<v Speaker 1>days where you're like,</v>

3386
02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:06.260
<v Speaker 1>people say that it could have been done </v>
<v Speaker 1>in three,</v>

3387
02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:11.360
<v Speaker 1>could have easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of drag out that you're </v>

3388
02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:11.360
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't we go over this already?</v>

3389
02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:12.770
<v Speaker 1>But that's just them being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

3390
02:22:13.860 --> 02:22:16.490
<v Speaker 1>come on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix wants six.</v>

3391
02:22:16.491 --> 02:22:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I want six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want six?</v>

3392
02:22:18.370 --> 02:22:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Six netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't need more fucking money.</v>

3393
02:22:22.310 --> 02:22:27.310
<v Speaker 1>They own Hollywood there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get out 30 comedy specials </v>

3394
02:22:27.310 --> 02:22:29.820
<v Speaker 1>just from just for laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing that bill sent me.</v>

3395
02:22:30.660 --> 02:22:31.860
<v Speaker 1>They can't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't even sniff.</v>

3396
02:22:31.861 --> 02:22:36.861
<v Speaker 1>One of my fucking far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even fucking get near them for </v>

3397
02:22:36.861 --> 02:22:36.861
<v Speaker 1>some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix wants nothing to do with me.</v>

3398
02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:39.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck they're thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is with me.</v>

3399
02:22:39.390 --> 02:22:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I did something wrong years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing putting out so many </v>

3400
02:22:44.390 --> 02:22:44.390
<v Speaker 1>specials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3401
02:22:44.390 --> 02:22:45.570
<v Speaker 1>how come I can't get anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

3402
02:22:45.571 --> 02:22:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably haven't seen you.</v>

3403
02:22:47.330 --> 02:22:48.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>

3404
02:22:48.091 --> 02:22:49.920
<v Speaker 1>man can keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3405
02:22:49.921 --> 02:22:51.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's too much going on.</v>

3406
02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:53.700
<v Speaker 1>The only thing keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they have enough people?</v>

3407
02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:54.770
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3408
02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's so much comedy going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on right now.</v>

3409
02:22:58.260 --> 02:23:01.470
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen more standup?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never in my life.</v>

3410
02:23:01.960 --> 02:23:03.240
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's overwhelming.</v>

3411
02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:07.280
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot more shit comedy being put</v>
<v Speaker 1>out than I've ever seen or,</v>

3412
02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:09.860
<v Speaker 1>or not shit comedy in terms of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion in terms of like,</v>

3413
02:23:10.650 --> 02:23:13.710
<v Speaker 1>just see just comedy for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

3414
02:23:13.711 --> 02:23:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a fucking well put together.</v>

3415
02:23:16.411 --> 02:23:21.411
<v Speaker 1>Special people didn't take time for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these things are pumping them </v>

3416
02:23:21.411 --> 02:23:21.411
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3417
02:23:21.411 --> 02:23:21.411
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely that too.</v>

3418
02:23:21.411 --> 02:23:22.920
<v Speaker 1>And there's people that are taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of an opportunity,</v>

3419
02:23:22.921 --> 02:23:27.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody offers you a shitload of money </v>

3420
02:23:27.921 --> 02:23:27.921
<v Speaker 1>and you don't really have a set ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3421
02:23:27.921 --> 02:23:31.981
<v Speaker 1>they just fucking want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing that happens with </v>

3422
02:23:31.981 --> 02:23:33.390
<v Speaker 1>people when they start doing movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you start doing movies,</v>

3423
02:23:33.391 --> 02:23:38.391
<v Speaker 1>you're on a set 16 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really have enough time to </v>

3424
02:23:38.391 --> 02:23:38.640
<v Speaker 1>write and you're definitely not </v>
<v Speaker 1>performing every no way.</v>

3425
02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:44.210
<v Speaker 1>That is a crazy move to be doing all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these films and then do an hour special </v>

3426
02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:45.420
<v Speaker 1>when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're barely.</v>

3427
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can do 30 and they're pushing 30 on</v>

3428
02:23:49.051 --> 02:23:53.820
<v Speaker 1>fun shit in between maybe even 30 men </v>
<v Speaker 1>because not even 30,</v>

3429
02:23:54.210 --> 02:23:59.210
<v Speaker 1>like a real rock 'em sock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>'Em robots 30 know a really know it's </v>

3430
02:23:59.210 --> 02:24:00.630
<v Speaker 1>probably not a back to back 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bang,</v>

3431
02:24:00.631 --> 02:24:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

3432
02:24:01.081 --> 02:24:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more thin than that.</v>

3433
02:24:02.881 --> 02:24:04.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit out there.</v>

3434
02:24:05.010 --> 02:24:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Louis said this to me once backstage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's right.</v>

3435
02:24:07.470 --> 02:24:09.120
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to do comedy,</v>

3436
02:24:09.121 --> 02:24:11.040
<v Speaker 1>to really do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do anything else.</v>

3437
02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:17.000
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the only way to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best at it was you could do it and you </v>

3438
02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:17.000
<v Speaker 1>can do it good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be at your best,</v>

3439
02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:18.330
<v Speaker 1>you really can't be doing anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>

3440
02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I believe that wholeheartedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3441
02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Miami thinking you have podcasts because</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts are just talking.</v>

3442
02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

3443
02:24:26.750 --> 02:24:31.750
<v Speaker 1>this is working out for working out at </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy to do a special like podcasting </v>

3444
02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:37.780
<v Speaker 1>and comedic relationships and us still </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving in whatever realm that is for </v>

3445
02:24:37.780 --> 02:24:38.490
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's all branching for it,</v>

3446
02:24:38.790 --> 02:24:41.610
<v Speaker 1>but other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acting that takes totally away from it.</v>

3447
02:24:41.660 --> 02:24:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I go do acting shit,</v>

3448
02:24:43.561 --> 02:24:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy loses its breath for awhile.</v>

3449
02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about when you were doing acting </v>

3450
02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:52.600

3451
02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm dying up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I performed them almost every night.</v>

3452
02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't give a fuck.</v>

3453
02:24:53.401 --> 02:24:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I was burning the candle at both ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care because you had to.</v>

3454
02:24:56.970 --> 02:24:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Because I know because I also know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to lose steps.</v>

3455
02:24:59.101 --> 02:25:00.690
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fucking lose steps.</v>

3456
02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I care about acting.</v>

3457
02:25:03.090 --> 02:25:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Not as much as I care about standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3460
02:25:07.531 --> 02:25:08.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3461
02:25:08.970 --> 02:25:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm in love with stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acting is like.</v>

3466
02:25:21.081 --> 02:25:21.081
<v Speaker 1>thing for me that stand up does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3495
02:26:25.241 --> 02:26:27.640
<v Speaker 9>I didn't understand it when he said it's</v>
<v Speaker 9>a waste of my time to leave the house.</v>

3496
02:26:28.210 --> 02:26:30.250
<v Speaker 9>The first thing I said,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm in my kitchen listening to it and if</v>

02:26:30.851 --> 02:26:31.840
<v Speaker 9>Leave my house.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Fifteen minutes ago.</v>

02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:37.040
<v Speaker 9>Fucking joe sitting right across your.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He leaves his house for fucking 15 </v>

3500
02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:37.040
<v Speaker 9>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I did it last night.</v>

3501
02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:37.040
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>no shit.</v>

3502
02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:38.110

<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3503
02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:39.520
<v Speaker 9>I think it's a different.</v>

3504
02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:42.480
<v Speaker 9>I think it's just a different breed of </v>
<v Speaker 9>certain people are like that,</v>

3505
02:26:42.481 --> 02:26:43.220
<v Speaker 9>that they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Nah,</v>

3506
02:26:43.340 --> 02:26:46.510
<v Speaker 9>on maximize that time and only do it at </v>
<v Speaker 9>this chunk,</v>

3507
02:26:46.570 --> 02:26:50.240
<v Speaker 9>but certain people you meet,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if I.</v>

3508
02:26:50.740 --> 02:26:52.510
<v Speaker 9>That is the maximizing of the chunk of </v>
<v Speaker 9>being.</v>

3509
02:26:52.511 --> 02:26:53.470
<v Speaker 9>Like if it's just 15,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to.</v>

3510
02:26:53.530 --> 02:26:56.350
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to make sure that 15 is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He doesn't have bits though.</v>

3511
02:26:56.470 --> 02:26:58.970
<v Speaker 9>Not the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like he's just a funny guy.</v>

3512
02:26:59.030 --> 02:27:02.190
<v Speaker 9>He raves and Improv in Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

3513
02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:07.380
<v Speaker 9>but he doesn't have like a chunk on lava</v>
<v Speaker 9>lamps and they're gone wristwatches,</v>

3514
02:27:07.610 --> 02:27:12.610
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he doesn't have that like I to open up </v>

3515
02:27:12.610 --> 02:27:12.610
<v Speaker 9>with lava lamps.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's not this what he does.</v>

3516
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:17.630
<v Speaker 9>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like he did a fallon set a couple of </v>

3517
02:27:17.630 --> 02:27:17.630
<v Speaker 9>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Maybe it was a year ago,</v>

3518
02:27:17.630 --> 02:27:22.591
<v Speaker 9>two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and it was all about lotion at the </v>

3519
02:27:22.591 --> 02:27:22.591
<v Speaker 9>airport and that was like a bit.</v>

3520
02:27:22.591 --> 02:27:22.591
<v Speaker 9>That was the first time I'd seen jeff do</v>
<v Speaker 9>a.</v>

3521
02:27:22.591 --> 02:27:23.280
<v Speaker 9>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>again,</v>

3522
02:27:23.340 --> 02:27:25.360
<v Speaker 9>again,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this is obviously no disrespect to Jeff.</v>

3523
02:27:25.361 --> 02:27:26.800
<v Speaker 9>I Love Jeff.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Jeff's a great guy to me,</v>

3524
02:27:27.460 --> 02:27:28.650
<v Speaker 9>but what he does is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

3525
02:27:28.651 --> 02:27:31.180
<v Speaker 9>it's that it's much more like free form </v>
<v Speaker 9>and unfailing.</v>

3526
02:27:31.181 --> 02:27:32.140
<v Speaker 9>He did like a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was like,</v>

3527
02:27:32.141 --> 02:27:32.860
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's like a bit.</v>

3528
02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:34.930
<v Speaker 9>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Jeff doesn't really do bits.</v>

3529
02:27:35.350 --> 02:27:36.850
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't chunk out bits.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He's like,</v>

3530
02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:39.910
<v Speaker 9>if he finds a bit it'll be great.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know what I mean?</v>

3531
02:27:39.911 --> 02:27:42.100
<v Speaker 9>But he usually just fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I watched him in Atlanta.</v>

3532
02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:43.810
<v Speaker 9>We were both playing Atlanta at the same</v>
<v Speaker 9>time.</v>

<v Speaker 9>it was hysterical.</v>

3535

<v Speaker 9>other conflict.</v>

3536
02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:52.530

02:28:54.910 --> 02:28:55.070
<v Speaker 9>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So passion is very original.</v>

3561
02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:57.620
<v Speaker 9>He's him.</v>
<v Speaker 9>No one is Sebastian,</v>

3562
02:28:57.680 --> 02:28:58.910
<v Speaker 9>but that's who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

3563
02:28:58.911 --> 02:29:03.310
<v Speaker 9>I think sometimes can use to open for </v>
<v Speaker 9>him years and years and years ago is um,</v>

3564
02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:04.660
<v Speaker 9>if I'm not wrong people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Correct.</v>

3565
02:29:04.661 --> 02:29:09.661
<v Speaker 9>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I think maybe dice felt like he's </v>

3566
02:29:09.661 --> 02:29:09.661
<v Speaker 9>not giving them as do.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like dissecting,</v>

3567
02:29:09.661 --> 02:29:13.750
<v Speaker 9>like I fucking raised you and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 9>even going to kiss the ring a little </v>

3568
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.750
<v Speaker 9>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>First of all,</v>

3569
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:16.970
<v Speaker 9>grown ass man who's built his own career</v>
<v Speaker 9>completely on his own and brilliantly so</v>

3570
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:22.150
<v Speaker 9>he has no anybody shit,</v>
<v Speaker 9>wasn't it that he didn't talk about </v>

3571
02:29:22.150 --> 02:29:23.570
<v Speaker 9>Dyson as book perhaps?</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's probably the crux of it.</v>

3572
02:29:23.630 --> 02:29:25.600
<v Speaker 9>I think it's the layers for the for,</v>
<v Speaker 9>for,</v>

3573
02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:27.560
<v Speaker 9>for old friendships like that that have </v>
<v Speaker 9>gone sour.</v>

3574
02:29:27.561 --> 02:29:28.970
<v Speaker 9>Maybe it's layers.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's that.</v>

3575
02:29:29.090 --> 02:29:30.950
<v Speaker 9>It's why don't you go to my fucking </v>
<v Speaker 9>dinner party?</v>

3576
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:31.910
<v Speaker 9>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's bullshit.</v>

3577
02:29:31.911 --> 02:29:36.110
<v Speaker 9>It's all bullshit piled up when you get </v>
<v Speaker 9>a guy opening for you for years and then</v>

3578
02:29:36.111 --> 02:29:38.660
<v Speaker 9>he's smashing it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now he's a fucking superstar.</v>

3579
02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:40.490
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's got to feel weird.</v>

3580
02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:43.050
<v Speaker 9>It's got to feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's got to feel weird.</v>

3581
02:29:43.060 --> 02:29:48.060
<v Speaker 9>I'm envious of what Sebastian's done </v>
<v Speaker 9>because Sebastian can kind of go </v>

3582
02:29:48.060 --> 02:29:48.060
<v Speaker 9>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3583
02:29:48.060 --> 02:29:48.890
<v Speaker 9>It does anything,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I mean,</v>

3584
02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:52.010
<v Speaker 9>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he's really successful,</v>

3585
02:29:52.190 --> 02:29:55.700
<v Speaker 9>but he's also like this weird kind of </v>
<v Speaker 9>famous.</v>

3586
02:29:56.270 --> 02:29:57.800
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he could like go to the movies.</v>

<v Speaker 9>mega famous.</v>

3589
02:30:03.880 --> 02:30:08.880
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we talked about this when I was in </v>

3590
02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:08.880
<v Speaker 9>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I walked by.</v>

3591
02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:11.831
<v Speaker 9>Gaffigan was playing one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 9>one of the arenas there and had a </v>

3592
02:30:11.831 --> 02:30:11.960
<v Speaker 9>billboard up that said,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3593
02:30:11.961 --> 02:30:12.920
<v Speaker 9>Jim Gaffigan,</v>
<v Speaker 9>28,</v>

3594
02:30:12.921 --> 02:30:13.490
<v Speaker 9>29,</v>
<v Speaker 9>whatever,</v>

3595
02:30:13.940 --> 02:30:15.860
<v Speaker 9>and I was saying to the comic that I was</v>
<v Speaker 9>with,</v>

3596
02:30:15.861 --> 02:30:20.861
<v Speaker 9>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>isn't that funny that like if Gavin was </v>

3597
02:30:20.861 --> 02:30:23.231
<v Speaker 9>just like walking through the casino,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's a good chance a lot of people </v>

3598
02:30:23.231 --> 02:30:23.231
<v Speaker 9>just wouldn't see him see him.</v>

3599
02:30:23.231 --> 02:30:23.720
<v Speaker 9>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 9>They might,</v>

3600
02:30:23.810 --> 02:30:28.810
<v Speaker 9>they might,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but in that fucking arena sold out five </v>

3601
02:30:28.810 --> 02:30:32.831
<v Speaker 9>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Sold out like unmistakably famous and </v>

3602

<v Speaker 9>Ralph's and you'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 9>someone will go.</v>

3605
02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:37.730
<v Speaker 9>I think that that guy he looks like </v>
<v Speaker 9>maybe he's not.</v>

3606
02:30:37.731 --> 02:30:38.810
<v Speaker 9>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Do you know what I mean?</v>

3607
02:30:38.811 --> 02:30:40.370
<v Speaker 9>Like these songs,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but hey,</v>

02:30:42.291 --> 02:30:43.320
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 9>Can I get a selfie selfie bro?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Come on,</v>

3612
02:30:49.851 --> 02:30:52.280
<v Speaker 9>I like going with you to watch how </v>
<v Speaker 9>people ask you for selfies.</v>

3613
02:30:52.490 --> 02:30:55.220
<v Speaker 9>My favorite thing is when I'm with Joe </v>
<v Speaker 9>and somebody asked me if they can take a</v>

3614
02:30:55.221 --> 02:30:56.440
<v Speaker 9>picture of Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's the.</v>

3615
02:30:56.990 --> 02:30:57.670
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>look at me.</v>

3616
02:30:57.870 --> 02:30:59.060
<v Speaker 9>We're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 9>hey,</v>

3617
02:30:59.061 --> 02:31:02.030
<v Speaker 9>do you mind to me?</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not his fucking hand.</v>

3618
02:31:02.240 --> 02:31:05.240
<v Speaker 9>Why are you asking me?</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's the.</v>

3619
02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:07.610
<v Speaker 9>That's so annoying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Don't look at me dude,</v>

3620
02:31:07.730 --> 02:31:09.290
<v Speaker 9>if you want to converse with a grown </v>
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>

3621
02:31:09.291 --> 02:31:14.291
<v Speaker 9>do it and not your through line to get </v>
<v Speaker 9>to Joe Gaffigan's doing an interesting </v>

3622
02:31:14.291 --> 02:31:14.610
<v Speaker 9>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He decided to.</v>

3623
02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:17.780
<v Speaker 9>He on his own to not put a special on </v>
<v Speaker 9>Netflix.</v>

3624
02:31:18.250 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 9>It was a conscious because</v>

3625
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:25.040
<v Speaker 1>he felt like there's so many digital </v>
<v Speaker 1>platforms on who's going to offer it </v>

3626
02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:25.350
<v Speaker 1>among all the other platforms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's got it on.</v>

3627
02:31:25.380 --> 02:31:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Amazon's got it on Hulu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's got it everywhere?</v>

3628
02:31:28.020 --> 02:31:31.680
<v Speaker 1>We're where the see find out the places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gaffigan put out his special on.</v>

3629
02:31:31.710 --> 02:31:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the billboard and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned.</v>

3630
02:31:33.091 --> 02:31:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Is that on the bottom it says available </v>
<v Speaker 1>on all platforms.</v>

3631
02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I have seen that Amazon platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Replatform step.</v>

3632
02:31:38.220 --> 02:31:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3633
02:31:39.350 --> 02:31:40.980
<v Speaker 1>He has been kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that he wants to.</v>

3634
02:31:41.010 --> 02:31:45.000
<v Speaker 1>He stood out his whole career as being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean.</v>

3635
02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:50.360
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think this is another way of him </v>

3636
02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:50.430
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also not grouped like that as well.</v>

3637
02:31:51.240 --> 02:31:56.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that he made the decision was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's just so many other </v>

3638
02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:58.350
<v Speaker 1>platforms available that he didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to limit it to Netflix and be one of the</v>

3639
02:31:58.351 --> 02:31:59.730
<v Speaker 1>many on Netflix already.</v>

3640
02:31:59.790 --> 02:32:00.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may.</v>

3641
02:32:00.611 --> 02:32:03.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might be actually a smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more lucrative move.</v>

3642
02:32:03.481 --> 02:32:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Although the access that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably isn't as good as you think.</v>

3643
02:32:08.161 --> 02:32:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Netflix is a global brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem with giant huge.</v>

3644
02:32:12.620 --> 02:32:14.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3645
02:32:14.460 --> 02:32:19.460
<v Speaker 1>But if you have it on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube is probably bigger than </v>

3646
02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:20.130
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3647
02:32:20.430 --> 02:32:23.610
<v Speaker 1>More people watched this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube has a bigger reach,</v>

3648
02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:25.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's just way more content on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

3649
02:32:26.050 --> 02:32:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the other thing.</v>

3650
02:32:27.540 --> 02:32:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Who's watching youtube on television at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

3651
02:32:30.970 --> 02:32:35.970
<v Speaker 1>the new gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of kids that are due </v>

3652
02:32:35.970 --> 02:32:35.970
<v Speaker 1>because now youtube TV is like a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

3653
02:32:35.970 --> 02:32:39.530
<v Speaker 1>but how many in comparison to to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix and I'm sure Netflix to launch </v>

3654
02:32:39.530 --> 02:32:41.670
<v Speaker 1>that ass Netflix at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix owns that ass.</v>

3655
02:32:42.260 --> 02:32:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I would think about the mobile though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people watch Netflix on their </v>

3656
02:32:47.260 --> 02:32:47.260
<v Speaker 1>phone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

3657
02:32:47.260 --> 02:32:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I think there's one netflix or one.</v>

3658
02:32:48.810 --> 02:32:51.510
<v Speaker 1>I just did my special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said half the people,</v>

3659
02:32:51.570 --> 02:32:52.890
<v Speaker 1>so it is on youtube too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3660
02:32:53.120 --> 02:32:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Have people found a netflix watching on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their phone?</v>

3661
02:32:56.460 --> 02:32:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it like this.</v>

3662
02:32:57.330 --> 02:32:59.760
<v Speaker 1>I've never pulled up youtube on my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my computer.</v>

3663
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3664
02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying I put it on my phone every </v>

3665
02:33:05.750 --> 02:33:07.851
<v Speaker 1>fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something on my phone that I'm </v>

3666
02:33:07.851 --> 02:33:07.851
<v Speaker 1>looking up on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3667
02:33:07.851 --> 02:33:07.851
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always,</v>

3668
02:33:07.851 --> 02:33:07.851
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>

3669
02:33:07.851 --> 02:33:09.990
<v Speaker 1>always on the phone and if I'm at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

3670
02:33:10.110 --> 02:33:15.110
<v Speaker 1>if I had watching something on my phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll flick it to my apple tv or </v>

3671
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:19.731
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he put it in movie theaters for a day </v>

3672
02:33:19.731 --> 02:33:19.731
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

3673
02:33:19.731 --> 02:33:22.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a cool move.</v>

<v Speaker 9>ghost town.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was like no,</v>

<v Speaker 9>There's still so many bangers in town.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't even fucking matter.</v>

3711
02:34:48.290 --> 02:34:48.680
<v Speaker 9>It's just</v>

3712
02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:51.360
<v Speaker 2>weird time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird time for standup.</v>

3713
02:34:51.361 --> 02:34:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Best time it's popping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you know,</v>

3714
02:34:54.390 --> 02:34:56.700
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what is the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many different.</v>

3715
02:34:56.701 --> 02:34:58.890
<v Speaker 2>It's so you can't really have one </v>
<v Speaker 2>factor.</v>

3716
02:34:58.891 --> 02:35:01.160
<v Speaker 2>There's not just one factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these,</v>

3717
02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:03.930
<v Speaker 2>the Internet for sure is the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines,</v>

3718
02:35:03.931 --> 02:35:08.931
<v Speaker 2>like more people have access to standup </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy through youtube and all these </v>

3719
02:35:08.931 --> 02:35:12.291
<v Speaker 2>other different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netflix and then on top of that it's </v>

3720
02:35:12.291 --> 02:35:13.110
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like comics get together and people.</v>

3721
02:35:13.111 --> 02:35:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Those podcasts become a part of people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives daily live their drive and then on</v>

3722
02:35:17.431 --> 02:35:20.280
<v Speaker 2>top of that that podcasts are talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the store.</v>

3723
02:35:20.430 --> 02:35:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone's talked the store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the store was taught and that because </v>

3724
02:35:25.430 --> 02:35:25.430

3727
02:35:34.410 --> 02:35:37.721
<v Speaker 9>factory doesn't have the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 9>talk that comics talk about the store.</v>

3728
02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:40.250
<v Speaker 9>The store is romanticized by Comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's just like that.</v>

3729
02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:41.210
<v Speaker 9>It's that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

3730
02:35:41.211 --> 02:35:42.280
<v Speaker 9>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when you look at the Echo,</v>

3731
02:35:42.290 --> 02:35:43.610
<v Speaker 9>look at the instagram for the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 9>store.</v>

3732
02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:46.610
<v Speaker 9>Every time they put a lineup,</v>
<v Speaker 9>read almost every single comment.</v>

02:35:46.611 --> 02:35:48.290
<v Speaker 9>We'll have someone go,</v>
<v Speaker 9>fuck man,</v>

3737
02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:56.090

<v Speaker 9>If I could afford it,</v>

3739
02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.550
<v Speaker 2>kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this virtual reality thing.</v>

3740
02:36:00.551 --> 02:36:05.551
<v Speaker 2>The htc vive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put the headphones on and you ever </v>

3741
02:36:05.551 --> 02:36:05.551
<v Speaker 2>seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3742
02:36:05.551 --> 02:36:06.280
<v Speaker 2>it headset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put the goggles on earplug.</v>

3743
02:36:06.850 --> 02:36:08.470
<v Speaker 2>They're going to do standup in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3744
02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:09.610
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

3745
02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:11.680
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in thinking about that a lot lately,</v>

3746
02:36:11.710 --> 02:36:14.440
<v Speaker 2>when you put that fucker on and you feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're in the room with that,</v>

3747
02:36:14.770 --> 02:36:18.880
<v Speaker 2>like that would be an amazing way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast.</v>

3748
02:36:18.881 --> 02:36:20.740
<v Speaker 2>Stand up into your living room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

3749
02:36:20.741 --> 02:36:22.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be at the store,</v>

3750
02:36:23.490 --> 02:36:25.060
<v Speaker 2>on your fucking couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just standing up.</v>

3751
02:36:25.061 --> 02:36:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Might even be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be kind of cooler than actually</v>

3752
02:36:29.051 --> 02:36:34.051
<v Speaker 2>be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Cool will be in there now being </v>

3753
02:36:34.051 --> 02:36:35.290
<v Speaker 2>there's always going to be cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but cool in a unique different way.</v>

3754
02:36:35.410 --> 02:36:35.800
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's an.</v>

3755
02:36:35.830 --> 02:36:37.300
<v Speaker 9>I think it's just another ad,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

3756
02:36:37.301 --> 02:36:42.301
<v Speaker 9>Like to me you're always gonna want live</v>
<v Speaker 9>performance because we always have in </v>

3757
02:36:42.301 --> 02:36:45.301
<v Speaker 9>the history of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we love watching performance live and </v>

3758
02:36:45.301 --> 02:36:49.090
<v Speaker 9>that's just another way for people to </v>
<v Speaker 9>access who physically can't get there.</v>

3759
02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:54.900
<v Speaker 9>It's always going to be sexier to be </v>
<v Speaker 9>there because you feel like you're a </v>

3760
02:36:54.900 --> 02:36:57.511
<v Speaker 9>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But to actually be someone in there in </v>

3761
02:36:57.511 --> 02:36:59.701
<v Speaker 9>the virtual world that will be justice.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean for people that can't physically </v>

3762
02:36:59.701 --> 02:36:59.701
<v Speaker 9>be here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that's just,</v>

3763
02:36:59.701 --> 02:37:04.650
<v Speaker 9>that's the closest you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's the best you can get when you're </v>

3764
02:37:04.650 --> 02:37:04.650
<v Speaker 9>there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's live,</v>

3765
02:37:04.650 --> 02:37:05.440
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's just a different kind of thing.</v>

3766
02:37:05.770 --> 02:37:07.390
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>stand up to me on tape.</v>

3767
02:37:07.391 --> 02:37:08.770
<v Speaker 9>Has ever been as funny as it is live?</v>

3768
02:37:08.850 --> 02:37:09.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3769
02:37:09.470 --> 02:37:09.730
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3770
02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Not even close you the best you can hope</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a television show,</v>

3771
02:37:13.700 --> 02:37:16.160
<v Speaker 2>so it's just kind of capture a feel</v>

3772
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:21.160
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're doing a special for </v>

<v Speaker 1>a almost like fake movie theater type </v>

3776
02:37:26.950 --> 02:37:28.550

<v Speaker 1>ads up.</v>

3788
02:38:05.660 --> 02:38:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where they're going to start </v>

3789
02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:10.660
<v Speaker 1>making all their money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

3790
02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:10.660
<v Speaker 1>that looks amazing because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3791
02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:10.660
<v Speaker 1>you've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of sporting events.</v>

3792
02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:13.880
<v Speaker 1>They use green screen on their ads girls</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they can change for television.</v>

3793
02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:15.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean that'll just be that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be the same thing,</v>

3794
02:38:15.650 --> 02:38:17.750
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dope would that be for UFC fights?</v>

3795
02:38:17.810 --> 02:38:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Fuck the HTC vive one wasn't the UFC do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3796
02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Call them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do do experimental things all the </v>

3797
02:38:27.340 --> 02:38:27.340
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3798
02:38:27.340 --> 02:38:27.920
<v Speaker 1>That they try out and then they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>always use them.</v>

3799
02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3800
02:38:29.050 --> 02:38:32.240
<v Speaker 1>but that seems like the best one with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys on.</v>

3801
02:38:32.241 --> 02:38:37.241
<v Speaker 1>And that way you could be in the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put a camera on the fucking guy who </v>

3802
02:38:37.241 --> 02:38:40.801
<v Speaker 1>was a referee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ref ref cam to shoulder camps and </v>

3803
02:38:40.801 --> 02:38:44.090
<v Speaker 1>some hip cams put cameras all over him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cam circling him a camera.</v>

3804
02:38:44.930 --> 02:38:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Make the fucking ref cameras to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in pride and pride to Gopro and Gopros.</v>

3805
02:38:49.670 --> 02:38:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd be able to see it from the Ref</v>

3806
02:38:51.620 --> 02:38:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Cam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those are just shit.</v>

3807
02:38:52.821 --> 02:38:55.640
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to get really good cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to be shitty.</v>

3808
02:38:55.641 --> 02:38:58.820
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty God damn good now for Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got to be really good cameras.</v>

3809
02:38:58.821 --> 02:38:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't take Gopros.</v>

3810
02:38:59.870 --> 02:39:00.710
<v Speaker 1>They can get it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

3811
02:39:00.770 --> 02:39:01.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3812
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:04.250
<v Speaker 1>I think they could probably could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet someone could pull this,</v>

3813
02:39:04.251 --> 02:39:06.910
<v Speaker 1>our gopros always with that fish </v>
<v Speaker 1>islands.</v>

3814
02:39:07.050 --> 02:39:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3815
02:39:07.611 --> 02:39:09.770
<v Speaker 1>You got to use some software to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To not have that,</v>

3816
02:39:09.771 --> 02:39:11.160
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're built like that.</v>

3817
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:14.000
<v Speaker 1>They're built with the fish eye on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do they do that?</v>

3818
02:39:14.001 --> 02:39:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Just for perspective angle field of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>

3819
02:39:16.310 --> 02:39:21.310
<v Speaker 1>because it's because it was originally </v>
<v Speaker 1>intended for extreme sports and so that </v>

3820
02:39:21.310 --> 02:39:22.340
<v Speaker 1>that's always the best view in every.</v>

3821
02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Every extreme sport is the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked great.</v>

3822
02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I think you're trying to recreate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes like you have a,</v>

3823
02:39:27.420 --> 02:39:29.750
<v Speaker 1>you know you have 180 degree or probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than that,</v>

3824
02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:31.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's not all just stored it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

3825
02:39:31.821 --> 02:39:34.850
<v Speaker 1>Everything's gets all stretched out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird at the edge of class.</v>

3826
02:39:34.851 --> 02:39:37.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone's figured out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet too hard,</v>

3827
02:39:37.540 --> 02:39:38.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's why the.</v>

3828
02:39:38.690 --> 02:39:43.690
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what four K is is inching towards </v>

3829
02:39:43.690 --> 02:39:43.690
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>

3830
02:39:43.690 --> 02:39:47.890
<v Speaker 1>live broadcast in four k is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say four k is more clear than the </v>

3831
02:39:47.890 --> 02:39:52.181
<v Speaker 1>human eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can see there's elements to it that are </v>

3832
02:39:52.181 --> 02:39:52.181
<v Speaker 1>clearer than what human I can actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

3833
02:39:52.181 --> 02:39:53.360
<v Speaker 1>And they're going higher than 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

3834
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:55.290
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they doing something?</v>

3835
02:39:55.340 --> 02:40:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Eight k cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that camera that you're getting </v>

3836
02:40:00.340 --> 02:40:01.430
<v Speaker 1>that phone with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The red phone.</v>

3837
02:40:01.800 --> 02:40:03.020
<v Speaker 1>The red got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

3838
02:40:03.021 --> 02:40:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I always forget the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a reds.</v>

3839
02:40:04.670 --> 02:40:06.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with the red,</v>

3840
02:40:06.761 --> 02:40:08.960
<v Speaker 1>the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Red Technology Company read,</v>

3841
02:40:08.961 --> 02:40:11.720
<v Speaker 1>made a phone and explained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read that.</v>

3842
02:40:11.721 --> 02:40:14.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like a super high end camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ferry fees with</v>

3843
02:40:14.330 --> 02:40:15.500
<v Speaker 2>just for all high end things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3844
02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:18.540
<v Speaker 2>I think they based started like $20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

3845
02:40:18.541 --> 02:40:20.010
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not even the lens.</v>

3846
02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:22.250
<v Speaker 2>That's just the physical fucking camera </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

3847
02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bulk of $5,000.</v>

3848
02:40:23.701 --> 02:40:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Battery or not really but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it gets really expensive.</v>

3849
02:40:25.801 --> 02:40:28.020
<v Speaker 2>But anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is supposed to be like a modular</v>

3850
02:40:28.021 --> 02:40:31.380
<v Speaker 2>piece that's supposed to work with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems they have coming in the future.</v>

3851
02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:36.880
<v Speaker 2>This like the base of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the phone might connect to a camera </v>

3852
02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:38.250
<v Speaker 2>or my connect to a series of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things it might replace.</v>

3853
02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they actually said that says two</v>

3854
02:40:40.921 --> 02:40:42.030
<v Speaker 2>cameras on the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

3855
02:40:42.031 --> 02:40:44.790
<v Speaker 2>the other cool part of it is the display</v>
<v Speaker 2>is holographic,</v>

3856
02:40:44.820 --> 02:40:49.820
<v Speaker 2>which no one's actually seen yet because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a new technology like playback can </v>

3857
02:40:49.951 --> 02:40:54.951
<v Speaker 2>be in the warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They supposed to release his phone over </v>

3858
02:40:54.951 --> 02:40:54.951
<v Speaker 2>a year ago.</v>

3859
02:40:54.951 --> 02:40:55.290
<v Speaker 2>They showed it a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when did you buy it then?</v>

3860
02:40:55.291 --> 02:40:58.880
<v Speaker 2>On preorder?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I bought it last about a year.</v>

3861
02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:00.250
<v Speaker 2>What do they clip you for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much we're,</v>

3862
02:41:00.251 --> 02:41:03.450
<v Speaker 2>that's the same price as a iphone and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 1200 bucks I just had to prepay it,</v>

3863
02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:07.920
<v Speaker 2>get 1200 bucks so they can advance the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology they needed.</v>

3864
02:41:07.921 --> 02:41:09.000
<v Speaker 2>The money I imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3865
02:41:09.030 --> 02:41:11.130
<v Speaker 2>we all paid for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>

3866
02:41:11.131 --> 02:41:13.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then just trusting read because it's</v>

3867
02:41:13.111 --> 02:41:13.710
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3868
02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:16.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a fly by night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're also getting,</v>

3869
02:41:16.650 --> 02:41:21.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure tons of a VC investors to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>pumping money to keep that going.</v>

3870
02:41:22.100 --> 02:41:25.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of thing that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology is so far ahead,</v>

3871
02:41:25.900 --> 02:41:28.470
<v Speaker 2>they're trying hard to get the hardware </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a place where it works.</v>

3872
02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:31.770
<v Speaker 2>And when is this supposed to come out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to be shipped next month.</v>

3873
02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:34.920
<v Speaker 2>So in the next four weeks have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3874
02:41:35.150 --> 02:41:37.830
<v Speaker 2>There might be the testers out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine some magical day,</v>

3875
02:41:37.831 --> 02:41:40.050
<v Speaker 2>like they're not going to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like August eighth for instance.</v>

3876
02:41:40.420 --> 02:41:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Well August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>August ninth is when the Samsung Galaxy </v>

3877
02:41:45.420 --> 02:41:49.191
<v Speaker 2>note nine comes in matching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably gonna come up with </v>

3878
02:41:49.191 --> 02:41:51.590
<v Speaker 2>similar ads coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now apparently it's going to have the </v>

3879
02:41:51.590 --> 02:41:51.590
<v Speaker 2>most storage of any phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biggest battery,</v>

3880
02:41:51.590 --> 02:41:52.350
<v Speaker 2>it's going to $4,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million amp battery.</v>

3881
02:41:52.351 --> 02:41:57.351
<v Speaker 2>It's going to have insane cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Samsung's last hurrah with the </v>

3882
02:41:57.901 --> 02:42:00.120
<v Speaker 2>note and the note doesn't work this </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3883
02:42:00.121 --> 02:42:05.121
<v Speaker 2>They're just gonna stick with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>galaxies because the galaxy s nine did </v>

3884
02:42:05.121 --> 02:42:05.250
<v Speaker 2>not do well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't sell well,</v>

3885
02:42:05.251 --> 02:42:08.460
<v Speaker 2>but it was an amazing phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was too close to the galaxy.</v>

3886
02:42:08.461 --> 02:42:09.990
<v Speaker 2>S eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't much different.</v>

3887
02:42:09.991 --> 02:42:13.050
<v Speaker 2>It was just like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An incremental step better as opposed to</v>

3888
02:42:13.051 --> 02:42:17.820
<v Speaker 2>like the iphone 10 is kind of way better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the iphone seven,</v>

3889
02:42:17.870 --> 02:42:18.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seven and eight.</v>

3890
02:42:19.290 --> 02:42:24.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just like the shape is better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that all it has is this little </v>

3891
02:42:24.290 --> 02:42:26.070
<v Speaker 2>tiny little notch at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all screen.</v>

3892
02:42:26.310 --> 02:42:27.270
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Camera.</v>

3893
02:42:27.271 --> 02:42:28.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who was talking about it.</v>

3894
02:42:28.921 --> 02:42:30.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it would maybe be a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were like,</v>

3895
02:42:30.511 --> 02:42:31.920
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Steve Jobs was alive,</v>

3896
02:42:32.220 --> 02:42:34.050
<v Speaker 2>that would have never been up there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>notch.</v>

3897
02:42:35.490 --> 02:42:40.490
<v Speaker 2>He was such a meticulous fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weiwei has an amazing phone called the </v>

3898
02:42:41.101 --> 02:42:46.101
<v Speaker 2>mate are or the [inaudible] pro.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But that's what I feel about what that </v>

3921
02:43:42.181 --> 02:43:42.181
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got mad at a guy at apple and I said,</v>

3922
02:43:42.181 --> 02:43:46.800
<v Speaker 2>I said they fucked me over on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>appointment or something that was being </v>

3923
02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:46.800
<v Speaker 2>a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

3924
02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:46.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that guy was alive,</v>

3925
02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:47.230
<v Speaker 2>this company will still be doing better.</v>

3926
02:43:47.470 --> 02:43:48.580
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3927
02:43:48.581 --> 02:43:49.690
<v Speaker 2>that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3928
02:43:49.691 --> 02:43:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3929
02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:53.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took a tank when that guy died.</v>

3930
02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:56.530
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So down to laptops are dog shit,</v>

3931
02:43:56.531 --> 02:43:58.120
<v Speaker 2>dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so bad.</v>

3932
02:43:58.140 --> 02:44:03.140
<v Speaker 2>They're beaten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're getting class action lawsuits </v>

3933
02:44:03.140 --> 02:44:04.180
<v Speaker 2>about the keyboards fucking up new small</v>
<v Speaker 2>smartphone.</v>

3934
02:44:04.181 --> 02:44:07.450
<v Speaker 2>Trump tried to ban drop to its lowest </v>
<v Speaker 2>price ever on Amazon.</v>

3935
02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:12.600
<v Speaker 2>But this is the problem is it's the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>camera in any smartphone is three </v>

3936
02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:14.710
<v Speaker 2>cameras on the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking amazing.</v>

3937
02:44:14.711 --> 02:44:16.960
<v Speaker 2>40 megapixel camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

3938
02:44:16.990 --> 02:44:21.990
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is it won't work on all </v>
<v Speaker 2>bands in the United States because it's </v>

3939
02:44:22.961 --> 02:44:24.540
<v Speaker 2>European design.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

3940
02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:28.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not built for this and it's only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only gsm.</v>

3941
02:44:28.421 --> 02:44:33.421
<v Speaker 2>So you have to use it on a and t or t </v>
<v Speaker 2>mobile 10 by one by one for 800 bucks.</v>

3942
02:44:34.450 --> 02:44:37.240
<v Speaker 2>But it's supposed to be the fucking shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

3943
02:44:37.270 --> 02:44:38.430
<v Speaker 2>the screens.</v>

3944
02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:43.440
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be able to jailbreak and </v>

3945
02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:43.440
<v Speaker 2>manipulate those films and make them </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to,</v>

3946
02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:46.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're not designed for the </v>

3947
02:44:46.681 --> 02:44:46.681
<v Speaker 2>same bands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says right there,</v>

3948
02:44:46.681 --> 02:44:48.490
<v Speaker 2>you could buy it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven hundred 95 bucks.</v>

3949
02:44:49.150 --> 02:44:51.430
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

3950
02:44:51.431 --> 02:44:55.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it works exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you have an at and t phone.</v>

3951
02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a SIM factory unlocked.</v>

3952
02:44:57.280 --> 02:44:59.770
<v Speaker 2>So you can use any international Sim Sim</v>
<v Speaker 2>on those.</v>

3953
02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is the radio,</v>

3954
02:45:03.251 --> 02:45:05.890
<v Speaker 2>the frequencies that it picks up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't pick up the same.</v>

3955
02:45:05.950 --> 02:45:10.950
<v Speaker 2>All the same bands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 18 t or t mobile has does not </v>

3956
02:45:10.950 --> 02:45:12.250
<v Speaker 2>work with sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>verizon,</v>

3957
02:45:12.251 --> 02:45:17.251
<v Speaker 2>US cellular and other cma cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are cdma because it's a GSM phone.</v>

3958
02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:22.380
<v Speaker 2>But the thing they're saying is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you get a GSM network like t and</v>

3959
02:45:22.390 --> 02:45:27.390
<v Speaker 2>t or I'm going to have to ask one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes that I know like Lewis from unbox </v>

3960
02:45:27.390 --> 02:45:31.630
<v Speaker 2>therapy or a flossy Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys that do those videos,</v>

3961
02:45:31.930 --> 02:45:32.530
<v Speaker 2>they would know.</v>

3962
02:45:32.650 --> 02:45:37.650
<v Speaker 2>40 megapixel camera for my first digital</v>
<v Speaker 2>camera that I ever had was like five.</v>

3963
02:45:37.930 --> 02:45:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I think mine was one thing that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3964
02:45:40.391 --> 02:45:41.630
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

3965
02:45:41.950 --> 02:45:43.600
<v Speaker 2>It was bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but back then I remember being like,</v>

3966
02:45:43.730 --> 02:45:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at these fucking Christmas photos.</v>

3967
02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:49.360
<v Speaker 2>That point I was trying to make us sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Wifi like that without making a</v>

3968
02:45:49.361 --> 02:45:54.361
<v Speaker 2>phone call and dialing the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are so many other ways you could </v>

3969
02:45:54.361 --> 02:45:58.111
<v Speaker 2>communicate with the people you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate with and still make a phone </v>

3970
02:45:58.111 --> 02:45:58.111
<v Speaker 2>call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3971
02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:04.180
<v Speaker 2>that point's not valid because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>places where you can use that Wifi,</v>

3972
02:46:04.510 --> 02:46:06.850
<v Speaker 2>you also get signaled that you could use</v>
<v Speaker 2>that phone on.</v>

3973
02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:09.560
<v Speaker 2>The real issue is in the places where </v>
<v Speaker 2>signal sketchy.</v>

3974
02:46:09.770 --> 02:46:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

3975
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:15.010
<v Speaker 1>weird rural areas from Mississippi </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted me and said he's been doing it </v>

3976
02:46:15.010 --> 02:46:16.890
<v Speaker 1>for years so he has no cell service or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wifi,</v>

3977
02:46:17.130 --> 02:46:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Wifi phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets around.</v>

3978
02:46:19.191 --> 02:46:24.191
<v Speaker 1>He's like are you could probably do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and larger cities than I do in </v>

3979
02:46:24.191 --> 02:46:24.191
<v Speaker 1>Mississippi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been doing it for a long time.</v>

3980
02:46:24.191 --> 02:46:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so he's going off of like starbucks </v>

3981
02:46:28.620 --> 02:46:29.300
<v Speaker 1>sell Wifi or what's he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or your house or like all the places you</v>

3982
02:46:29.301 --> 02:46:30.560
<v Speaker 1>go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that in Japan,</v>

3983
02:46:30.561 --> 02:46:33.620
<v Speaker 1>but when you're in your car driving down</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rural road,</v>

3984
02:46:33.621 --> 02:46:35.480
<v Speaker 1>this is the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get a service.</v>

3985
02:46:35.481 --> 02:46:40.481
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get Wifi and you're </v>

3986
02:46:40.481 --> 02:46:41.060
<v Speaker 1>not going to get cell phone service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with a t and t or t mobile,</v>

3987
02:46:41.090 --> 02:46:43.850
<v Speaker 1>they would have some service in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird areas.</v>

3988
02:46:44.090 --> 02:46:46.820
<v Speaker 1>That's the only place where these phones</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a problem is the weird areas.</v>

3989
02:46:47.270 --> 02:46:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Spots in la it would work fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3990
02:46:50.210 --> 02:46:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those weird areas than like that.</v>

3991
02:46:52.580 --> 02:46:57.580
<v Speaker 1>There's more problems than just not </v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to connect to beans in a </v>

3992
02:46:57.580 --> 02:46:57.580
<v Speaker 1>weird area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3993
02:46:57.580 --> 02:46:58.250
<v Speaker 1>See you there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

3994
02:46:58.490 --> 02:46:59.670

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3995
02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:05.160
<v Speaker 1>put your phone away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for fucking looking for </v>

3996
02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:05.160
<v Speaker 1>pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking for forest.</v>

3997
02:47:05.180 --> 02:47:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I'll look for obscure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pushy.</v>

3998
02:47:07.100 --> 02:47:12.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't like pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were low density environments like </v>

02:47:12.100 --> 02:47:12.950
<v Speaker 1>kitchen.</v>
