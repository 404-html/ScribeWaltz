00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.080
Hello freaks.
Let me do these people that are hearing this right in that.

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.290
There they go.
That's it.
People waiting there like,
what the fuck,
dude,
it's late.

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.160
Exactly.
That's how it caused folks.
We don't,

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.410
we don't guarantee you we're going to start at a certain time.
It's relax.

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.210
Leave it on the background.
We're trying to get you to take it less seriously.

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.420
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by

7
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:27.880
carbonite.com thanksgivings almost here.

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.430
It's the busiest travel time of the year,

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.590
but did you know that about 12,000 laptops are lost every week at us airports

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.950
that sucks a fat one,
and if you're traveling,

11
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.240
make sure your computer is backed up with carbonite online backup.
It's nice,

12
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.320
it's easy,
it's idiot proof,
so that means someone like me can use it.

13
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.000
All you need to do is set it up and carbonite will automatically back up your

14
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.270
important computer files to the cloud and continuously,

15
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.510
no matter how many computers your business has or where they're located,

16
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.150
or you could do it as an individual.
You don't have to be a business.

17
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.900
Do this easy to set up with each computer and you get peace of mind that

18
00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:07.650
computer firewalls are you computer files,
I don't know what that other word was,

19
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.850
but computer files,
what I meant to say are always safe.
I have carbonite.

20
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.370
We use it here on the podcast to back shit up.

21
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.850
It's super easy to do and if you go to Carbonite,

R.
E.

25
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:34.920
It's an excellent service and it's always smart to be backed up freaks because

26
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:38.400
just in case some important shit that laptop shit's real.

27
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.770
I know that girl that buy a brand new MAC book.
Seriously.

28
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:43.980
The second day she went to go travel and she put it in that thing,

29
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.010
that little slot where the magazines are left it there,

30
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.250
came back like 20 minutes later it was gone.
Not only that,

31
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:55.170
they never find those things.
Wink,
wink,
wink,
wink,
wink,
those fucks.

32
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.000
Not all of them,
but you know you are.

33
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.600
We're also brought to you by ting.com rogan.ting.com specifically Tang is a cell

34
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:05.220
phone service that uses a sprint backbone,

35
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.320
but they rent time on it and use their own rules.
It's a much more ethical,

36
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.030
easy,
simple and fair way of distributing cell phone service.
They,

37
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.420
first of all,
they'd have no contracts or early termination fees.

38
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:21.630
If you don't like it anymore,
you just get out and it's sprint.
It's a,

39
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:22.740
it's an excellent service.

40
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:25.680
It's not like it's some new startup that doesn't have a lot of towers.

41
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.310
They use all sprint service,
but they do it in a different way.

42
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.940
They give you credit on unused service if you use less than you thought you

43
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:37.680
would,
tank drops you down and credits you the difference on your next bill.

44
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.210
That's a beautiful thing.
I love that.
I love that a company says,
look,

45
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.790
people don't mind paying for stuff.

46
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:49.290
I think everybody's established that capitalism and its core idea.

47
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.410
Not as far as like the way our economic system is set up of course,

48
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.520
but the idea of I give you money for something,
I work,
I get money.

49
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.570
Like these ideas are pretty clean as long as there's morality attached to it in

50
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:06.130
ethics attached to it and businesses can choose to put in termination fees and

51
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.080
choose to make you pay more for Shit,

52
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:10.900
then you have to or two thinking choose to fuck you.
Basically.

53
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:11.800
That's what they're doing.

54
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.370
And when a company like tin comes along that's not trying to fuck you.

55
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.500
I like it because I think it gives people a better sense of what they're dealing

56
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.630
with.
It gives you,
you know,
you feel good about it.

57
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.870
You don't feel like you're getting fucked over by some big giant asshole company

58
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:27.610
that's just sucking money out of the world.

59
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.020
And if you have a sprint iPhone four or sprint,

60
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:33.220
iPhone four s,

61
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:38.221
you can port them over to ting right now along with bringing over the nexus five

62
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.710

or service rogan.ting.com we're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com

66
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.670
that's o,
n n I t,

67
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.480
makers of Alpha brain and monkey kettlebells.

68
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.190
We have all kinds of crazy shit over at [inaudible] dot com and this Friday is a

69
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:10.690
big fat,
crazy black Friday sale or shit's gonna get poppin.

70
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.280
It's a very,
um,

71
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.320
it's a very big sale for on and every year and they go,
they go crazy with it.

72
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.180
There's a lot of serious money to be saved.
For instance,

73
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.400
I think a,
Hey,
let me give you,
the people are already slowed down like,

74
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.550
like lined up for black Friday at best buy black Friday is weird.

75
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.690
It's a very weird thing.
I'm not sure I agree with it as far as like,

76
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.450
I definitely don't agree with you like getting in line and waiting and stores

77
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:41.500
because I feel like what is your time worth?
Isn't it worth something?

78
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.880
It's one thing if you're ordering online,

79
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:46.420
but if you're waiting and then you're there with a bunch of other assholes where

80
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:49.210
there,
because it's an event and it becomes a game.

81
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.130
<v 1>Yeah.
And it's not,
it's much cheaper.
Like if you go to best buy,</v>

82
00:04:52.131 --> 00:04:55.490
you're going to save an extra $30 and what it would be at Amazon and then you

83
00:04:55.491 --> 00:04:58.010
know,
half these companies online,
you don't have to pay tax,
which,

84
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.890
so that $30 it could have just,
you know,
safe with no tax.

85
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.521
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

86
00:05:01.521 --> 00:05:04.670
And meanwhile you're going to have to use that money to get your teeth fixed.

87
00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:07.130
Cause someone's gonna fucking elbow you in the face while you reach for that

88
00:05:07.131 --> 00:05:12.110
laptop.
They want,
people are crazy.
But on amazon.com um,

89
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.060
you know,
I love ordering Shit online because you don't have to do,

90
00:05:17.061 --> 00:05:20.920
it's like I do,
like half of my shopping is on amazon.com.
Like it's,
it's,

91
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.070
it's so easy to order shit online,
but the idea of like going to best buy,

92
00:05:25.071 --> 00:05:28.010
I don't want to do that unless something's wrong.
You know,

93
00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:29.150
I don't want to go to a place,

94
00:05:29.151 --> 00:05:31.100
I don't want to go to Fry's unless something's really wrong.

95
00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:34.130
I need some shit right now.
Cause otherwise it's like fuck going.

96
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.930
That's one of the things I love about stamps.com and the,

97
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.010
those kinds of services.
Like I don't want to go anywhere.

98
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.770
I want to have to go to your place.
Why can't we work this out?

99
00:05:42.771 --> 00:05:47.660
Or I do this at home anyway at on it.
We're offering 25% off of all supplements,

100
00:05:47.661 --> 00:05:49.640
55% off,
excuse me,

101
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:53.930
15% off foods and 10% off fitness and packages,

102
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.080
plus an additional 5% of orders over 150 bucks and 10% of old off of orders,

103
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.130
over 250 bucks.
So for big orders,

104
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:07.910
it's like 35% of supplements and 20% off fitness equipment.
It's,

105
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.790
it's pretty powerful.
It's a serious deal.
And on it,

106
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:13.550
if you haven't been there for awhile,
we have a lot of new shit.

107
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.940
We try to carry new things every month that we find that we think are

108
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:20.540
interesting.
We just started carrying defense soap.
Um,
yeah,
I need to get that.

109
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.700
So I've been,
uh,
kind of bring you in some remind,

110
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:24.530
remind me on Friday and I'll bring it in.
It's,

111
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.700
or I'll bring it tonight and you can wash your mouth out with soap after you

112
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.890
tell your dirty jokes at the ice house.

113
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.950
A defense soap is amazing soap that works.

114
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:36.800
It keeps bacteria off of your body,
bad bacteria,

115
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:38.750
but it keeps healthy flora on your skin.

116
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.160
It's all natural ingredients like tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil.

117
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.240
And it smells good.
It's completely organic.
It doesn't smell like,
you know,

118
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:50.750
like I had,
um,
um,
it was at a,
um,

119
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.810
this deer hunting things weekend and they had like regular soap.

120
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.920
I wash myself with regular soap once and then I luckily brought defense.
So,

121
00:06:57.921 --> 00:07:02.420
but me,
because for some people they have like stinky deodorant soap.
So you're,

122
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.460
you've basically washing yourself with a fucking a ball of like,

123
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.970
it's,
it's,
it's Cologne.
Yeah.
I mean it's fucking Cologne.
You can call it in,

124
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.750
call it deodorant,
soap,
all you want,
that shit's Cologne.

125
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:16.970
You're covering yourself with some shit that doesn't smell like you.

126
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.710
I know I have axe body wise and I have like a one that right now but I'm not

127
00:07:21.711 --> 00:07:24.440
gonna throw it away but it smells like I'm Persian when I wear it for the first

128
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:25.610
hour.
I just,
I smelled like,

129
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.720
I have like really shitty like Polo Cologne on when I,

130
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:31.430
when I go out whack job.

131
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.060
But I am a refuse that stuff just for their goddamn commercial.
Why,

132
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.860
why you treat me like I'm not stupid.

133
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.740
I know that there's people that are that stupid out there would retire you

134
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:40.574
bitches.

135
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.100
Actually they probably know their target market because those are the only

136
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:46.430
people.
Dumb enough.
Excuse me Brian.
Pardon me to a order.

137
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:51.431
That shit I just haven't had like I switched to bodies washed with like the lone

138
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.410
wolf or Poof,
poof.
Well actually defensive cells body wash too.
Yeah.

139
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.990
I don't think we have it on [inaudible] dot com yet.
But if you go to um,

140
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.650
defense soap.com and know they have it,
cause he's sent me some before.
Yeah,

141
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:06.600
it's great stuff and it's healthy and there's like a lot of,
uh,

142
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.130
it all came out of wrestling because in wrestling a lot of people get bacterial

143
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:12.500
infections.
They get staph infections from their skin,

144
00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:16.730
from getting scratched on the mats and then dirty mats and,
and also,
um,
ringworm.

145
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.110
Ringworm is pretty common and a lot of times people wash with antibacterial soap

146
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:23.690
and that's the wrong approach.
When you're doing that,

147
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:26.330
what you're doing is you're killing everything man.
The good stuff too,

148
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.160
it's like when you take antibiotics,

149
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.580
we have a real problem with overprescribing antibiotics.

150
00:08:31.581 --> 00:08:34.010
Antibiotics are very useful.
Don't get me wrong.
I mean,

151
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:37.250
if you've got a staph infection or if you've got fucking Lyme disease or

152
00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:40.640
something like that,
antibiotics could save your life for sure they're there.

153
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:44.540
It's an amazing invention of fantastic human minds.

154
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.100
But the reality is there's other ways to approach it and the holistic way to

155
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:53.120
approach is to keep your skin healthy and clean and keep the healthy bacteria

156
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.600
that actually fight off bad bacteria.
Keep that shit active.

157
00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:01.320
That's why I've always preached the,
the benefits of probiotics.

158
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:06.030
I drink Kombucha tea every day and it's,
it,
it's,
it's,

159
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.990
I like the taste,

160
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.370
but there's these floating pieces of fungus in it that feel like an elephant

161
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:15.390
just jerked off in your soda.
Goobers it's like a soda,

162
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.170
a Beeri Soda.
He thing.
I remember Marin,
you know Marin,
who's a mark.

163
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:23.150
Marin is a clean sober and uh,
he had a Kombucha and he's like,
ah.

164
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.510
He tweeted on Twitter,
Hey,
am I drinking fucking beer?
Like,
what's going on here?

165
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.720
Because this is before the,
uh,
they started taking them out of whole foods.

166
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.560
Esther got drunk.
Remember she,
she doesn't,
she doesn't drink.

167
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:37.140
She had two of them and she was like,
oh,
I have,
I have right,

168
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:40.590
like slurring words and everything.
There's less than 1% alcohol.

169
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:43.530
She said she was,
yeah,
I don't buy that.
It's,

170
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.590
if it is more than one half of 1% now they have to market and it has to be sold

171
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:53.601
as alcohol because they were using bottles apparently that allowed them to

172
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:57.420
continue fermenting.
So if they had been on the shelf for a couple of months,

173
00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:01.050
they've got stronger and stronger and stronger as time went on.
Fantastic.

174
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:03.420
For your health though,
amazing for your immune system,

175
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:08.220
it's really some special stuff.
Have you heard about fecal transplants?
Yes.
Yes.

176
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.290
I'm not crazy,
but yeah,

177
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:13.500
they take poop and they put it in your butt because or in your colon,

178
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.110
like if you're,
you're lacking certain bacterial,
um,
uh,

179
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.820
you know things are supposed to live in your gut.

180
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:24.750
Back to gut bacteria like e Kolai actually intestinal flora.
Yeah.

181
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:28.410
Intestinal Flora is the nice way of saying it.
But save people,

182
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:31.800
save people like from serious disease from Shit that was,
sorry shit,

183
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.820
shit stuff that was completely uncurable in any other way.

184
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.210
It's like you're fucked the last worth a shit up your ass.

185
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.400
I don't know how they do it.
What they did,

186
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.680
they take it like it doesn't help anything.
I just wanted to film this.

187
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.121
<v 2>It's really simple.</v>

188
00:10:50.121 --> 00:10:53.510
They just take something from someone who's got the the floor that they want a

189
00:10:53.511 --> 00:10:56.510
little bit,
put it in the blender or you know,
at some hospital thing,

190
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.940
mix it up and squirt that right out.

191
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.800
You've heard of the vice documentary about poop line that Chinese or I think do

192
00:11:03.801 --> 00:11:06.590
it where they make wine out of a kid's poop that's like seven

193
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.620
<v 0>years old or something like that.</v>

194
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.150
I have heard that and I've also seen where they boil eggs and p young boys.

195
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.050
P Virgin.
Virgin Boys.
Yeah.

196
00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:19.930
They prefer like boys under the age of 11 or something like that.
Whoa.
Yeah.

197
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.060
<v 2>The other day,
I don't know if it was vice,</v>

198
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.460
but was the thing about people going around the streets take up the manhole

199
00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:29.480
cover and they've got these big long spoons and they grabbed the stuff that's

200
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:31.760
caught in the filter.
Right.

201
00:11:31.761 --> 00:11:36.230
And the strainer and it's all this like fatty,
gelatinous horrible,

202
00:11:36.231 --> 00:11:38.630
like big Luger's.
Basically what it is.

203
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.360
And then they take it out to their plant in the countryside,

204
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:45.210
boil it down and sell it as cooking oil.
Oh.

205
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:50.270
And they estimated the 10% of the cooking oil in China.
It contains this stuff.

206
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.160
<v 0>Oh my God.
Fuck that.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

207
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.290
Brian Cowen was telling me that when he was in China,
him,
uh,

208
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.610
he was with his family and his mom said that when they were at this restaurant,

209
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:04.270
she noticed that they had pig sties underneath the building.
Right.

210
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.410
And she's trying to figure out what was going on.
And um,
Brian was like,

211
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:11.070
why are they living on,
in the building?
She goes,
I suspect that there the,

212
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.600
the sewage system here.
Okay.

213
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.360
<v 2>And so in the heat,
the,
it's traditional method,
they had the,</v>

214
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.560
well just the body heat of the animals and the China and other Asian countries,

215
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:23.920
they would typically have them,
uh,
under the house.
So it would heat the house

216
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.940
and sewage.
I have shit into the eager face of a pig.
Now that you mentioned,

217
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:35.080
how dare you,
do you know that Peter Listens?
They're here.

218
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.340
The peak was asking for it.
All right.
Oh,
this was,
no,
seriously,

219
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:44.320
this was on a long bus ride in Sumatra and Indonesia.
Right.
And you get,

220
00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:47.890
you know,
it's one of these 20 hour bus rides and you stop and you know,

221
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:49.480
all the buses stop in the same place.

222
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:53.680
They got the quick food and the shitters big long line of shitters and I go up

223
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.970
and it's squat toilets,
right?
And it's just a whole no plumbing or anything.

224
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.150
And I look through the hole and there are all these pigs down there,

225
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.170
just look it up with shit all over their faces.

226
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:08.010
<v 0>Oh my God.
Oh my God.</v>

227
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.050
And you just happily shit right in their face.

228
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.780
<v 2>It was hard to relax.
But I,
you know,
I was traveling,</v>

229
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.650
I had a certain urgency.
What the fuck?
Anyway,

230
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:21.810
we don't sell shit or pigs@ana.com but if you use a code name,

let's get this party rolling.

247
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.710
<v 3>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

248
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.370
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

249
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.290
<v 0>When a man tells you that he's shit into a pig's mouth,</v>

250
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:36.570
you look at him differently forevermore.

251
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.700
<v 2>If you look at Bacon differently.</v>

252
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:45.100
<v 0>Well.
Um,
I've been,
uh,
I want to go a hunting pigs.
I'm going to do that soon.</v>

253
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.410
I think I'm going to go and do that this January.

254
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:52.070
<v 2>You ever written a Michael Pollan's essay about a hunting wild?
No.
Sonoma?</v>

255
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.060
<v 4>No.
It's an excellent essay.
I think it might be in a,</v>

256
00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:58.880
the Omnivore's dilemma or maybe it was published separately.

257
00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:01.850
I don't remember where I came across a noma is a big area for them.

258
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:06.410
Northern California is a huge issue with pigs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
In Spain,

259
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.190
they're wild boars all over the place and you know the wild pigs and domestic

260
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:14.700
pigs like wild boars,
like,
like the,
those,
those crazy looking eval boards.

261
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:19.590
They're the same animal.
The exact same animal.
Yeah.
Really?
No species different.

262
00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.810
No,
no.
According to Steve Rinella,
it's the exact same l animal.

263
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.140
Steven Nela is without a doubt the biggest animal expert that I know.

264
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:29.450
He's the host of mediator that a hunting TV show.

265
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.810
We just got done hunting with him and Wisconsin for deer,

266
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.470
which are fucking everywhere.
Oh my God.
You know,

267
00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:40.760
people that like worry about deer hunters and what deer hunting.
It's evil.

268
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:43.820
It's cruel.
Like the people have no idea how many do you have?

269
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:46.640
There are like these guys,
they're asking to kill deer.

270
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:49.460
Like they have to make no pressure days.
There's no predators.
Exactly.

271
00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:54.170
There's coyotes,
which a kill the Fonz and they kill wounded animals.

272
00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:56.090
I go down and gets wounded.
But man,

273
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.060
well I grew up in Pennsylvania where there are no coyotes.
Right?

274
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.440
So there were no predators.

275
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:04.070
There were like two mountain lions still in the mountain somewhere.
But uh,

276
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:08.110
there are everywhere.
Everywhere.
I mean,
I've hit four or five or in a car.
Yeah.

277
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.360
And I moved out of there when I was 17,
so that's two,
two years of driving.

278
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.570
My folks used to live in Harrisburg.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mine too.

279
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.850
We couldn't drive at night.
He's driving now.

280
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:20.630
You better go 10 miles an hour because they were everywhere in their driveway.

281
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.370
And you know,
it might be your marijuana plants.
How dare those cons,

282
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.170
they ate flowers too.
They love roses.
Yeah.
Wow.

283
00:16:27.171 --> 00:16:30.890
I had a crazy dream that I just remembered because of that,
that a,

284
00:16:30.891 --> 00:16:35.150
I brought a bunch of roses in for Pete for a friend to eat and he was eating him

285
00:16:35.151 --> 00:16:38.500
telling me how fantastic they were and I was just taking it for granted.

286
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.690
I didn't want to eat these roses at all,
but I got them for him.

287
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.260
But a strange train for Valentine's Day,
but it wasn't like roses,

288
00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:49.130
like a bouquet with like the leaves and everything.
It was like a plate,
like a,

289
00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:52.250
like almost like a tray that you would get like at Wendy's,
you know like,

290
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:56.540
well it's fast food trays stacked up with roses on it.
You served him man rose.

291
00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.590
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was like,
hey man,
I got some roses.
You can eat these.

292
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.520
Like you said try.
They're fantastic.
And I remember trying,
I'm like,
man,

293
00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:07.410
I don't get,
it sounds like American beauty.
It's a fucking strange dream man.

294
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.660
And to the fact that I just remembered it when you said that like deer eating

295
00:17:11.661 --> 00:17:14.280
things to see what else we're,
we'll knock loose.
Yeah,

296
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.510
it's dreams are a motherfucker,
man.
They're so weird.
How,

297
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:19.560
like in the middle of the day like,
Oh yeah,
that's right.

298
00:17:19.561 --> 00:17:22.490
That for my fucking dream.
Like why can't I remember that?
What,

299
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:25.130
what is the mechanism there?
Figured that out.
Yeah.

300
00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:29.930
There's a chemical that your body,
your brain releases that are racist memories.

301
00:17:29.931 --> 00:17:32.390
What is it?
As you're waking,
I don't remember the name of the chemical,

302
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.970
but there's another one that stops you from moving.
Right?

303
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:39.020
So you won't hurt yourself.
It disconnects your volition from your body.

304
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:43.680
And uh,
that's why you have those a night terrors.
You know,
where you're like,
you,

305
00:17:43.681 --> 00:17:47.290
you hear someone come in but you can't move.
You ever have that?

306
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.040
That's what it is.
But it's really aliens,
Bro.
Could be ale.

307
00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.080
<v 2>It's fucking aliens.
All right man.
What is it with aliens and anal probes?</v>

308
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.400
Well,
I think it's a bullshit.
That's what I think it is.

309
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.180
And I think people who are crazy or worried about their ass all the time worried

310
00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:05.820
someone's going to put something in there.
What's the name of the,

311
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:10.820
of the singer who used to be married to the bike?
I'm sorry.
I've Lance Armstrong.

312
00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:16.380
Sheryl crow.
Sheryl crow.
You this Weird Sheryl Crow alien thing?
No.

313
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.190
Okay.
I may be the only person in the world who's ever noticed this,

314
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:24.000
but it all right,
she's got a record that came out.
Uh,

315
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.420
and there are two songs on the record.
There's one called a maybe angels,

316
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:32.340
and it's about the lyrics are like,
my bags are packed if they ever come for me,

317
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:37.110
you know,
I know my sister,
she knew Elvis.
And so all this kind of like,

318
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.040
it's sung from the perspective of someone who's waiting for aliens to come and

319
00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:42.540
take her away.
Right?

320
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:47.580
And then there's another song on the record called Heaven's gate,
which is,

321
00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:52.560
I don't really know what that song's about.
Months after this record came out,

322
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:58.160
the heaven's gate cult in San Diego all killed themselves because they thought

323
00:18:58.531 --> 00:19:00.900
that there were aliens behind the,
the comment,

324
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:03.450
the Hale Bob comment that was coming to take them away.

325
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.080
They're on the same sneakers on,
and they were all wearing Nike's,
I think,
right?

326
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.360
Purple Nike's or something like that.
And you know,

327
00:19:09.361 --> 00:19:13.890
one of the people in that sector was the nephew of lieutenant who roof from Star

328
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:18.360
Trek.
Whoa,
weird.
But anyway,
that happened after she released this record.

329
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.180
So what I mean,
that's pretty weird.

330
00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:24.570
You got a song about aliens coming to take you away and another song called

331
00:19:24.571 --> 00:19:25.231
Heaven's gate,

332
00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:28.440
and then some is about that Warren Beatty movie that was really just were bomb.

333
00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:32.190
Yeah,
maybe she was like a Warren Beatty Fan,
which I like that.

334
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.060
I've thought of that as an alternative hypothesis and she just have but cancer

335
00:19:36.061 --> 00:19:40.680
too.
Oh,
she did?
Yeah.
She just likes survivor.
She had breast cancer,

336
00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:42.390
I believe.
I don't think it was buck cancer.

337
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.680
Girls don't get bud cancer as much as they get broke camp breast cancer breasts

338
00:19:46.681 --> 00:19:51.570
are apparently very vulnerable to cancer.
Yeah.
Well,
you know why?
Why?
No,

339
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:56.010
because the cells replicate much more often and much more quickly in breast

340
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:57.180
tissue than another tissue,

341
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.830
which makes sense because they have to in order to swell up and morph and become

342
00:20:01.831 --> 00:20:06.270
milk bags.
Yeah.
Ovaries too,
right?
You think about ovaries there every month.

343
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.650
And I'll tell Barry cancer,
another very common cancer.
And it's,
I mean,
here's,

344
00:20:10.651 --> 00:20:15.510
here's another angle on this that I'm working into this book I'm writing.
Uh,

345
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.860
you know,
think about how many times a woman menstruated before agriculture.

346
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.210
I don't want to,
he made me,
but how many,

347
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.410
so a woman came into,
uh,

348
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:30.420
you became fertile at 18 or 19 because they had low body fat.
So they,

349
00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:33.570
they meant straight in later.
Now girls are menstruating at eight,
nine,

350
00:20:33.571 --> 00:20:37.020
10 years of age.
But the sort of typical hunter gatherer human thing,

351
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:40.380
it starts around 18.
They'd be having sex before then,

352
00:20:40.381 --> 00:20:43.040
but there was no consequences because they weren't obvious.

353
00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:47.230
Obviating so they got roped in to sex as the track one.
I don't know about.
Well,

354
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.190
anyway,
so just

355
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.600
<v 0>to,
to follow this line,
uh,
so they start having,
yeah,</v>

356
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.220
<v 5>sex,
they get pregnant.
They have a kid,
they breastfeed for two and a half,</v>

357
00:20:57.221 --> 00:20:58.690
three years typically.
Right?

358
00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:02.500
So that's a period of like four years when they're not obviating because women

359
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.420
typically don't ovulate when they're breastfeeding,

360
00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:08.890
especially if they have low body fat.
And then,
okay,
they start ovulating again.

361
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:12.050
They might opulate a dozen times,
they get pregnant again,
another kid and so on.

362
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.780
So you add it all up.
You find that a typical human before agriculture,

363
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:22.230
female opulate it may maybe between 50 and 80 or a hundred times in her life,

364
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.580
you look at it after agriculture and like now women obviously you late three,

365
00:21:27.581 --> 00:21:28.870
400 times in a way,

366
00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.560
<v 0>sometimes a day.
Some of them,</v>

367
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.800
some of them seem like they're on the rag all day on a weekend.
The whole life,

368
00:21:34.801 --> 00:21:38.180
their whole life,
they're spent bleeding.
So that stress is women's bodies a lot.

369
00:21:38.181 --> 00:21:40.620
Cause every time they go through that cycle is you say their breasts are

370
00:21:40.621 --> 00:21:43.770
swelling,
things are changing.
What are they attribute this change in?

371
00:21:43.771 --> 00:21:46.170
The amount of menstruating women do?
Is it just food?

372
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.930
<v 5>Uh,
it's a higher body fat,
which gets them started earlier.</v>

373
00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.270
But it's also that women aren't,
uh,

374
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.360
aren't having as many kids and they aren't breastfeeding their kids.

375
00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:01.520
So a woman in an agricultural society or now could have a kid,

376
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.090
kids on cow milk immediately

377
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.420
<v 0>cycling again.
What's the numbers on people who breastfeed and people don't?</v>

378
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.390
It was almost all of my friends whose wives had children.
They breastfed.

379
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:16.370
<v 5>Yeah.
I don't know.
And you don't have to also think about how to judge it.</v>

380
00:22:16.371 --> 00:22:17.780
You know?
How long do they breastfeed?

381
00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.420
<v 0>I know one lady who didn't want to breastfeed because she didn't want her</v>

382
00:22:20.421 --> 00:22:22.790
nipples to get ugly.
Yeah,
yeah.
A lot of women.

383
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:27.020
Let's stretch it out or did it didn't do anything to my wife's,
but to some,

384
00:22:27.021 --> 00:22:30.170
some people's names.
Well,
some people are more susceptible to stretch marks too.

385
00:22:30.171 --> 00:22:33.800
Like I've met people that had a kid and it just wrecked their body.

386
00:22:33.801 --> 00:22:35.950
I mean it looks like they were attacked by a bear,
you know,

387
00:22:35.951 --> 00:22:39.320
like just claw marks all of their stomach and then you see some girls,

388
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.140
they have a baby and then like three weeks later they look like nothing even

389
00:22:42.141 --> 00:22:46.010
happened to them.
Like it doesn't even make any sense.
That's genetics.
Genetics.

390
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.900
They vary substantially when it comes to the elasticity of skin.
Apparently.
Yeah.

391
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.460
You know,
you see that in mixed martial arts,

392
00:22:52.461 --> 00:22:56.270
like some guys get cut really easy and it's not just the shape of the bones

393
00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.540
that's been argued.
That's the shape of the bones around the eyes.

394
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.940
There's some people that just have much more tender skin.

395
00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.960
There's guys like Bj Penn,
Bj Penn fought and like God,

396
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.190
I don't know how many times the champ have to weight divisions.

397
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.980
I've never seen the guy caught it,
never gets caught.
He gets beat up.

398
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:14.540
I mean he's had fucking wars,
five swollen,
no cuts.
It's weird.

399
00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.320
Some guys you just,
you punch misses him and they cut open.

400
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.910
It's a very strange thing.
I think it goes that way with a vaginas as well.

401
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.320
Like some girl's Vaginas,

402
00:23:24.321 --> 00:23:28.610
like snapped back into action and other ones it's like you just shot a bowling

403
00:23:28.611 --> 00:23:33.260
ball through a chicken.
You know,
it's,
what are you going to do with this?

404
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:34.370
You're going to stitch up,

405
00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:39.110
stitch up the outside and pretend you're not a fucking or canyon.
After that.

406
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.130
It's,
you know,
it's just genetics.

407
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:46.010
We were talking about Dan savage earlier.
He's gay,

408
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.870
<v 5>right?
So he's not real into vaginas.</v>

409
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.280
And at one point he wrote in his column that for him,

410
00:23:52.281 --> 00:23:57.020
vaginas looked like canned hams that had fallen from the sky and I can split on

411
00:23:57.021 --> 00:24:00.940
impact.
How rude.
He did not win him a lot of and

412
00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.440
<v 0>ratio from the ladies.
It's so silly to say too,</v>

413
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.840
they don't look anything like that.
It's a shitty comparison.
Well,

414
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.370
you know what's he know,
but I mean it doesn't look,

415
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.470
I can't handle it fell from the sky at all.
No,

416
00:24:13.471 --> 00:24:18.120
it looks like a strange gelatinous alien that's trying to steal your sperm.

417
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.750
That's what it looks like.
The mouth of some strange creature,

418
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:26.310
some succubus bus.
It's just there to pull genetic material out of your body,

419
00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.410
which essentially the vagina is.

420
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.950
Other than being a point of pleasure in a place where Your pee looks like your

421
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.650
Predator mask.
That was in my last special,

422
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:39.810
I was talking about my wife saying that uncircumcised dicks are ugly.

423
00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:42.240
And I'm like,
have you even seen your vagina?

424
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:43.770
Do you know what that thing looks like?

425
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.430
The extra skin on that might be the best one

426
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:51.340
<v 5>part of it.
Yeah.
Genitalia,
you know,
it's all in the eye of the beholder.
Right.</v>

427
00:24:51.341 --> 00:24:52.420
He's gotta be in the mood,

428
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:56.920
especially if you're really wanting it looks better.
Yeah.

429
00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.690
That's when it becomes delicious.
When you're all excited.

430
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:02.883
So,
um,

431
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.810
there's many things that have caused people to start menstruating later in life.

432
00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.530
Yeah.
Primarily,
uh,
less,
uh,

433
00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.410
breastfeeding less amount of time and higher fat diets.

434
00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.210
What percentage of women breastfeed?

435
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:18.163
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

436
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.550
<v 5>Yeah.
And you're going to want to look on,
you know,
cross cultural stuff too?</v>

437
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.030
<v 0>No,
I'm going to go with the first website I find,</v>

438
00:25:24.031 --> 00:25:27.240
and I'm going to say it like it's fact,
because that's what you do.

439
00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:32.200
How that's how it goes.
The CDC Center for Disease Control,
they know.
Yeah.

440
00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.160
They'll know about America.
Sure.
More mothers are breastfeeding,

441
00:25:35.161 --> 00:25:38.490
but overall rates are still low.
90%.

442
00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:39.190
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

443
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:42.210
<v 0>Of families exclusively breastfeed for six months.</v>

444
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.133
<v 6>Wow.</v>

445
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:49.050
<v 5>How many?
90%.
And they're saying that's low.
Um,</v>

446
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.040
they say they're saying that,
um,
overall the rates are still low,

447
00:25:53.041 --> 00:25:54.870
is what they're saying in this article.
I don't understand.

448
00:25:54.871 --> 00:25:58.830
That doesn't make sense.
It's on CBS news too.
What are you saying you fucks?

449
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.580
Did I read this wrong?
Is that possible?
You know,

450
00:26:02.581 --> 00:26:05.870
in breastfeeding also relates to what we were talking about earlier with the

451
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.220
bacteria and the intestinal fallen and all that.

452
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:13.350
Babies that are born vaginally pickup,
uh,
bacteria,

453
00:26:13.351 --> 00:26:16.820
especially skin bacteria that stays with them for life.
Whoa.

454
00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.400
And they found that babies who are born through society and don't have that and

455
00:26:20.401 --> 00:26:24.900
are more likely as a result to get infections and various fungal infections and

456
00:26:24.901 --> 00:26:28.800
their skin's,
wait,
I got proceed.
Bacteria on me.
Yeah,
you want to,

457
00:26:28.801 --> 00:26:32.850
you want to get as much of that as you can.
And then a breastfeeding as well.

458
00:26:32.851 --> 00:26:36.390
The first few days of breastfeeding,
I think it's called clostridium.

459
00:26:36.391 --> 00:26:39.120
There's a substance that comes from the breasts that isn't,

460
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.070
it's mostly stuff other than milk.
Really high colostrum.

461
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.130
<v 4>Colostrum,
I think that's the word.
Yeah.
He just spit that out.</v>

462
00:26:47.131 --> 00:26:48.960
Like you know what you're talking about.
You don't know how to say it,

463
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.060
but I know what it tastes like.

464
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.970
You get an order that you could buy it at a whole foods.
I'm past,

465
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:59.760
the old from cow
is healthy.

466
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.910
<v 0>It's rich in human growth hormone or cow growth hormone.</v>

467
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:07.720
It's very similar.
So with this,
listen to this statistic,

468
00:27:07.721 --> 00:27:09.730
this is pretty crazy that they're not saying how many people do it.

469
00:27:09.731 --> 00:27:13.780
What they were saying was if 90% did,
this is how much lower uh,
health risks.

470
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.630
Right?
Right.
I can't read and talk at the same time,

471
00:27:16.631 --> 00:27:21.040
but infants who are breastfed for the first six months have a 72% lower risk of

472
00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:26.340
hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infections and it's 64% reduced risk

473
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.760
for non-specified gastronomical tract infections,

474
00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:35.320
58% risk reduction for the intestinal infection.

475
00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.850
Necrotizing enter.
Wow.

476
00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:44.910
Enter ocular Titus in preterm infants and at 27 to 42% reduction in allergic

477
00:27:48.011 --> 00:27:51.400
diseases in breastfed infants.
That's amazing.

478
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.280
You would be an asshole to not breastfeed your kid if you could because you're

479
00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:57.190
like,
setting this up,

480
00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:01.540
this kid up for like a life of much more likely infections,

481
00:28:01.541 --> 00:28:05.320
much more likely allergic reactions.
I mean,
those are big numbers.

482
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.690
<v 5>Yeah.
And that's just the stuff that happens when it's still a kid.</v>

483
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:13.340
There's evidence that there are lifelong changes in immune response.
Whether uh,

484
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.160
based on whether or not a kid was breastfed,

485
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.970
<v 0>the World Health Organization recommends that babies should be exclusively</v>

486
00:28:17.971 --> 00:28:20.940
breastfed for the first six months of life and then receive a combination of

487
00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:25.020
breast milk and easily digestible foods through the age of two.
Wow.

488
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.570
You should still have breast milk up to the age of two.

489
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:31.890
Research shows that if 90% of families exclusively breastfed for six months,

490
00:28:31.891 --> 00:28:36.660
almost 1000 infant deaths could be prevented annually and 13 billion would be

491
00:28:36.661 --> 00:28:41.661
saved in medical costs each year according to the u s department of Health and

492
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.550
Human Services Office on Women's health.
That's amazing.
I mean,

493
00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:47.700
I know there's some issues that some women have,
some women's,
um,

494
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:52.730
areas aren't set up for breastfeeding and some of that can be helped with pumps

495
00:28:52.921 --> 00:28:56.370
to apparently,
and you know,
some people,
they just don't have the fucking time,

496
00:28:56.371 --> 00:28:57.204
unfortunately.

497
00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.290
<v 5>And also it's a social thing.
You know,</v>

498
00:28:59.291 --> 00:29:02.920
in the United States it's still seen as a shameful,
you know,

499
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.200
sorta something you should do in the bathroom.

500
00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:08.950
There states where it's illegal to do it in restaurants or in public.
It's,

501
00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.190
there's a lot of bullshit women have to contend with in addition to the

502
00:29:12.191 --> 00:29:13.300
biological stuff.

503
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:16.130
<v 4>Yeah.
Doing it in public as a rough one and the same.</v>

504
00:29:16.131 --> 00:29:19.900
That's like everywhere in India.
Women are breastfeeding,
but those are Spanish,

505
00:29:19.901 --> 00:29:22.030
tits and Indian to it's no one cares.
You know,

506
00:29:22.031 --> 00:29:25.510
you got a nice American corn fed tet and you can't just have that out there in

507
00:29:25.511 --> 00:29:25.930
the breeze.

508
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.890
I sat next to one on a plane just last week on the way home from Vegas and the

509
00:29:29.891 --> 00:29:32.860
whole time I just had my sunglasses on staring at her nipple all the time.

510
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:36.760
It's great.
You're a fucking creep.
Which are the reason why Pete?
No,
I wouldn't.

511
00:29:36.761 --> 00:29:40.150
I'd be respectful.
You're the reason why people are afraid to do that.
Fuck wait,

512
00:29:40.151 --> 00:29:42.040
was,
was this a fed or

513
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.880
<v 0>stupid?
Ma'Am,
why don't you do that?
Because she was hot.</v>

514
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.900
You're just being an asshole.
Okay.
Anyway,

515
00:29:46.901 --> 00:29:50.890
more than 70% of American women don't fall the new recommendations.

516
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:55.930
So that means that 30% of women breastfeed.
That's,
that's crazy.

517
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.711
That's,
this is,

518
00:29:56.711 --> 00:29:59.890
so this is a more accurate statistic as to how few actually breastfeed.

519
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.540
70% of American women don't exclusively breastfeed their babies for the first

520
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:08.860
six months.
So they might be mixing formula.
And with that,
I'm not sure,

521
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.130
I'm not sure how it works,
but that's not good.

522
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.370
<v 5>You,
you ever heard about what Nestle did in Africa?
No.</v>

523
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:21.290
If the formula they had a bunch of formula was um,
it was too old,

524
00:30:21.291 --> 00:30:22.124
it was expired.

525
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:27.430
They hired guys to go around Africa wearing like lab coats looking like doctors

526
00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:32.820
trying to convince women to use this formula because they were gonna just go

527
00:30:32.821 --> 00:30:35.420
throw it away.
So they sold it and really cheap in Africa.

528
00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.820
Now these are women who otherwise would breastfeed,

529
00:30:37.821 --> 00:30:39.350
which is really good for their kids.
Right?

530
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.350
But because these guys are wearing lab coats and you know,

531
00:30:42.351 --> 00:30:46.370
speaking with authority in this,
all this scientific bullshit,
a lot of women,

532
00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:49.430
tens of thousands of women started buying this formula,

533
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.310
mix it with the really shitty water that they've got there.

534
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:57.230
And all these babies die all over Africa.
And Nestle gotten big.

535
00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:59.000
It's just like in the eighties or nineties,

536
00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.270
there was a worldwide boycott of Nestle because of this is

537
00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:07.090
<v 0>it's corporations.
It's the idea that you have to make money for your company,</v>

538
00:31:07.091 --> 00:31:07.640
period.

539
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.030
<v 5>Did you see today with the,</v>

540
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:13.520
the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case to decide whether or not corporations

541
00:31:13.521 --> 00:31:15.110
have religious rights.

542
00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.180
They've already determined they have the right of free speech,

543
00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.230
which is translated into unlimited spending on political parties because that's

544
00:31:24.231 --> 00:31:27.560
considered speech citizens United.
And uh,

545
00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:31.640
now today they agreed to hear a case because these companies that are owned by

546
00:31:31.641 --> 00:31:36.641
religious radical right wingers don't want to have insurance for the employees

547
00:31:38.001 --> 00:31:39.140
that cover birth control.

548
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.530
So they say it's their right as a corporation not to do this,

549
00:31:42.531 --> 00:31:46.580
even though it's the national law and the Supreme Court's going to hear the
case.

550
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:50.030
<v 0>Wow.
That's hilarious.</v>

551
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.850
<v 5>Yeah.
I mean,
when people talk about Frankenstein,
you know,
this whole idea like,</v>

552
00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:59.480
or will will robots ever take over?
It's like,
dude,
it's done.
Yeah.

553
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.140
Look at a corporation is something we created,

554
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:07.500
legal structure that we created that has already got more power than governments

555
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:11.200
or religions.
It's taken over governments.

556
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.200
You even if you talk to people,
they say,
yeah,

557
00:32:14.201 --> 00:32:16.510
but there are good people in that company.
Sure there are,

558
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.700
but the company doesn't give a shit.
Right.

559
00:32:18.701 --> 00:32:20.710
Cause they'll die and they'll have new people.

560
00:32:20.711 --> 00:32:25.540
It's like it's like a structure that has taken control of the planet and we're

561
00:32:25.541 --> 00:32:29.440
just part of the structure where like working for this monster.

562
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:29.881
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

563
00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:34.881
It's all about ones and Zeros and when it comes down to only being responsible

564
00:32:34.921 --> 00:32:38.490
for your bottom line and having an obligation to shareholders to include

565
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.580
increased the money every month,

566
00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:45.080
<v 4>that that gets really weird because it is sort of a machine and it's each person</v>

567
00:32:45.081 --> 00:32:48.110
has to go home and say,
Hey,
what can we do?
It's business.
It's business.

568
00:32:48.111 --> 00:32:50.360
It's what we do,
right?
Like what?
What are,
what do we do?

569
00:32:50.361 --> 00:32:54.650
We're plugged into this weird machine and what are the machines doing as best I

570
00:32:54.651 --> 00:32:59.651
can tell their entire purpose is taking part of the earth and turning it into

571
00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:05.480
shit.
You know,
like destroying everything that's beautiful and,

572
00:33:05.481 --> 00:33:09.290
and digging big holes and turning it all into plastic that then floats in the

573
00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:12.890
ocean.
Some you know and when you're involved in the manufacturing process?

574
00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.900
Most except for Ting Tang is really corporations,

575
00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.340
sort of a company kind of.
I've got to say last time I,

576
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.690
one of the Times I was on your show,

577
00:33:20.691 --> 00:33:22.970
you were talking about ting and I had an iPhone.

578
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.440
I don't know if you remember and I was like,
damn,

579
00:33:24.441 --> 00:33:26.420
I would get Tang if I didn't have this fucking iPhone,

580
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:31.930
but I got so like tired of bullshit with phone companies like the hidden charges

581
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:36.530
and the sneaky bullshit and I really admire this,
this philosophy of like,
hey,

582
00:33:36.531 --> 00:33:39.200
here it is.
You get what you pay for.
We're not going to fuck around with you.

583
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.940
I ended up selling my iPhone.

584
00:33:40.941 --> 00:33:44.300
I got a Samsung just so I could go with tink for you.
Which one did you get?

585
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.150
A galaxy s four it's a nice phone.
Yeah.

586
00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:50.900
I saw you went with the the other one that this bad boy.
That's a monster.

587
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.550
The note.
Oh,
you got to know it.
I thought you got the note three.

588
00:33:55.551 --> 00:33:59.810
You had another one a few months ago.
I got an HTC one.
Yeah.

589
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.610
This is the shit though.
This was the one I really love.
Still using it.
Oh yeah.

590
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.830
I love the fuck out that phone set up.
The little pen.
Yes,
a stylist.

591
00:34:06.831 --> 00:34:08.210
I write my comedy notes on it.

592
00:34:08.211 --> 00:34:11.120
Like I don't need to bring a notepad with me anymore because I have an endless

593
00:34:11.121 --> 00:34:14.540
supply of pages and I can file them on the phone.

594
00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:19.340
Like I can shuffle through all my notes.
I put them in folders.
It's amazing.

595
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.890
I got to stop coming on this show.
It costs me money.

596
00:34:21.891 --> 00:34:25.190
Every time I got to buy a new phone I'm going to have to go buy a note and get a

597
00:34:25.191 --> 00:34:29.390
Porsche.
Well the um,
the galaxy s four,
it's pretty sweet.
It's sweet.

598
00:34:29.391 --> 00:34:30.950
Another phone.
It is beautiful.

599
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:34.580
I mean just the screen looking at photos and say I don't watch videos and stuff

600
00:34:34.581 --> 00:34:35.121
on the phone,

601
00:34:35.121 --> 00:34:39.200
but I like looking at the photos and man like go back to an iPhone after that.

602
00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:43.790
It looks so small and the Internet is the biggest difference in the experience.

603
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.390
You mean cause this,
the note is enormous when you're looking at screen.

604
00:34:47.391 --> 00:34:50.180
If you're looking at a photograph on the screen or if you're looking at a

605
00:34:50.181 --> 00:34:54.470
website,
I mean God damn huge.
I mean look how big that is.
Yeah.

606
00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.750
I mean it really is like a tablet.
You get an awesome view and you know,

607
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:04.730
I carry a purse.
How dare you immerse.
I like it.
I wish everybody did.

608
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.300
Yeah.
So you can take rule for that and yeah,
I put it in my back pocket.

609
00:35:08.301 --> 00:35:11.390
It fits easy.
Oh really?
That's no issue at all.
But uh,

610
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:13.670
I'm 100% in favor of the murse.

611
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.880
I think I'm disgusted by the fact that we can't wear a purse.

612
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.850
It's rude and we just have to take back,
take it back.

613
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:24.650
I consider it more than immerse.
I consider it my quite chain Kane bag.

614
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:30.440
Remember?
Remember quite chain cane?
Yeah,
I do Kung Fu.
Yeah.
He had a bag.

615
00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:33.590
He had like a little leather sandbag.
Yeah,
little leather thing.

616
00:35:33.591 --> 00:35:35.230
He kept as necessary.

617
00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:38.520
I tried keeping my laptop one of those cause I wanted to look more
sophisticated.

618
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.990
I feel like I'm in my forties now.
She'll probably grow up.
I didn't work.

619
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:45.810
I went back to the backpack backpack.
She was more effective.

620
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:50.010
Wait for your fifties I give up.
I just got this new shirt like a,

621
00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:51.630
it's like a Hoodie.
I don't have it on right now,

622
00:35:51.631 --> 00:35:56.430
but it has like a man like a fanny pack built into it kind of.

623
00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:59.890
You have your two hands in your pockets and then there's like this middle like

624
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.140
thing that's just like a fanny pack.
Yeah,
it,
yeah,
it's like velcro.

625
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:08.340
You just open it up and it's not the hundreds like a baby step.

626
00:36:08.341 --> 00:36:12.380
That's the gateway drug to fanny packs.
Yeah,
it's cold.

627
00:36:12.381 --> 00:36:15.340
Cause I use it like crazy and it just looks like you have a little,
you know,

628
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.860
stomach of gear and then some,
some girls like guts,
you'll find them that way.

629
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:23.610
It was girls other than have fetishes,
just like guys,
like pretty feet.

630
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:27.180
Some girls like guts.
Really?
Yeah,
I've heard.
Not enough of them.

631
00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:31.180
Not enough of them.
It's an evolutionary advantage.

632
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.910
There's more guts out there.
So they start,

633
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.780
they start gravitating towards in order to ensure that their seed gets spread.

634
00:36:36.781 --> 00:36:39.480
Right.
And a lot of the guys with the guts have money.
Yeah.

635
00:36:39.481 --> 00:36:42.270
I think a lot of people have given up on quality and they just,
you know,

636
00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.920
just want to get the job done and any port in a storm got her warm.
Well,

637
00:36:46.921 --> 00:36:50.280
physical attributes are not nearly as necessary as it used to be.

638
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.830
When our society gets more and more safe,

639
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:57.660
you know it's less and less a requirement to be physically sound or strong or

640
00:36:57.661 --> 00:37:01.650
not look like in a key little version.
Now they have life insurance policies.

641
00:37:01.651 --> 00:37:05.750
It's actually beneficial if you marry that guy with a bad heart.
Exactly.

642
00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:10.410
Ladies Kill when you will.
Yeah.
If you marry a guy who's got like sleep apnea,

643
00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:14.370
he's a hundred pounds overweight and he's also on a gang of pills,

644
00:37:14.371 --> 00:37:18.330
like just wait it out,
get a nice life insurance policy,

645
00:37:18.331 --> 00:37:20.970
make sure the medical stuff is all documented.

646
00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.060
He's going to kick over eventually.
How long can they last?

647
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.300
Get them involved in sports.
Say Yani,
I want you to start losing weight.

648
00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:32.460
Let's go scuba dive and get them involved in some stupid shit you can't do that.

649
00:37:32.791 --> 00:37:36.690
Ticker would just give the fuck out and then you rake it in hang gliding.

650
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:38.010
It's evolutionary,
right?

651
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.160
I mean there's got to be gold diggers have to be a part of evolution,

652
00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.920
right?
I mean it has to be some,
some form of an equation.

653
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:50.160
What is that a serious question?
Cause not really.

654
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.300
It's like what we were talking about,
like corporations being machines.

655
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.320
I did write a book about that.
It's like a

656
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:02.730
gold digging.
Yeah.
Well we,
we wrote in our book,

657
00:38:02.731 --> 00:38:05.040
actually we say Darwin says your mother's a whore.

658
00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:10.080
And I had business cards that I had that quote on the book because Darwin's

659
00:38:10.081 --> 00:38:15.081
theory is that women traded sexual access for goods and services,

660
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.400
right?
Gold diggers essentially.

661
00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:22.350
And the sort of mainstream views since Darwin has been that that's women's

662
00:38:22.351 --> 00:38:25.080
nature and that man's nature is to be the provider.

663
00:38:25.081 --> 00:38:27.720
And so the women are trying to rope in the best provider and all that,

664
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.080
but that we basically call bullshit on that in our book.

665
00:38:31.081 --> 00:38:36.010
So how do you call bullshit on it?
What's the,
well,
you know,
aside from

666
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.840
<v 5>all the evidence that our ancestors did not evolve in nuclear families,</v>

667
00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:45.670
uh,
in our bodies and in our,
you know,
the,
it's 300 pages of evidence.

668
00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:49.150
But essentially what we say is,
no,
we may have sex for the same reason men do.

669
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:51.400
It feels good.
And it's a way to bond with somebody.

670
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:55.140
It's not about getting something from the dude because when you actually look at

671
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:56.470
hunter gatherer societies,

672
00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:01.420
hunters go out of their way to make sure that nobody knows who killed the

673
00:39:01.421 --> 00:39:03.330
animals,
like the hunters will,
uh,

674
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.980
exchange arrows and stuff before they go hunting.

675
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:10.600
The guy who brings the animal back to the village often generally is not the one

676
00:39:10.601 --> 00:39:15.100
who killed it.
There are all these,
um,
very powerful,
uh,

677
00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:19.270
ways that societies make sure that nobody gets proud and nobody gets too much

678
00:39:19.271 --> 00:39:21.610
credit and everything's spread around evenly.

679
00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:24.700
It's fierce egalitarianism is what the scientists call it.

680
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.710
And it's not because they're,
they're,
you know,
a noble savages or some shit.

681
00:39:29.711 --> 00:39:33.550
It's because that's the best way to mitigate risk in a hunter gatherer society.

682
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.510
All right.
So like you go hunting today,
you hit,
you get a deer.
I didn't get one.

683
00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:40.420
I might not get one for a week.
Right.
But you're not going to get one everyday.

684
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:44.170
It's sporadic.
You come back,
you don't have any refrigeration anyway.

685
00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:47.740
So it's not like you could keep it all for yourself and your wife and your kids.

686
00:39:47.741 --> 00:39:51.970
Right.
And uh,
and it mitigates risks.
What everybody eats,
you know,

687
00:39:51.971 --> 00:39:53.650
whether you get it or I get it.
We all eat.

688
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.950
Plus we're all really highly independent,
interdependent.

689
00:39:56.951 --> 00:40:00.820
So the last thing we need is you and me fighting over who's a better hunter and

690
00:40:00.821 --> 00:40:01.571
you know,
who's fucking,

691
00:40:01.571 --> 00:40:04.870
whose wife and all this kind of bullshit cause that splits up the group.

692
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:10.260
So we are you in sex at dawn is the human sexuality was actually a way to bond

693
00:40:10.451 --> 00:40:13.390
the group together and people were having sex with different people

694
00:40:13.391 --> 00:40:16.120
simultaneously and raising children together.

695
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.820
And this obsession with paternity,

696
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.590
which is assumed to be part of our DNA,
is actually a response to agriculture,

697
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.600
which is just 10,000 years ago,

698
00:40:25.601 --> 00:40:28.930
which is like 5% or less of our existence as a species.

699
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.790
So is there a response to staying put,

700
00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:35.680
which allowed people to make much larger civilizations?
Yeah,
yeah.

701
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:39.460
In,
in a nutshell,
essentially it was when people stayed put,

702
00:40:39.461 --> 00:40:41.580
they could accumulate resources,
right?

703
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.510
Whether it's domesticated animals or land or buildings or wheat or whatever.

704
00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:51.670
And so once that happens,
then there's a completely different sense of property,

705
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:53.980
right?
Because in a hunter gatherer society,

706
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:56.110
there's very little property cause they're nomadic,

707
00:40:56.111 --> 00:40:59.940
so you don't want to carry shit around,
right.
And,
um,

708
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:04.990
whatever there is,
is shared.
And uh,
when you shift to agriculture,

709
00:41:04.991 --> 00:41:08.980
suddenly there's a lot of property and it's not shared.
It's,
it's hoarded,

710
00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:11.320
it's controlled by individual families or people.

711
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:15.550
So that's when paternity becomes a big deal because you've spent your life

712
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:19.510
accumulating all these resources.
You want them to go to your son's right.

713
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.640
And it's also interestingly,

714
00:41:21.641 --> 00:41:25.870
the first time that people really understood that sex caused babies.

715
00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:30.340
Because before that everybody's just having sex and women are having babies.

716
00:41:30.341 --> 00:41:33.710
There's no reason to think that sex is causing the babies.
Wow.

717
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.890
But then when you've got domesticated animals and you see like,
oh,
okay,

718
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:38.900
the black bowl,
fuck that white cow.

719
00:41:38.901 --> 00:41:42.650
And now we've got these black and white calves.
Oh right.
I get it.
Right.

720
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.500
So you start putting that together when you're living around a lot of

721
00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:47.270
domesticated animals and breeding.

722
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:51.170
And so that's when women became the property of men.

723
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.170
If you read the Old Testament says,

724
00:41:54.171 --> 00:41:57.380
thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife frame property.
Yeah.

725
00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.680
It's not about respecting his marriage,
read it in context,
nor his house,

726
00:42:00.681 --> 00:42:04.620
nor his ox,
nor his slaves.
Nor has she asked you in whatever she asks us.

727
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.961
So it's the,
you know,

728
00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:09.800
keep your hands off your neighbor's stuff and the wife is just part of his
stuff.

729
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:14.000
So that's radically different from the way men and women interacted in hunter

730
00:42:14.001 --> 00:42:18.860
gatherer societies where women had very high status equal to or sometimes higher

731
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:23.861
than men's because of the women's supplied a over half of the calories that

732
00:42:23.901 --> 00:42:27.470
people lived on.
Alright.
The gathering is what brought the food in every day.

733
00:42:27.471 --> 00:42:29.750
The hunting was an occasional bonus.

734
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.360
<v 0>So the women were involved in plants and harvesting fruits and vegetables and</v>

735
00:42:35.361 --> 00:42:38.100
things.
Small rodents.
Yeah.
So Maul Rodents,

736
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:41.280
ladies take care of the small rodents will go get the mail cook.

737
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.900
He can't handle anything too large.
So they,

738
00:42:44.901 --> 00:42:47.650
because of they brought in small rodents,
they were the kings,
that kind of thing.

739
00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:51.660
<v 5>Well they,
you know,
they were like,
mom,
you know,
they were there day in,
day out.</v>

740
00:42:51.661 --> 00:42:53.130
Dad's like,
hey,
you know,

741
00:42:53.131 --> 00:42:56.910
like occasional party dad brings home a deer or something.
But wow,

742
00:42:56.911 --> 00:43:00.030
that's interesting.
How do they know this?
For sure.
Well,

743
00:43:00.031 --> 00:43:02.220
you look at Wa which aspect?

744
00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:05.170
<v 0>Yeah,
the whole story and being,
you know,
having a,</v>

745
00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.260
<v 5>the higher status,
um,
matriarchal in that case,</v>

746
00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:13.010
primarily you're looking at anthropological research that's been done by people

747
00:43:13.011 --> 00:43:14.450
on hunter gatherers.
Right.

748
00:43:14.451 --> 00:43:18.320
There's still some hunter gathers in the world and in the sixties and seventies

749
00:43:18.321 --> 00:43:22.850
there were a lot more and a lot of people wrote their research on that.

750
00:43:22.851 --> 00:43:27.080
So there's a pretty sizable research on hunter gatherers and what you find is

751
00:43:27.081 --> 00:43:28.250
universalities.

752
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:33.290
So whether you're talking about in wits in Greenland or Australian aboriginal

753
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:35.870
people or Papa New Guinea or the Upper Amazon,

754
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:40.430
you find these similarity or or universalities among all the different groups.

755
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.620
So you say,
okay,
look,
if they're all,

756
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:45.680
if this is common to all of these groups from all over the world,

757
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:50.270
then it is a characteristic of hunter gatherer societies and we know our

758
00:43:50.271 --> 00:43:53.720
ancestors were hunter gatherers,
so therefore we can extrapolate.

759
00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:58.100
<v 0>Wow,
that's interesting.
So what about money?
How did that factor into it?</v>

760
00:43:58.101 --> 00:44:02.060
Because when you started not just accumulating material possessions but actually

761
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:06.500
start figuring out finances and figuring out money and the monitoring

762
00:44:06.501 --> 00:44:08.960
compensation for work and things along those lines,

763
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.200
like how did that factor into the male female relationship?

764
00:44:12.201 --> 00:44:14.870
Because men physically being stronger,

765
00:44:14.871 --> 00:44:18.620
we're able to do things being more aggressive or probably push here when it

766
00:44:18.621 --> 00:44:20.030
comes to acquiring that money.

767
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:24.350
And then they found themselves in an imbalanced position with the men have more

768
00:44:24.351 --> 00:44:25.670
financial worth and the woman.

769
00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:30.090
<v 5>Yeah,
and the women generally have zero financial worth.</v>

770
00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.430
It's not just that the manners,
you know,
slightly higher.
You look at women in,

771
00:44:34.431 --> 00:44:36.520
in societies like,
uh,

772
00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:39.670
early agricultural societies and the Middle East and you know,

773
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.580
as recounted in the Bible and so on.

774
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.590
A woman's only access to the things she needs,

775
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.800
food,
shelter,
status,
things like that.
It's through a man,

776
00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.740
it's through her father and then through her husband.

777
00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.790
<v 0>Well the Middle East,
they take it to the next level.</v>

778
00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:58.920
You can't even show your face cause you're the property of the man.

779
00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:00.610
He doesn't want that being shown.

780
00:45:00.611 --> 00:45:04.190
You're walking around the fucking tent over your head every day.
Some,

781
00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:08.380
I mean that's the biggest that like you want to talk about like the weak ass

782
00:45:08.381 --> 00:45:12.820
approach to life.
They can't drive like,
I mean,
in 2013,

783
00:45:12.821 --> 00:45:15.790
Saudi Arabian women are battling to drive.

784
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:20.380
They're risking their lives to drive just to fucking,
they won't let him drive.

785
00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:24.910
I mean,
it's like,
dude,
you guys gotta relax your grip.

786
00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.280
All you Saudi Arabian men,

787
00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:31.690
you're fucking yourself over like is no one taught you.
You know what,

788
00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:36.370
what having character is,
is no one taught you what being a bitches.
Like what,

789
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:41.110
what kind of a man wants to keep his wife from driving and wants her to wear a

790
00:45:41.111 --> 00:45:45.160
sleeping bag everywhere she goes,
let's you fucking ridiculous.

791
00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:49.300
The idea is ridiculous.
She can't show her face like this.

792
00:45:49.301 --> 00:45:53.620
He's got to go through life like she's a bank robber.
That's so fucking dumb.

793
00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:58.380
In 2013 the fact that that still exists.
I mean,
what is that an echo of what,

794
00:45:58.381 --> 00:46:01.140
what,
what caused all of that?
Cause the scarcity thing.

795
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:01.381
<v 5>Well,</v>

796
00:46:01.381 --> 00:46:06.381
I think it's an echo of these early days when women became the property of men.

797
00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:09.840
And,
and honestly,
you know,
uh,

798
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.290
with someone I was talking to recently,
uh,

799
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.340
just the tenor and American woman said in the 60s,
in the 60s,

800
00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:20.550
she couldn't open a bank account without her husband or father co-signing.

801
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:24.160
<v 0>The shoes are silly bitch,
she's going to go crazy with the money by person.</v>

802
00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.320
I don't think we have no money for baby formula.

803
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:30.930
<v 5>I don't think so.
Yeah.
I mean,
it's not that long ago that we were,</v>

804
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.520
we're still,
you know,
fucking women over in lots of ways.
But,
um,

805
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.370
as far as that,
you know,
the whole Middle Eastern thing,

806
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:42.750
I think that's a reflection of this notion that women are the property of men.

807
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.440
Now,
why were women the property of men?
Partly it's,
as you said,

808
00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.430
questions of upper body strength than the way men organized politically more

809
00:46:50.431 --> 00:46:54.780
effectively than women did.
And so men took control of a lot of stuff.

810
00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:59.760
Also the need for armies because agricultural societies expand,
you know?

811
00:46:59.761 --> 00:47:02.880
And that gets us into what we were saying earlier about corporations,
right?

812
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:08.090
That's when you get these institutions that were growth is a central

813
00:47:09.421 --> 00:47:12.120
characteristic of that institution.
You know,

814
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:15.690
I think it was Edward Abbey who said growth for its own sake is the ideology of

815
00:47:15.691 --> 00:47:19.080
the cancer cell.
It's also the ideology of corporations,

816
00:47:19.081 --> 00:47:22.950
of agricultural societies.
You know,
we talk about growth,
right?
Oh,
this,

817
00:47:22.951 --> 00:47:26.400
this year's growth rate is whatever,
you know,
everything's always got it.

818
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.280
<v 0>Hundred thousand new jobs introduced by the president.
Exactly right.</v>

819
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:31.210
<v 2>What we need to be,</v>

820
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.120
one of the things I'm talking about in this book I'm working on now,

821
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.470
it's called civilized to death.
Um,

822
00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:40.390
is the whole idea of progress stops making sense.

823
00:47:40.391 --> 00:47:43.480
If you're going in the wrong fucking direction,
if you go in the wrong way,

824
00:47:43.481 --> 00:47:47.410
the last thing you want is progress.
You went regress.
We don't want growth.

825
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:51.580
You know,
we gotta go,
we got a contract.
Get fewer people.

826
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:55.180
Yeah.
Using fewer,
you know,
fewer resources.

827
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.990
<v 0>I was a fascinating thing that transport Canada once said about a mushroom chip.</v>

828
00:47:58.991 --> 00:48:02.480
He asked a mushroom,
uh,
how could he possibly,
uh,

829
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:05.500
how could anyone possibly save the path that humans are on?

830
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.610
And they said very simply and very easily.
Each parent,
each,

831
00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:14.350
each couple should reproduce.
Once you know,
two people,

832
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:19.180
they have one kid,
everybody relaxes the whole,
the resources relax,
everything.

833
00:48:19.181 --> 00:48:21.610
Relax.
It's like there's plenty of fucking people.
Okay,

834
00:48:21.611 --> 00:48:24.790
there is zero worry that people are going to go extinct.

835
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.330
But then the problem is how do you go to those people,

836
00:48:28.331 --> 00:48:31.240
like those crazy people that were on that TV show that had 19 children,

837
00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:33.850
none of those people.
First of all,
what does she,

838
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.820
what does she in labor for like three seconds.
I mean what,
what

839
00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:42.850
does he actually have sex with her or does he just jerk off into the abyss?

840
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:48.310
Like how,
how,
how are those babies actually fertilized,
um,
that,

841
00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.560
that woman,
how could you tell that woman she can't do that?

842
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.030
I mean I think it's a freak show.
I think it's,
I think resources wise,

843
00:48:55.031 --> 00:48:56.740
like I have three kids.
It's hard.

844
00:48:56.770 --> 00:49:00.220
It's hard to give them all the time that they deserve.
You know,

845
00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:04.210
me and my wife have discussed that when it comes to the possibility of having

846
00:49:04.211 --> 00:49:04.721
more children.

847
00:49:04.721 --> 00:49:07.570
I said I think we should really concentrate on raising the ones we have.

848
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:11.050
Like their,
they're fun and it's great.
And I,
I,
they needed a lot of time,

849
00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.200
like children need a lot of time and I enjoy giving them that time.

850
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.600
But I think that if you have another kid around,

851
00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:21.460
everyone gets a little bit less time.
And I think in that getting less time,

852
00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:24.070
there's some benefits,
the independence aspect of it,

853
00:49:24.071 --> 00:49:25.810
as long as there's love and there's comfort.

854
00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:29.170
But I also think you can teach kids a lot of Shit,
you know?

855
00:49:29.171 --> 00:49:30.130
And you could teach them a lot,

856
00:49:30.131 --> 00:49:34.120
especially if you really are into it and you concentrate on it and you read a

857
00:49:34.121 --> 00:49:37.450
lot of books on it,
which I'm really involved in.

858
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:40.900
The idea of raising kids,
like I'm raising little human beings.

859
00:49:40.901 --> 00:49:44.500
So the conversations that I have with them are all geared towards that.

860
00:49:44.501 --> 00:49:48.850
Like it's geared towards enlightening them is to the world and it's sort of

861
00:49:48.851 --> 00:49:51.910
guiding them is how to,
how to treat people,
how to be nice to be.

862
00:49:51.911 --> 00:49:55.270
But it'd be nice to your sister or like be nice to [inaudible] Pete.
Don't,

863
00:49:55.271 --> 00:49:58.420
don't get angry at things for no reason.
Look at it this way instead of that way.

864
00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.830
And I think that kind of,
you know,

865
00:49:59.831 --> 00:50:03.280
you ain't gonna miss a lot of that when you have 1516 kids,
you're going to like,

866
00:50:03.281 --> 00:50:07.150
do you guys just shut the fuck up,
shut the fuck up.
Organize teams.
You,

867
00:50:07.151 --> 00:50:09.250
you're responsible for your little brother you're responsible for.

868
00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.540
And that's what those people did.

869
00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:12.760
Those people have like every kid has a chore and every kid,

870
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.430
that's how you're raised as zombies.
I mean these kids,

871
00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:17.950
they're not going to know what the fuck is going on in the world.

872
00:50:17.951 --> 00:50:21.580
Like they're going to need someone to help them every day is spent doing tasks

873
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:26.230
and,
and your life is basically religion,
homeschooling and these tasks.

874
00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:29.810
That's those kids.
That's the,
the 19 people.
What are they?
The Duggins?

875
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:33.890
Is that what they're called?
Yeah.
See if you will find that.
It's,
I mean,
look,

876
00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:36.230
I don't think you could tell those people not to do that.

877
00:50:36.231 --> 00:50:39.380
I think this is America,
but the Americans got it's faults.
But,

878
00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:40.751
<v 5>but the thing about it,</v>

879
00:50:40.751 --> 00:50:45.130
they only neutralize like eight gay couples neutralize when you want to.
I mean,

880
00:50:45.131 --> 00:50:49.020
like if it goes to 18 kids,
you average it out.
Like you got eight gay couples,

881
00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:51.460
it who don't have any kid.
And it's like,
or adoptive kid,

882
00:50:51.461 --> 00:50:54.400
which takes it out of the other pool.
And you're,
you know,

883
00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:58.120
mathematically you can have outliers like that because there are lots of people

884
00:50:58.121 --> 00:51:01.120
like me who don't have kids,
you know,
and just,
I mean,

885
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:06.250
I think the way to do it is to remove the stigma around not having kids and to

886
00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:11.480
encourage,
um,
w what Helen,
uh,

887
00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:15.850
Sarah Hrdy calls aloe parenting.
And this gets back to the hunter gatherer thing.

888
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:20.080
Um,
like kids are raised by everybody,
you know,
they say,
you know,
Oh,

889
00:51:20.081 --> 00:51:22.630
two parents are better than one.
Yeah,
that's true.
But you know what,

890
00:51:22.631 --> 00:51:25.960
five parents are better than to write.
It takes pressure off you,
right.

891
00:51:25.961 --> 00:51:29.110
Because you get frustrated,
you get tired,
you know,
their mother gets tired.

892
00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.750
And it also,
it's enriching for the adult.

893
00:51:31.751 --> 00:51:35.880
I love being around kids for a couple hours,
you know?
Right.
Yeah,
no,
I know.

894
00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:37.870
I can fully,
you know,
we

895
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:41.740
<v 0>had a party at my house,
the had day and uh,
there was uh,
a gang for Halloween.</v>

896
00:51:41.741 --> 00:51:45.170
There was a Halloween party and there was a gang of kids over and uh,

897
00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:48.160
it was fine.
It was fun talking to other people's little kids and you know,

898
00:51:48.161 --> 00:51:50.560
seeing how they're different and how they behave different.

899
00:51:50.561 --> 00:51:53.770
They have different ideas about stuff and you know,
it's nothing wrong with that.

900
00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:57.190
This is the,
the family,
the 19 folks that live at home together.

901
00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.090
Nice House stuff for 19 guy must be making some good bank,

902
00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:05.800
be paying for all those kids.
Maybe he just loves to fuck.

903
00:52:05.801 --> 00:52:08.650
It's all this religion and stuff.
It's just to keep them all around.

904
00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:11.530
Just love sending in

905
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:17.920
19 kids seems a little excessive.
But again,
I don't think weighs anal.

906
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:21.660
Not for really religious people.
I think it's in the Bible.
Oh really?

907
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:24.010
People pick and choose what they like about the Bible.

908
00:52:24.011 --> 00:52:25.540
That's why they get religious tattoos.

909
00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:30.430
Did you ever think that were you raised religiously?
Uh,
21,

910
00:52:30.431 --> 00:52:33.970
that's a family of 21.
And there's this new one called the Bates family.
Oh God.

911
00:52:33.971 --> 00:52:38.620
They're taking on the fucking Duggar's toxin a new,
they're still growing.

912
00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:42.220
Look at that creative fucking the left.
Uh,
yeah,
I was really Catholic.

913
00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:45.490
I went to Catholic school and uh,
I went only for one year,

914
00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:51.180
but luckily my mom and my dad split up when I was about five years old and it's

915
00:52:52.181 --> 00:52:57.100
like that old world,
New Jersey,
sort of Italian and Irish mix.

916
00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:57.730
There was,

917
00:52:57.730 --> 00:53:00.760
everyone was fucking Catholic and everyone went to Catholic school and,

918
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:04.870
but for me it was,
uh,
it was very enlightening.

919
00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:07.150
I gave up on religion when I was six years old.

920
00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:10.690
I gave up on religion in Catholic school.
I was like,

921
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:12.580
obviously this is not real.

922
00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:17.470
Like this is very obviously not by him is I was like,
if there's a god,

923
00:53:17.471 --> 00:53:19.270
and I wasn't saying that there was no god,
but I was like,

924
00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:21.610
this shit is just crazy people.

925
00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:25.470
This is just more crazy people that have figured out how to control a bunch of

926
00:53:25.471 --> 00:53:26.160
assholes and scare

927
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:26.993
<v 4>the shit out of him.</v>

928
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:31.290
I could see that as a six year old at this crazy lady who is teaching this class

929
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:34.470
was just as an evil demented woman,
a hateful,

930
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:38.700
horrible woman who had nothing to do with what everybody told me God was about.

931
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.490
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

932
00:53:41.491 --> 00:53:44.220
My parents were raised Catholic and that part of the country,

933
00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:48.750
and I saw a lot of that,
but I was thinking recently like,
uh,
you know,

934
00:53:48.751 --> 00:53:52.530
you're talking about anal sex and Christians and all that.
Uh,
I wonder if,

935
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:56.340
if we're sort of shooting ourselves in the foot,
those of us who are trying to,

936
00:53:56.341 --> 00:53:59.520
uh,
you know,
move away from shame and hang ups and stuff.

937
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:04.050
I wonder if the people with the shame actually have better sex is because it's

938
00:54:04.051 --> 00:54:05.940
intense.
No,
no.

939
00:54:05.941 --> 00:54:09.330
You don't think like a priest fucking and none out behind the church and the

940
00:54:09.331 --> 00:54:11.220
woods knowing God's watching.

941
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:14.850
You don't think that's like a really intense fuck.
No,

942
00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:18.770
because I think you're dealing with so much guilt that neutralizes hate.

943
00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:24.120
Useless fucking gross.
It's one of the worst feelings you can ever feel.
You know?

944
00:54:24.121 --> 00:54:26.190
I mean,
I think there's,
there's reasons for it.

945
00:54:26.191 --> 00:54:29.640
It's to guide your behavior in a way that you don't have any guilt,

946
00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:33.960
but it's also you can get fucked over and create associations very early on

947
00:54:33.961 --> 00:54:37.530
about things he really shouldn't be guilty about like masturbation,
right?

948
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:39.660
Like someone was telling me,
hey,
you know,
man,

949
00:54:39.661 --> 00:54:43.980
you should cover your camera on your laptop because there's a camera on the

950
00:54:43.981 --> 00:54:47.190
laptop and the fucking NSA spying on you.
And I'm like,
good.

951
00:54:47.191 --> 00:54:50.000
They'll catch me beaten off.
That's all you're going to get.
What am I?

952
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:52.320
I'm not doing anything bad.
I'm beaten off occasionally.

953
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:56.700
Am I supposed to be ashamed of that?
But for some people it is a shame.

954
00:54:56.730 --> 00:55:01.530
Like Mr. Ryan,
we have photographic evidence of you masturbating.
Like good.

955
00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:04.800
Release it.
Let the Internet see,
release the hounds.

956
00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:09.330
Let them know that I'm just like them.
This is just my dick.
Okay?
It hurts.

957
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:13.350
I gotta get rid of some stuff.
I've often thought like that would be a great,

958
00:55:13.351 --> 00:55:16.920
a political campaign.
Like the guy who,
who are the woman who became says,

959
00:55:16.921 --> 00:55:17.221
all right,

960
00:55:17.221 --> 00:55:20.150
I'm running for president and let's get this out on the table right here.

961
00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:24.800
All right.
I tripped a lot in college.
I've tried coke,
I've tried heroin,
you know,

962
00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:25.800
like I fucked whores.

963
00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:29.430
Like just get it all out there and see how the country responds to that,

964
00:55:29.431 --> 00:55:34.110
you know.
Well this guy from Toronto is essentially doing that.
Lord

965
00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:38.770
Rob,
what are you pulling up?
Brian?
Rob,
NSA.

966
00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:43.230
Spied on porn part of the plan to discuss this credit radicalizes yeah,

967
00:55:43.231 --> 00:55:46.540
like if you're in a tranny porn that they shouldn't take it seriously.
Sorry.

968
00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:47.820
We're not allowed to say training anymore.

969
00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:52.230
Trying to new transgender and warrant can't say training.
They get upset.

970
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.600
But cabbies you could still call cab drivers cavities.

971
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:56.940
So let's hang onto that while we can.

972
00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:01.140
Let's hang on to that before the fucking super sensitive police breaks that down

973
00:56:01.141 --> 00:56:03.800
to their cab PR professionals.

974
00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:09.260
They're not cabbies asshole.
You Sis gendered asshole.

975
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:11.060
I get so much of that stuff,
man.

976
00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:14.610
Of course you do a lot of disenfranchised people out there that want to blow

977
00:56:14.611 --> 00:56:18.420
horn and anybody who will be in earshot.
But it's so frustrating.

978
00:56:18.421 --> 00:56:21.930
I just had this today cause yesterday I released a podcast episode with the

979
00:56:21.931 --> 00:56:23.980
transgender person.
Yeah,
right.
Tell me about

980
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.850
<v 2>this wonderful person I met.
I met her at a party and I,</v>

981
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:32.850
at first I didn't realize she was transgender.
What's your dictates like coconut

982
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:38.060
now that you mentioned it?
Um,
but,
uh,
anyway,
I,

983
00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:40.250
so I released this thing and I get an email today from,

984
00:56:40.251 --> 00:56:43.960
from someone I know who's cool,
who's smart and,
and,
uh,
she's like,

985
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:46.510
she's a lesbian.
And she's like,
well,
you know,

986
00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:51.640
she was upset because the transgender person dresses like a convention,

987
00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:56.641
a woman and associates with this sort of conventional vision of womanhood.

988
00:56:57.850 --> 00:56:59.920
And so the lesbian is saying she's,

989
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:04.720
she's supporting a paradigm that makes me feel bad,
that makes me suffer.

990
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.390
That's hilarious.
Like,
Jesus Christ,

991
00:57:07.391 --> 00:57:09.670
the lesbians are fighting with the transgender people.

992
00:57:09.671 --> 00:57:13.990
No wonder nothing ever gets better.
Yeah.
I had the asshole stick together.

993
00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:17.050
<v 0>I had discussion with his radical feminist woman about,
um,</v>

994
00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:22.030
she w w the discussion originally started talking about transgenders and about

995
00:57:22.031 --> 00:57:26.890
how transgender man is a man to woman is a woman now.
And I'm like,
hmm,

996
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:30.460
okay,
that's interesting.
I'm like,
I'm more than willing to call them a woman.

997
00:57:30.461 --> 00:57:33.340
I'm more than willing to call them whatever new name they want or whatever they

998
00:57:33.341 --> 00:57:34.174
want to be called.
Sure.

999
00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:38.080
It's not my [inaudible] names to me or fucking ridiculous.
The,

1000
00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:41.950
I understand that we need them,
you know,
I can't be like,
ah,

1001
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:46.680
oh yeah,
I know all you about what I have to call you Chris.
Why do I have right.

1002
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:47.830
It's,
it's silly.

1003
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:50.010
<v 2>And they're coming out of the fucking Bible,
you know,</v>

1004
00:57:50.011 --> 00:57:54.150
Saint Christopher's Saint Joseph saying like,
you might as well,
they're random.

1005
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:57.760
A lot of them are random.
You might as well call us,
you know,
by numbers.
What

1006
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:58.620
<v 0>we were talking about,</v>

1007
00:57:58.621 --> 00:58:03.270
which was you got a really weird was we were talking about traditional roles and

1008
00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:07.230
um,
and things that women do that discredit other women.

1009
00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.890
And she was talking about makeup and high heels and I was like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,

1010
00:58:10.891 --> 00:58:12.180
whoa,
Whoa,
okay.

1011
00:58:12.181 --> 00:58:16.530
I know for a fact that if you see a transgender man wearing makeup and high

1012
00:58:16.531 --> 00:58:20.160
heels,
you don't have a problem with that at all to you.
And she's like,

1013
00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:23.340
you're right.
And I go,
what the fuck is that about?
I go,

1014
00:58:23.341 --> 00:58:27.030
if a guy is dressing up like a woman,
if he has a sex change,
becomes a woman.

1015
00:58:27.031 --> 00:58:28.080
You're like,
you go girl.

1016
00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:32.730
But if a woman wants to wear high heels and let her ass hanging out of a skirt,

1017
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:35.370
you think that there's something wrong with her.
Right?
I'm like,

1018
00:58:35.371 --> 00:58:38.250
that's ridiculous.
You're just closed minded.

1019
00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:42.990
You're just very rigid in what you expect from other people.
And Yeah,
for sure.

1020
00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:47.880
There's some women out there that put on a big show to get sexual attention,

1021
00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:51.330
much like a peacock male spreads his feathers.
I mean they're,

1022
00:58:51.331 --> 00:58:53.400
they're trying to get attention and it's effective.

1023
00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:56.010
I think a lot of the problem that people have with that,

1024
00:58:56.011 --> 00:59:00.150
that they don't want to admit is that it bothers them that people are attracted

1025
00:59:00.151 --> 00:59:03.390
to that.
It bothers them.
The people are not as attracted to them.
You know,

1026
00:59:03.391 --> 00:59:07.140
there's a lot of ugly women who are mad.
It pretty women.
I mean,
it's not fair.

1027
00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:11.100
Life is not fair.
And until they come up with some sort of a genetic remedy,

1028
00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:13.350
which I believe is within a hundred years,

1029
00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.020
they're going to be able to take you and turn you into whatever the fuck you

1030
00:59:16.021 --> 00:59:19.380
want.
If you want to be a unicorn,
if you want to be the hulk,
you know,

1031
00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:21.060
I think they're going to be able to do to your body,
whatever.

1032
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:25.130
I think there's going to be elasticity to our genetics and the design of the

1033
00:59:25.131 --> 00:59:29.120
human being will invariably be manipulated.
They're going to change it.

1034
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:31.640
So you're going to be able to look like a beautiful woman if you want to.

1035
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.260
And I think when that comes,
man,

1036
00:59:33.261 --> 00:59:35.150
it's going to be a weird time because first of all,

1037
00:59:35.151 --> 00:59:37.400
I was only going to be available to the elite at first.

1038
00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:41.160
There's going to be as glowing perfect specimens that everyone's going to want

1039
00:59:41.161 --> 00:59:44.830
to fuck.
No one's gonna want to fuck a regular person with a mole.
You know,
La,

1040
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.610
she's got a fucking weird teeth,
you know?

1041
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:49.130
And maybe they'll become exotic or they become exotic.

1042
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:51.560
Most likely not though it most likely to be like cell phones.

1043
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:54.830
Only rich people have met first.
And then within a few decades,

1044
00:59:54.831 --> 00:59:56.630
everyone's going to have them because it's going to get cheap.

1045
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:58.640
<v 5>So I don't wonder how weird it will be though,</v>

1046
00:59:58.641 --> 01:00:02.720
because I think we'll be trained for it by our avatars online,

1047
01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.080
so it will be accustomed to taking these other forms,
you know?

1048
01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:08.020
<v 0>Well,
there's that thing though.
I mean,</v>

1049
01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:11.690
this is the thing about competition and the thing about it,

1050
01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:16.700
it really does boil down to that people feel like if you're attractive,

1051
01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.760
you're taking something away from them,
right?
Like I,

1052
01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:23.770
I was at a wedding once and there was,

1053
01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.800
the bride at the wedding was furious because some other woman that one of the

1054
01:00:29.711 --> 01:00:33.970
guests had broughten was dressed really sexy.
And she had this band body.

1055
01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:39.070
And,
um,
the bride was fucking crying like that.

1056
01:00:39.071 --> 01:00:43.750
This was her big day.
And this fucking bitch came in and she's wearing this out.

1057
01:00:43.751 --> 01:00:45.670
And it wasn't,
it wasn't anything crazy.

1058
01:00:45.671 --> 01:00:49.030
It wasn't like she was wearing fishnets and a bra and it was like,
Kapow,

1059
01:00:49.031 --> 01:00:51.070
why get married?
Look at this shit.

1060
01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.710
This is what you're gonna hear the market fuck face.

1061
01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:57.010
And you're set it on for cold mashed potatoes,
you know,

1062
01:00:57.011 --> 01:00:58.390
and the woman was attractive as well.

1063
01:00:58.390 --> 01:01:01.390
The bride was attractive to was and they were clearly in love and it was,

1064
01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:03.160
it should have been a celebration and should have been joy.

1065
01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:08.050
And all she could think of was this bitch was upstaging her on her fucking day.

1066
01:01:08.051 --> 01:01:10.600
This bitch was,
why the fuck did he bring that bitch?
You know,

1067
01:01:10.601 --> 01:01:12.100
why the fuck did she dress that way?

1068
01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:15.430
And my wedding apparently like no one knew her.
She was a guest.

1069
01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.830
You know a friend of the guest.
Fuck.

1070
01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.520
You know that that competition thing is weird because people feel like you're

1071
01:01:21.521 --> 01:01:24.350
taking something from them.
If you have something,

1072
01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.040
like if you always wanted to play basketball but you're,
you know,

1073
01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:28.630
you're five foot eight and like me,

1074
01:01:28.631 --> 01:01:32.500
I'm five foot eight and I kind of wish I was as tall as that.
Mao Yang Guy,

1075
01:01:32.501 --> 01:01:36.580
whatever the fuck his name is.
He,
what's his name?
The big giant Chinese guy.

1076
01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:40.030
Y'All man,
whatever his name is Shaquille O'Neal.
Let's go with shack.

1077
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:44.110
I did fear factor with Shaq and I stood roughly Dick Height to him and it looked

1078
01:01:44.111 --> 01:01:48.210
like I was his child with his Dick Taste didn't taste bad,
taste bad.

1079
01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:52.840
It tastes like a basketball,
a little rubbery.
It only rubbery side,

1080
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:55.720
very dark.
Um,
you know,

1081
01:01:55.721 --> 01:01:59.350
it's like you can't get mad at chuck for being seven feet tall.
Okay.

1082
01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.000
If we want to play basketball,

1083
01:02:01.001 --> 01:02:04.030
you obviously that's not the hand of cards you're dealt my friend.

1084
01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:06.670
<v 5>Right?
And who gives a shit?
Because I mean,</v>

1085
01:02:06.671 --> 01:02:10.450
the assumption underlying all of these things is zero sum thinking,
right?

1086
01:02:10.451 --> 01:02:13.570
You know that you're familiar with that famine thinking,
right,
exactly.

1087
01:02:13.571 --> 01:02:16.990
In fam and thinking came onto the scene after agriculture,

1088
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:18.760
before agriculture hunter,

1089
01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.030
the way anthropologists describe it is there is an assumption of plentitude in

1090
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:28.770
hunter gatherer societies and in farming societies,
in every society since then,

1091
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:30.720
there's an assumption of scarcity.

1092
01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:35.220
It's a completely different way of looking at the world.
You also see it in,

1093
01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:38.220
we were talking about a religion.
You see it in agricultural societies.

1094
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:42.690
The gods are angry,
jealous,
temperamental,
perverse.

1095
01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:46.640
The gods in hunter gatherer societies on gods are giving,
they're,

1096
01:02:46.641 --> 01:02:50.670
they're not even giving there.
They're just like a source of richness.
Yeah,
right.

1097
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:54.690
It's a completely different way of looking at life.
The world,
each other.

1098
01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:55.524
It's amazing.

1099
01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:57.750
<v 4>But they never invented shit.</v>

1100
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.390
They invented sharper arrows and things along those lines.

1101
01:03:00.391 --> 01:03:03.600
There was no cell phones.
If we're all hunter gatherers,
there'd be no internet.

1102
01:03:03.601 --> 01:03:06.210
There'd be no podcast right now.
You wouldn't be wearing glasses.

1103
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:10.260
Shit would be weird.
You know,
it would be,
I probably wouldn't need glasses.

1104
01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.670
You'd be healthier.

1105
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:16.290
I think the glasses is chem trails making your chem trails in my eye,

1106
01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:19.860
it's the birth control pills in the water world.

1107
01:03:19.861 --> 01:03:24.270
Health Organization works for the new world order.
They,
um,
the,

1108
01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:26.760
the people that lived in these hunter gatherer societies though,

1109
01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:30.810
they were very happy.
I don't necessarily want to do what they do,

1110
01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:35.190
but they were very happy.
Well,
yeah.
I mean,
this is what this book's about.

1111
01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:38.550
Sex at dawn,
by the way.
If people are,
what's his fucking books?
Oh yeah.

1112
01:03:38.551 --> 01:03:40.970
Actually I was thinking of the other one.
The one I'm working on now,

1113
01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:41.430
the new book,

1114
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:46.430
it's called civilized to death and it's about the modern world in conflict with

1115
01:03:46.591 --> 01:03:51.090
our evolved nature,
but gets sex at dawn.
Now,
read that before the new book,

1116
01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.390
the new book,
and to come out about a year after I write it.

1117
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:58.110
You haven't even started,
dare you?
How dare you come in.

1118
01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.770
I mispronounced colostrum.
Fucking son of a bitch.

1119
01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.300
You son of a being busy.
I'm busy.
You are.
You are very busy thinking.

1120
01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:08.400
Got me into this podcasting shit.
You know,

1121
01:04:08.401 --> 01:04:13.050
I didn't even know what a podcast was when I met Dunkin.
Well,
you know,

1122
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:18.390
<v 5>it's fun.
I love it.
I wouldn't write books if I could do this for a living.</v>

1123
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.910
I would just hang out and talk to cool,
interesting people.

1124
01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.160
<v 4>It's a more effective way of distributing information to,</v>

1125
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:24.840
I'm amazed how many people listen.

1126
01:04:24.841 --> 01:04:27.930
We're getting like 15 20,000 downloads at this point.
That's a lot.

1127
01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:32.580
That's really good.
Not Rogan numbers,
but well,
whatever.
I mean,
we started out,

1128
01:04:32.581 --> 01:04:34.800
Brian and I,
we got like a hundred the first day we did it.
Yeah,

1129
01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:37.580
we got a hundred people watching on Ustream.
You know,

1130
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:40.980
you guys are doing the video from the get go.
Yeah.
We started doing a video.

1131
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.660
We're one of the few that doesn't,

1132
01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:46.590
we don't do any editing or our shows.

1133
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:50.980
They air warts and all.
They go out there and some people in the,

1134
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.700
originally the big knock was that that was very unprofessional that we should

1135
01:04:53.701 --> 01:04:55.870
edit it and,
but there's,

1136
01:04:56.130 --> 01:04:59.130
but there's a sort of a thrill to it that people know,

1137
01:04:59.131 --> 01:05:03.900
like these people appreciate the authenticity.
Yeah.
It's like you're,
you're here.

1138
01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.980
And also the conversations that we're having,
like this conversation with you,

1139
01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:12.870
you can,
you can not just acquire information much more easily than reading,

1140
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:17.830
but it also stimulates your desire to acquire new knowledge in a way that,

1141
01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:18.010
I don't

1142
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:22.060
<v 0>even know if reading does.
It's like you,
you get inspired by a variety.</v>

1143
01:05:22.061 --> 01:05:23.350
It's almost like a magazine.

1144
01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:27.190
You get inspired by a variety of different ideas and then you can go pursue

1145
01:05:27.191 --> 01:05:28.360
those ideas on your own.

1146
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:33.280
But they open up doors and doors to me to not just to the listeners,

1147
01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:36.340
they're like,
there's a lot of that.
Just having these conversations,

1148
01:05:36.341 --> 01:05:39.130
being able to sit down with a guy like you for three hours and just talk.

1149
01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.960
I mean how would we do that if we did that?

1150
01:05:40.961 --> 01:05:43.360
Normally if we decided to have dinner together we would be,

1151
01:05:43.361 --> 01:05:46.510
what are you going to eat?
Oh the the this,
this year is really good.

1152
01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:50.180
<v 2>Be with other people and they'd be having their thing and you know it's,</v>

1153
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:52.780
you're right.
It's extremely efficient.
I mean,

1154
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:55.510
my favorite thing about it is exactly what you said.

1155
01:05:55.511 --> 01:06:00.490
It gives me a reason to sit down for a while with someone who otherwise might

1156
01:06:00.491 --> 01:06:04.510
not be,
might not make time for me.
Right.
You know,
or half time.
You know,

1157
01:06:04.511 --> 01:06:06.580
they've got to think about their effectiveness.

1158
01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:10.180
<v 0>Well and also the committing to sitting down for like three hours because we're</v>

1159
01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:13.720
calling it a show.
The committing to just sitting here and doing this,
you know,

1160
01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:17.950
it's not like checking your phone or I'm going to what's on TV.
It was a,

1161
01:06:17.951 --> 01:06:20.980
when does this start?
This is a season of that in and you know,

1162
01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:23.590
look at this magazine,
a guy we'll fucking take who took this picture.

1163
01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:27.670
You know what I mean?
All that stuff.
Yeah.
It's like life is a distraction.

1164
01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.940
This is almost like,
yeah,
you got to lock yourself in.

1165
01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:34.780
Clink across the table in a weird way.
We would never really sit you.

1166
01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:38.440
We'd sit on a couch over there.
I'd be over here.
Which chatting know,

1167
01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.610
watching the fucking TV.

1168
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:44.200
Probably likely taking most of our time where there'd be music plan or
something.

1169
01:06:44.201 --> 01:06:46.540
They'd be something going on where you're,
you're,

1170
01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:49.450
you're adding to the distraction of life itself.

1171
01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:53.310
There's sun flowers feeding roses,
feeding you a big,

1172
01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:58.630
big fast food tray of roses.
Dick tasted like rose pedals.

1173
01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:03.730
Wonder what,
what some one of those Weirdo dream expert people would,

1174
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.000
how they would decipher that.
Like what would be their,
uh,
Google it.

1175
01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:08.850
There's a lot of dream dictionaries.
Oh,

1176
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:12.220
you remember Stanley Kripner he's a dream dream expert.
Yeah.

1177
01:07:12.221 --> 01:07:13.570
I don't know what he would say about that.

1178
01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:18.850
The man roses without the thorns.
Interesting.
It was just pedals.

1179
01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:24.340
Pedals maybe as a beers.
Cause I know the deer.
So did you,
did you bag one?

1180
01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.540
Yes.
Yeah,
it was at buck season does well,
it's both.
I,

1181
01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.230
it's kind of a sad story.
Oh,
it was fun season.
Oh No,
no,
no.

1182
01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:35.730
I didn't shoot one of those,
but I'm eating rose pedal dream interview.

1183
01:07:37.410 --> 01:07:41.210
<v 2>It's on my Islamic dream.
Oh my God.</v>

1184
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:46.470
My is launching.
Please shut.
Shut this off before we get G.

1185
01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.710
Exactly.
Yeah.
I had nothing to do with that.

1186
01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.060
<v 0>I shot a buck and wounded a doe.</v>

1187
01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:58.040
I dropped my rifle because I fell and apparently the scope was off on the rifle

1188
01:07:58.610 --> 01:08:01.970
and a,
the the animal got wounded and its leg and we had a followup,

1189
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.590
but we couldn't,
we couldn't find it.

1190
01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:07.700
We found a blood trail and we followed it for several hours the next day.

1191
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:11.750
Even looking for it,
we couldn't find the deer,
so he got wounded.
It was very,

1192
01:08:11.751 --> 01:08:16.550
very depressing,
very sad,
and it was like two extreme opposites.

1193
01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:20.900
The,
the buck I shot died instantly.
It was like I got,

1194
01:08:20.901 --> 01:08:25.901
I have a large caliber rifle and one of them in the Winchester 300 win mag 300

1195
01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:27.860
and the idea behind it was like,

1196
01:08:27.861 --> 01:08:31.880
I want to make sure that nothing gets wounded if I wanted it to be as painless,

1197
01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:35.580
as quick as possible.
I had my rifle cited the day before.

1198
01:08:35.581 --> 01:08:36.830
We went to a range of shot,

1199
01:08:36.831 --> 01:08:41.831
a gang around the shot 90 rounds before the day before we left and another 20

1200
01:08:41.961 --> 01:08:46.190
the day up.
And I've been practicing a lot.
So my accuracy is excellent.

1201
01:08:46.191 --> 01:08:49.570
I was ready to do.
And the idea behind it is very simple.

1202
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:54.650
I mean hunting is very thrilling thing.
What I want to do this year,

1203
01:08:54.651 --> 01:08:57.170
and this is in no judgment of anybody who's not doing it,

1204
01:08:57.171 --> 01:09:02.171
but I want to be able to know exactly where all my meat comes from and I want it

1205
01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:06.230
all to be wild meat.
I think it's better for you.
I think it's an ethical,

1206
01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:10.100
much more ethical way than factory farming,
certainly.

1207
01:09:10.101 --> 01:09:13.910
And even more than agriculture because that an animal is living it's life

1208
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.320
completely free and wild until the moment you pull that trigger.
And,
uh,

1209
01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:21.620
so my idea was to get all those ducks in a row,

1210
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:23.360
make sure that I'm shooting an animal,

1211
01:09:23.361 --> 01:09:26.150
that I'm definitely going to hit the crosshairs aligned,
lined up on it.

1212
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:28.760
Perfectly.
Fucking scope is off,

1213
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:32.480
scope is off and the animal got hit in the shoulder.
So I went,
um,

1214
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:35.420
I wasn't sure if that was what the case was or if I just miss,
you know,

1215
01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:40.190
there's so much adrenaline going on and it's so,
it's so depressing and so sad.

1216
01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.250
So I went to a range and a,
I went with a um,
uh,

1217
01:09:44.251 --> 01:09:46.240
a marksman two and a,

1218
01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:49.250
one of the guys we were with and knows how to cite rifles and he's like,
yeah,

1219
01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:52.910
this is off Zoloft quite a bit.
It was off by like six inches at a hundred yards,

1220
01:09:52.911 --> 01:09:55.780
which is quite a bit.
I mean when you fall,
you know,

1221
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:58.520
I was walking around the slippery hills,

1222
01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:03.760
snow everywhere and logs and at these big stupid moon boots I was wearing that

1223
01:10:04.101 --> 01:10:08.450
were,
um,
there were insulated boots that were good to like 40 below zero.

1224
01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:12.350
But you can't fucking walking them.
I mean,
they're enormous and stiff.
You could,

1225
01:10:12.351 --> 01:10:16.100
their ankles don't bend,
so you're like dining exactly.
Like ski boots.

1226
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.390
But they keep your feet warm.
But I fell and a huge,

1227
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:23.330
huge depressing moment.
Very,
very sad.
I mean,

1228
01:10:23.331 --> 01:10:27.440
it's like the animal will die and it's probably dead already.
And if not,

1229
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:28.700
the coyotes deleted anyway.

1230
01:10:28.701 --> 01:10:32.110
It's part of the cycle of life and they're trying to get rid of as many deers

1231
01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:36.350
they can up their,
they have a lot of deer and the deer damaging a lot of their,

1232
01:10:36.351 --> 01:10:39.920
they're trying to replant forests up there.
Deer eat all the saplings,

1233
01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.440
the leaves off the oak trees and things along those lines.

1234
01:10:42.441 --> 01:10:44.810
It killed people and auto accidents.
They do.

1235
01:10:44.811 --> 01:10:48.220
But I was obviously trying not to do that.
Yeah,

1236
01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:51.920
I was trying to make sure that it died instantly.
Like the first one,

1237
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:56.030
the buck I shot was dead within seconds.
It was boom vintage.

1238
01:10:56.031 --> 01:11:00.410
You have it cleaned.
No,
I did it.
I did it.
We got it.

1239
01:11:00.411 --> 01:11:03.680
It butchered it.
Everything.
Hung it up on a tree.
It took hours.

1240
01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:05.270
We did it in a garage.

1241
01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:09.540
We skinned it and the whole deal and it took hours to cut it down into porch.

1242
01:11:09.541 --> 01:11:12.350
But this is the way,
right way to do it.
The last time we did it,

1243
01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:16.650
we send it to butcher.
I have no idea if that was even my dear that I got back.

1244
01:11:16.651 --> 01:11:19.110
It tasted delicious.
It was awesome.
But I didn't see it.

1245
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.890
I didn't see the whole process.
And to me it's like I was missing a step.

1246
01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:26.990
<v 2>I wonder that when you get the ashes back from someone who's been cremated.
No.</v>

1247
01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:30.310
Really?
Oh,
how do I know it's in here?
You know,

1248
01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:35.220
stack of newspapers and cocaine and they just shit.
Yeah,
it's,
you know,

1249
01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.380
it's like they cut it,
they cut.
Your grandmother wouldn't let it go.

1250
01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:43.310
You might want to check out that book I mentioned earlier the Omnivore's
dilemma,

1251
01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:47.880
Michael Pollan.
Cause the,
the idea of that book was just,
he said,
uh,

1252
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:51.710
I want to make one meal where I know where everything came from.

1253
01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.270
<v 0>Yeah.
Well I'm doing that now.
I'm growing vegetables.</v>

1254
01:11:54.271 --> 01:11:55.960
I eat broccoli from my garden rose tonight.

1255
01:11:56.570 --> 01:12:00.870
I have a pretty serious garden now and it's getting bigger and have chickens
now.

1256
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.470
I,
I've,
uh,
14 chickens and I just ordered seven more getting seven.

1257
01:12:04.471 --> 01:12:07.260
Would you order them from a chicken factory?
I don't know.

1258
01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:10.850
<v 2>I'll show you.
You order them online,</v>

1259
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:15.650
<v 0>send them through the U s postal service.
Actually they get next day.
Yeah.</v>

1260
01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:16.240
And they're fine.

1261
01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.830
What did they call the red something reds with dealing with the breed is a gang

1262
01:12:20.831 --> 01:12:23.260
of different breeds.
We have a bunch of different types of chickens,

1263
01:12:23.261 --> 01:12:24.440
but so you're getting the eggs from there.

1264
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:28.540
I get fresh eggs every day from these chickens.
And then on top of that,

1265
01:12:28.541 --> 01:12:33.130
I'm getting vegetables from the garden and I'm trying to go by the end of 2014.

1266
01:12:33.131 --> 01:12:36.890
My goal is to be all game meat because I think if you're going to be a meat

1267
01:12:36.891 --> 01:12:39.760
eater,
and I've been a meat eater my whole life,
I want to be,

1268
01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:41.790
I want to know where the food comes from.
One,

1269
01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.100
I mean it's great if you can go to a farm that you know the guys taking care of

1270
01:12:45.101 --> 01:12:49.180
his cows,
like Doug during the guy who's a farm that I hunted on this weekend,

1271
01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:51.010
he has cows and he grabs,
feeds him.

1272
01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:53.860
He even gave me some of his meat that he got and I was happy to get that.

1273
01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:57.520
You know,
he gave me a couple of steaks.
You know exactly where that came from.

1274
01:12:57.521 --> 01:13:00.440
I know exactly what he feeds that.
He knows exactly what that cow's been through.

1275
01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:03.370
There's no hormones,
no bullshit.
It's just they're just cows eating grass.

1276
01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:06.350
This is what it's supposed to be,
but most of the time you're,

1277
01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:10.420
you don't know what that relationship is between the farmer or the butcher or

1278
01:13:10.421 --> 01:13:13.590
the,
and you can assume it's bad.
You can set certain real,

1279
01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:17.320
certainly if it's factory farm and also the fact that most of the state that

1280
01:13:17.321 --> 01:13:21.670
we're getting is fed grain and those animals are not supposed to be in corn and

1281
01:13:21.671 --> 01:13:21.940
anybody.

1282
01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.810
Then the fucking ass he of one of the reasons being is because their body

1283
01:13:25.811 --> 01:13:27.500
doesn't process Cornwell.
Right.

1284
01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:31.750
So they get all these abscesses and all these issues with their stomachs.
Yeah.

1285
01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:36.400
Look,
you know it,
again,
I'm not trying to judge I.
Dot.

1286
01:13:36.401 --> 01:13:39.070
I'm not saying go out and do what I'm doing,

1287
01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:43.000
but I think knowing what I know about the whole process,

1288
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:46.810
seeing documentaries like food inc and it just,
no,
knowing what I know about,

1289
01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:50.270
I don't want to do that.
I I W if I'm going to,
I'm not,

1290
01:13:50.271 --> 01:13:51.430
I don't want to be a vegetarian,

1291
01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:56.670
but if I had a choice between being a vegetarian and keeping the factory farm

1292
01:13:57.221 --> 01:14:00.010
system in place the way it is,
I probably go with being a vegetarian.

1293
01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:04.300
I would just eat eggs.
I would just eat eggs and vegetables and you know,

1294
01:14:04.330 --> 01:14:07.260
and things along those lines.
But I like meat and I,

1295
01:14:07.261 --> 01:14:11.500
I think there's benefits.
I think there's a lot of health benefits.
Me.

1296
01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:15.640
I really do.
I find it delicious and I've always said this,

1297
01:14:15.641 --> 01:14:17.980
but it's not like those animals are going to live forever and become magic.

1298
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:21.040
I mean they,
they have a short lifespan dear.

1299
01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:25.060
If Deere is lucky as fuck,
they hit five years old,

1300
01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:29.390
they have to be lucky as fuck to not get eaten by a predator.

1301
01:14:29.391 --> 01:14:34.270
He hit by a car shot by a hunter and especially or froze to death,

1302
01:14:34.271 --> 01:14:38.110
which is the big issue with you,
especially in non farm lands.

1303
01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.800
Seeing the place where we were at these dear fat as fuck because they're grazing

1304
01:14:41.801 --> 01:14:45.310
on crops.
They're eating Alfalfa,
they're eating on these,
uh,

1305
01:14:45.311 --> 01:14:50.311
a lot of these places they actually grow food plots just for deer because deer

1306
01:14:50.591 --> 01:14:55.180
hunting first of all,
the opening day is fucking crazy.
We were out there,

1307
01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:56.710
it was like five 30 in the morning.

1308
01:14:56.711 --> 01:14:58.660
We were out there and an hour before it got light.

1309
01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.490
And you hear as soon as the sun starts cracking you here.

1310
01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:04.930
Yeah.
It's awesome.

1311
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:09.690
It's like you're at a war zone dear day in Pennsylvania as a school holiday.
Yup.

1312
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:13.870
Yup,
Yup.
I remember seeing people driving home from hunting with like a dead deer

1313
01:15:13.871 --> 01:15:17.620
strapped to their pinto.
Yup.
Yup.
Yeah,
yeah.

1314
01:15:17.621 --> 01:15:21.550
You gotta be careful first day of deer season unless you did a dogs and cows get

1315
01:15:21.551 --> 01:15:26.470
shot and panthers.
Yeah.
So when you were in like a Oh yeah.
Cammo yeah,
no,
no,
no.

1316
01:15:26.471 --> 01:15:28.310
Orange.
Just orange,
orange vests.

1317
01:15:28.311 --> 01:15:32.890
We were in a blind sitting there at zero degrees outside the tree.
No,
no,
no.

1318
01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:36.490
One time I went up in the tree,
but uh,
it was for a short amount of time.

1319
01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:38.470
I only hunted up in a tree for about an hour.

1320
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:42.310
Most of the time was in a blind that was on the ground.
It was,

1321
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:45.460
it's intense because it's nothing,
nothing,
nothing.
You're waiting,

1322
01:15:45.461 --> 01:15:48.210
you're freezing.
I mean,
fucking freezing.
It's one,

1323
01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:49.810
it's fine if you're walking around,

1324
01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.880
if you're well insulated and you're walking around,

1325
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:55.630
it's actually kind of pleasant because you feel warm because your clothes are

1326
01:15:55.631 --> 01:15:58.090
good.
You're wearing wool and down and all these different things.

1327
01:15:58.210 --> 01:16:01.660
But when you just sit down,
nothing fucking keeps you warm.
You have to,

1328
01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.010
you have to tense your body.

1329
01:16:03.011 --> 01:16:06.970
And release and tense your body of these chemical bags.
That's how those help,

1330
01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:10.480
they keep your feet warm.
I didn't figure out those until the second day.

1331
01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.640
They made a big difference and you put them in your gloves,

1332
01:16:12.641 --> 01:16:15.940
you hold onto these little bags and they help,
but your face is still fallen off.

1333
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:18.220
You're still sitting there freezing your dick off.

1334
01:16:18.221 --> 01:16:22.480
Who knows will not stop running.
But it's quiet,
quiet,
quiet,
nothing,
nothing,

1335
01:16:22.481 --> 01:16:27.250
nothing.
And then he hears you get a snap and you look up like,
oh shit.
Oh shit,

1336
01:16:27.251 --> 01:16:30.610
there's a deer.
Yeah,
it was pretty exciting.
It's very exciting.

1337
01:16:30.611 --> 01:16:33.130
We had decide whether or not the deer was big enough for me to shoot because

1338
01:16:33.131 --> 01:16:36.850
this guy is trying to raise large deer on his property.

1339
01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:40.780
But since they're trying to get rid of as many as possible right now because

1340
01:16:40.781 --> 01:16:41.780
they're growing there,

1341
01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:44.140
he kind of gave us the green light to shoot a younger deer.

1342
01:16:44.170 --> 01:16:47.170
So there was only like two years old.
They liked him to grow like five years.

1343
01:16:47.171 --> 01:16:49.990
They get these big crazy antlers.
Right.
But,
um,
you know,

1344
01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:53.020
there are big antlers are cool,
but I was doing it for me.

1345
01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.060
Like that's what I want to do it for.
From now on.

1346
01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:59.260
I want to just try to do that every few months and bring back,
you know,

1347
01:16:59.261 --> 01:17:01.660
a hundred pounds of meat or what that shoot an elk,
you know,

1348
01:17:01.661 --> 01:17:06.520
shoot a large animal and just try to live off wild animals.
You know,

1349
01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:10.130
my,
my wife's from Africa,
from Mozambique,
I'm leaving

1350
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:13.700
<v 5>in two days.
We're going to Mozambique,
first time ever for me to be in Africa.</v>

1351
01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:18.690
Well,
um,
but uh,
one time we were,
she was raised in a rural,
uh,

1352
01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:22.910
her grandmother's house was in a village African village and she spent weekends

1353
01:17:22.911 --> 01:17:25.970
out there all the time.
So anyway,
one day we're in Amsterdam,

1354
01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:29.990
we're sending in Amsterdam.
It's a beautiful spring day by a canal.
And you know,

1355
01:17:29.991 --> 01:17:34.550
these little ducks go by and she's looking at these ducks like really staring at

1356
01:17:34.551 --> 01:17:37.790
these ducks and it's got a weird look on her face.
I said,
what are you thinking?

1357
01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:41.420
She said,
oh,
I was just thinking how much I'd love to kill that duck.

1358
01:17:41.421 --> 01:17:45.870
And rip its guts out and stuff it with garlic and herbs and rosemary living me,

1359
01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:49.370
my grandmother,
and like my wife grew up like,
you know,

1360
01:17:50.050 --> 01:17:53.210
ringing next of chickens and ducks and geese and you know,

1361
01:17:53.211 --> 01:17:56.690
like it's no big deal for her.
You know?
It's like whatever.
That's what you do.

1362
01:17:56.691 --> 01:17:57.710
She thinks we're silly.

1363
01:17:57.711 --> 01:18:01.610
Americans are ridiculous with our disconnect from where things came from.

1364
01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.310
<v 0>Well,
this is this woman that I know who's raising her son to be a Vegan.</v>

1365
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:09.900
She wears a leather jacket.
It's got leather shoes on and she eats meat.
Oh,

1366
01:18:09.901 --> 01:18:14.130
but he's got to be kid to be a Vegan kids.
Fucking three.
Yeah.

1367
01:18:15.210 --> 01:18:18.230
Somebody needs to call child protective services.
You mean?

1368
01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.700
I don't know what kind of be 12 they're given the kid and then maybe,

1369
01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.200
hopefully they're given a B12.

1370
01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:25.980
They say a lot of people that they get their beat 12 from actually from insects,

1371
01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:29.670
from just the amount of insects that you eat and inadvertently or mixed into

1372
01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:33.620
your,
yeah,
it makes any vegetables or on that Burger won't be 12 every day.

1373
01:18:33.690 --> 01:18:36.420
A couple of weeks ago.
It's such a great energy boost.
Fuck.
Yeah,

1374
01:18:36.421 --> 01:18:38.880
it's great for your body to,
you know,
a trim tech sport.

1375
01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:42.780
One of its big ingredients besides the quadriceps mushroom is B12 fantastic for

1376
01:18:42.781 --> 01:18:44.310
endurance.
I mean they used to give it to us,
uh,

1377
01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:48.760
intro muscularly when we were wrestling,
if,
uh,
like,
uh,

1378
01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:51.020
someone was feeling tired or down,
they shoot you,

1379
01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:53.670
give you a shot at B12 cause a lot of gags were drained.

1380
01:18:53.671 --> 01:18:58.070
It's fuck from losing weight and uh,
the pilots use that.

1381
01:18:58.510 --> 01:19:01.410
Yeah.
A lot of people,
the best way is the shot.

1382
01:19:02.130 --> 01:19:04.180
There's sublingual.
Um,

1383
01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:07.890
there's actually a good company that makes a spray that you use sublingually

1384
01:19:07.930 --> 01:19:08.731
that works pretty good,

1385
01:19:08.731 --> 01:19:13.500
but nothing beats the old injector oni be 12 right into your system.

1386
01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:19.350
Yeah,
that's a big issue with vegans not getting B12 because primarily I think it

1387
01:19:19.351 --> 01:19:23.000
comes from animals,
but they've,
um,
they actually,
um,

1388
01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:28.130
brought this vegan couple two trial for manslaughter or murder or whatever it

1389
01:19:28.861 --> 01:19:32.850
was because their child died from malnutrition because the kid wasn't getting

1390
01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:33.684
enough.
B 12,

1391
01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:36.810
that baby died because they didn't give it the proper vitamins because they

1392
01:19:36.811 --> 01:19:40.800
insisted on a vegan diet.
So and not harming animals.
They harm their child,

1393
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:46.350
you know,
life eats life.
And that's a real issue.
Factory farmings eval.

1394
01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.330
I agree.
I'm with you.
I think,
you know,

1395
01:19:48.331 --> 01:19:50.490
it goes along with the same thing that we were talking about earlier with

1396
01:19:50.491 --> 01:19:55.491
corporations being that we lost are we lost the script and humanity is not

1397
01:19:56.521 --> 01:19:57.930
favored over finances,

1398
01:19:57.931 --> 01:20:02.220
over ones and Zeros and humanity should be favored above all else.
It should be

1399
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:05.200
<v 5>important.
Sessions should be serving us.
Yes.</v>

1400
01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.340
How did we end up serving the corporate?
They are us

1401
01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:12.780
<v 0>and they are,
because there's,
it's a,
because it's a game because it's a,
you know,</v>

1402
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:14.010
uh,
acumen of game,

1403
01:20:14.011 --> 01:20:18.000
you could figure out how to acquire more and there's clear benefits to being,

1404
01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:18.421
you know,

1405
01:20:18.421 --> 01:20:21.300
the guy who has the giant mansion who gets driven around in a Rolls Royce,

1406
01:20:21.301 --> 01:20:23.100
like you know,
there's,
he's got a g five,

1407
01:20:23.101 --> 01:20:27.510
he flies his own jet because all those benefits and being that ruthless fuckhead

1408
01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.160
<v 5>but you know,
the,
the,</v>

1409
01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:32.040
I mean maybe I'm going to sound like one of these vegans here,

1410
01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:37.041
but I've known a lot of these guys with the yachts and the mansions and they're

1411
01:20:37.561 --> 01:20:41.910
not really happier.
They're not actually happier.
In fact,

1412
01:20:41.911 --> 01:20:44.910
a lot of them are much less happy than,
than,
uh,

1413
01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:48.960
certainly then people suppose cause when you get that much shit then your life

1414
01:20:48.961 --> 01:20:52.470
becomes about your shit.
Yeah.
You got,
you got that much money,

1415
01:20:52.471 --> 01:20:53.850
where are you going to invest it?
You know,

1416
01:20:53.851 --> 01:20:57.230
people are always trying to get it from you that,
you know,

1417
01:20:57.270 --> 01:21:00.160
what does it freedoms another word for nothing left to lose.
Right.

1418
01:21:00.161 --> 01:21:01.350
And that's a different kind of freedom.

1419
01:21:01.351 --> 01:21:06.240
But I think there's a middle path and I think we make a mistake by assuming that

1420
01:21:06.241 --> 01:21:09.750
people are necessarily going to be happier when they get more.

1421
01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:11.590
<v 0>No,
money is one.</v>

1422
01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:16.620
There's a broad range of needs that a human has.

1423
01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:20.200
And in this society you need a little money cause he need to be able to figure

1424
01:21:20.201 --> 01:21:22.630
out how to pay for food and shelter.
And Yeah,

1425
01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:25.590
<v 5>the studies do show that happiness goes up,
uh,</v>

1426
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:30.510
from like seven grand a year to 40 grand a year and then after 40 grand a year

1427
01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:31.380
at tapers off.

1428
01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:35.240
<v 0>Hmm.
Yeah.
I was saying once your needs are met,
once your needs are met,</v>

1429
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:38.690
that's not everything after that is not about happiness.

1430
01:21:38.691 --> 01:21:42.140
Like I was explaining this to a friend of mine that,
uh,

1431
01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:46.100
one of the big things that happened to me when I started doing well and started

1432
01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:49.130
making enough money.
I mean,
it was not rich by any stretch of the imagination.

1433
01:21:49.131 --> 01:21:54.110
But when I first started doing well as a comedian was that I didn't feel worried

1434
01:21:54.111 --> 01:21:57.770
anymore about where my bills are getting paid because every month was like a

1435
01:21:57.771 --> 01:22:02.771
fucking terrifying struggle to pay for food and pay for gas.

1436
01:22:03.381 --> 01:22:05.870
And it was always like barely under the wire.

1437
01:22:05.871 --> 01:22:08.990
I'm paying my rent three days late every month.
It was cause I didn't have it,

1438
01:22:08.991 --> 01:22:12.440
you know,
it was just,
it was always like that.
And once that was alleviated,

1439
01:22:12.441 --> 01:22:13.970
it was a huge pressure release.

1440
01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.990
That's what makes you happy when you can go to a restaurant and not worry about

1441
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:20.660
what you order,
you know,
that makes you happy.

1442
01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:23.240
Everything after that you get used to,

1443
01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:26.220
you get used to a big house just as nice to have a small house you need.

1444
01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:29.510
Sometimes it helps.
Smiles is better,
it's cozier,
everybody's connected,

1445
01:22:29.511 --> 01:22:30.470
they're all just,
you know,

1446
01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:33.970
<v 5>that's the thing that the greatest predictor of happiness,</v>

1447
01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:38.200
once you get past that level of subsistence or you know,
you can take a vacation.

1448
01:22:38.201 --> 01:22:40.180
You're not worried about paying your bills and all that.

1449
01:22:40.630 --> 01:22:43.120
The greatest predictor of happiness is community,

1450
01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:47.590
is sense of community interconnection with other people.
And the,
the,
you know,

1451
01:22:47.591 --> 01:22:49.190
shooting ourselves in the foot with the,

1452
01:22:49.191 --> 01:22:53.470
the wealth is that one of the things that happens with wealth is that we become

1453
01:22:53.471 --> 01:22:57.000
isolated and insulated from other people.
You know?

1454
01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:01.990
And what's the difference between comfort and numbness?
You know,
it,
I mean,

1455
01:23:01.991 --> 01:23:06.430
I used to travel backpack all over the world and I'd meet somebody and they'd be

1456
01:23:06.431 --> 01:23:10.090
like,
hi,
you don't know man,
you gotta you gotta come with me on my private jet.

1457
01:23:10.091 --> 01:23:13.810
You know,
we stay at the five star hotels and those people didn't see anything.

1458
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.920
Yeah.
You know,
the five star hotels are the same wherever you go,
you know,

1459
01:23:17.921 --> 01:23:20.230
like it's different beach out front.
But that's it.

1460
01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:25.090
You're not really meeting any of the local people,
whatever.
I mean,
yeah,
whatever.

1461
01:23:25.091 --> 01:23:29.650
You know what I'm talking about?
It's,
there's an isolation that comes with money.

1462
01:23:29.651 --> 01:23:31.270
And I'm not just talking about wealthy people,

1463
01:23:31.271 --> 01:23:34.000
I'm talking on a social level as well.
We're much more,

1464
01:23:34.001 --> 01:23:39.001
Americans are much more isolated socially than Indians or Cubans are Brazilians

1465
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:43.330
of lower classes.
You know,
it's,
there's a,

1466
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:45.520
we pay for the money is what I'm saying.

1467
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:49.090
<v 0>Yeah,
I,
I see that.
I mean,
it makes sense.</v>

1468
01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:54.040
And I think that society as a whole gets really weird when you have cities to,

1469
01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.020
you know,
Jim Norton,
who's a good buddy of mine,

1470
01:23:56.050 --> 01:24:00.520
lives in an apartment in New York City and he lives in a building with probably

1471
01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:03.130
a thousand people.
I mean,
I don't know how many people live in the building.
I go,

1472
01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.060
who do you know and that building and he's alert.
He goes,
I don't know anybody.

1473
01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:09.040
He goes,
I say hi to my neighbor every now and then.

1474
01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:11.740
I've seen him a couple of times.
He goes,
but I don't know anybody.

1475
01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:16.890
So it's even more crazy because unlike a community like your house is next to

1476
01:24:17.351 --> 01:24:19.780
your neighbor's house and you see them all in the law,
he say,
hi.

1477
01:24:19.781 --> 01:24:21.940
So what do you do?
I'm a printer.
Oh cool.

1478
01:24:21.941 --> 01:24:24.790
I write books and you have a little chitchat.
Well,
hey,
if you ever need anything,

1479
01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:26.770
I'm next door that doesn't even go on.

1480
01:24:26.771 --> 01:24:30.970
And there's a thousand people living in a box stacked on top of each other,

1481
01:24:30.971 --> 01:24:35.200
and that is the norm instead of the village.

1482
01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:39.400
Like one of the things that I've found really fascinating about your book was a

1483
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.353
sex at dawn,

1484
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:45.510
was the way you describe the interconnectedness of these small societies that

1485
01:24:46.121 --> 01:24:49.180
the idea of promiscuity that we have today,

1486
01:24:49.810 --> 01:24:51.760
that's our idea of it,

1487
01:24:51.761 --> 01:24:55.930
is someone going to a bar and picking up a stranger told around stranger and

1488
01:24:55.931 --> 01:24:57.670
having sex with someone all willy nilly and crazy.

1489
01:24:57.671 --> 01:25:02.650
Like that's not what promiscuity originated as it originated as just having sex

1490
01:25:02.651 --> 01:25:06.310
with a bunch of different people that were also in the tribe and it was the
norm.

1491
01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:10.750
<v 5>And you knew them.
Yeah.
Like you've known them for years.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
exactly.</v>

1492
01:25:10.751 --> 01:25:15.130
So we tried to make a big point of that so that people wouldn't get confused by

1493
01:25:15.131 --> 01:25:18.070
it,
by our use of the word promiscuity.
Cause as you say,

1494
01:25:18.071 --> 01:25:21.280
it means it means now screwing a stranger.

1495
01:25:21.281 --> 01:25:25.090
And people don't recognize that in prehistory there really weren't any
strangers.

1496
01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:27.730
Yeah.
You know,
so you're talking about that,

1497
01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.280
that apartment building and how nobody knows each other.

1498
01:25:30.281 --> 01:25:34.420
It reminds me of a book I just read recently researching this other one called

1499
01:25:34.421 --> 01:25:37.690
paradise built in hell.
And it's,
uh,
it's,
uh,

1500
01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:42.670
studies of the way people react to disasters,
you know,

1501
01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:46.600
and uh,
contemporary mainstream economic theory,
which,

1502
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:50.020
which is sort of based on the idea that we're all selfish and trying,
you know,

1503
01:25:50.021 --> 01:25:53.140
self optimizers,
always looking for advantage for ourselves.

1504
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:57.540
That's sort of like built into economic theory would predict that in,

1505
01:25:57.541 --> 01:26:01.000
in disasters that people would be even more like that.
You know,
they'd,

1506
01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.920
they'd be even more protective of resources.

1507
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:09.340
<v 2>Whereas what actually happens is that in disasters people start helping each</v>

1508
01:26:09.741 --> 01:26:12.560
other strangers,
you know,
like those people in that building,

1509
01:26:12.561 --> 01:26:15.020
that's when they'll meet each other when there's an earthquake.
Right,
right.

1510
01:26:15.021 --> 01:26:18.350
And like,
Holy Shit,
did you feel that?
Or,
you know,
twin towers,

1511
01:26:18.351 --> 01:26:19.880
people were so happy after that.

1512
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:24.470
And I think that's also why people enjoy,

1513
01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:26.780
I'm not sure enjoys the right word,
but,
um,

1514
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:31.340
you ever heard of Sebastian younger?
Yes.
His book war.

1515
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:33.150
I saw him being interviewed about it.

1516
01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:35.600
<v 0>He's a CNN correspondent,
is that what it is?</v>

1517
01:26:35.710 --> 01:26:36.543
<v 2>Well,
he's,</v>

1518
01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:41.660
he's a war correspondent and he was embedded with a marine platoon in the

1519
01:26:42.221 --> 01:26:46.360
Korengal valley for like six months in Afghanistan.
And this was like,

1520
01:26:46.630 --> 01:26:50.170
they were at the tip of the spear right where they were getting attacked every

1521
01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:50.200
day.

1522
01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:55.120
Cause they were like in this point in a valley where the Taliban were above them

1523
01:26:55.121 --> 01:26:58.630
on the mountains shooting down into their babies.
It was just a horrible thing.

1524
01:26:59.050 --> 01:27:02.470
So he was there and uh,
for six months,
I think,

1525
01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:07.090
and he was being interviewed about the book,
it's called war.
And he said,
uh,

1526
01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:11.050
they said to him,
well,
why did these guys do that?
You know,
I mean,

1527
01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:12.940
they don't care about geopolitics.

1528
01:27:12.941 --> 01:27:17.350
They're not thinking about oil pipelines and Chinese expansion,
you know,

1529
01:27:17.351 --> 01:27:21.580
whatever the,
the guys in the Pentagon or thinking of,
why the hell do they do it?

1530
01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:26.820
And his answer was love,
right?
That's what makes these guys go to war,

1531
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:31.450
love for each other.
That they have a sense of community when you're under fire,

1532
01:27:31.451 --> 01:27:34.960
right?
Like we talked about it disaster in New York or an earthquake or whatever.

1533
01:27:35.410 --> 01:27:39.250
But imagine like every damn day as an earthquake and you're with the same dudes

1534
01:27:39.251 --> 01:27:42.460
every day and you're depending on each other constantly.

1535
01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:47.760
It creates deep bonds of love that people really miss when they're gone.

1536
01:27:48.670 --> 01:27:50.850
And I think those are the bonds our ancestors had.

1537
01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:53.910
<v 0>Yeah.
There's an intensity to life in those circumstances</v>

1538
01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:57.120
<v 2>and an immediacy.
Yeah.
You know,
because any day,</v>

1539
01:27:57.121 --> 01:27:58.860
and you were out hunting when you fell,

1540
01:27:58.861 --> 01:28:01.200
that gun could have gone off and you could be dead now.
No,

1541
01:28:01.201 --> 01:28:04.310
I didn't have bullets in the chamber.
I'm not retired.
Okay,
well it's a,
I mean,

1542
01:28:04.311 --> 01:28:05.280
illustrating a point,

1543
01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:08.880
a hunter gatherers out with his fucking poison tipped arrows.

1544
01:28:08.881 --> 01:28:13.860
If he trips and break your neck or a leopard can kill you or a snake can get you

1545
01:28:13.861 --> 01:28:18.540
or you know,
whatever you can.
The immediacy of death is,
I think something,

1546
01:28:18.541 --> 01:28:23.060
it's a tonic.
It makes life
immediately.

1547
01:28:23.170 --> 01:28:26.650
<v 0>So you think that maybe that's one of the reasons why people feel so unfulfilled</v>

1548
01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:30.130
is that they're not experiencing highs and lows,
that just experiencing a drone,

1549
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:33.670
like a daily drone of traffic and a job that's mundane.

1550
01:28:33.730 --> 01:28:36.390
And is that what causes all this depression?
Yeah.

1551
01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:38.810
<v 2>Yeah.
I think so.
In suicides and you know,</v>

1552
01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:43.530
all sorts of horrible,
uh,
results of,

1553
01:28:43.531 --> 01:28:48.420
this is what I said earlier.
What's the difference between comfort and numbness?

1554
01:28:49.050 --> 01:28:53.040
Right.
Comfort is thinking about what we associated with comfort pillows,

1555
01:28:53.041 --> 01:28:56.940
blankets,
sleeping bags,
jackets,
cushions,

1556
01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:00.060
things that stop us from feeling right.

1557
01:29:00.061 --> 01:29:04.620
That's what comfort is a lack of feeling in maybe a lack of negative feeling.

1558
01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.840
But if you blog negative feeling,

1559
01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:09.660
you're also blocking positive feeling antidepressants.

1560
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:13.020
They don't just make you stop being depressed.
They make you stop feeling,

1561
01:29:13.530 --> 01:29:15.090
they take the highs and the lows.

1562
01:29:15.290 --> 01:29:18.200
<v 0>They take numbness there making that create numbness.
Exactly.
Yeah.</v>

1563
01:29:18.201 --> 01:29:21.200
There's a lot of people that I've talked to that have had them and then gotten

1564
01:29:21.201 --> 01:29:23.430
off of them,
they'd be like,
it's just like last time.

1565
01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:26.540
It's like there was that year meant nothing.

1566
01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:30.590
There was like there was missing time that year was just a series of things that

1567
01:29:30.591 --> 01:29:32.960
went on that I had no emotional connection to whatsoever.

1568
01:29:33.170 --> 01:29:36.650
And that's the antidote for this crazy society that we live in this completely

1569
01:29:36.651 --> 01:29:40.520
unnatural and this all the,
all the,
the,
the,

1570
01:29:40.521 --> 01:29:45.521
the reward systems that are set up in our bodies from thousands of years of DNA

1571
01:29:45.711 --> 01:29:49.580
and learning,
all that stuff is just never appeased.

1572
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.200
There's no real thrills.
There's nothing,
you know,
you're,
you're real thrill.

1573
01:29:54.201 --> 01:29:57.620
It's like going and buying some illegal drug from someone and just closing your

1574
01:29:57.621 --> 01:30:01.520
door and doing it and no one knows,
fuck you.
I'm doing heroin.
You know,
those,

1575
01:30:01.521 --> 01:30:01.940
those years.

1576
01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:03.320
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
and there's a ritual.</v>

1577
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:08.090
I mean a lot of the junkies find the hardest thing about kicking heroin is the

1578
01:30:08.091 --> 01:30:12.250
loss of ritual and community.
Like a heroin junkie,
community,

1579
01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:15.530
junky community.
You're hanging out with your,
the same people.
You know,

1580
01:30:15.531 --> 01:30:18.440
you've got this thing in common,
you've got the ritual,
the burning,

1581
01:30:18.441 --> 01:30:22.730
those measuring the,
you know,
syringes,
the whole shit.
Yeah.
I mean,

1582
01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.400
I've been interviewing a lot of addiction specialists recently.

1583
01:30:25.401 --> 01:30:29.900
Did you have Carl Hart on here?
No.
Oh,
he's cool.
He's a really interesting card.

1584
01:30:30.730 --> 01:30:33.020
Carl Hart didK or c because c,
uh,

1585
01:30:33.021 --> 01:30:37.720
he's a a neurology professor at Columbia University or h.

1586
01:30:37.721 --> 01:30:39.900
E.
R.
H.
A.
R.
T.
No,

1587
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:43.160
I think I sent you an email about him cause he was coming out to do the bill

1588
01:30:43.161 --> 01:30:45.620
Maher show like a month ago or something.

1589
01:30:45.621 --> 01:30:50.621
And he's got a book out called high price and it's sort of a autobiographical

1590
01:30:53.150 --> 01:30:58.010
account of him being born in Miami.
Wrong part of town.
He's a black guy,

1591
01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:00.920
you know,
low income.
And uh,

1592
01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:04.970
I don't remember if it's his brother or his buddies growing up.

1593
01:31:04.971 --> 01:31:08.210
Most of them are in jail.
Uh,
you know,
a lot of,
uh,

1594
01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:11.150
grew up in that like inner city drug scene.
Right.

1595
01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:15.620
And through good luck and some people who were impressed by him,

1596
01:31:15.621 --> 01:31:19.130
he ended up getting a phd and now he's a tenured professor at Columbia,

1597
01:31:19.670 --> 01:31:21.290
but he's a dude from that world.

1598
01:31:21.291 --> 01:31:25.850
And so he's talking about drugs with a very knowledgeable,

1599
01:31:25.851 --> 01:31:29.750
realistic understanding of what they are and what kind of people use them and

1600
01:31:29.751 --> 01:31:34.310
why they use them.
You know,
and so his,
he argues that,
you know,

1601
01:31:34.311 --> 01:31:35.300
drugs aren't addictive.

1602
01:31:35.301 --> 01:31:39.380
What's happening is these people are in this absolutely impossible situation.

1603
01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:41.210
And as you say,

1604
01:31:41.211 --> 01:31:44.480
they like go get the drugs and get behind the door and say fuck you.

1605
01:31:44.481 --> 01:31:47.840
Because it's like the only,
the only escape they've got.

1606
01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:50.230
<v 0>Yeah.
They're unfulfilled.
The,</v>

1607
01:31:50.231 --> 01:31:53.120
the idea of the hunter gatherer being a fulfilling life,

1608
01:31:53.121 --> 01:31:54.620
like that lifestyle being a fulfilling life,

1609
01:31:54.621 --> 01:31:57.560
it's really been appealing to me lately.
One of the reasons why I started this,

1610
01:31:57.561 --> 01:32:02.440
uh,
this project of thousand 14 to live off only game meat cause I started seeing

1611
01:32:02.441 --> 01:32:07.090
these documentaries like the Warner Herzog documentary on the Taiga Happy
People.

1612
01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:10.870
That's a fantastic film.
It's an amazing,
I love everything hurts.
Sogs done.

1613
01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:14.170
I've seen all of them,
but that's a wonderful one.
Yeah,

1614
01:32:14.410 --> 01:32:15.820
there's a realness to those people.

1615
01:32:16.190 --> 01:32:18.940
And then there's also these Alaska shows that I like,

1616
01:32:18.941 --> 01:32:23.560
like let a life below zero is one of them was all people that live either below

1617
01:32:23.561 --> 01:32:25.850
or right above the arctic circle or a right,

1618
01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:28.090
a right below or above the arctic circle.

1619
01:32:28.091 --> 01:32:30.700
Some of them 140 miles above the arctic circle.
I mean,

1620
01:32:30.701 --> 01:32:34.930
they just fucking freezing your ass off up,
but they're happy.
They have a task.

1621
01:32:34.931 --> 01:32:37.330
They do.
It's not my life.
It's not what I want to do.

1622
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:40.270
They're missing a lot of things that I enjoy,
you know?

1623
01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:42.580
But there's something about this,

1624
01:32:42.581 --> 01:32:46.750
this life that they're living that creates these stable,
happy people.

1625
01:32:46.751 --> 01:32:50.710
If you look at reality shows like reality shows drive me fucking crazy,

1626
01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:55.090
and I think they should because there's something about putting people on

1627
01:32:55.091 --> 01:32:59.410
television for no reason and then following them because they're on television

1628
01:32:59.411 --> 01:33:01.970
for no reason.
Like keeping up with the Kardashians.

1629
01:33:01.971 --> 01:33:04.150
It's like the kind of ashy hands or just some normal folks.

1630
01:33:04.151 --> 01:33:07.510
I'm sure there are no better or no worse than most of our neighbors.

1631
01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:11.230
But when you're following these unexceptional people that have nothing to

1632
01:33:11.231 --> 01:33:13.450
contribute,
there's no,
they're not doing anything.

1633
01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:16.360
They're not releasing songs and not writing books.

1634
01:33:16.361 --> 01:33:19.510
They're not contributing to the,
the,
the,
the cultural awareness.

1635
01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:20.770
There's nothing going on there,

1636
01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.220
but yet you follow them anyway because they're being broadcast.

1637
01:33:24.221 --> 01:33:25.810
And it becomes something that you're locking too.

1638
01:33:25.811 --> 01:33:30.811
But you're dealing with people have an exceptionally low character nonsense

1639
01:33:31.211 --> 01:33:34.210
talking.
You listen to things,
they care about the things they say,

1640
01:33:34.211 --> 01:33:38.800
like they're essentially children eating the fat of this society,
this,

1641
01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.870
this oozing,
big,
fat,

1642
01:33:40.871 --> 01:33:45.871
sloppy society that just lets them pull up to the trough and feed all them all.

1643
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:47.441
And because of that,

1644
01:33:47.441 --> 01:33:52.060
they never are pressured to develop character and true identity and be

1645
01:33:52.061 --> 01:33:52.960
exceptional people.

1646
01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:56.170
And in the way that these hunter gatherer people are that have watched these

1647
01:33:56.171 --> 01:34:00.010
subsistence shows,
you're dealing with these really solid people.
They get up,

1648
01:34:00.011 --> 01:34:02.830
it's fucking 20 below zero.
They have to feed their dogs.

1649
01:34:03.010 --> 01:34:04.390
They have to pull together these,
uh,

1650
01:34:04.570 --> 01:34:07.060
these salmon wheels to gather up all these fish.

1651
01:34:07.061 --> 01:34:09.190
So that they could feed their dogs.
If they don't get 200 fish,

1652
01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.360
200 pounds of fish,

1653
01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:12.940
they're going to have to kill one of their fucking dogs because they can't feed

1654
01:34:12.941 --> 01:34:14.830
the God damn thing.
So they have to put it out of its misery.

1655
01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:17.710
And it's one guy was talking about how he had to kill all his dogs one year.

1656
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:20.440
He had a kill all his fucking dogs.
He couldn't feed them.
I mean,

1657
01:34:20.441 --> 01:34:23.650
these are there different kinds of people than someone like,
I hate red shoes.

1658
01:34:23.770 --> 01:34:28.100
Why did you give me red shoes?
Oh my God,
my feet are fat.
They're not fast.

1659
01:34:28.101 --> 01:34:28.631
Shut up.

1660
01:34:28.631 --> 01:34:32.830
She knows my feet are fat and then cut away and she's always telling me my feet

1661
01:34:32.831 --> 01:34:34.960
are fat.
And then when I see my feet are fat,
she's like,
no,
they're not.

1662
01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:39.550
Well make up your mind bitch.
I mean that kind of nonsense distraction.

1663
01:34:39.551 --> 01:34:43.190
When you come home from a day of work and you're all fucked up on Zoloft and

1664
01:34:43.191 --> 01:34:47.560
you're just staring at this stupid fucking show,
like what is that?

1665
01:34:47.710 --> 01:34:51.130
What is that?
I mean,
is that like some sort of a,

1666
01:34:51.131 --> 01:34:56.131
a way that this machine has of getting us to continue to contribute,

1667
01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.880
continue feeding this machine,

1668
01:34:59.030 --> 01:35:03.560
continue buying things and becoming a part of this weird process we have where

1669
01:35:03.561 --> 01:35:08.561
all we do is just create new items and blocks of fucking things and stuff.

1670
01:35:09.531 --> 01:35:12.920
Your house filled with shit that you buy and everything that you buy just

1671
01:35:12.921 --> 01:35:17.840
continues to contribute to this process of constantly creating new shit.

1672
01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:21.740
<v 2>That's it,
man.
Keep running on the wheel.
Instead,</v>

1673
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:25.010
all they care about is that the wheel keeps spinning faster and faster if

1674
01:35:25.011 --> 01:35:27.860
possible.
It doesn't matter why.
Right.

1675
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:32.480
I mean I remember listening to this interview with a football coach for years

1676
01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:35.480
ago.
It was great,
great moment.
They said,
I don't remember who he was,

1677
01:35:35.481 --> 01:35:38.780
but they said,
what's the key to being a great coach?
He said,
well,

1678
01:35:38.781 --> 01:35:42.710
you've gotta be smart enough to really understand the game but not smart enough

1679
01:35:42.711 --> 01:35:46.550
to see how little it all matters.
I thought,

1680
01:35:46.551 --> 01:35:50.540
well that sums up just about everything,
you know,
cause if you think about it,

1681
01:35:50.541 --> 01:35:54.010
you realize like this is all bullshit.
You know,
this,
the,
the,

1682
01:35:54.011 --> 01:35:58.640
the entire enterprise of Western civilization is not leading to happiness.

1683
01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:02.630
It's leading away from happiness,
higher suicide rates,

1684
01:36:02.631 --> 01:36:07.280
higher depression rates,
higher lack of,
uh,
of life satisfaction.

1685
01:36:07.281 --> 01:36:11.030
Plus we're destroying the fisheries were destroying the fucking planet,
you know,

1686
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:15.200
bit by bit bigger bits all the time.
What's,

1687
01:36:15.201 --> 01:36:18.750
what is the point of this,
you know,
and people say,
well,
but you know,

1688
01:36:18.751 --> 01:36:22.370
we'll look at the pyramids,
you know,
we created the period,
we use cell phones,

1689
01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:23.233
blah,
blah,
blah.

1690
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:28.040
But none of that shit matters unless it contributes to human happiness.

1691
01:36:28.041 --> 01:36:32.610
And it's demonstrably show that it doesn't.
Therefore,
I mean I,
I hear you,

1692
01:36:32.611 --> 01:36:35.870
you say,
well I'd miss this.
I miss that.
I miss a lot of shit too.

1693
01:36:35.871 --> 01:36:37.790
There's no doubt about it.
And in the book,

1694
01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:40.790
I'm not advocating that we go back to a hunter gatherer societies,

1695
01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:45.080
although partial steps like what you're doing are great.

1696
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:46.580
Not because it's going to save the world,

1697
01:36:46.581 --> 01:36:51.410
but because title enrich your life and your kids' lives.
Yeah.
But,
uh,

1698
01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.041
you know,
the whole,

1699
01:36:52.041 --> 01:36:57.041
like I'd missed this or that thing is kind of like a non issue because if you

1700
01:36:57.111 --> 01:37:01.130
were raised in that society,
then you wouldn't have,
you wouldn't know to miss it.

1701
01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:04.700
Right?
So it's not about you or me becoming hunter gatherers,

1702
01:37:04.701 --> 01:37:08.990
it's about looking at these two approaches to life,
uh,

1703
01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:10.790
independently and saying,
okay,

1704
01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:14.570
the people who were born and raised in those traditions,
what's the outcome?

1705
01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:18.770
Who's happier,
who's better off,
who has greater life satisfaction,

1706
01:37:18.771 --> 01:37:21.860
who has better health?
You know,
look at all these different parameters.

1707
01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:26.870
There's a great book.
Um,
uh,
don't sleep.
There are snakes.

1708
01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:29.930
It's about the Pina hop people of the Upper Amazon.

1709
01:37:29.931 --> 01:37:33.830
This missionary went to live with them and he's the only western who speaks

1710
01:37:33.831 --> 01:37:38.660
their language.
It's a very unusual language.
Daniel Everett.
Um,

1711
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:42.050
and uh,
so he went to live with them,
learn the language and,

1712
01:37:42.051 --> 01:37:47.051
and eventually they convinced him to adopt their,

1713
01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:49.910
a spiritual traditions rather than the other way around.

1714
01:37:49.911 --> 01:37:53.150
He abandoned the church that,
I don't remember which church sent him,

1715
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:58.350
but he talks a lot about,
uh,
happiness,
satisfaction.
He says,

1716
01:37:58.530 --> 01:38:01.920
some psychologist came and visited the village when he was there.

1717
01:38:01.921 --> 01:38:03.540
And these are a hunter gatherer people.

1718
01:38:03.541 --> 01:38:08.430
Very little contact with the outside world.
And the psychologist said,

1719
01:38:08.431 --> 01:38:08.611
man,

1720
01:38:08.611 --> 01:38:13.460
I've never seen anyone happy this much for this Pr.

1721
01:38:13.710 --> 01:38:14.790
And he said,
the way you judge it,

1722
01:38:14.791 --> 01:38:18.000
as you take videos and you look at how much of the time they're laughing or

1723
01:38:18.001 --> 01:38:21.690
smiling,
right?
And he said,
they,
they laugh about everything.

1724
01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:25.140
Their house falls down,
they're laughing.
Someone you know,
you,
you're embarrassed,

1725
01:38:25.141 --> 01:38:29.760
you laugh.
Like everything is about laughter.
It's very interesting society,

1726
01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:32.970
a real look into the mentality of these people.

1727
01:38:33.150 --> 01:38:36.660
One of the things that's really striking about them is that they don't,
you know,

1728
01:38:36.661 --> 01:38:38.160
we're talking about focus,
right?

1729
01:38:38.490 --> 01:38:43.260
They don't have a sense of future or past that extends beyond,

1730
01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:46.710
uh,
pass beyond the generation of the grandfathers.

1731
01:38:47.010 --> 01:38:51.240
So when the missionary showed up and started talking about Jesus,
they'd be like,

1732
01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:52.860
okay,
did you know

1733
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:55.850
<v 0>guy?
And he'd say,
no,
no.
This was long time ago.</v>

1734
01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:58.670
Did your grandfather know him?
No,
no,

1735
01:38:58.671 --> 01:39:02.210
this was before my grandfather and have conversation.
We're done.
They're done.

1736
01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:05.710
That's like,
then it's meaningless.
Wow.
You know,

1737
01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.630
there's no connection between you and this store.
There's,

1738
01:39:08.631 --> 01:39:11.470
I don't want to hear about this.
Fuck it.
They just walk away.
That's Intel.

1739
01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:15.080
Absolutely not interested.
Yeah.
I mean it doesn't,
you know,

1740
01:39:15.081 --> 01:39:16.760
obviously it's nice to have history.

1741
01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:21.320
We have a lot of it and you can learn a lot from reading about amazing shit that

1742
01:39:21.321 --> 01:39:25.790
happened a long time ago.
This documentable.
But that's pretty funny.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1743
01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:26.690
we would,

1744
01:39:26.690 --> 01:39:31.690
the problem we have is it's so deeply ingrained in our idea and our idea of

1745
01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:37.060
culture so deeply ingrained that when you're talking about happiness,

1746
01:39:38.630 --> 01:39:43.010
that happiness without money,
without success,
it's like,

1747
01:39:43.011 --> 01:39:47.000
come on,
you know,
like we don't buy it.

1748
01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:49.540
Like if you're talking about like a guy who's got a,
you know,

1749
01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:54.590
half a million dollar house and you know,
he drives a Cadillac and works all day.

1750
01:39:54.591 --> 01:39:55.970
And I'm like,
well listen,
you know,
we've,

1751
01:39:55.971 --> 01:39:59.510
we've decided to start a commune and we're real,
we're going to be really happy.

1752
01:39:59.511 --> 01:40:01.370
We're going to grow her own food.
What are you gonna do for money?

1753
01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:05.120
We're not going to have any money.
Get the fuck Outta here.
Look at this house.

1754
01:40:05.121 --> 01:40:07.490
I God,
look at this car.
Come on.
I need to pay for gas.

1755
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:11.600
It costs a lot of money to just the electric bills,
$500 a month.
You know,

1756
01:40:12.650 --> 01:40:15.820
people get this idea in their head that you're what?

1757
01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:17.450
This thing that you're doing,

1758
01:40:17.451 --> 01:40:21.020
this part of this role that you're playing in this society is the only way to be

1759
01:40:21.021 --> 01:40:24.220
happy.
It's inevitable.
Yeah.
To step outside of that and have like a,

1760
01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:28.610
a radical restructuring of what you do.
It's really impossible.
You know why?

1761
01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:31.190
Because you're always going to have to pay taxes on that fucking house.

1762
01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:33.470
You're always going to have to be,
even if you buy your house,

1763
01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:36.110
if you own your land,
you don't,
sorry.

1764
01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:39.440
Every year you have to be fucking property tax period.
In Spain,

1765
01:40:39.441 --> 01:40:41.290
it doesn't work that way and be marked down.

1766
01:40:41.610 --> 01:40:44.820
<v 2>Yeah.
You pay the tax up front when you buy it and then you're done.
That's it.</v>

1767
01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:45.630
It's yours.

1768
01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:48.840
<v 0>Unless you're talking about gigantic chunks of land.</v>

1769
01:40:48.841 --> 01:40:51.450
Like if someone's got a goddamn huge cattle ranch,

1770
01:40:51.451 --> 01:40:54.940
it's got 3000 acres and that it's obvious like they're using them a lot of

1771
01:40:54.941 --> 01:40:56.540
resources,
a lot of waters,
a lot of,

1772
01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:58.600
he should probably pay some sort of a tax on that.

1773
01:40:58.601 --> 01:41:02.950
But if you're just a guy and he's got $150,000 $200,000 house and you worked

1774
01:41:02.951 --> 01:41:05.800
your whole life to earn that house and you,
you bought it and paid for it,

1775
01:41:05.890 --> 01:41:08.440
you should be fucking done just like you're done with your car.

1776
01:41:08.670 --> 01:41:11.050
Or you don't have to keep paying your fucking car over a year.

1777
01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:12.850
You'd have to like,
what's your car worth this year?
Well,

1778
01:41:12.851 --> 01:41:15.940
you owe us 10% of that boy.
Like I paid it already.

1779
01:41:15.941 --> 01:41:17.770
Like we talking about it paid sales tax.

1780
01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:19.960
You guys got to cut when I bought the fucking thing.

1781
01:41:20.290 --> 01:41:22.120
Like why do you keep getting a cut every year?

1782
01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:25.240
Like what does this property text nonsense?
It's stupid.

1783
01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:28.900
It's ridiculous and it keeps you on the tit.
It keeps you on the tit.

1784
01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:31.110
You can never just go off the grid.
Right.

1785
01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:34.540
One of the shows that I watch is this show called mountain men and there's a guy

1786
01:41:34.541 --> 01:41:39.460
named Eustace Conway and he lives in North Carolina and this guy is totally off

1787
01:41:39.461 --> 01:41:40.630
the tit.
All right,

1788
01:41:40.690 --> 01:41:45.220
all he does his little off and he's got a generator that uses the river water.

1789
01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:48.880
The river water spins this wheel that creates electricity and that's how he

1790
01:41:48.881 --> 01:41:51.730
powers his band saws.
He cuts his own wood chops.

1791
01:41:52.110 --> 01:41:55.810
He has like a couple thousand acres out there and he lives off deer meat that he

1792
01:41:55.811 --> 01:41:59.260
shoots.
It was about chickens that he raises and he's off the land,

1793
01:41:59.261 --> 01:42:00.850
grows his own Kale,
the whole deal.

1794
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:04.360
But his big dilemma paying his fucking property tax every month.

1795
01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:08.980
So every year you know it,
he's got to figure out how to sell things.

1796
01:42:08.981 --> 01:42:10.960
He's got to chop wood and sell woods.

1797
01:42:10.961 --> 01:42:14.140
You gotta do all these different things when really he paid for all that shit,

1798
01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.970
which is leave that guy alone.

1799
01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:19.480
He's not hurting anybody by living off the land that he paid for it,

1800
01:42:19.481 --> 01:42:23.770
like get the fuck off his back.
But they are always going to do that.

1801
01:42:23.771 --> 01:42:26.290
They're always going to keep you tied in if they can,

1802
01:42:26.291 --> 01:42:29.440
if they can figure out a way to keep sucking money out of you.

1803
01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:33.160
And it's essentially a justification for the incompetent system.

1804
01:42:33.161 --> 01:42:36.180
The current system is so fucking filled with just,

1805
01:42:36.330 --> 01:42:41.330
just gross misspending and misappropriation and mismanagement of funds,

1806
01:42:43.661 --> 01:42:48.190
just so gross and sloppy and bureaucratic and they just,

1807
01:42:48.191 --> 01:42:52.150
they need to be to everybody to be on the tit in order to feed that stupid

1808
01:42:52.151 --> 01:42:53.140
inefficient machine.

1809
01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:57.820
<v 2>You're here,
man,
here,
here,
when you were talking about Alaska,
you know,</v>

1810
01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:01.170
and getting off the grid and all that,
uh,
you know,

1811
01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:04.600
I had a transformative experience that first time I went to Alaska I,

1812
01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:07.300
I was in college in New York,

1813
01:43:07.690 --> 01:43:11.910
I was studying literature and one of my teachers was a visiting professor that I

1814
01:43:11.911 --> 01:43:13.060
had got to be friends with,

1815
01:43:13.390 --> 01:43:16.480
was the youngest person to ever be a professor at Oxford.

1816
01:43:16.481 --> 01:43:20.590
He's like a real big shot at Oxford.
I mean since 1261 or something,

1817
01:43:20.591 --> 01:43:23.990
this guy's the youngest person to ever be a professor.
Then how old was he?

1818
01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:27.760
21 when he was a full day focus on,
yeah.
Wow.
Anyway,

1819
01:43:27.761 --> 01:43:31.150
he's very well known guy.
Indira Gandhi was his godmother.

1820
01:43:31.151 --> 01:43:35.320
He's written a bunch of books and all this and he was a friend of mine and he

1821
01:43:35.321 --> 01:43:40.030
was,
uh,
I was in my,
I was skipping my junior year of college and the one,

1822
01:43:40.031 --> 01:43:43.210
I had one more year of undergraduate and then I was going to go to Oxford for my

1823
01:43:43.211 --> 01:43:43.810
phd,

1824
01:43:43.810 --> 01:43:47.740
thanks to this guy and his connections and I was going to like study literature

1825
01:43:47.741 --> 01:43:51.560
that I'd do a phd and by the time I was 30 be teaching somewhere,

1826
01:43:51.561 --> 01:43:54.110
hopefully have tenure and be all set for life and all that.

1827
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:57.680
So I skipped my junior year because I found a loophole in the student handbook

1828
01:43:57.681 --> 01:44:00.670
where I could like scam through I,

1829
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.310
which I've done like every school I've ever been in,
every job I've ever had,

1830
01:44:04.311 --> 01:44:06.560
I find some scam.
Right.
So I,

1831
01:44:06.650 --> 01:44:10.070
I a scam my way out of junior year and I said I'm going to go to Alaska because

1832
01:44:10.071 --> 01:44:14.270
I want to see the frontier.
So I hitchhiked from New York to Alaska,

1833
01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:18.440
had all these freaky adventures as you can imagine.
Right.

1834
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:23.030
Went to prison,
got shot at,
you know,
all this crazy shit happen.

1835
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:26.030
And I met people along the way who picked me up,

1836
01:44:26.170 --> 01:44:31.170
especially like in the Yukon and in Alaska who were so fucking kind.

1837
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:36.410
Yeah.
So competent and they'd take me home.
I'd say,
you know,

1838
01:44:36.411 --> 01:44:39.700
they feed me,
introduced me to the wife,
the kids that you know,

1839
01:44:39.701 --> 01:44:43.100
that or women who'd stopped and picked me up.
Just trusting like,
Hey,
whatever,

1840
01:44:43.101 --> 01:44:47.270
you know,
really self sufficient people.
They built their own houses,

1841
01:44:47.271 --> 01:44:50.840
they had healthy relationships,
they knew how to fix their own cars.

1842
01:44:50.841 --> 01:44:52.220
They were really self sufficient.

1843
01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:57.440
None of them knew anything about the fancy schmancy literature and philosophy

1844
01:44:57.441 --> 01:44:59.580
that I was studying.
Right?
Like I had,
you know,

1845
01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:03.470
the collected poems of Dh Lawrence and my backpack and they'd never heard any of

1846
01:45:03.471 --> 01:45:04.304
this shit.
Right.

1847
01:45:04.670 --> 01:45:09.670
But when I compared them to my professor friends back at school and it was like,

1848
01:45:10.610 --> 01:45:13.670
wait a minute,
these people don't know any of this,
you know,

1849
01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:15.980
the elite knowledge.

1850
01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:20.330
But they're really happy people and they're healthy people and they have good

1851
01:45:20.331 --> 01:45:23.420
families and they're decent and they're kind and they're generous to me.

1852
01:45:23.690 --> 01:45:27.140
And then I imagine one of them,
you know,
stumbles into Princeton,

1853
01:45:27.141 --> 01:45:28.420
New Jersey or your,

1854
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:31.910
where I was going to school in upstate New York and my professor friends,

1855
01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:35.930
you know,
come upon them,
they'd,
they'd laugh at them,
they wouldn't help them,

1856
01:45:35.931 --> 01:45:37.340
they wouldn't be kind to them.
They would.

1857
01:45:37.610 --> 01:45:40.670
And my professor friends like had to call a fucking electrician to change a

1858
01:45:40.671 --> 01:45:43.760
light bulb.
Right?
So it's like,
well,
why wait a minute?
What a,

1859
01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:47.870
what do I want to do in this life?
Where am I going?
So that's what I just said.

1860
01:45:47.930 --> 01:45:51.860
All right,
fuck it.
No Grad school.
And I wrote to the guy like,
just,
sorry,

1861
01:45:51.861 --> 01:45:54.120
not going to printer Oxford.

1862
01:45:54.130 --> 01:45:58.220
Not not going to do any of this till I'm 30 I'm not going to make a commitment

1863
01:45:58.221 --> 01:46:02.390
to anything.
No job,
no woman,
no Grad School,
no med school,
nothing.

1864
01:46:02.391 --> 01:46:04.970
I'm just going to float around the world and have adventures.

1865
01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:09.580
<v 0>Wow.
That's fucking cool story.
I love that idea.
That's a,</v>

1866
01:46:09.581 --> 01:46:11.770
that's really cool.
I found out a,

1867
01:46:11.771 --> 01:46:13.930
I didn't go to the Yukon but I went to anchorage

1868
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:17.630
<v 2>recently with,
with Ari.
Right.
You guys went fishing.
We went fishing.</v>

1869
01:46:17.631 --> 01:46:19.730
We were the Kenai peninsula.

1870
01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:25.140
<v 0>Mm.
South of Anchorage.
Um,
quite honestly,
I don't remember.</v>

1871
01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:29.170
I don't remember what river we're on.
I remember we had a great time.
Yeah.
Uh,

1872
01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:32.580
we caught some salmon and we,
we did a show up there,

1873
01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:37.760
but I felt that way as well about the people that there's a self sufficiency to

1874
01:46:37.801 --> 01:46:41.520
a lot of the folks that live up there that eat mean.
Even in Anchorage,

1875
01:46:41.521 --> 01:46:43.850
which is a city,
you know,
it's a real city.
They have,
you know,

1876
01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.370
hotels and gas stations and the whole deal movie theater went to the movies

1877
01:46:47.371 --> 01:46:50.760
there.
It was 10 o'clock at night.
It was out.
Yes.
It's very weird.

1878
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:53.130
It's very weird bars with no windows.
Yeah.

1879
01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:55.360
He can't can have windows because people are in their drink.

1880
01:46:55.361 --> 01:46:57.780
And you don't want to see your fucking son come your eye and let you know what a

1881
01:46:57.781 --> 01:47:00.080
loser you are.
Thanks.
Yeah.

1882
01:47:00.090 --> 01:47:02.460
And people will make better decisions and there was a light on them.

1883
01:47:02.461 --> 01:47:03.410
We don't want that.
So

1884
01:47:03.530 --> 01:47:06.350
<v 5>do they still have like handgun permits where you have to leave your gun at the</v>

1885
01:47:06.351 --> 01:47:07.220
door when you go into the

1886
01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.950
<v 0>some places like a gun check?
Yeah.</v>

1887
01:47:09.951 --> 01:47:13.040
You have to check your guns when you come in because everybody's got guns.

1888
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:15.420
Get Shit faced.
They need to pick up your gun on your way out.
Yeah.

1889
01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:18.420
That's the best time to get it.
After you've gotten enough far arc.
Exactly.

1890
01:47:19.450 --> 01:47:21.110
You find people there.

1891
01:47:21.111 --> 01:47:25.130
They were very kind and very cool and very competent as you were saying.

1892
01:47:25.131 --> 01:47:28.830
And they're just,
there are people that are also dealing with nature and a,

1893
01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:32.750
and I'll weigh different level.
Yeah.
They're dealing with weather,
you know,

1894
01:47:33.050 --> 01:47:37.250
real weather and we don't have to do that.
We,
especially in California,

1895
01:47:37.251 --> 01:47:42.251
which is the most ridiculous and retarded state in the country as far as the way

1896
01:47:42.411 --> 01:47:45.200
people behave on the norm.
Don't get me wrong.
I love it here.

1897
01:47:45.201 --> 01:47:48.650
And there's a lot of cool people here and you know,
all my best friends are here,

1898
01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:52.670
but the reality of California is that we don't have to deal with weather at all.

1899
01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:55.400
The worst thing we have to do is press a button.
Oh my God,
it's hot.

1900
01:47:55.610 --> 01:47:58.610
You press a button,
it's not hot anymore.
I mean it's really,

1901
01:47:58.670 --> 01:48:01.610
as long as the power stays on really,
not that fucking hard to deal.

1902
01:48:01.850 --> 01:48:05.240
But if you living in Alaska,
you have to take precautions every year.

1903
01:48:05.241 --> 01:48:08.450
You have to keep a candle in the back of your car.
You have to keep matches.

1904
01:48:08.690 --> 01:48:12.140
You have to keep blankets with you at all times because your car could break

1905
01:48:12.141 --> 01:48:13.310
down.
You can be at the side of the road,

1906
01:48:13.311 --> 01:48:16.460
no one could be on the road and that candle,
it might keep you alive.

1907
01:48:16.810 --> 01:48:19.430
You Are the light that candle in your car with all the doors shut,

1908
01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:22.520
and that's the only way you're going to stay warm and stay alive.
Like there's a,

1909
01:48:22.521 --> 01:48:24.470
there's a lot of that kind of thinking going on there.

1910
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:27.110
And then when someone sees you pulled over to the side of the road,

1911
01:48:27.111 --> 01:48:29.980
they're not like,
oh,
who's this creepy fuck you know,
in um,

1912
01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:32.660
the Sherman oaks that's pulled over to the side of the road with his hazards on,

1913
01:48:32.661 --> 01:48:36.080
I'm not stop them to this guy.
They're like,
Oh,
who is this person,

1914
01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:41.100
this kindred soul out here in the middle of the woods that got fucked and this

1915
01:48:41.481 --> 01:48:45.290
could be me.
Yay.
Come on in exam.
Do you guys have cell phone service?
No.

1916
01:48:45.291 --> 01:48:47.840
If we drive five more miles,
we get cell phone service,
hop in the car.

1917
01:48:47.841 --> 01:48:52.010
I'll take you to where we can call somebody.
Yeah,
there's not,
but you're right.

1918
01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:53.060
Your pre press,

1919
01:48:53.061 --> 01:48:57.200
her friends to not pick them up would be right where they live.

1920
01:48:57.230 --> 01:48:58.520
That's the crazy thing about it.

1921
01:48:58.521 --> 01:49:02.390
It's like you're right that the professor was probably wouldn't pick up someone

1922
01:49:02.391 --> 01:49:03.710
who has broken down the side of the road,

1923
01:49:03.711 --> 01:49:06.770
but they're right too and not doing that.

1924
01:49:06.771 --> 01:49:10.040
If you live in a city because you never know what the fuck you're going to get.

1925
01:49:10.090 --> 01:49:12.130
<v 5>Exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You got it.</v>

1926
01:49:12.131 --> 01:49:14.770
You got to participate in the world you're born into,

1927
01:49:14.771 --> 01:49:17.870
whether you agree with it or not.
Yeah.
You know,
you're,

1928
01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:20.410
sorry to interrupt you with that.
What you said about California,

1929
01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:23.890
that also ties to the origins of civilization.

1930
01:49:23.950 --> 01:49:26.050
Actually in a funny way there,

1931
01:49:26.290 --> 01:49:31.290
one of the leading theories for why Europe became more advanced use in quotes,

1932
01:49:32.861 --> 01:49:36.310
right.
Um,
is because people had to,

1933
01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:40.570
had to think twice there people they had winter.
So when you build a house,

1934
01:49:40.571 --> 01:49:44.800
it has to be better engineer.
The best engineers,
you know,
the best cars,
German,

1935
01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:48.250
you know,
they're not Italian because in,
in architecture

1936
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:52.360
<v 2>and all this stuff you see in Europe,
the,
the Mediterranean countries are sloppy,</v>

1937
01:49:53.230 --> 01:49:56.380
right?
The,
the,
the houses aren't insulated.
They're not the,

1938
01:49:56.381 --> 01:50:00.230
the fittings aren't right.
You know,
people like show up late.

1939
01:50:00.231 --> 01:50:03.730
The whole mentality is kind of laissez faire,
whatever.
Well,
that's the,

1940
01:50:03.731 --> 01:50:04.960
whether it's a reflection of the,

1941
01:50:04.961 --> 01:50:09.340
whether it's a reflection of the fact that they're not battling weather for

1942
01:50:09.341 --> 01:50:14.170
their lives.
So there is a competence and a sort of carefulness and uh,

1943
01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:18.340
you know,
checklist.
If you're a pilot,
you use a checklist because if you don't,

1944
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:22.720
your deer a dead pilot,
you know,
it's like that in northern climates as well.

1945
01:50:22.721 --> 01:50:27.160
It develops a certain kind of approach to life that's much more competent.

1946
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:28.480
<v 0>And then on the other hand,</v>

1947
01:50:28.481 --> 01:50:31.930
you've got places like Brazil where the weather's fantastic and the people are

1948
01:50:31.931 --> 01:50:33.460
like laughing and they were on the beach.

1949
01:50:33.461 --> 01:50:36.070
They're smiling and very friendly and very warm.

1950
01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:39.220
And that's also because they don't have to,

1951
01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:41.980
they don't have to deal with any bullshit.
They're all wearing flip flops.
I mean,

1952
01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:46.840
nobody has to worry about nothing.
It's no matter what the time of the year is,

1953
01:50:46.841 --> 01:50:51.310
it never gets cold.
And now there's people in Rio that a surf in 24 hours a day,

1954
01:50:51.311 --> 01:50:53.320
seven days a week,
they can do whatever they want.

1955
01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:55.060
There's no sharks down there either.

1956
01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:58.780
We think that recently someone got bit by a shark in Brazil was like a really,

1957
01:50:58.781 --> 01:51:02.530
really rare situation.
Yeah.
So they're like surfing perfect water.

1958
01:51:02.531 --> 01:51:03.640
It's like bath water.

1959
01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:08.780
<v 2>Beautiful waves.
Ah,
AH,
hot.
Hi.
Everything's great.</v>

1960
01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:10.840
I know you like a Verna Hertz.
Ugh.

1961
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:16.010
You ever see a documentary called bus one oh seven it was called,
it's,

1962
01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:17.750
it's not Verner Herzog,
but it's a,

1963
01:51:17.751 --> 01:51:20.540
it's a documentary that will blow your fucking mind.

1964
01:51:20.541 --> 01:51:23.930
I know you're into grizzly man too.
I really love it.
Yeah.
Oh,

1965
01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:29.570
the music in grizzly man.
Oh,
no,
no.
I'm thinking of into the wild.
Oh yeah.
Uh,

1966
01:51:29.690 --> 01:51:33.620
yeah.
Anyway,
uh,
this,
this film,
is it bus one oh seven?
And is that coming up?

1967
01:51:33.621 --> 01:51:37.430
It's bus one something.
I don't remember which number,

1968
01:51:37.431 --> 01:51:40.910
but it's a Brazilian documentary and it's available with subtitles.

1969
01:51:40.911 --> 01:51:45.290
It's about this guy who tries to hijack a bus.

1970
01:51:46.010 --> 01:51:49.730
And his idea is just to like,
uh,
grab some money and jump off the bus.

1971
01:51:49.731 --> 01:51:54.170
But there's some cops going by and they stop and the bus gets surrounded and

1972
01:51:54.171 --> 01:51:57.380
then suddenly it's like,
well,
it's not at all what he intended.

1973
01:51:57.380 --> 01:52:01.100
He didn't intend to be on this bus with 30 people holding them all hostage.

1974
01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:06.580
But now he's there and then the TV cameras show up and their helicopters and

1975
01:52:06.761 --> 01:52:08.090
their TV crews all around.

1976
01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:13.360
And it turns into this like national day where everyone in Brazil is watching

1977
01:52:13.611 --> 01:52:18.100
this dude on the bus live coverage.
Wow.
You know,
it's like the Oj,
you know,

1978
01:52:18.110 --> 01:52:23.050
that's one 74,
one 74 highly recommended documentary,
uh,

1979
01:52:23.330 --> 01:52:28.250
for insights into Brazilian life and just something you,
you,
you'll never see.

1980
01:52:28.251 --> 01:52:31.340
It's like grizzly man in the sense that there's a lot of,
uh,

1981
01:52:31.341 --> 01:52:35.180
actual footage used in the documentary.
So you get the interviews and stuff,

1982
01:52:35.181 --> 01:52:39.460
but then you've got the,
the,
the footage that the TV crews were,

1983
01:52:39.461 --> 01:52:43.760
were taking at the time.
There he is.
Yeah.
It's a very intense,

1984
01:52:44.450 --> 01:52:46.160
wow.
That's

1985
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:50.910
<v 0>fucked.
Okay.
I'll check that out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

1986
01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:55.520
I think that a certain amount of nature having to deal with a certain amount of

1987
01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:57.740
adversity develops character.

1988
01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:01.610
It's one of the issues that I have with modern life as far as like,

1989
01:53:01.670 --> 01:53:06.380
people just getting a nice,
safe job is that you're,
you're,

1990
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:09.800
you don't really have to deal with too much.
Adversity is not,

1991
01:53:09.801 --> 01:53:13.070
there's not a lot of risk involved and a lot of fear and parents like that for

1992
01:53:13.071 --> 01:53:16.610
their children.
It's like take a safe job,
Johnny,
you know,
they get the,
you know,

1993
01:53:16.611 --> 01:53:18.770
you get in the union and you've got a good,
good Korea,

1994
01:53:18.771 --> 01:53:23.540
they have good government job.
But when you do that,
when you reduce those risks,

1995
01:53:23.541 --> 01:53:28.420
you also reduce the excitement of life.
You take away some of the thrill of life.

1996
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.700
My whole life I've been a thrilled junkie,
you know,

1997
01:53:31.701 --> 01:53:35.180
and in more ways than one I've avoided the,
the,
the,
the fear,

1998
01:53:35.210 --> 01:53:38.540
like the drugs and the things that can really fuck up your life.

1999
01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:41.600
I've avoided all those cause I've,
I've seen them happen before,

2000
01:53:41.601 --> 01:53:45.980
but if I didn't avoid them,
I for sure what it got hooked on something,
you know,

2001
01:53:45.981 --> 01:53:50.720
I'm,
I'm,
I'm a crazy person.
You have an addictive personality.
Yeah,
for sure.
100%.

2002
01:53:50.721 --> 01:53:54.330
Yeah.
But I funnel it into being addicted to positive things,
right?

2003
01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:55.970
Like I get addicted to martial arts.

2004
01:53:55.971 --> 01:54:00.470
I get addicted to standup comedy or get addicted to,
you know,
things that I like,

2005
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:05.060
but those,
um,
they're thrills.

2006
01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:08.150
That's what I'm addicted to.
I'm addicted to like martial arts.

2007
01:54:08.151 --> 01:54:13.010
One of the things about it that was so exciting is regular life became so much

2008
01:54:13.011 --> 01:54:17.900
more manageable when four or five days a week I was fighting for my life.

2009
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:21.240
It's like it was a reality of,

2010
01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:26.290
of a mad scramble with some crazy brown belt has got a nasty guard and you guys

2011
01:54:27.261 --> 01:54:31.340
are doing battle and he's trying to choke the blood out of your neck,
you know?

2012
01:54:31.341 --> 01:54:32.480
And because of that,

2013
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:37.570
everything else I would do would be so much less threatening and so much more in

2014
01:54:39.021 --> 01:54:42.050
context.
It would,
it would give it a context and it would give it a person.

2015
01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:47.760
<v 2>And it also cleanses the mind to be terrified.
Yes.</v>

2016
01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:52.110
I mean,
I wrote a motorcycle for seven years in Spain.
I had a BMW,

2017
01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:57.420
Spain.
I wrote it every day.
Every night.
That's so crazy.
Uh,
yeah.

2018
01:54:57.421 --> 01:55:01.440
I used it for work.
How many accidents?
Uh,
you know what?

2019
01:55:01.441 --> 01:55:06.090
A lot of near misses,
uh,
some crazy near misses,

2020
01:55:06.091 --> 01:55:10.260
but I never dropped it.
Whoa.
That's amazing.
I've dropped other motorcycles.

2021
01:55:10.261 --> 01:55:14.490
I almost died on a motorcycle in a while.
I almost died on that one.

2022
01:55:14.491 --> 01:55:18.090
But that's another story.
But the first time I almost,

2023
01:55:18.610 --> 01:55:20.640
I took a bike,
a trail bike,

2024
01:55:20.670 --> 01:55:23.730
I laid it down and slid under a Barb wire fence.

2025
01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:28.280
<v 0>Oh my God,
I was like 14 oh my God.
They kinda just shredded you.</v>

2026
01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:32.900
<v 2>And then the time,
the next time I was in Thailand,</v>

2027
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:33.890
I was in Chiang Mai,

2028
01:55:33.891 --> 01:55:38.891
Thailand and I rented this a Suzuki one 85 like a small light bike and I did

2029
01:55:39.531 --> 01:55:43.950
like a six day trip around the Golden Triangle and North West Thailand,

2030
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.690
which borders Burma in Laos and it's where like 80% of the heroin in the world

2031
01:55:48.691 --> 01:55:53.280
comes from.
That's also where I tried heroin,
which was a weird time.
But

2032
01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:58.460
did you try an injection or did you try it?
I smoked it.
Smoked.

2033
01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:02.400
I met these two British guys.
God is such a weird thing that I was,

2034
01:56:02.401 --> 01:56:07.401
and I remember exactly when it was because I got up early like seven o'clock in

2035
01:56:07.681 --> 01:56:12.450
the morning to watch Mike Tyson fight James Bone crusher Smith.
Oh,

2036
01:56:12.451 --> 01:56:13.560
I remember that.
So,

2037
01:56:13.561 --> 01:56:18.210
and it was being shown in this little bar cafe in Chiang Mai near where I was

2038
01:56:18.211 --> 01:56:20.760
staying.
And I got up early because I wanted to see it.

2039
01:56:20.761 --> 01:56:24.660
And these two British dudes and me,
we're the only ones there.
So I got to,

2040
01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:28.620
and they were junkies and they were like super high class dudes.

2041
01:56:28.621 --> 01:56:29.281
Like one of them,

2042
01:56:29.281 --> 01:56:33.180
his uncle was in parliament and the other was the son of a very famous writer

2043
01:56:33.181 --> 01:56:37.110
whose book I had read,
actually,
I won't say his name,

2044
01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:41.880
but a very well known.
He won the booker prize and big deal.
Anyway,
these,

2045
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:43.580
these two were junkies and they were in,

2046
01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:48.800
so the one dude was in Thailand ostensively to be,

2047
01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:52.740
uh,
an actor in the taping of good morning,
the film you have.

2048
01:56:52.741 --> 01:56:53.790
Good Morning Vietnam,

2049
01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:57.510
the Robin Williams film that they were taping at the time in Bangkok.

2050
01:56:58.110 --> 01:57:00.540
That was the story he gave his parents bullshit.

2051
01:57:00.541 --> 01:57:03.740
He was just getting high all the time.
And then his friend was like,
oh,

2052
01:57:03.741 --> 01:57:06.540
I got to go save him.
And then,
so he came and now he's getting high.

2053
01:57:09.150 --> 01:57:13.140
And I met the two of them with this Mike Tyson fight.
And so,
and I had always,

2054
01:57:13.141 --> 01:57:15.360
you know,
my,
my thing about drugs is I'm not,

2055
01:57:15.361 --> 01:57:19.350
I don't have an addictive personality.
I'm too lazy to be addictive on it.

2056
01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:21.420
It's really,
so I do things,

2057
01:57:21.421 --> 01:57:25.680
I get the thrill out of it and I try to be careful about it.
And you know,

2058
01:57:25.681 --> 01:57:28.590
I like to do things in the place with that.
It comes from,
right.

2059
01:57:28.591 --> 01:57:31.740
I've done Iowa skin,
Brazil and piety in Mexico.

2060
01:57:31.741 --> 01:57:35.460
And so I'm in northern Thailand in Chiang Mai.
It's going to be the cleanest,

2061
01:57:35.461 --> 01:57:36.990
best quality heroin ever.

2062
01:57:36.991 --> 01:57:40.140
And I meet these two guys and they're into it and they've got all the contacts

2063
01:57:40.141 --> 01:57:43.440
and all that.
And uh,
so they,

2064
01:57:43.441 --> 01:57:46.730
we got to be friends and uh,
you know,
they invited me to,

2065
01:57:46.731 --> 01:57:50.160
to get high and I was like,
okay,
look,
I've never done this before.
They,
Donna,

2066
01:57:50.161 --> 01:57:51.510
will,
we got you a no worries.

2067
01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:55.110
So we're sitting in their room and we did the chase the dragon,

2068
01:57:55.140 --> 01:58:00.140
you know where you put the heroin on tin foil and you cause the flame can't

2069
01:58:00.331 --> 01:58:03.150
touch the heroin.
It's like they don't ruin it.
Yeah.

2070
01:58:03.151 --> 01:58:05.880
I can't go to prison for saying this.
Right.
In talking about this,

2071
01:58:05.881 --> 01:58:08.940
this is all hearsay,
but you know what non Americans,

2072
01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:11.940
if you admit that you have ever used illegal drugs,
they can,

2073
01:58:11.970 --> 01:58:14.160
they stamp your passport.
You're never allowed in the country.

2074
01:58:14.190 --> 01:58:15.630
I know of two friends that happen to,

2075
01:58:15.690 --> 01:58:18.630
so if you're in another country and you start talking about using drugs,

2076
01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:22.440
like on another podcast,
they can,
I don't know,
I don't know about podcasts,

2077
01:58:22.441 --> 01:58:25.140
but what happened with his friend?
She was coming back from Amsterdam.

2078
01:58:25.141 --> 01:58:29.730
She was a judge in the cannabis cup competition and she lives in Vancouver.

2079
01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:31.020
And the plane,

2080
01:58:31.021 --> 01:58:35.700
she changed planes in Seattle and they took her and said,

2081
01:58:35.701 --> 01:58:38.310
so where are you doing in Amsterdam?
And she told them and they said,

2082
01:58:38.311 --> 01:58:41.500
so who have you smoked marijuana?
She said,
yeah,
and they stamped password.

2083
01:58:41.501 --> 01:58:43.600
She's never landed in the u s again.
Wow.

2084
01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:46.000
Because she smoked marijuana in Amsterdam.

2085
01:58:46.290 --> 01:58:47.370
<v 0>Wow.</v>

2086
01:58:47.470 --> 01:58:49.810
<v 2>And another guy I know is a psychiatrist,</v>

2087
01:58:49.811 --> 01:58:54.610
a Canadian psychiatrist who had worked with LSD psychotherapy and they stopped

2088
01:58:54.611 --> 01:58:59.380
him at the drive through border,
you know,
at Vancouver and interviewed them.

2089
01:58:59.381 --> 01:59:03.070
They've the Wiki PDM and,
and I'm like,
Oh,

2090
01:59:03.071 --> 01:59:07.720
you did a research with Lsd,
have you ever used LSD?
And he said,
yeah,
stamp.

2091
01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:12.750
<v 0>Wow.
He's never allowed in the country.
That's crazy.
That's all.</v>

2092
01:59:12.770 --> 01:59:15.570
Is that only America as far as I know,

2093
01:59:15.810 --> 01:59:19.620
Canada's rough if you get them drunk driving in America,
good luck in,
in Canada.

2094
01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:21.600
Oh really?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
A lot of,
um,

2095
01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:24.240
a lot of fighters have issues getting into Canada for fights.

2096
01:59:24.241 --> 01:59:25.590
A lot of comedians have issues.

2097
01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:29.100
A lot of comedians have had issues getting into the Montreal comedy festival,

2098
01:59:29.101 --> 01:59:32.010
which was one of the big events for standup comedian because of drunk driving.

2099
01:59:32.011 --> 01:59:33.690
Yes.
Cause a drunk driving conviction.

2100
01:59:33.691 --> 01:59:37.640
I need domestic violence or anything like that.
Yeah.
Eddie Bravo had,
um,

2101
01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:41.730
an arrest for having a gun on him legally.
Okay.

2102
01:59:41.731 --> 01:59:45.720
He was a working for a check cashing place and he used to have to carry large

2103
01:59:45.721 --> 01:59:48.570
sums of cash in his car to another location.

2104
01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:52.590
And so he would leave with a check cash company and he had a registered

2105
01:59:52.591 --> 01:59:56.090
concealed carry permit for a gun.
And so,
uh,

2106
01:59:56.100 --> 02:00:00.930
he got pulled over for something and he had to tell the,
uh,
the cop officer,
uh,

2107
02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.520
I worked for checkouts and company.

2108
02:00:02.521 --> 02:00:06.420
I have a legal registered hand gun in my car right now.
It's loaded.

2109
02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:08.720
And then they go,
okay,
hold on a second,

2110
02:00:08.730 --> 02:00:11.460
we're going to put you in handcuffs and we're going to run this.
So they run it.

2111
02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:12.690
They go,
okay.
Checks out.

2112
02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:16.410
They let them go because it was not even supposed to be on his record because it

2113
02:00:16.411 --> 02:00:20.760
was all legal.
It doesn't matter.
Every time he goes to Canada,
they sit him down.

2114
02:00:21.570 --> 02:00:25.500
Tell us about this.
You have a gone on inside you right now.

2115
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.810
You take a gun,
you should to go for the border.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I was,

2116
02:00:30.811 --> 02:00:33.630
I was working for a company.
I was allowed to have this,
like it cut,

2117
02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:37.330
he's got an extra hour every time he goes into Canada.

2118
02:00:37.340 --> 02:00:40.650
It happened to quickly and immigration going into Canada.
What'd you get a,

2119
02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:41.513
what was your issue?

2120
02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:45.150
<v 2>They asked me if I'd ever been convicted of a crime and I said no,</v>

2121
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:50.230
and I go sit down and then they call me over and they said,
uh,

2122
02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:53.850
the guys like,
um,
you said you'd never been convicted of a crime,
correct?
I said,

2123
02:00:53.851 --> 02:00:55.050
yeah.
He said,

2124
02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:59.100
is there anything you'd like to say about Fairbanks Alaska in 1983?

2125
02:01:00.190 --> 02:01:05.190
And I was like,
uh,
yeah,
I got busted in Fairbank's,
you know,

2126
02:01:05.191 --> 02:01:08.580
a for eating a snickers bar in the fucking grocery store and not paying for it.

2127
02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:12.810
And,
but I did two or three days.
It was Memorial Day weekend.
I did three,

2128
02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:16.650
four nights in the prison.
And then the guy said,
you know,

2129
02:01:16.651 --> 02:01:20.270
20 hours of community service and this will disappear from your record and get

2130
02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:21.630
if you don't get arrested in a year.

2131
02:01:22.350 --> 02:01:25.980
So I always say no because I wasn't convicted of anything.

2132
02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:30.030
And they said it would be taken for my record.
And the guy's like,
nope.

2133
02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:34.470
The fact that you were not Alaskan so you're from out of state meant they

2134
02:01:34.471 --> 02:01:38.670
couldn't strike it from your record.
So,
and it's on your FBI record,

2135
02:01:38.671 --> 02:01:42.910
which is we get in Canada.
So he was knicker thief.
Yeah,
I'm a sneaker thief,

2136
02:01:42.911 --> 02:01:43.760
so he's a cool guy.

2137
02:01:43.761 --> 02:01:48.740
I did four days in a fit in a federal medium security prison with no underwear

2138
02:01:48.890 --> 02:01:51.500
for a snickers.
For snickers.
What do you mean with no underwear?

2139
02:01:51.501 --> 02:01:54.840
Were you wearing anything or just naked?
I was a wearing shorts.

2140
02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:59.300
Why didn't you have pants at the grocery store you tell us about because it

2141
02:01:59.301 --> 02:02:03.800
makes it more harrowing.
Come on man.
I was,
I was 19 years old.

2142
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:08.880
That,
yeah.
Will you liked very twink ish.
I was twinkie.
I was very twinkie.
Yeah,

2143
02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:10.690
you were worried it was all going to go down.

2144
02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:14.730
I would've been worried if I were wearing,
you know what?
Anything,
you know,

2145
02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:17.210
survival suit.
But yeah.
Is that even,

2146
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:20.510
isn't that under the amount of money that they could even bust you for
something?

2147
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:22.550
Maybe not.
In the 80s Reagan was in president,

2148
02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:26.690
they were trying to fucking be tough on crime,
just say no.
Yeah.
And also I had a,

2149
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:31.520
I mean what happened was we got in from this 10 day hitch with these two guys

2150
02:02:31.521 --> 02:02:35.930
I'd met on the ferry coming up the inside passage and we had this long hitch

2151
02:02:35.931 --> 02:02:40.730
through the Yukon territory,
all this crazy shit.
And the,
and we get to Fairbanks.

2152
02:02:40.731 --> 02:02:45.020
So the first place we go is the laundromat because we stank,
right?

2153
02:02:45.021 --> 02:02:49.760
We didn't have that special soap,
your defense defense.
So,
and a,

2154
02:02:49.761 --> 02:02:53.120
so we went to the laundromat,
we put everything possible in the washer.

2155
02:02:53.121 --> 02:02:55.700
So all three of us were wearing shorts with no underwear,

2156
02:02:55.701 --> 02:02:57.950
boots with no socks and a jacket with no shirt.

2157
02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:00.170
And then one of the guys was like,
oh,

2158
02:03:00.171 --> 02:03:02.540
he wanted to go to the grocery store because there was a PE fund.

2159
02:03:02.541 --> 02:03:05.480
And he was going to call his girlfriend to let her know that he'd arrived on

2160
02:03:05.481 --> 02:03:07.070
time.
And I was like,
fuck it.

2161
02:03:07.071 --> 02:03:10.220
I'll go over with you and the other guy's gonna stay with the bags or backpacks

2162
02:03:10.221 --> 02:03:13.910
and all that shit.
You know,
watch the clothes.
So I went with him.

2163
02:03:13.911 --> 02:03:17.450
Somebody who was on the phone,
we start pushing a cart around.
We were like,

2164
02:03:17.451 --> 02:03:20.650
you know,
Soviet immigrants,
like,
oh so many kinds of,
you know,

2165
02:03:20.690 --> 02:03:24.320
food here because we'd been living in the woods eating nuts and chocolate and

2166
02:03:24.321 --> 02:03:29.070
LSD for the last 10 days.
And so he,
he opened a,

2167
02:03:29.071 --> 02:03:31.930
a thing of Keifer as first time I'd ever heard of Keifer,

2168
02:03:31.970 --> 02:03:36.060
which is like liquid yogurt and drank that great for your body.
Acidophilus.

2169
02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:40.220
And I,
uh,
I,
for some reason,
eight a snickers bar,

2170
02:03:40.221 --> 02:03:43.400
even though I'd been eating chocolate and not much imagination there.

2171
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:47.540
And then we,
he used the phone,
we ditch the cart and we laughed.

2172
02:03:47.541 --> 02:03:50.810
And so there's some security guy had seen us and turned into a thing.

2173
02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:56.080
This cop showed up and I had a knife in my boot and some grass in my pocket,

2174
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:59.570
both of which were legal at the time in Alaska,

2175
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:04.820
but it was enough to make this cop not like me at all.

2176
02:04:04.850 --> 02:04:06.820
And he was like this,
you know,

2177
02:04:06.850 --> 02:04:11.850
he Napoleonic comp kind of situation and he didn't like smart ass college kids

2178
02:04:11.871 --> 02:04:16.420
from outside coming into Alaska in the summer snickers bar fucking around

2179
02:04:16.670 --> 02:04:21.410
fucking around with Kiefer.
So he took us,
he handcuffed us and took us to prison.

2180
02:04:21.411 --> 02:04:24.590
Fairbank's correctional center.
Did you not have the money for the snickers bar?

2181
02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:27.230
Yeah,
we have plenty of money.
He just didn't want to pay for it.
But it was like,

2182
02:04:27.231 --> 02:04:31.460
well you tell it to the magistrate.
Oh you mean for that now that was just like,

2183
02:04:31.461 --> 02:04:34.760
I don't know what the fuck you're just young and dumb and you know,

2184
02:04:34.761 --> 02:04:37.050
and maybe there was a line or something.
I don't remember.

2185
02:04:37.590 --> 02:04:42.120
We pretended we were shopping so we put like dog food and Shit in the carts,

2186
02:04:42.150 --> 02:04:45.510
you know,
and we ate our stuff and put the,
the package,

2187
02:04:45.511 --> 02:04:48.420
like we were going to pay for it when we checked out.
Right,
right,
right.

2188
02:04:48.421 --> 02:04:52.320
So I don't know what we were just being dumb,
but uh,
yeah.

2189
02:04:52.321 --> 02:04:57.321
So we ended up being taken to this prison and I had a pipe to yeah cause I

2190
02:04:58.171 --> 02:05:00.120
remember when we were,
did the intake,

2191
02:05:00.150 --> 02:05:03.810
the guy that like the prison dude who booked us and you know did the whole

2192
02:05:03.811 --> 02:05:07.350
intake thing,
I was joking with him,
I was like yeah,

2193
02:05:07.351 --> 02:05:10.320
I'm not going to get that pipe and grasp back Emma.
And he was like,

2194
02:05:10.321 --> 02:05:11.670
I don't think so man.
I was like,

2195
02:05:11.671 --> 02:05:15.150
well you know it wouldn't bother me if it just disappeared and was never even

2196
02:05:15.151 --> 02:05:18.480
registered because grass is hard to come by in Alaska wasn't then.

2197
02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:22.680
And so we sort of had a little understanding like I'm cool,
you're cool.

2198
02:05:22.681 --> 02:05:26.070
Cause he was like,
what the fuck you have snickers bar,
why would this guy,

2199
02:05:26.430 --> 02:05:29.490
what's wrong with that cop?
Did you like hit him or something?
And I'm like,
no it,

2200
02:05:29.491 --> 02:05:33.450
you know,
he just had a hair up his ass.
So this guy was cool.

2201
02:05:33.451 --> 02:05:35.640
He saved us because what he did is he said,
look,

2202
02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:38.730
I'm not going to put you guys in with the general population.

2203
02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:42.270
You're going to sleep in the gym at night.
Hope you got some cots,

2204
02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:43.620
you sleep in the gym,

2205
02:05:43.890 --> 02:05:48.390
you never let the other one out of your sight the whole time you're here,

2206
02:05:48.391 --> 02:05:51.180
you go to the bathroom together,
you go to the showers together,

2207
02:05:51.630 --> 02:05:55.620
you watch each other's back and you'll get through it all right.
And we did,

2208
02:05:55.870 --> 02:06:00.720
it was wild and this was like 83,
I guess.
And um,

2209
02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:04.110
so the,
there's a lot of money in Alaska right from all the oil.

2210
02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:08.580
So the prison was plush.
It was like every meal was all you can eat,

2211
02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:12.240
salad bar,
whole wheat rolls,
white roles.

2212
02:06:12.450 --> 02:06:16.470
Wednesday was prime rib day where the cops could pay a buck to eat with the

2213
02:06:16.471 --> 02:06:17.304
prisoners.

2214
02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:21.750
But the catch was you only had 20 minutes each meal.

2215
02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:26.310
So I remember like one day we're sitting there at this table,
we're in like 19,

2216
02:06:26.311 --> 02:06:28.530
maybe 20,
maybe 20,
something like that.

2217
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:33.870
We're sitting at this table and the guy across the table looked like Charles

2218
02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:36.360
Bronson.
You remember him,
the stash and the tats and all that.

2219
02:06:36.930 --> 02:06:37.860
And we were just like,

2220
02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:40.620
this dude was shoveling it in and he looks up at one point he says,

2221
02:06:40.830 --> 02:06:43.110
this is the best fucking prison I've ever been in.

2222
02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:49.830
Yikes.
And you've got a laundry list of prisons that don't,

2223
02:06:50.340 --> 02:06:54.090
don't meet that criteria at the standard.
Yeah,
he,
he,
his story was,

2224
02:06:54.091 --> 02:06:59.091
he founded dude with his wife and he beat him with a lead pipe and he didn't

2225
02:07:00.211 --> 02:07:03.990
know if he was dead,
but as soon as it happened,
he got in his car.

2226
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.390
He was from like New Mexico or Arizona.

2227
02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:10.560
He got his car and drove to Alaska because he knew he'd get picked up and he

2228
02:07:10.561 --> 02:07:13.290
wanted to get picked up in Alaska because he'd heard the prisons were much

2229
02:07:13.291 --> 02:07:16.740
better.
That's hilarious.
So he might've beat a guy to death and said,

2230
02:07:16.741 --> 02:07:19.500
the way to deal with this is to go to a place that I was awesome prisons.

2231
02:07:20.010 --> 02:07:24.980
And that place just happens to be on the exact opposite of the continent fucking

2232
02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.710
far as shit.
It's a long drive to drive to Alaska.

2233
02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:31.260
Can you actually drive straight to Alaska?
The Alcan Highway?
Whoa.

2234
02:07:31.290 --> 02:07:35.700
What is that like?
It's bumpy or at least it was shitty.

2235
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.160
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause you know every winter it gets all torn up.</v>

2236
02:07:39.161 --> 02:07:42.250
And how many lanes is it most of?
It's two lanes.

2237
02:07:42.430 --> 02:07:46.630
One Lane on each side so you can get stuck behind some asshole that wants to go

2238
02:07:46.631 --> 02:07:47.464
40 miles an hour.

2239
02:07:47.490 --> 02:07:51.060
<v 2>Well there's a lot of passing.
I mean it's,
it's a lot of,</v>

2240
02:07:51.061 --> 02:07:55.190
it's just flat and cause like the Yukon's Tundra.
Right.

2241
02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:59.340
It's just like being,
you know,
it's just flat scrub plants.

2242
02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:02.550
<v 4>I can't imagine someone driving all the way the fuck to Alaska.</v>

2243
02:08:02.551 --> 02:08:03.870
That just seems insane.

2244
02:08:03.930 --> 02:08:08.930
I just drove to La from Vancouver by way of Utah that tag 10 days.

2245
02:08:11.310 --> 02:08:15.700
But I mean we stopped and went hiking in Utah.
Trip out of it.
Yeah.

2246
02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:19.570
How many hours was it actual driving?
I don't,
I dunno.

2247
02:08:19.620 --> 02:08:24.420
It was about 6,000 kilometers I think.
Which is what,
4,000 miles?

2248
02:08:24.421 --> 02:08:29.190
Something like that.
3,800 something like that.
Yeah,
I think it's 2.2 per,

2249
02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:32.790
yeah.
Yeah.
2.2 kilometers per mile.
Something along those lines.

2250
02:08:32.791 --> 02:08:34.170
A hundred kilometers of 60 miles.

2251
02:08:34.670 --> 02:08:38.010
So it is something that I want to like 60 miles an hour is 100 kilometers.

2252
02:08:38.070 --> 02:08:42.600
60 to 62 mile now.
Yeah,
that's a,
Utah was great.
Yeah,

2253
02:08:42.601 --> 02:08:46.590
Utah is amazing.
It's so beautiful,
man.
Moab.
Oh

2254
02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:47.031
<v 2>yeah.</v>

2255
02:08:47.031 --> 02:08:52.031
We were in Moab and then I been wanting to go to Moab since the early eighties

2256
02:08:52.311 --> 02:08:56.300
because I'd read this book called the Desert Solitaire by Edward Abbey ever at

2257
02:08:56.301 --> 02:09:00.620
that point.
It's a great book.
Essays about the desert.
He's like,
uh,

2258
02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:05.210
Edward Abbey was like a,
a red neck philosopher,

2259
02:09:05.630 --> 02:09:09.710
hippie.
I mean he just integrated these worldly.
He was like,
uh,

2260
02:09:10.070 --> 02:09:13.790
like who's the singer?
Willie Nelson.
He's like a Willy Nelson kind of author,

2261
02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:17.210
you know,
like country guys from Pennsylvania originally.

2262
02:09:17.211 --> 02:09:22.211
But he moved out west in the 60s and got a job as a fire lookout in arches

2263
02:09:24.051 --> 02:09:27.890
national monument or one of those parks or maybe just canyon lands right there.

2264
02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:31.430
And I spent the summer by himself in this house,
you know,

2265
02:09:31.431 --> 02:09:35.690
just with this incredible view looking for lightening strikes and a,

2266
02:09:35.691 --> 02:09:36.501
and he wrote about,

2267
02:09:36.501 --> 02:09:41.030
he wrote essays and the book became this cult word of mouth classic.

2268
02:09:41.031 --> 02:09:44.780
It's probably sold a million copies by now.
Wow.
It's a great book.

2269
02:09:44.930 --> 02:09:48.890
So I'd want it to go there since I read that book in the early eighties.
And,
uh,

2270
02:09:48.891 --> 02:09:51.740
this was the first chance that guide,
man,
it's amazing.

2271
02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:56.530
<v 4>I have a good buddy who was a living outside of salt lake for a while and then</v>

2272
02:09:56.531 --> 02:09:59.890
he had to move to Arizona and he fucking hates it.
He had to move there for work,

2273
02:09:59.891 --> 02:10:02.980
but he just ranted and raved about how great Utah was.

2274
02:10:03.310 --> 02:10:06.160
And then I went up there this winter to go skiing for the first time.

2275
02:10:06.730 --> 02:10:10.420
I suck at skiing.
That's beside the point.
It's so beautiful up there.

2276
02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:14.830
So God damn gorgeous to me.
Rolling Hills.
And then we were there this summer.

2277
02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:19.360
Um,
we went there the winter to ski and then I was there this summer,
um,

2278
02:10:19.420 --> 02:10:21.010
filming the TV show,
the sci fi show,

2279
02:10:21.011 --> 02:10:25.150
one of the things we did was in Utah and everything was fucking green and

2280
02:10:25.210 --> 02:10:25.961
gorgeous.

2281
02:10:25.961 --> 02:10:28.460
And you just get to see what it looks like when it's not covered in snow.

2282
02:10:28.461 --> 02:10:31.120
And it's like,
oh my God,
this is paradise.
The red

2283
02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:33.980
<v 2>rock country.
Yeah.
Down in,
down in,
you know,
the</v>

2284
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:38.480
<v 4>arches.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just the,
it's just phenomenally beautiful.</v>

2285
02:10:38.690 --> 02:10:42.440
This sell some sweet spots in this country.
Yeah.
I mean,

2286
02:10:42.910 --> 02:10:46.250
the thing for me,
I,
I shit on America a lot.

2287
02:10:46.251 --> 02:10:50.060
Anyone who follows my Twitter feed sees me bitching about America constantly.

2288
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:55.390
But the thing America's got that Europe doesn't have is just incredible natural

2289
02:10:56.661 --> 02:11:01.070
beauty and large scale,
you know,
it's not some little part,
you know,

2290
02:11:01.130 --> 02:11:04.430
like the Grand Canyon,
Yosemite.
Yeah.
I mean,

2291
02:11:04.431 --> 02:11:07.370
but there are just massive chunks of amazing.

2292
02:11:07.850 --> 02:11:10.700
All these parks around Moab are amazing.
Alaska.

2293
02:11:10.701 --> 02:11:14.870
The whole fucking state is just an off the charts man.
Yeah.

2294
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:18.500
Really Nice.
We were in,
um,
Seattle for uh,

2295
02:11:18.530 --> 02:11:23.420
the Scifi show and Dunkin and I went to Mount Rainier and we drove off.

2296
02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:26.650
By the way,
it's only like 50 miles outside of Seattle and it's,

2297
02:11:26.651 --> 02:11:30.620
you're in the mountains from Seattle.
It's like,
it's like a cloud.

2298
02:11:30.990 --> 02:11:34.940
It's massive,
massive of gorgeous.
And just,
it sort of highlights that city.

2299
02:11:34.941 --> 02:11:36.680
I think it's one of the reasons why that city is so cool.

2300
02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:39.530
It's got the ocean there to keep you humble and then it's got this massive

2301
02:11:39.531 --> 02:11:43.730
mountain.
It's like,
listen bitch,
you ain't shit relax.

2302
02:11:44.300 --> 02:11:46.210
But when we drove up there,
I mean Dunkin,

2303
02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:49.040
I could just could not stop like rolling down the window and just sticking our

2304
02:11:49.041 --> 02:11:52.160
heads out and go,
God,
is this real?
It's so gorgeous.

2305
02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:56.630
Just deep rich green with like low clouds everywhere because you know,

2306
02:11:56.631 --> 02:12:00.620
you're pretty high altitude up there in the mountains and it's just the fog and

2307
02:12:00.621 --> 02:12:04.220
the clouds and the trees and it's just so alive in the air.

2308
02:12:04.221 --> 02:12:05.330
You feel like you could eat it.

2309
02:12:05.710 --> 02:12:09.500
It's about when you were watching and we're squashing.
Yes.
It's a technical term.

2310
02:12:09.501 --> 02:12:13.610
Glad you used that.
It's like I follow your,
your movements.
Yeah.

2311
02:12:13.611 --> 02:12:16.610
People who are not squatch enthusiasts don't,
you know,

2312
02:12:16.611 --> 02:12:19.580
they don't know the right terms.
They might say you're out big footing.

2313
02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:23.910
That's not correct.
We were squatch big footing.
That's snowshoeing.
Yeah.

2314
02:12:24.210 --> 02:12:26.180
Wasting your time.
Hey,
easy.

2315
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:30.120
Well one of the things that the guy said that uh,

2316
02:12:30.170 --> 02:12:34.040
we went squashing with this guy,
John,
Steve,
very,
very cool guy there.

2317
02:12:34.041 --> 02:12:36.480
The both guys we went with were very,
very nice guys.

2318
02:12:36.490 --> 02:12:40.680
Took cool actually in the show.
Yeah.
Very,
very cool.
Pretty chill.
Yeah.

2319
02:12:40.681 --> 02:12:43.130
And well one of the things that they said was like,
look man,

2320
02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:46.410
even if there's no big foot,
we're still out here camping.
Yeah.
We're,

2321
02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:50.030
we're having a good time.
It's beautiful woods that we're in.
And like,

2322
02:12:50.031 --> 02:12:51.440
I liked that,
that attitude.

2323
02:12:51.770 --> 02:12:55.670
Well that's what people say about fishing and hunting as well.

2324
02:12:55.671 --> 02:12:59.540
Although it sounds like your,
your trip wasn't as enjoyable sitting in a freezer,

2325
02:12:59.541 --> 02:13:03.650
but it was enjoyable still.
I liked it a lot.
I like suffering a little bit.

2326
02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:06.440
I think it's important to get the fuck out in the woods,
you know,

2327
02:13:06.441 --> 02:13:09.410
and hang out with your buddies and you know,
have a good time.

2328
02:13:09.411 --> 02:13:12.980
And the guy owned the land.
His name is Doug.
Um,
he took me to this one spot.

2329
02:13:13.010 --> 02:13:16.190
We win a hunting and I went up in the tree stand and he,

2330
02:13:16.250 --> 02:13:20.890
he likes to do a lot of his hunting,
walking around.
And so he said,
let's,

2331
02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:22.940
let's split up for a little bit.
I'll go this way.

2332
02:13:22.941 --> 02:13:25.010
You sit in the tree stand and maybe if me walking around,

2333
02:13:25.011 --> 02:13:29.180
sometimes it'll scare a deer towards you.
Um,
and uh,

2334
02:13:29.210 --> 02:13:32.490
when I was sitting there,
it was just me alone for like an hour

2335
02:13:32.490 --> 02:13:34.280
<v 0>and there wasn't a single sound.</v>

2336
02:13:34.710 --> 02:13:36.570
Every now and then I'd hear like a little squirrel chip,

2337
02:13:36.571 --> 02:13:40.530
but there's no TV cameras this time we had basically finished filming what we

2338
02:13:40.531 --> 02:13:43.490
need to film for the show.
So it's just me sitting up there in the stand,

2339
02:13:43.491 --> 02:13:45.060
like looking around,
waiting for a deer show up,

2340
02:13:45.061 --> 02:13:50.061
but just soaking in the beauty of the woods and it's the driftless area of

2341
02:13:50.431 --> 02:13:53.520
Wisconsin,
which means is the area of the glaciers didn't flatten out.

2342
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.000
So it's all hilly and gorgeous and woodsy everywhere and just creeks and you

2343
02:13:59.731 --> 02:14:02.220
know,
it was just God damn it is fucking beautiful.

2344
02:14:02.250 --> 02:14:04.650
Just fucking beautiful and quiet and peaceful.

2345
02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:07.830
And I felt like just sitting there for an hour did me good.

2346
02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:12.360
Just like it cleaned me out somehow.
Like it cleaned my,
my spirit,
you know?

2347
02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:17.240
<v 4>Yeah.
There you,
you mentioned weather earlier and we were talking about,
you know,</v>

2348
02:14:17.670 --> 02:14:21.360
the,
the,
the cleanliness of fear and it,

2349
02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:26.780
there's something about whether that I find deeply relaxing like strong,

2350
02:14:26.810 --> 02:14:31.100
like a storm or a tropical storm,
a hurricane.
You know,

2351
02:14:31.150 --> 02:14:32.360
I'm like one of those guys,

2352
02:14:32.361 --> 02:14:36.400
I would time myself to a tree and just like watch the hurricane come through and

2353
02:14:36.460 --> 02:14:37.040
do that.

2354
02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:42.040
They get hit in the face by a car that that's the downside of fucking tree comes

2355
02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:46.240
by and takes your head off.
You shouldn't do,
you can't duck.
Yeah.

2356
02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:49.610
But I agree with you though.
Like as long as I know it's not life threatening,

2357
02:14:49.611 --> 02:14:52.880
a good thunder showers beautiful.
Even if it is life threatening,

2358
02:14:52.881 --> 02:14:56.690
I mean that's even more cleansing cause it's good to be fucking terrified a

2359
02:14:56.691 --> 02:14:59.390
little bit.
It's good to,
it's,
I mean for me,

2360
02:14:59.391 --> 02:15:04.391
anything that reminds me of how insignificant I am is really liberating.

2361
02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.320
Yeah.
And the problem is when,
when I get caught up in my ego and you know,
the,

2362
02:15:09.650 --> 02:15:13.220
whatever the bullshit is that I need to deal with and Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

2363
02:15:13.670 --> 02:15:17.750
And I forget how,
you know,
it's like the football coach who,
you know,
doesn't,

2364
02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:20.390
isn't smart enough to know how little it all matters.
You know?

2365
02:15:20.810 --> 02:15:24.200
It's like I never want to forget how little it all matters cause then you're,

2366
02:15:24.410 --> 02:15:26.090
then you're screwed.
I agree with you a hundred.

2367
02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:27.590
<v 0>I think it was really important.</v>

2368
02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:31.750
I think as we were saying about whether that dealing with weather is,

2369
02:15:31.940 --> 02:15:35.830
it's important to just to know that you,
you're humbled by nature upon occasion.

2370
02:15:35.831 --> 02:15:39.050
It's one of the things I like about when it rains in la and everybody else to
go,

2371
02:15:39.110 --> 02:15:42.680
oh okay,
yeah,
this could happen to his people that complain about it.

2372
02:15:42.681 --> 02:15:46.640
But I love the fact that they're introduced to the reality of the fact that

2373
02:15:46.641 --> 02:15:48.950
you're living on a planet with an ecosystem and it's variable.

2374
02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:49.873
It's very variable,

2375
02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:52.920
<v 4>right?
Yeah.
Something that that cuts through your,</v>

2376
02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:57.360
I mean I still love it when the lights and,
yeah,
and you're,
you know,

2377
02:15:57.361 --> 02:16:00.930
the infrastructure that yeah,
your complacency.
Exactly.
I mean,

2378
02:16:00.931 --> 02:16:04.680
one of the cool things,
and I've lived in India for four months at a stretch,

2379
02:16:04.681 --> 02:16:08.070
and one of the cool things there is that electricity would go out like

2380
02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:12.600
constantly,
you know,
so cool.
Yeah.
No,
it's not terrible.

2381
02:16:12.601 --> 02:16:16.380
It sucks you.
Food goes bad.
Uh,
they're all covered in flies.

2382
02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:21.760
Me.
Keep me from going there,
please.
I ain't never been to India.
No,

2383
02:16:21.761 --> 02:16:25.530
no.
Dude,
you gotta gotta gotta hit him.
I don't know.
That's what's interesting.

2384
02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:30.100
I don't know.
I don't,
I,
I love Indian food.

2385
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:34.270
I fucking love it.
Yeah.
There's a dish named after me,
lamb,
Rogan,
Josh.

2386
02:16:35.100 --> 02:16:37.250
Oh,
and it's not named after me.
It's just happens to happen.

2387
02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:41.260
I had that last night.
It's delicious.
And somebody's,
Oh fuck.

2388
02:16:41.290 --> 02:16:43.120
Somebody last night told me that story.

2389
02:16:43.121 --> 02:16:48.121
Showed me that recipe in her cookbook and said that something about the person

2390
02:16:48.761 --> 02:16:53.761
who named it got you confused with Seth Rogan or something or Josh somebody.

2391
02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:58.570
Is it an old days?
Yes.
Was that bullshit?

2392
02:16:59.570 --> 02:17:03.790
Fucking retarded.
Oh my God.
You're hanging out with a monkey that first.

2393
02:17:03.970 --> 02:17:05.740
That dish has been around forever.

2394
02:17:06.670 --> 02:17:10.230
Let's find out how long the lamb Rogan Josh.
I was,

2395
02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:13.390
I was hanging with this really sweet woman in Vancouver one night,

2396
02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:16.840
and a lay lady lay came on and she said,

2397
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:19.420
do you know Dylan wrote that song for his dog?

2398
02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:26.680
And she said,
yeah,
he's dog's name was lady.
And he wrote the song for the dog.

2399
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:30.940
Okay.
This is her ex boyfriend had told her that this is from Persia.

2400
02:17:31.390 --> 02:17:35.080
It's one of the signature recipes of Kashmiri cuisine.

2401
02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:39.070
Rogan means clarified butter or fat in Persian,

2402
02:17:39.071 --> 02:17:43.600
while Josh means heat,
hot,
boiling or passionate Rogan.

2403
02:17:43.601 --> 02:17:47.860
Josh dust means cooked in oil and intense heat and other interpretation of the

2404
02:17:47.861 --> 02:17:51.790
name.
Rogan Josh has delivered Deriv derived from the word Rogan,

2405
02:17:51.791 --> 02:17:53.680
meaning red color,
uh,

2406
02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:58.840
the same Indo European root that is the source of the French rogue and the

2407
02:17:58.991 --> 02:18:03.970
Spanish rogue Roho.
Uh,
and Josh meaning passion or heat.

2408
02:18:04.270 --> 02:18:09.160
So there you go.
So this is old shit man.
This is like,
it's named after.
No,
no,

2409
02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:10.990
she's an asshole.

2410
02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:14.740
She should do a Google search or force you fuck it spreads hardened incense.

2411
02:18:15.430 --> 02:18:18.640
It's not me or that beautiful Seth Rogan fellow,

2412
02:18:20.170 --> 02:18:23.740
which by the way,
uh,
I watched uh,
his last movie.
Um,
the,
the,

2413
02:18:23.741 --> 02:18:27.760
this is the end and Holy Shit is that fun?
It is fun.
There are some,

2414
02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:32.800
there are some fucking funny,
funny,
funny moments in that movie,

2415
02:18:33.420 --> 02:18:37.200
but how good is Craig Robinson that Mike,
Sarah was my favorite thing.

2416
02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:42.010
Oh,
he was great.
To a blow job or the Beth.

2417
02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:46.870
How about Kenny powers?
How about Kenny powers?
Oh my God.
It's a fucking amazing.

2418
02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:52.240
The fun about all just taking the piss out of themselves.

2419
02:18:52.241 --> 02:18:54.640
That's what I love about it.
You know,
they're all like,

2420
02:18:54.910 --> 02:18:58.120
I love about Craig Robinson has a towel everywhere he goes and sweat so much,

2421
02:18:58.470 --> 02:19:00.610
which is so true about Craig in real life.
You know,

2422
02:19:00.611 --> 02:19:04.510
he's always got a towel on stage with him.
Oh,
that was really,
really funny.

2423
02:19:04.511 --> 02:19:05.490
Movie Moon.
It was a good,

2424
02:19:05.710 --> 02:19:09.160
did I ever tell you there's this one video of like a fight that broke out in

2425
02:19:09.161 --> 02:19:13.420
like a gymnasium and everyone used even used to have towels more back then

2426
02:19:13.421 --> 02:19:16.690
because like with a towel things kind of knew like and then like last 10 years

2427
02:19:16.691 --> 02:19:20.620
like rappers started having towels all the time and stuff and this whole thing

2428
02:19:20.621 --> 02:19:24.910
is new where they just carry around with a towel that all the time.
No,

2429
02:19:24.940 --> 02:19:25.773
never seen it yet.

2430
02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:29.510
There was this fight that broke out in this gymnasium and they showed the video

2431
02:19:29.511 --> 02:19:33.170
lasted to like everyone got out of the gymnasium and on the ground was just

2432
02:19:33.171 --> 02:19:35.630
towels and the stickers from people's hats.

2433
02:19:36.090 --> 02:19:40.190
Whole area looked like it was a joke.
That's hilarious.

2434
02:19:40.191 --> 02:19:44.040
A big rap battle with towels and stickers.
Yeah.

2435
02:19:44.041 --> 02:19:48.370
I remember when they used to wait like where the the tag on their hat hanging

2436
02:19:48.371 --> 02:19:48.701
from their hat.

2437
02:19:48.701 --> 02:19:53.580
Like Minnie Pearl from the old Opry choose your original gangster many curls

2438
02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:57.650
from,
from the Grand Ole Opry.
She always had a tag on her hat,
man.

2439
02:19:58.340 --> 02:20:01.060
I Dunno what that was about.
Did you hear about that?
That,

2440
02:20:01.061 --> 02:20:06.050
that waitress in New Jersey,
that's,
oh my God,
that's fucking gross story.

2441
02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:10.460
You know the story.
Uh,
not yet about the,
uh,
the lesbian woman.

2442
02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:14.900
She was working as a waitress in this nasty note.
Yeah.

2443
02:20:14.901 --> 02:20:16.550
She got some nasty note that said,

2444
02:20:16.551 --> 02:20:18.790
we are not going to leave a tip because we don't agree with your lifestyle.

2445
02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:23.660
Right.
It's a hoax.
No.
Yes.
Personally,
yes.

2446
02:20:23.661 --> 02:20:28.661
The family started getting shit family brought in the actual original receipt.

2447
02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:33.230
You know how you get a customer copy and a merchant copy?
Yeah.

2448
02:20:33.350 --> 02:20:37.610
Well the customer copy was the one that she left,
but the merchant copy,

2449
02:20:37.850 --> 02:20:38.870
she left blank.
You know,

2450
02:20:38.871 --> 02:20:41.900
sometimes people fuck up and they fill out the wrong one.
Well,

2451
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:45.320
they had the customer copy,
they had a copy of it.
They like,

2452
02:20:45.321 --> 02:20:47.870
they saved it and the merchant copy,

2453
02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:52.130
I don't know if somebody's photo shopped it.
I Dunno what the fuck he can read,

2454
02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:56.240
print these out.
So all she did is just reprinted out and then write it on.

2455
02:20:56.241 --> 02:21:01.241
She wrote on it in a hoax to try to draw attention to herself and sending her

2456
02:21:01.321 --> 02:21:02.154
money.

2457
02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:05.730
Thousands and thousands of dollars that she was going to use and she was going

2458
02:21:05.731 --> 02:21:09.680
to send to something else.
And you know what I mean?
I don't know if who knows?

2459
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:11.720
I mean,
we're accusing her of hoaxing it,

2460
02:21:11.721 --> 02:21:16.010
but it might've been something that her are her,
her staff did.
Right.

2461
02:21:16.011 --> 02:21:19.560
It could have been a hoax on her.
Yes.
We,
no one knows.
And so I think it's,

2462
02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:24.180
we shouldn't,
we shouldn't definitely not accuse someone or you know,

2463
02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:27.380
say that she did it or did she was a liar,
but somebody fucking hoax.

2464
02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:28.580
What's interesting is that,

2465
02:21:28.581 --> 02:21:32.270
I don't know if you heard the family said that the only thing they could think

2466
02:21:32.271 --> 02:21:35.180
of is that the host,
this is Dana is going to be,

2467
02:21:35.210 --> 02:21:38.570
or Dan's going to be your ho a waiter and be here in a second.

2468
02:21:38.571 --> 02:21:42.830
And then when she came up they go,
Oh,
you're definitely not a Dan,
you know,

2469
02:21:42.831 --> 02:21:45.910
or something like that.
Cause her real name's Dana.
And uh,

2470
02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:49.340
so she kind of might've took,
take it as like,
oh,
they're calling me a guy,

2471
02:21:49.370 --> 02:21:51.790
you know?
And that's why she got mad at these people.
Yeah.

2472
02:21:51.860 --> 02:21:55.730
But that still doesn't mean you should hope that and write a fake,
I mean,

2473
02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:57.920
so did they actually did leave her a tip?

2474
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.580
20% or 18% of normal statements?
Yeah,

2475
02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:05.930
they left her like the right amount every month.
Me,
like five years ago,

2476
02:22:05.931 --> 02:22:09.110
I read this story in the International Herald Tribune about a guy,

2477
02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:11.780
this is relates to where we were saying earlier,
a rich guy,

2478
02:22:11.781 --> 02:22:16.781
he millionaire big house who decided to give it all up and uh,

2479
02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:20.990
you know,
give everything away and live a simple life cause that that was happy.

2480
02:22:20.991 --> 02:22:22.760
It would make them happier and the US in that.
Right.

2481
02:22:22.970 --> 02:22:25.950
So when I started working on civilized death,
I

2482
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:29.340
<v 2>found I had this clipping that I had kept for years and I,</v>

2483
02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:31.530
so I googled the dude to see,
you know,

2484
02:22:31.531 --> 02:22:34.800
what's happened with this guy as he's still happy or is he getting another job?

2485
02:22:34.801 --> 02:22:38.750
What's going on?
Turns out it was the whole thing was a hoax.
Oh Wow.

2486
02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:43.590
He owed a bunch of money and he went and he figured out that he would get more

2487
02:22:43.591 --> 02:22:47.430
money if he auctioned his house.
So what he did was he said like,

2488
02:22:47.690 --> 02:22:51.150
and he went to a public relations company and they came up with this whole plan.

2489
02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:53.970
They're like,
he was going to renounce his wealth and all that,

2490
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:57.060
but really behind the scenes,
he had to make money to pay off creditors,

2491
02:22:57.061 --> 02:23:01.980
whatever it was.
And the guys going around the world still giving talks,

2492
02:23:02.010 --> 02:23:03.510
charging lots of money to give,

2493
02:23:03.511 --> 02:23:05.970
talks about how wonderful it is to give up all your money.

2494
02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:09.150
It's all a fucking hoax.
Oh my God.
That's hilarious.
Yeah,

2495
02:23:09.340 --> 02:23:13.390
<v 0>that's hilarious.
This family,
apparently,
not only would they not homophobic,</v>

2496
02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:17.950
they actually wouldn't vote for governor Christie because he didn't agree with

2497
02:23:17.951 --> 02:23:22.360
gay marriage.
So his family was very progressive.
Right.
So it's like,
you know,

2498
02:23:22.390 --> 02:23:25.870
she fucked,
whoever did it fucked up.
Fuck the wrong people.

2499
02:23:25.871 --> 02:23:28.600
They just did something gross.
They did something gross and fake.

2500
02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:31.750
But that's the world that we live in,
man.
You know,

2501
02:23:31.751 --> 02:23:34.870
until we figure out how to tell whether or not people are lying,

2502
02:23:35.020 --> 02:23:37.180
we're going to be dealing with this nonsense for a long time.

2503
02:23:37.230 --> 02:23:39.180
<v 2>Well,
she's the one that came out and said,</v>

2504
02:23:39.450 --> 02:23:43.330
look what these people said and put it on her Instagram or whatever she did and,

2505
02:23:43.350 --> 02:23:46.020
and,
and,
and it's actually a good point.
And so that,

2506
02:23:46.021 --> 02:23:48.450
that showed the wrong amount on there.

2507
02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:53.280
And so they have a credit card statement like going,
no,
this is the right amount.

2508
02:23:53.281 --> 02:23:56.250
Here is my actual copy receipt.
So she had to

2509
02:23:56.370 --> 02:23:58.410
<v 0>have done it.
It must most likely,</v>

2510
02:23:58.411 --> 02:24:02.970
unless someone tricked her and took the good bill away and then rode on the

2511
02:24:02.971 --> 02:24:04.440
other one,
a fake signature.

2512
02:24:04.441 --> 02:24:07.260
And when they gonna have to find out the signatures match and then rode on the

2513
02:24:07.261 --> 02:24:10.080
one with a fake signature,
find out who the fuck wrote that.

2514
02:24:10.081 --> 02:24:11.830
Like they have handwriting experts.
Yeah.

2515
02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:15.750
They could tell if it's a woman's writing or man's writing or transgender.
Hey,

2516
02:24:15.751 --> 02:24:20.070
easy.
A cabbie could be a cabbies writing challenge.
Yeah.

2517
02:24:20.190 --> 02:24:21.630
I don't know.
You know,
I think,

2518
02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:26.640
I think you're going to have bigots for sure.
You're always going to have bigots,

2519
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:29.790
but you're also is going to have like people that are crying out for attention

2520
02:24:29.791 --> 02:24:33.480
and pretend the they've been a victim of bigotry.
You're going to have rape,

2521
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:35.970
but you're also going to have false rape accusations too.

2522
02:24:36.270 --> 02:24:38.820
It's like that's one of the reasons why I'm,

2523
02:24:39.540 --> 02:24:44.540
I'm really against gender identity in the fact that not gender identity but

2524
02:24:45.930 --> 02:24:50.930
sticking with your gender like uniformly and prejudice Li like always I'm on

2525
02:24:52.381 --> 02:24:54.870
team penis,
you know?
I think that's ridiculous.

2526
02:24:54.871 --> 02:24:57.960
I think sticking with your race just as ridiculous,

2527
02:24:58.020 --> 02:25:00.420
sticking with your nationality,
equally ridiculous.

2528
02:25:00.570 --> 02:25:04.320
I've met fantastic people in England.
I've met some awesome folks in Canada.

2529
02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:05.760
It's stupid.

2530
02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:10.530
It's like to categorize people or to like I'm a fucking patriots fan and those

2531
02:25:10.531 --> 02:25:12.960
giants could suck it and it's the same thing.

2532
02:25:12.961 --> 02:25:17.670
You're doing the same thing and it's dumb and it's just as dumb on on all sides.

2533
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:19.710
And until that's resolved,

2534
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:24.400
you're going to always have this cloudy situations until it's impossible for

2535
02:25:24.401 --> 02:25:28.330
someone to rape a woman,
which is never going to happen probably until you know,

2536
02:25:28.390 --> 02:25:31.480
we figured out there's no,

2537
02:25:31.690 --> 02:25:36.380
I mean this is a lot of steps before there's any no violence and no rape is

2538
02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:39.310
going to be a lot of steps for,
there's no theft.
It's going to be probably,

2539
02:25:39.311 --> 02:25:40.690
we're not going to see it in our lifetime,

2540
02:25:41.050 --> 02:25:45.610
but it's possible and that's the only way we're going to have like real harmony

2541
02:25:45.820 --> 02:25:46.571
and these,

2542
02:25:46.571 --> 02:25:51.430
I don't know necessarily how much like pro vagina or pro men's rights groups,

2543
02:25:51.431 --> 02:25:53.560
I don't know how much those things fucking help anybody.

2544
02:25:53.770 --> 02:25:55.600
They create dialogue I guess,

2545
02:25:55.930 --> 02:25:59.830
but I think they also like they'd divide in a lot of ways and they,
you know,

2546
02:25:59.831 --> 02:26:03.280
when people hear the word feminist they almost automatically think,

2547
02:26:03.310 --> 02:26:04.750
oh she fucking hates men.

2548
02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:08.230
They're just a really in women and it creates like a rift.

2549
02:26:08.350 --> 02:26:10.570
When you heal men's rights organization,
what do you think?

2550
02:26:10.571 --> 02:26:14.860
I think misogynists I think fat,
Lazy Misogynists who women don't like.

2551
02:26:14.861 --> 02:26:16.990
So they come up with a bunch of reasons why women suck.

2552
02:26:17.650 --> 02:26:21.160
And that's not necessarily correct on either side,
but it's still,

2553
02:26:21.161 --> 02:26:25.150
that's the automatic stereotype that waitress who lied about it,

2554
02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:27.370
gay tip has told far worst laws.

2555
02:26:28.190 --> 02:26:32.910
<v 2>She used to tell her that she had survived brain cancer,
that she did,</v>

2556
02:26:32.930 --> 02:26:37.380
uh,
when in Afghanistan and all her people in her army thing blew up.

2557
02:26:37.381 --> 02:26:39.570
And she was the only survivor,
which she never even toured.

2558
02:26:39.571 --> 02:26:43.970
And Afghanistan kicked out of incriminating.
Go ahead.

2559
02:26:44.850 --> 02:26:47.940
Let's get off her.
I don't want to dwell on that.
Poor soul,
you know,

2560
02:26:47.941 --> 02:26:49.800
I agree with what you're saying.

2561
02:26:49.801 --> 02:26:54.330
I think that the source of all this,

2562
02:26:55.290 --> 02:26:58.500
all these problems is scale.

2563
02:26:58.710 --> 02:27:02.640
It gets back to population levels and,
and the size of communities,
right?

2564
02:27:02.850 --> 02:27:04.980
If you've ever heard of Dunbar's number's yeah.

2565
02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:09.480
So when you get above Dunbar's number,
other people become abstractions,
right?

2566
02:27:09.481 --> 02:27:13.470
It became like Stalin who said hundred and 50 people,
right?
Stalin said one,

2567
02:27:13.471 --> 02:27:17.160
death is a tragedy.
1 million deaths is a statistic.
Right?
And so it's,

2568
02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:21.810
and it does become like that.
So if you're,
you know,
like in her case,

2569
02:27:21.811 --> 02:27:26.460
she might say,
well,
I wasn't lying to anybody.
I didn't know those people.
Right.

2570
02:27:26.461 --> 02:27:30.390
I mean,
you know,
people sending me money,
they can,
obviously they can spare it,

2571
02:27:30.420 --> 02:27:32.570
you know,
and I needed,
and you know,

2572
02:27:32.571 --> 02:27:35.550
you can make all sorts of excuses because you're not talking directly to the

2573
02:27:35.551 --> 02:27:39.010
person you fucked,
you know?
Whereas when,

2574
02:27:39.011 --> 02:27:40.620
and it's the same thing in the legal system,

2575
02:27:40.621 --> 02:27:42.840
you get minimum mandatory sentencing,
you know,

2576
02:27:42.841 --> 02:27:47.130
so all these people are going away to fucking prison for 15 years to life for,

2577
02:27:47.310 --> 02:27:50.370
you know,
and the judge is like this dude sitting right in front of me.

2578
02:27:50.371 --> 02:27:54.840
I know I can see this person as an individual.
He doesn't deserve this,
you know?

2579
02:27:54.841 --> 02:27:58.650
But because it's institutionalized,
I have to do it.

2580
02:27:59.130 --> 02:28:00.030
And so I,

2581
02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:04.710
I really think that as long as we're living in these massive societies where

2582
02:28:04.980 --> 02:28:08.700
we're constantly dealing with people we don't know in any personal way,

2583
02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:13.080
there's always going to be that sense of emptiness and the abuse of trust.

2584
02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:15.550
<v 0>Yeah.
I think you're 100% right.</v>

2585
02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:19.390
I think we have a real hard time dealing with large numbers of people.

2586
02:28:19.630 --> 02:28:21.980
You get this weird detachment,

2587
02:28:21.981 --> 02:28:25.520
like I was saying about Jimmy Norton living in this box with a thousand people

2588
02:28:25.521 --> 02:28:29.420
that he doesn't know this,
this.
And also I wanted to get back to this.

2589
02:28:29.421 --> 02:28:32.480
We were talking about earlier about New York after the twin towers.

2590
02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:37.840
We film fear factor in New York and I think it was 2002 or maybe 2003 at the

2591
02:28:38.721 --> 02:28:39.530
latest.

2592
02:28:39.530 --> 02:28:44.530
And it was palpable how friendly people were and what a change it had made and

2593
02:28:45.531 --> 02:28:46.490
what a sense of community.

2594
02:28:46.730 --> 02:28:51.730
We had a woman who is with us who may or may not have smoked some of my weed and

2595
02:28:52.071 --> 02:28:53.720
uh,
she was,
uh,

2596
02:28:53.721 --> 02:28:58.220
one of the crew and a May or may not have been ready for some of my weed and

2597
02:28:58.280 --> 02:29:01.640
Blacktown and actually fainted on the street.

2598
02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:05.540
And we had a catcher like,
uh,
we were all sitting around.
I'm like,

2599
02:29:05.541 --> 02:29:07.910
you guys want to get high?
Maybe allegedly.
I said that.

2600
02:29:08.090 --> 02:29:12.230
And we went outside and um,
she,
she literally lost consciousness.

2601
02:29:12.290 --> 02:29:16.550
So the firemen came and when the firemen came over,
first of all,

2602
02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:18.980
they could have been more friendly and uh,
you know,

2603
02:29:18.981 --> 02:29:20.090
they were really nice to her and everything,

2604
02:29:20.091 --> 02:29:24.710
but the amount of love the firemen were getting from people on the street waving

2605
02:29:24.711 --> 02:29:27.380
to them honking at the,
um,
you know,

2606
02:29:27.381 --> 02:29:31.430
like a set is yelling and shouting nice things to cross the street.
You know,

2607
02:29:31.910 --> 02:29:35.400
somebody yelled something about I love first responders or some,

2608
02:29:35.450 --> 02:29:38.120
something along those lines and they wave to them.
And there was like this,

2609
02:29:38.390 --> 02:29:41.030
this feeling of appreciation and camaraderie.

2610
02:29:41.250 --> 02:29:44.960
<v 2>Think about the American soldiers going into France.
Yeah.
And World War II,</v>

2611
02:29:44.980 --> 02:29:48.310
the amount of love they were again.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
man.
Yeah.

2612
02:29:48.390 --> 02:29:53.040
Save us from this fucking Har.
Yeah.
I mean,
it's real life and that's the thing.

2613
02:29:53.041 --> 02:29:57.120
Then we can go through an entire lifetime without ever really experiencing real

2614
02:29:57.121 --> 02:30:00.900
life.
We don't see death.
I mean,
I don't know how many dead bodies you've seen,

2615
02:30:00.901 --> 02:30:01.950
but you know,

2616
02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:06.810
I think my grandmother is the only dead body I ever saw and I got to kiss her on

2617
02:30:06.811 --> 02:30:10.980
the fucking lips,
which was pretty creepy.
I saw my grandfather.
Yeah,
same,

2618
02:30:10.981 --> 02:30:15.270
same sort of situation.
Do you ever,
you know this mortician ask a mortician,

2619
02:30:15.790 --> 02:30:18.430
uh,
Caitlin,
Caitlin Dodi,

2620
02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.720
she'd be a funny guests for you to or meet or just to hang out.

2621
02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:23.610
She's just like a hip,
young,

2622
02:30:23.611 --> 02:30:28.611
sexy mortician and she's got a show called ask a mortician that's like,

2623
02:30:29.071 --> 02:30:32.430
gets hundreds of thousands of hits,
a hip,
young,
sexy mortician.

2624
02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:36.030
Ask a mortician ask.
That sounds ridiculous.

2625
02:30:36.170 --> 02:30:39.660
I had her on my podcast,
she was fantastic.
She's,

2626
02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:44.290
she's just fascinated by death and uh,
know there she is.

2627
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:48.900
She is pretty hot.
She's damn,

2628
02:30:48.901 --> 02:30:50.850
she's hot from mortician,
but still,

2629
02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:56.130
that's just so weird that she's doing.
And Her story is cool,
man.

2630
02:30:56.880 --> 02:31:01.200
How cool could it really be?
What she's,
I mean,
it's really cool because,
you know,

2631
02:31:01.201 --> 02:31:04.560
the thing is we come to these moments in our lives where we have to face death

2632
02:31:04.561 --> 02:31:07.140
and we get some creepy dude in a bad suit,
you know,

2633
02:31:07.141 --> 02:31:09.120
selling us overpriced by the way.

2634
02:31:09.150 --> 02:31:13.380
What's going on with a $12,000 hermetically sealed stainless steel coffin?

2635
02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:15.090
What the fuck are we saying?

2636
02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:18.060
<v 0>Yeah.
We're saying we're ripping you off.
Yeah.</v>

2637
02:31:18.090 --> 02:31:22.170
Joey Diaz has good line on that because it's one of his buddies that he went to

2638
02:31:22.260 --> 02:31:26.370
school with.
Uh,
his family owned a funeral parlor and a,

2639
02:31:26.371 --> 02:31:29.640
they were just pretty open about what a rip off it is and how they scam you and

2640
02:31:29.641 --> 02:31:33.420
how they get you in,
in the period where you're in great grief.
And they say,

2641
02:31:33.421 --> 02:31:33.751
you know,

2642
02:31:33.751 --> 02:31:37.380
wouldn't you like to represent your family in a very beautiful way and we can

2643
02:31:37.381 --> 02:31:41.970
offer this fantastic walnut lined coffin.
This is the finest Valore

2644
02:31:42.110 --> 02:31:46.630
<v 2>interior,
finest.
The lure.
And you know,
all these people are,
yeah,</v>

2645
02:31:46.700 --> 02:31:47.330
<v 0>they're there.</v>

2646
02:31:47.330 --> 02:31:50.930
They don't want to feel bad that they're not taking care of their loved ones.

2647
02:31:50.931 --> 02:31:53.510
So they spend insane amounts of money.

2648
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:56.680
And then there's a scam where even if you want to,
um,

2649
02:31:57.530 --> 02:32:00.320
to cremate someone,
you still have to embalm the body.

2650
02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:04.060
So they have to embalm the body,
prepare it for preservation.

2651
02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:08.010
<v 2>Know the embalming.
Kaitlin and I talked about this.
That's American.</v>

2652
02:32:08.011 --> 02:32:11.610
Nobody else in ballroom spa.
Yeah.
This whole like take out the blood,

2653
02:32:11.611 --> 02:32:15.540
put in toothpaste that's American and you know where it came from.
Where?

2654
02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:18.750
Civil war really.
Yeah.
Because they wanted to,

2655
02:32:18.960 --> 02:32:22.950
so many guys are dying in their families wanted to bury the body back home on

2656
02:32:22.951 --> 02:32:26.970
the farm,
you know,
so the guy dies down in,
you know,
wherever Georgia,

2657
02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:30.210
they have to get the body back to Pennsylvania.
It's going to rot,
you know,

2658
02:32:30.211 --> 02:32:32.670
cause it's going in a wagon behind a horse or something.

2659
02:32:32.970 --> 02:32:36.330
So that's when they started the embalming things so they could get the bodies

2660
02:32:36.331 --> 02:32:40.800
back home and it's just wow.
It just took off and became an American tradition

2661
02:32:40.910 --> 02:32:44.240
<v 0>and it became also one of those things where it becomes a part of the system,</v>

2662
02:32:44.500 --> 02:32:47.150
you know,
once,
once something is in the system,
right.

2663
02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:51.440
It becomes an issue where it's really difficult to change that it becomes,
yeah.

2664
02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:55.490
It's like one of the problems with making drugs illegal.
It's like,
well,
okay,

2665
02:32:55.491 --> 02:32:58.160
what about all these people that make their living off arresting people for

2666
02:32:58.161 --> 02:32:59.620
drugs?
You know,

2667
02:32:59.630 --> 02:33:03.710
and that's one of the main issues with as far as lobbying is concerned,

2668
02:33:03.920 --> 02:33:06.620
is police guard or a prison guard unions,
right?

2669
02:33:06.680 --> 02:33:10.130
Prison guard unions spent a lot of money to make sure that certain drugs remain

2670
02:33:10.131 --> 02:33:10.930
legal

2671
02:33:10.930 --> 02:33:14.760
<v 2>in the,
in the companies that make these private prisons.
Yes.
You know,</v>

2672
02:33:14.761 --> 02:33:17.970
the state has to guarantee them in 98% occupancy.

2673
02:33:19.050 --> 02:33:23.040
So you got to come up with the bodies.
Oh my God,
that's so fucking crazy.

2674
02:33:23.060 --> 02:33:26.940
Or funny example of that is in Spanish.
Funny.
But you know,

2675
02:33:27.030 --> 02:33:29.580
the less tragic,
I guess,
example in Spain,

2676
02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:33.240
they've got an industry of dubbing films and TV shows.

2677
02:33:33.570 --> 02:33:35.400
So La and it's really advanced.

2678
02:33:35.401 --> 02:33:38.790
So like the guy who does woody Allen always does woody Allen.

2679
02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.850
So Spanish people associate that voice with Woody Allen.

2680
02:33:42.090 --> 02:33:47.040
And apparently it's a real art form.
Right.
Whereas in Portugal subtitles,
it's,

2681
02:33:47.041 --> 02:33:50.850
everything has been subtitled forever.
So there's no tradition of dubbing,

2682
02:33:51.380 --> 02:33:56.160
dubbing industry in Portugal.
So you go to Portugal,
everybody speaks English,

2683
02:33:56.370 --> 02:33:57.870
the guy checking you,
you know,

2684
02:33:58.500 --> 02:34:02.220
taking your money at the gas station speaks English because he grew up watching

2685
02:34:02.221 --> 02:34:05.950
American programming with Portuguese subtitles,
hearing the voice,

2686
02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:10.380
the voices speaking English.
Right.
Just pick it up in Spain,

2687
02:34:10.470 --> 02:34:11.520
nobody speaks English.

2688
02:34:11.521 --> 02:34:14.970
So people like me go there and make a lot of money teaching English because

2689
02:34:14.971 --> 02:34:18.310
they've got this stupid dubbing system.
So they're probably like two dozen,

2690
02:34:18.311 --> 02:34:20.500
three dozen people make a living doing this.

2691
02:34:20.890 --> 02:34:25.690
And they're completely fucking the entire country just so they don't lose their

2692
02:34:25.691 --> 02:34:28.670
jobs.
You know?
That's fascinating.
Yeah.

2693
02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:33.720
Hundreds of millions of euros spent if not billions on English classes and it's

2694
02:34:33.851 --> 02:34:38.040
completely unnecessary.
Just get rid of those 30 guys who make a living dubbing.

2695
02:34:38.041 --> 02:34:40.820
It's,
I'll have to learn English or not.

2696
02:34:41.350 --> 02:34:42.630
Well they won't have to learn it cause they'll,

2697
02:34:42.631 --> 02:34:46.870
they'll grow up watching it on TV and hearing it.
Wow.
Yeah.
That's wild.

2698
02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:48.161
Yeah.

2699
02:34:48.161 --> 02:34:50.950
There's a lot of weird things like that where something becomes a part of the

2700
02:34:50.951 --> 02:34:52.390
system and even though it's illogical,

2701
02:34:52.391 --> 02:34:54.940
it just remains because it's attribute board it right in front of you.

2702
02:34:55.180 --> 02:34:57.520
Courtney folks don't know.

2703
02:34:57.521 --> 02:35:01.990
Explain that well the keyboard,
the,
the layout of the keyboard,

2704
02:35:01.991 --> 02:35:06.991
the placement of the letters is the way it is because of frequency of use.

2705
02:35:07.241 --> 02:35:08.790
And so they tried to,

2706
02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:13.960
to space the letters out so that you wouldn't hit two letters that were next to

2707
02:35:15.281 --> 02:35:16.001
each other that we're,

2708
02:35:16.001 --> 02:35:19.060
the arm came up on the typewriter so that the arms would tangle.

2709
02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:24.540
So they tried to make it so that the arms that came up would be spaced out.

2710
02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:27.280
So they laid out the keyboard that way.

2711
02:35:27.430 --> 02:35:31.960
So it's a very inefficient way to have a keyboard because it's not,

2712
02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:35.380
it's based upon the demands of a machine that no longer exists.

2713
02:35:35.650 --> 02:35:37.730
It's not based upon ease of use,

2714
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:42.160
which I mean really that's a metaphor for society in general.

2715
02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:44.470
This is what I've been saying the whole time,
you know,

2716
02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:46.840
like the interest of the corporation,

2717
02:35:46.841 --> 02:35:51.310
the interests of these institutions supersede the interest of the person.

2718
02:35:52.030 --> 02:35:55.120
So people always say to me when I get into these arguments about human nature,

2719
02:35:55.121 --> 02:35:57.580
like yeah,
but we're people we can decide,
you know,

2720
02:35:57.581 --> 02:36:00.730
we can free will and Yada Yada Ya.
But you know,

2721
02:36:00.731 --> 02:36:04.820
you do want a shoe that's more or less shaped like a foot,
right?

2722
02:36:05.530 --> 02:36:10.410
If your shoes strays too far from the shape of a foot,
you're fucked.
Yeah.

2723
02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:13.510
And so the,
yeah,
the keyboard is a good example of that.

2724
02:36:13.511 --> 02:36:16.650
They made one that's like,
oh yeah,
oh yeah,

2725
02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:20.440
there's a much more efficient key layout.
But the problem is you would have to,

2726
02:36:20.441 --> 02:36:22.120
first of all,
you'd have to change your key.

2727
02:36:22.121 --> 02:36:25.180
You'd have to bring it to a place and get it done.
Or you get a,
if you have a,

2728
02:36:25.210 --> 02:36:29.380
an actual external keyboard,
you can get it and learn it.
But it's,

2729
02:36:29.381 --> 02:36:32.580
it's really weird and you'd have to relearn.
Yeah.

2730
02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:34.750
So there's this vested interest is like,

2731
02:36:34.810 --> 02:36:37.570
I can type pretty goddamn fast and I don't have to look at it.

2732
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:39.580
I can just do it like while I'm talking to you.

2733
02:36:39.581 --> 02:36:43.400
As long as I feel those little nubs on the f and the J,
I'm good to go.
Yeah.

2734
02:36:43.570 --> 02:36:46.930
But I know where the system is.
I know where everything is.
Yeah.

2735
02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:49.270
Apparently though it's not the best way.

2736
02:36:49.330 --> 02:36:53.680
And the other way is like statistically quite a bit faster.
It's like x,

2737
02:36:53.681 --> 02:36:57.640
Esperanto.
What's that?
Esperanto is this,
um,

2738
02:36:58.570 --> 02:36:58.991
like a,

2739
02:36:58.991 --> 02:37:03.760
an artificial language that was invented I think late 19th century.

2740
02:37:03.820 --> 02:37:07.240
Not Ebonics.
Do you know that I,

2741
02:37:07.570 --> 02:37:12.490
on my resume I have that USP bottlenecks to English translator.

2742
02:37:12.610 --> 02:37:15.350
That's a good one.
I have been paid.
Really?

2743
02:37:15.530 --> 02:37:17.670
I have been paid to translate from Ebonics.

2744
02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:19.970
Danglish so you like that lady on the movie airplane?

2745
02:37:23.180 --> 02:37:25.910
This friend of mine was,
uh,
how much do you get paid for that?

2746
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:27.080
I got paid pretty heavy,

2747
02:37:27.081 --> 02:37:29.480
whatever it was back when I was teaching English in Spain.

2748
02:37:29.481 --> 02:37:32.810
I was living in Barcelona and this friend of mine was a Hispanic woman,

2749
02:37:32.811 --> 02:37:35.540
was a translator for an independent film festival,

2750
02:37:35.541 --> 02:37:39.230
but they have every year in Barcelona called Ian Edit.
And,
uh,

2751
02:37:39.231 --> 02:37:44.150
so she calls me up and she says,
Hey,
Chris,
do you,
do you understand black people?

2752
02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:50.270
And I thought she meant conceptually.
Yeah.
I was like,
yeah,
you get it.

2753
02:37:50.271 --> 02:37:54.290
Definitely some,
you know,
whatever.
Uh,
as much as I understand anyway.

2754
02:37:54.291 --> 02:37:57.190
And she's like,
no,
no.
The way they talk,
like,
Oh yeah,
whatever.

2755
02:37:57.430 --> 02:38:02.190
So the story was that that year the films were all about the original,
um,

2756
02:38:02.300 --> 02:38:06.230
bebop guys,
the origins of hip hop in Brooklyn in the 70s,
I guess,

2757
02:38:06.650 --> 02:38:11.480
and Delta Blues Man.
And so the Spanish translators who spoke English very,

2758
02:38:11.481 --> 02:38:14.690
very well would listen to these dudes and they couldn't understand what they

2759
02:38:14.691 --> 02:38:18.290
were saying.
So they had me come down the first,
they had called a black guy,

2760
02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:22.100
but he was British and he didn't understand them,
right?
So then they're like,

2761
02:38:22.101 --> 02:38:25.060
well,
I know a white guy,
but he's American.
So I,

2762
02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:27.920
my job was to go down and sit there next to a translator,

2763
02:38:27.921 --> 02:38:31.850
watch this DVD with the pause thing and just,
you know,
pause.
They're like,

2764
02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:34.700
you know,
the dude would be like,
yeah,
we're up in my crib.

2765
02:38:34.701 --> 02:38:35.560
And it's like a stop light.

2766
02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:37.990
That means they went back to his apartment and I continued,

2767
02:38:38.930 --> 02:38:40.940
I didn't even have to translate it into Spanish.

2768
02:38:41.090 --> 02:38:44.780
I also was the in house editor and translator for the biggest porn company in

2769
02:38:44.781 --> 02:38:47.270
the world.
Whoa.
Private.
Yeah,

2770
02:38:47.330 --> 02:38:50.600
inhouse translator and editor.
Yeah.

2771
02:38:50.630 --> 02:38:55.100
So you had to translate American porn to ain't to Spanish.
I try it again.

2772
02:38:55.101 --> 02:39:00.101
What I pretty much stayed in that job was translate from bad English to better

2773
02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:04.760
English because they had someone else who would like do the rough translation

2774
02:39:04.761 --> 02:39:07.940
and then they'd email me the documents and I just had to go through and clean it

2775
02:39:07.941 --> 02:39:11.420
up.
And they're funny things.
Like for example,

2776
02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:14.540
in German tail,

2777
02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:17.330
the word tail refers to penis.

2778
02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:20.870
So I remember one of the first ones I was translating it was like for some

2779
02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:23.030
hardcore porn mag,
you know,
and,

2780
02:39:23.630 --> 02:39:27.980
and there were two dudes wagging their tails.
Yeah.

2781
02:39:27.981 --> 02:39:31.760
And one of the dudes are,
the woman looked at the dudes and it was and was like,

2782
02:39:31.790 --> 02:39:36.410
Oh,
you guys have nice tails or a nice tail.
And I was like,
Whoa,

2783
02:39:36.411 --> 02:39:40.310
wait a minute.
An English Tales,
the,
you know,
the woman.
It's completely different.

2784
02:39:40.530 --> 02:39:43.340
But anyway,
that was,
that was a weird gig.
That was,

2785
02:39:43.370 --> 02:39:47.360
that was the Gig that strangely enough led me to meet Paul locaway.
Yo,

2786
02:39:47.361 --> 02:39:51.770
the Brazilian writer,
you know him,
he wrote the alchemist,

2787
02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:55.160
like the best selling book in the history of humanity.

2788
02:39:55.430 --> 02:39:58.890
What is the alchemist about the alchemist is this,
um,

2789
02:39:59.210 --> 02:40:03.560
is a story about,
uh,
the product prodigal son.
It's,

2790
02:40:03.561 --> 02:40:07.100
it's what Joseph Campbell called the hero with a thousand faces,
right?

2791
02:40:07.101 --> 02:40:11.420
It's a guy born in southern Spain.
Uh,
has,

2792
02:40:11.421 --> 02:40:14.580
goes on a quest,
goes through northern Africa,

2793
02:40:14.610 --> 02:40:19.410
meets all these characters and their,
give them challenges and tests and things.

2794
02:40:19.411 --> 02:40:22.080
And then he goes through the test and he goes back home and he finds the

2795
02:40:22.081 --> 02:40:26.070
treasure he was looking for all the time.
Right.
The Odyssey.
It's the same story.

2796
02:40:26.220 --> 02:40:28.050
It's not a good book.
I'm not recommending it.

2797
02:40:28.051 --> 02:40:31.830
It just sold more books than any book since the Bible.
Really?
Yeah.

2798
02:40:31.831 --> 02:40:36.660
It's a huge bestseller.
Paul Oakway use an industry like you go to a bookstore,

2799
02:40:36.661 --> 02:40:41.430
there'll be a Paulo keyway yo stand with,
but they're not good books there.

2800
02:40:41.431 --> 02:40:43.590
It's new age bullshit.
You know,

2801
02:40:43.591 --> 02:40:46.560
it takes the oldest story in the world.

2802
02:40:46.590 --> 02:40:50.600
Retells it and calls it knew and loved.
It makes a lot of money.

2803
02:40:51.210 --> 02:40:56.010
They do this knowing that something's wrong and searching for an answer and

2804
02:40:56.011 --> 02:40:59.070
finding one that has the most mystical qualities attached to it.

2805
02:40:59.490 --> 02:41:03.540
That's new age bullshit,
isn't it?
It is.
Do you know a Jamie and Swiss?

2806
02:41:03.541 --> 02:41:06.420
The Magician?
No,
it was interviewing him.
He's,

2807
02:41:06.421 --> 02:41:09.510
he's like the world's most famous closeup magician.

2808
02:41:09.511 --> 02:41:13.560
He'll do shit in front of you on a table that will blow your fucking mind.

2809
02:41:13.950 --> 02:41:18.510
Anyway,
he said the worst.
He said smart people are the easiest to trick.
Really?

2810
02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:23.220
Yeah.
Because they're there.
Predict their attention is predictable.

2811
02:41:23.221 --> 02:41:24.450
You know where they're going to look.

2812
02:41:24.451 --> 02:41:27.260
You can pull their attention where you want.
They're well trained.

2813
02:41:27.630 --> 02:41:31.380
Kids are really tough cause kids will look where they're not supposed to look.

2814
02:41:31.980 --> 02:41:36.600
And he said he hates doing magic for new agers because they already believe in

2815
02:41:36.601 --> 02:41:37.770
all this bullshit.
So it's like

2816
02:41:39.420 --> 02:41:42.780
you already believe that Crystal's going to save you that you know what I do?

2817
02:41:42.780 --> 02:41:45.300
Is it really going to impress you?
Oh,
it's like,
yeah.

2818
02:41:45.301 --> 02:41:49.030
It's like selling fake real estate to mentally handicapped people.
Yeah.

2819
02:41:49.050 --> 02:41:51.240
There's no challenge.
What are you doing there?
That's not a skill.

2820
02:41:51.241 --> 02:41:54.300
It's like what Bernie Madoff did.
That's Goddamn scam.

2821
02:41:54.330 --> 02:41:57.050
The very sophisticated scam and probably there's a lot of satisfaction.

2822
02:41:57.070 --> 02:42:00.750
Tricia tricking all these really smart people to give me your money.
Yeah.

2823
02:42:00.751 --> 02:42:04.290
But it's also a very simple,
right.
You know,
warm in with more money.

2824
02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:07.290
You know what works for him.
Even though people were looking at the numbers,

2825
02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:09.510
this is fucking,
this doesn't even make any sense.

2826
02:42:09.511 --> 02:42:11.700
Like where's this money coming from?
Like doesn't make any sense.

2827
02:42:11.730 --> 02:42:15.660
You can't do that trick on someone who's not greedy.
It's true,
right?
Yeah.

2828
02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:18.360
Somebody Frugal and smart and conservative,
they were like,
Ooh,

2829
02:42:18.361 --> 02:42:22.440
this does not seem like it makes sense.
Ooh,
I'm going to get out.
I don't need it.

2830
02:42:22.441 --> 02:42:23.940
But Spielberg is like,
listen,
I'm telling you,

2831
02:42:23.941 --> 02:42:25.530
the guy's giving me 20% of my investment.

2832
02:42:26.490 --> 02:42:29.520
So many people lost money with that guy too.
Like big,
big,
big people.

2833
02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:33.710
Lots of fucking money.
Lots of money.
Yeah.

2834
02:42:33.870 --> 02:42:37.620
I was working in the 80s after Alaska if they went there two years and then I

2835
02:42:37.621 --> 02:42:39.780
got this job and the dye lived there for two whole years.
Well,

2836
02:42:39.781 --> 02:42:43.800
two summers I worked on in a cannery the first year and on a boat.

2837
02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:47.100
Salmon.
Yeah.
What do they do?
How do they do that?

2838
02:42:47.101 --> 02:42:50.610
They boil the fish and then just chopping the cube.
Oh Man.
It was,
it was,

2839
02:42:50.810 --> 02:42:55.710
it was very intense.
I worked in Kenai,
Kenai packers still remember him.

2840
02:42:55.711 --> 02:42:59.970
Respect.
Uh,
and I lived in my tent up on the bluff.

2841
02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:04.290
You lived in a tent?
Yeah.
All summer.
You got like a individual tent,

2842
02:43:04.830 --> 02:43:07.610
like a small town,
big tent where a bunch of people living in it.

2843
02:43:08.140 --> 02:43:11.440
It was just my 10 no,
it was a,

2844
02:43:11.441 --> 02:43:13.180
it was a three man,

2845
02:43:13.210 --> 02:43:18.210
a geodesic dome tent and at one point we got eight people in there having the

2846
02:43:18.251 --> 02:43:20.530
party.
Yeah,
that was pretty fun in the rain.

2847
02:43:20.531 --> 02:43:24.010
We all had to sit with our legs over each other,
you know,
in a circle.

2848
02:43:24.011 --> 02:43:28.630
And we're passing the wine and the joints around in the circle.
Oh Wow.
And uh,

2849
02:43:28.660 --> 02:43:31.450
playing footsies,
that was the first time I ever saw anyone light a fart.

2850
02:43:31.790 --> 02:43:36.690
And it was a historic moment in my life.
I've never seen that.
I've seen,

2851
02:43:36.691 --> 02:43:40.540
I started a video online.
Nope.
It does,

2852
02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:45.090
it eliminates the stink.
Yeah.
Kills the methane,
right?
Yeah.
And uh,

2853
02:43:45.810 --> 02:43:50.620
so I was living there.
So the way the way it works is the fish come in and uh,

2854
02:43:50.650 --> 02:43:52.720
you know,
you can get jobs because when the fish come in,

2855
02:43:52.721 --> 02:43:55.510
they have to process them fast because they're rotting.
Right.

2856
02:43:55.900 --> 02:44:00.730
So the fish come in,
uh,
they go through this,
they come off the boats,

2857
02:44:00.731 --> 02:44:01.870
they go through this machine,

2858
02:44:01.871 --> 02:44:06.871
this big clanking machine that they called the Chink.

2859
02:44:07.210 --> 02:44:10.600
And I thought it was called the chink cause it like,
you know,
changing,
changing.

2860
02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:14.230
And one day I asked one of the foreman and he said,
oh no,

2861
02:44:14.231 --> 02:44:16.660
it's called the chink because Chinese used to do that job

2862
02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:21.940
and the job was to rip off the head and,

2863
02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:26.100
and get the you as much of the guts as possible.
So then the,

2864
02:44:26.260 --> 02:44:30.610
the fish go onto these conveyor belts and they come down the slime line and

2865
02:44:30.611 --> 02:44:34.930
that's where I was.
I was a slime monkey the first year.
So you stand there,

2866
02:44:35.140 --> 02:44:38.770
you've got it's piping cold water spraying on a cutting board.

2867
02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:43.180
You're wearing rain gear,
uh,
ear plugs because it's so loud.

2868
02:44:43.450 --> 02:44:47.500
You got a knife in your hand,
gloves and you're just gutting the fish all day.

2869
02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:50.650
You're getting what the Chink missed.
Sometimes it bid missed everything.

2870
02:44:50.651 --> 02:44:53.990
So you have to take off the head,
the fins,
get the guts,

2871
02:44:53.991 --> 02:44:58.030
get the blood line off the spine and the back,
and then you put it on.

2872
02:44:58.031 --> 02:45:00.880
You put all that guts,
all that stuff into a shoot,

2873
02:45:01.210 --> 02:45:05.470
which I later learned is goes into tanks that are sold to pharmaceutical

2874
02:45:05.471 --> 02:45:10.150
companies because the fat from the internal organs and the head of the salmon is

2875
02:45:10.151 --> 02:45:14.980
the base for a lot of cosmetics.
And then the other,
the,
the fish,

2876
02:45:15.390 --> 02:45:15.521
the,

2877
02:45:15.521 --> 02:45:20.521
assuming the fishes in decent condition goes onto another conveyor belt and then

2878
02:45:20.741 --> 02:45:24.820
it goes down into the canning section where it's chopped and placed in these

2879
02:45:24.821 --> 02:45:26.430
cans.
So it's just chopped rights.

2880
02:45:26.431 --> 02:45:29.680
Here you have lived some really crazy adventures.

2881
02:45:29.681 --> 02:45:33.670
You've had a pretty wild and and broad life.
Well that was the point,
right?

2882
02:45:33.670 --> 02:45:37.840
I wanted,
I mean,
when I was 20 I was like,
you know,
fuck it,

2883
02:45:37.841 --> 02:45:39.230
I'm going to die someday.
But it's,
you know,

2884
02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:43.450
romantic that you actually like engineered that,
you know,
a lot of people don't,

2885
02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:46.120
you know,
they said maybe they have a rich crazy life,
but as,

2886
02:45:46.130 --> 02:45:49.350
because they were an alcoholic and they were running from the law,
if you like,

2887
02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:53.170
you made a conscious decision to have this adventure.
Yeah.

2888
02:45:53.171 --> 02:45:56.890
It was definitely intentional and I mean it helped that I didn't want to have

2889
02:45:56.891 --> 02:46:01.060
kids.
Right.
So that removed that whole area of,
of,

2890
02:46:01.630 --> 02:46:03.780
of problem for me.
And it also helped them.

2891
02:46:03.781 --> 02:46:08.781
My parents were sort of upper middle class and really good people and they were,

2892
02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:13.010
you know,
the only thing my dad said when that first year in Alaska,
I call it,

2893
02:46:13.011 --> 02:46:17.060
I said,
look,
I'm going,
I'm going to Japan.
I'm just like forget college,
I'm,

2894
02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:21.950
I'm alive.
You know.
Also about the time I discovered acid by that help,

2895
02:46:22.160 --> 02:46:26.510
the wonder connection maybe.
And my dad was like,
look Chris,
you know,

2896
02:46:26.511 --> 02:46:31.430
I'll support you in anything you do,
but please for me,
go back to school,
Finish,

2897
02:46:31.431 --> 02:46:34.490
get your degree because it's going to be so hard to go back later.

2898
02:46:34.850 --> 02:46:36.590
So for my dad and really to this day,

2899
02:46:36.591 --> 02:46:39.140
that's like the only thing he's ever stepped in and said,

2900
02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:42.710
please trust me on this.
I went back to school,
but I said,

2901
02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:44.120
I'm not going to live in the dorms.

2902
02:46:44.121 --> 02:46:48.740
I'm not cause I went to this school full of rich spoiled ass holes.

2903
02:46:48.890 --> 02:46:51.140
I mean,
George Bushes niece was in my class,

2904
02:46:51.710 --> 02:46:56.000
the air to the Spalding fortune and was in my class.
Um,

2905
02:46:56.030 --> 02:46:59.750
so I lived in my tent in the woods behind the art museum.

2906
02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:02.060
That's awesome.
Yeah.

2907
02:47:02.810 --> 02:47:05.050
<v 0>I love talking to you,
man.
It's so much fun.
We're out of time,</v>

2908
02:47:05.051 --> 02:47:09.580
but we can do this all day.
Do like a hundred times a year.
You got a gig tonight,

2909
02:47:09.581 --> 02:47:12.900

Yes.
Yes.
We're at the ice.
It's sold out though.
So go fuck yourself folks.

2910
02:47:12.910 --> 02:47:15.730
If you're trying to buy a ticket to late tough shit,
you snooze,
you lose.

2911
02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:19.700
I was going to ask for one.
You can get in.

2912
02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:21.370
It's rose petals.

2913
02:47:21.490 --> 02:47:23.720

2914
02:47:25.370 --> 02:47:28.600
Feed each other routes,

2915

I'll tell you that.

2925
