<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>we were in a film together so we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right next to each other on</v>

10
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.240
<v Speaker 1>cellulite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let someone we in that was the culture.</v>

11
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Hi Brett Harvey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a you,</v>

12
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson and snoop Dogg.</v>

13
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good company.</v>

14
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.823
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

15
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

16
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you were just saying right before</v>

17
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:41.740
<v Speaker 1>we did the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were in bed for 15 years.</v>

18
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got sick in 1988.</v>

19
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't able to make it out of that bed</v>
<v Speaker 1>until 2003.</v>

20
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>But Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was absolutely certain I would never</v>

21
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.350
<v Speaker 1>make it out of that bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you have?</v>

22
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>It's called these days.</v>

23
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>This month it's called a m e cfs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

24
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 1>up until now it was just known as</v>
<v Speaker 1>chronic fatigue syndrome cfs.</v>

25
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 1>But it's real serious if you get a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>case of it.</v>

26
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>So I was too weak to talk for five years</v>
<v Speaker 1>too weak to talk.</v>

27
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>You didn't talk at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a bit.</v>

28
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have the strength to puff out</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a syllable.</v>

29
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

30
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I was too weak to have another person in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room with me for five years so I</v>

31
00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:26.671
<v Speaker 1>don't have a person in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My stress levels were off the charts and</v>

32
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>the slightest thing would just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack.</v>

33
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>My wife tried to keep me company so we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this big king size bed and she</v>

34
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:38.841
<v Speaker 1>would lay in bed reading a newspaper and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sound of the page turning went</v>

35
00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:45.111
<v Speaker 1>through me like a cannon ball and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just tore me to pieces and she had to</v>

36
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.380
<v Speaker 1>build a separate room in the front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house and live there because I</v>

37
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>couldn't tolerate anything.</v>

38
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Did you think it was over?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I thought first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you don't know,</v>

40
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>you have a sense of humanity and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know it and something like this</v>

41
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>that wipes out your entire future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every dream,</v>

42
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:11.751
<v Speaker 1>the overhead for yourself robs you of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sense of humanity and you don't</v>

43
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a sense of humanity until it</v>

44
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it took me three years.</v>

45
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>I had to rebuild a personality from just</v>
<v Speaker 1>about scratch.</v>

46
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of the one area I could handle</v>

47
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.050
<v Speaker 1>at least most of the time was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>

48
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet hit the music industry in</v>

49
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:36.051
<v Speaker 1>1983 and I had been lusting after it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>years because only academics had access</v>

50
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>to this real high tech thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

51
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took me three years to realize that</v>

52
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>every day I was trying to go up to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>front room office and work.</v>

53
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And that sitting was draining me of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

54
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>And since I only had a tiny amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

55
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:58.971
<v Speaker 1>if I lay there horizontal in the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my voice eventually come back.</v>

56
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>So I had an assistant take two computers</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in those days to computers was</v>

57
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>about half the size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The processing power was half the size</v>

58
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>of your cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had them hook up two computers and</v>

59
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>a Chinese box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't let anybody tell you the Chinese</v>

60
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>and Chinese don't event things they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was a box that allowed me to</v>

61
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>control both computers from one monitor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one keyboard.</v>

62
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>So we have the keyboard up on foam</v>
<v Speaker 1>bolsters so that I could see it when I</v>

63
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>was laying perfectly horizontal in bed</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could still see the keys.</v>

64
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.890
<v Speaker 1>And I rebuilt a personality online cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get any further than to the</v>

65
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>bathroom and back.</v>

66
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by you rebuilt a</v>

67
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>personality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>everything I hadn't expected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was going to write my first</v>

69
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>book and I was gonna I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a nerd from science.</v>

70
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>I got into science at the age of 10 I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got into theoretical physics and</v>

71
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>microbiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt built my first Boolean Algebra</v>

72
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>machine when I was 12 I code is on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer that won science fair awards.</v>

73
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:06.571
<v Speaker 1>When I was 12 I was taken to see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head of the graduate physics department</v>

74
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>at the University of Buffalo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared into his office for an hour.</v>

75
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 1>My mother wondered what in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened to me cause it was</v>

76
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be a five minute courtesy</v>
<v Speaker 1>call.</v>

77
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>We were discussing big bang versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>steady state theory of the universe for</v>

78
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 1>an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was 16 I worked at the world's</v>

79
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.590
<v Speaker 1>largest cancer research lab and I came</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with the theory of the beginning,</v>

80
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:30.030
<v Speaker 1>middle and end of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Big Bang theory or the bloom tour,</v>

81
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 1>a little model that predicted 38 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>in advanced dark energy.</v>

82
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.160
<v Speaker 1>And then I ended up in the rock and roll</v>
<v Speaker 1>business with this background.</v>

83
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.970
<v Speaker 1>So when I imagined I was going to write</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first book,</v>

84
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I was going to leave the rock and roll</v>
<v Speaker 1>business behind because my field</v>

85
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 1>expedition and rock and roll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd learned,</v>

86
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I thought as much as I was ever going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from it.</v>

87
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 1>And I'd worked with Michael Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prince Bob Marley,</v>

<v Speaker 1>bette Midler,</v>

<v Speaker 1>kiss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kiss Queen,</v>

90
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Billy Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billy idol,</v>

91
00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Paul Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Gabriel,</v>

92
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:03.370
<v Speaker 1>David Byrne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like that.</v>

93
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What caused this disease?</v>

94
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows.</v>

95
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has a clue what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in the different names,</v>

96
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 1>chronic fatigue syndrome and ease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just send me a Myalgic</v>

97
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:19.921
<v Speaker 1>encephalomyelitis and more dignified</v>
<v Speaker 1>name do can they understand it into the</v>

98
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:24.330
<v Speaker 1>point where they could test for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they give you a blood test or they</v>

99
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>just can't test for it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what causes it.</v>

100
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>There's no Ivrit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A friend approached me at one point and</v>

101
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Duchess of Kent has what you have.</v>

102
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Can you write her a letter about how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage it?</v>

103
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 1>So instead of a letter I wrote 14 or 16</v>
<v Speaker 1>pages or something like that.</v>

104
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>So when people have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I send them this pamphlet that explains</v>

105
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>how I got out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll work for me is not necessarily</v>

106
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>gonna work for you or anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it a gradual slipping away of your</v>

107
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:57.451
<v Speaker 1>energy or was it a back gradual?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened on March 10th of 1988 so</v>

108
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>March 9th you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>March 10th March 9th I'm fine.</v>

109
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.570
<v Speaker 1>March 10th I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fly down to a,</v>

110
00:06:04.571 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it was richmond or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that to go out.</v>

111
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Five to be taken by jeep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

112
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>five hours into the countryside to meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Linda Womack.</v>

113
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 1>That's Sam Cooke's daughter and her</v>
<v Speaker 1>husband,</v>

114
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cecil Womack who is broke the rolling</v>

115
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 1>stones first hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and his brother and they have this</v>

116
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>big aircraft hanger sized farm building.</v>

117
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be their home,</v>

118
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 1>but right now they've just had it built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's empty,</v>

119
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have heating yet and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>March 10th.</v>

120
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 1>It's still the end of winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we go and pass the sheep and into</v>

121
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>this building and there's no furniture</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>

122
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:46.150
<v Speaker 1>And I sit there and interview them for</v>
<v Speaker 1>five hours and find out that there's</v>

123
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>something called a black coal mining</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

124
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 1>And the Gospel came out of those black</v>
<v Speaker 1>coal mines.</v>

125
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea that blacks ever got</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in coal mines,</v>

126
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 1>much less that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how gospel culture began.</v>

127
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they drove me five hours back to the</v>

128
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>airport again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat there on the plane with my little</v>

129
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 1>trs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100,</v>

130
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 1>the very first laptop computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little Gizmo that ran off of Aa</v>

131
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:13.330
<v Speaker 1>batteries and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I forgot my,</v>

132
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.850
<v Speaker 1>my laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the plane.</v>

133
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't do things like that.</v>

134
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Some of that was a little off the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>day I thought I had a cold.</v>

135
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 1>My technique for handling a cold work</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fucking ass off.</v>

136
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk a minimum of two and a half miles</v>

137
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 1>and do your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I worked in power to my way through</v>

138
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:35.870
<v Speaker 1>it by Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

139
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:41.290
<v Speaker 1>I was so weak that my staff had a pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>me up under the armpits and drag me off</v>

140
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 1>to the elevator and throw me in the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a car service car and shipped me out</v>

141
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 1>to parks slope to my brownstone in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn.</v>

142
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know how I even got up the stairs</v>

143
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.220
<v Speaker 1>and it was all downhill basically from</v>
<v Speaker 1>there for 15 years.</v>

144
00:07:55.221 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 1>15 freaking years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

145
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still had,</v>

146
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I had gotten halfway through writing my</v>
<v Speaker 1>first book.</v>

147
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 1>My plan was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

148
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll do what I've done with all my rock</v>
<v Speaker 1>and roll bands when my book is ready to</v>

149
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 1>come out.</v>

150
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll go do every morning television</v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

151
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 1>every radio show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every newspaper in the country.</v>

152
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I'll stay at high houses where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheets are sunny and yellow and um,</v>

153
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.790
<v Speaker 1>where they make the bed for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to make it yourself and</v>

154
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:24.710
<v Speaker 1>they'll feed you food and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

155
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.730
<v Speaker 1>And I'll promote my book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my vision of my next step in</v>

156
00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:29.600
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Future.</v>

157
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't leave your bedroom,</v>

158
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 1>that's all gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all gone.</v>

159
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 1>And you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had to walk into my office one day</v>

160
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea of what's happening to</v>

161
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:42.110
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be dying.</v>

162
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.680
<v Speaker 1>I have to be out of here in two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

163
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I gave the whole thing to my staff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest pr firm in the music</v>

164
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:51.350
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just gave it to them.</v>

165
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next day I got a call from a</v>

166
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:56.670
<v Speaker 1>west coast competitor offering me a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money and I had to say,</v>

167
00:08:56.671 --> 00:08:57.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

168
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I gave it to my staff yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

169
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

170
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>and I say how to reinvent myself with</v>
<v Speaker 1>what little I had.</v>

171
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:11.070
<v Speaker 1>The books were still a value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My science was still a value and I had</v>

172
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:16.071
<v Speaker 1>to create a new me online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you see create a new you online</v>

<v Speaker 1>and you say create a new personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

174
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:22.270
<v Speaker 1>what exactly do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

175

<v Speaker 1>couldn't talk anymore.</v>

177
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my body.</v>

178
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:34.011
<v Speaker 1>But you have no idea of just how much of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your personality is your body and your</v>

179
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:39.240
<v Speaker 1>vocal cords and stuff like that that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>take for granted are instruments of some</v>

180
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.390
<v Speaker 1>internal you I had to invent an</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

182

<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how'd you do that?</v>

183
00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Like when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

184
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I got on,</v>

185
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first I,</v>

186
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.910
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even remember what came first,</v>

187
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:55.410
<v Speaker 1>but at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

188
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.740
<v Speaker 1>because I was fact checking my first</v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

189
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 1>but how to do this all laying there in</v>
<v Speaker 1>bed.</v>

190
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got hold of Napoleon,</v>

191
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Sean [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the,</v>

192
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 1>the anthropologist who chronicled the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fierce people,</v>

193
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:12.480
<v Speaker 1>the Auto Mama in South America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who are really,</v>

194
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more people you kill,</v>

195
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:16.980
<v Speaker 1>the more wives you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that.</v>

196
00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:19.890
<v Speaker 1>And Ya know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm old culture and um,</v>

197
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I wanted him to read my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first book,</v>

198
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:26.220
<v Speaker 1>the Lucifer principle of scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>expedition into the forces of history.</v>

199
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.391
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

200
00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:29.850
<v Speaker 1>people are out to destroy my career</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

201
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I can't get involved with anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial but I a key member of the</v>

202
00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:37.980
<v Speaker 1>human behavior and evolution society and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be a member.</v>

203
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.510
<v Speaker 1>While he introduced me to a social group</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which I could interact as long as I</v>

204
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:43.560
<v Speaker 1>can continue to type.</v>

205
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.180
<v Speaker 1>So this is a message board or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all done via email.</v>

206
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 1>So just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group of people that you could</v>

207
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:53.700
<v Speaker 1>interact with with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been working on my writing</v>

208
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.790
<v Speaker 1>since I was 16 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science is my base,</v>

209
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.900
<v Speaker 1>but the book I got at the age of 12 by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Albert Einstein,</v>

210
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a book grabs you by the lapels</v>

211
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 1>and it feels like the author's writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this directly into your face.</v>

212
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.000
<v Speaker 1>And Einstein said to be a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not enough to come over,</v>

213
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.510
<v Speaker 1>come up with a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only seven men in the world can</v>

214
00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:16.590
<v Speaker 1>understand to be a genius who have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to come up with that theory and</v>

215
00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 1>then express it so clearly that anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a high school education and a</v>

216
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:22.230
<v Speaker 1>reasonable degree of intelligence can</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it.</v>

217
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.360
<v Speaker 1>So Albert Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my heroes said,</v>

218
00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:25.410
<v Speaker 1>schmuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen up.</v>

219
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.260
<v Speaker 1>You want to be on an original scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinker?</v>

220
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.170
<v Speaker 1>You have to be the best writer you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly be.</v>

221
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.830
<v Speaker 1>So I had been working on my writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>since I was 16 years old.</v>

222
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I was late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] took me four years to get</v>

223
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 1>around to doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After Einstein gave me the orders,</v>

224
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.830
<v Speaker 1>and I'm one when I was put on the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and evolutionary society group,</v>

225
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can write my fucking ass off.</v>

226
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.740
<v Speaker 1>So people were impressed and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>gathered around me.</v>

227
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now admittedly it's all on a computer</v>

228
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:03.910
<v Speaker 1>screen and it's all via keyboard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no living humans in the room</v>

229
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.970
<v Speaker 1>and he applies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's saved my life to be able to do</v>

230
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I found it to international</v>

231
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 1>scientific groups of my own and I wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>three books because those were things I</v>

232
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:19.690
<v Speaker 1>could do with that keyboard as long as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the strength to do the keyboarding</v>

233
00:12:19.691 --> 00:12:22.720
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't always have the strength to</v>
<v Speaker 1>even lift my hands and do that,</v>

234
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.400
<v Speaker 1>but I did most of the time.</v>

235
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Now during this time were you getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>treated?</v>

236
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Were doctors giving you doctors don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know a damn thing about this?</v>

237
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first wife who I lost because of this</v>

238
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.420
<v Speaker 1>lost a 34 year marriage because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>

239
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.750
<v Speaker 1>She persuaded a cfs doctor or a doctor</v>
<v Speaker 1>who specializes in chronic fatigue</v>

240
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:47.560
<v Speaker 1>syndrome to come out to my house when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to a party in Brooklyn and see</v>

241
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:51.970
<v Speaker 1>me and the most useful thing that he did</v>
<v Speaker 1>was hand me a piece of paper with an</v>

242
00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:55.720
<v Speaker 1>email address on it and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is another one of my patients.</v>

243
00:12:55.721 --> 00:12:58.270
<v Speaker 1>She's in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to get in touch with her.</v>

244
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.610
<v Speaker 1>And the two of us went out like Hansel</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Gretel,</v>

245
00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:04.690
<v Speaker 1>holding hands going into the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for treatment modalities.</v>

246
00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:09.691
<v Speaker 1>We're looking for treatments that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly save us from our illness.</v>

247
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.450
<v Speaker 1>So when I tell people this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take it and they say,</v>

248
00:13:13.451 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can I get this room?</v>

249
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.620
<v Speaker 1>And I send them to my doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my old cfs doctor.</v>

250
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:18.761
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

251
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't give those treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he gave them to me,</v>

252
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:25.660
<v Speaker 1>but he gave them to me because those</v>
<v Speaker 1>were the things that felt like they</v>

253
00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 1>might work and he allowed me to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

254
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And I ended up with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every morning I give myself a shot with</v>

255
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:35.710
<v Speaker 1>three different things in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a half a cc of magnesium,</v>

256
00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:40.690
<v Speaker 1>one cc of Oxytocin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a about two CC's of Santa Cobalamin,</v>

257
00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:45.691
<v Speaker 1>which is liquid vitamin B's 12 so b12</v>
<v Speaker 1>magnesium and oxytocin.</v>

258
00:13:45.881 --> 00:13:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Oxytocin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bonding hormone,</v>

259
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.860
<v Speaker 1>oxytocin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that creates trust in</v>

260
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.400
<v Speaker 1>neuroeconomics experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oxytocin with,</v>

261
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>if you're a mother and you've just given</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth to a baby,</v>

262
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.670
<v Speaker 1>when you put that baby to your left</v>
<v Speaker 1>nipple for the very first time,</v>

263
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:06.210
<v Speaker 1>you feel in some cases like you've just</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken lsd because this chemical goes</v>

264
00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:11.641
<v Speaker 1>coursing through your body and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trip and it makes you trust everybody.</v>

265
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.380
<v Speaker 1>In the room and everybody who walks into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room,</v>

266
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:19.590
<v Speaker 1>it's oxytocin and oxytocin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been on oxytocin now for 20 years</v>

267
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.500
<v Speaker 1>and Oxytocin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out also does something else.</v>

268
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this little experiment called</v>

269
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:31.030
<v Speaker 1>parabiosis taken old rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His brain is aging is hard as aging.</v>

270
00:14:31.031 --> 00:14:34.110
<v Speaker 1>His kidneys are aging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Hook up the circulatory system to</v>

271
00:14:34.111 --> 00:14:38.320
<v Speaker 1>the circulatory system of a young rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And guess what starts happening to the</v>

272
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:40.030
<v Speaker 1>old rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His brain starts,</v>

273
00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:42.280
<v Speaker 1>we're versing getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting younger.</v>

274
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 1>His heart starts getting younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His kidneys start to get younger.</v>

275
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.610
<v Speaker 1>So I'm about to be 75 years old in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

276
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do between 400 and 700 pushups in the</v>

277
00:14:54.201 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First thing,</v>

278
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.740
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really crazy.</v>

279
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:02.950
<v Speaker 1>But when they tried to figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>is reversing the aging and the muscles</v>

280
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.590
<v Speaker 1>of the rat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart of the rat,</v>

281
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:10.280
<v Speaker 1>the brain of the rat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one ingredient they were able to</v>

282
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:15.340
<v Speaker 1>isolate and then use on other rats to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them to get younger instead of older</v>

283
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.660
<v Speaker 1>was oxytocin.</v>

284
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 1>So in all probability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I can do between 400 and 700</v>

285
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:25.730
<v Speaker 1>pushups in the morning at the age of 74</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I was 19,</v>

286
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:28.880
<v Speaker 1>the most I could do was 92 and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>working really hard at it.</v>

287
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the oxytocin,</v>

288
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.730
<v Speaker 1>so never heard of anybody taking that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a supplement?</v>

289
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it showed up.</v>

290
00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:40.730
<v Speaker 1>There was a doctor named something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>seastrunk in Texas who was using it on</v>

291
00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:42.860
<v Speaker 1>cfs patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my friend,</v>

292
00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:45.460
<v Speaker 1>the Texas patient of my doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

293
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.650
<v Speaker 1>found seastrunk and got his protocol out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of him.</v>

294
00:15:48.651 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what he'd used to treat the</v>

295
00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:53.990
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we gave it to my doctor and he sat</v>

296
00:15:53.991 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 1>on it for six months until he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>regurgitate it as a own bright idea.</v>

297
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.220
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he prescribed it for me and</v>

298
00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:05.690
<v Speaker 1>it's done wonders that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a bunch of other stuff have done</v>

299
00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:07.520
<v Speaker 1>absolute wonders of the other things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have worked.</v>

300
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I think Gabapentin without that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

301
00:16:10.581 --> 00:16:13.340
<v Speaker 1>I was on my way to Moscow once I finally</v>
<v Speaker 1>got out of bed,</v>

302
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I was going to address an international</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference of quantum physicists.</v>

303
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:18.710
<v Speaker 1>About why everything they know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum physics is wrong.</v>

304
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.060
<v Speaker 1>And I was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>

305
00:16:22.061 --> 00:16:26.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean this was my first traveling since</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd gotten out of bed and it was taking</v>

306
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:29.540
<v Speaker 1>a huge chance cause it was a huge chance</v>
<v Speaker 1>on throwing me back into bed again.</v>

307
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.140
<v Speaker 1>And I flew all the way to Germany and</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing just fine.</v>

308
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.600
<v Speaker 1>I was exhilarated that I was doing so</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

309
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.120
<v Speaker 1>And then halfway between Germany and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moscow,</v>

310
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.540
<v Speaker 1>the cfs symptoms began to come back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was scary.</v>

311
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.250
<v Speaker 1>And then I reviewed what I was doing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized I had missed all my afternoon</v>

312
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:51.110
<v Speaker 1>pills and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as I was able,</v>

313
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.830
<v Speaker 1>well we had to find a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bed in the infirmary,</v>

314
00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:55.700
<v Speaker 1>which is scary.</v>

315
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.730
<v Speaker 1>And the Moscow airport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are people walking around</v>

316
00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:03.530
<v Speaker 1>with machine guns and military uniforms</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they want to take my passport away</v>

317
00:17:03.531 --> 00:17:06.020
<v Speaker 1>in order to allow me to lay in a bed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the infirmary.</v>

318
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:09.290
<v Speaker 1>And so I could be disappeared at any</v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

319
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:14.180
<v Speaker 1>But when we finally got to our hotel and</v>
<v Speaker 1>opened up my drug role,</v>

320
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:17.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took the Gabapentin and within 15</v>

321
00:17:17.841 --> 00:17:20.390
<v Speaker 1>minutes of the symptoms were going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

322
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.310
<v Speaker 1>So did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever tried to isolate</v>

323
00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:24.650
<v Speaker 1>individual ones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It removes some of them from the</v>

324
00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:29.540
<v Speaker 1>protocol to see if I once removed one</v>
<v Speaker 1>amytriptolene it's an antidepressant.</v>

325
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:33.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was originally designed</v>
<v Speaker 1>for and I figured I don't need this</v>

326
00:17:33.171 --> 00:17:35.540
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm perfectly healthy.</v>

327
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.530
<v Speaker 1>It was a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started having these blinding stomach</v>

328
00:17:39.531 --> 00:17:43.130
<v Speaker 1>aches and they went out for a low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for months and months and months</v>

329
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.670
<v Speaker 1>until I finally got fed up and started</v>
<v Speaker 1>researching on Google.</v>

330
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.530
<v Speaker 1>What do you do about summer cakes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

331
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:52.140
<v Speaker 1>guess one of the primary things you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop stomach cases,</v>

332
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 1>amitriptyline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very thing I had gone off of,</v>

333
00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 1>so I had to go back on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a whole network,</v>

334
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.830
<v Speaker 1>a mesh of supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and lifestyle.</v>

335
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't sleep the way normal people</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

336
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:12.300
<v Speaker 1>I sleep from four o'clock in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>until eight o'clock in the morning.</v>

337
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to magazines on the kindle</v>

338
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:19.050
<v Speaker 1>while I'm taking my bath and shaving and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

339
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.530
<v Speaker 1>I meet with my assistant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give her her marching orders for the</v>

340
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.720
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go back to sleep at 11 and I sleep</v>

341
00:18:24.721 --> 00:18:27.450
<v Speaker 1>until three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I get up for my second work</v>

342
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:28.920
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

343
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.980
<v Speaker 1>and that's when I do all my writing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that kind of stuff.</v>

344
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.310
<v Speaker 1>So you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sleep in four hour chunks while you</v>

345
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.140
<v Speaker 1>four hour chunks because that is better</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

346
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.530
<v Speaker 1>My body was refusing to do the eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour thing.</v>

347
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:45.120
<v Speaker 1>So one of the first symptoms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cfs is in Somnia.</v>

348
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Joe,</v>

349
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.050
<v Speaker 1>if your body is refusing to sleep for</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight hours straight,</v>

350
00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.250
<v Speaker 1>listen to your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it what the hell it wants.</v>

351
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.310
<v Speaker 1>And so these are the hours my body</v>
<v Speaker 1>demanded.</v>

352
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

353
00:18:58.651 --> 00:19:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I had been working often until eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>o'clock in the morning from roughly 11</v>

354
00:19:03.331 --> 00:19:06.780
<v Speaker 1>o'clock at night or something like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and losing track of time and it was very</v>

355
00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:10.410
<v Speaker 1>disorienting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once I started this two periods of</v>

356
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:12.570
<v Speaker 1>sleep a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my day stabilized.</v>

357
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's other stuff.</v>

358
00:19:14.881 --> 00:19:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean listening to Pandora,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think,</v>

359
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.720
<v Speaker 1>what does that have to do with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>illness?</v>

360
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work at a cafe.</v>

361
00:19:20.461 --> 00:19:24.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a vital part of things because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm surrounded by people and I've slowly</v>

362
00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:28.710
<v Speaker 1>build community in this cafe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other workaholic writers like me,</v>

363
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.550
<v Speaker 1>a neuroscientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a novel novelist,</v>

364
00:19:32.551 --> 00:19:35.760
<v Speaker 1>and all kinds of people who just sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and slave away all day.</v>

365
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.730
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm listening to Pandora that gives</v>

366
00:19:38.731 --> 00:19:40.710
<v Speaker 1>me a sense of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some reason.</v>

367
00:19:40.711 --> 00:19:44.670
<v Speaker 1>It's as it's as positive as an elixir</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be.</v>

368
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gives me a sense of control over</v>

369
00:19:47.881 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 1>my environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't hear the conversations going</v>

370
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:52.830
<v Speaker 1>on around me so I can really focus on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

371
00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:56.250
<v Speaker 1>I've written four books this way so far</v>
<v Speaker 1>in cafes,</v>

372
00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.040
<v Speaker 1>all of this stuff walking five miles a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

373
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm in two bursts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

374
00:20:01.111 --> 00:20:03.960
<v Speaker 1>there I am going through a meadow in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of a park at night.</v>

375
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many New Yorkers do you know who go</v>

376
00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:08.940
<v Speaker 1>out and walk through a park in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the night?</v>

377
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Rob's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

378
00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:11.790
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you'd think.</v>

379
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.720
<v Speaker 1>But I have the time of my life looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>up at the stars at Lynn middle of the</v>

380
00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:19.920
<v Speaker 1>meadow and being where I'm not supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be and not supposed to go through the</v>

381
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:20.460
<v Speaker 1>park at night.</v>

382
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Well they let you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

383
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I had been thrown up six times by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>police because I've overseen,</v>

384
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.970
<v Speaker 1>I've overstepped the boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been out there after one o'clock</v>

385
00:20:29.971 --> 00:20:32.490
<v Speaker 1>and they do close the place at one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw us all out.</v>

386
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.280
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York Lore,</v>

387
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.530
<v Speaker 1>unless you're walking a really big dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do not go out into parks at night</v>

388
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.660
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you put this whole lifestyle</v>

389
00:20:42.661 --> 00:20:47.661
<v Speaker 1>together and it's not just any</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual ingredient that's making me</v>

390
00:20:49.091 --> 00:20:52.120
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happier than I was when I was 19.</v>

391
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm stronger than I walk a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly than when I was 19.</v>

392
00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.730
<v Speaker 1>But in terms of push ups and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercises,</v>

393
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm stronger than I was when I was 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

394
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.010
<v Speaker 1>That is a crazy journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Howard.</v>

395
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.110
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's only a part.</v>

396
00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now I'm co-designing.</v>

397
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.700
<v Speaker 1>So here I hurry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy who worked with Michael</v>

398
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prince Bob Marley and all of those</v>

399
00:21:14.051 --> 00:21:14.860
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

400
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 1>And I'm co-designing a multiplanetary</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission at Caltech right now.</v>

401
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm out here in California to do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bookstore reading my first one on the</v>

402
00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:26.020
<v Speaker 1>west coast for how I accidentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>started the 60s my current book.</v>

403
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.500
<v Speaker 1>But then I have three presentations at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the annual meeting of the National Space</v>

404
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Society and I'm on the board of</v>
<v Speaker 1>governors of the National Space Society</v>

405
00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 1>and I've got some important things to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

406
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 1>And then they let me sit on the board</v>
<v Speaker 1>meetings.</v>

407
00:21:39.161 --> 00:21:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm used to be on both the board and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Board of governors and uh,</v>

408
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.390
<v Speaker 1>there are some important things I need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help this group accomplish.</v>

409
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.240
<v Speaker 1>And then I go back to New York and get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully,</v>

410
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:54.241
<v Speaker 1>if I'm lucky and my planes are on time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to New York in time to get some</v>

411
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:59.140
<v Speaker 1>sleep and to get up and do an interview</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a British</v>

412
00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.330
<v Speaker 1>filmmaker who's making a film about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prince.</v>

413
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.300
<v Speaker 1>And meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a film being made about my life</v>

414
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.920
<v Speaker 1>called surf the catastrophe.</v>

415
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a 60 to 90 minute film and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally getting,</v>

416
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:14.890
<v Speaker 1>after a year of shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting down to the editing and</v>

417
00:22:14.891 --> 00:22:19.891
<v Speaker 1>it's a three time grammy winner who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>my director and one of the camera who's</v>

418
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.350
<v Speaker 1>been with us through this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

419
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.820
<v Speaker 1>a couple of Sundays ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my director got his first or his third</v>

420
00:22:27.821 --> 00:22:30.970
<v Speaker 1>grammy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our Emmy and my,</v>

421
00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my cameramen got his second emmy.</v>

422
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.980
<v Speaker 1>So there's all kinds of wild stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have 15 projects going on at once.</v>

423
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.110
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

424
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say that it seems like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get very energized when you talking</v>

425
00:22:44.681 --> 00:22:47.020
<v Speaker 1>about the amount of different things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're doing all at once.</v>

426
00:22:47.021 --> 00:22:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that part of what gives you</v>

427
00:22:49.091 --> 00:22:49.924
<v Speaker 1>juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

428
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

429
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:55.950
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I refuse to go into any niche,</v>

430
00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.430
<v Speaker 1>I refuse to go into one specialization</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see the walls close in on me and get</v>

431
00:23:00.431 --> 00:23:01.264
<v Speaker 1>buried there.</v>

432
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.290
<v Speaker 1>And my goal since I was 16 years old and</v>
<v Speaker 1>working at the world's largest cancer</v>

433
00:23:05.291 --> 00:23:09.460
<v Speaker 1>research facility has been not to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mole digging a hole so deep you can't</v>

434
00:23:09.461 --> 00:23:10.960
<v Speaker 1>see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

435
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:14.420
<v Speaker 1>but to be the eagle flying over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape and taking each of those mole</v>

436
00:23:14.421 --> 00:23:19.421
<v Speaker 1>holes as pick pixels in a big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do all the sciences that termed</v>

437
00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.730
<v Speaker 1>autod Dec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

438
00:23:21.731 --> 00:23:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Autodidact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

439
00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:26.500
<v Speaker 1>I read two books a day from the time I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was 10,</v>

440
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:30.640
<v Speaker 1>and by the time I got to college I</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember I'm there with the,</v>

441
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.720
<v Speaker 1>at the age of 12 with the head of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate physics department,</v>

442
00:23:34.721 --> 00:23:38.560
<v Speaker 1>not just the physics department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the graduate physics department,</v>

443
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:41.920
<v Speaker 1>and we're talking as equals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really weird.</v>

444
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.620
<v Speaker 1>So pretty weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the time I got to college,</v>

445
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I ended up with four fellowships in</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience.</v>

446
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.340
<v Speaker 1>I realized that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate school would be the Auschwitz</v>

447
00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:56.174
<v Speaker 1>of the mind.</v>

448
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt I was in a box car on my way to</v>

449
00:23:59.781 --> 00:24:02.270
<v Speaker 1>the end of everything I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand in life.</v>

450
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

451
00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:08.291
<v Speaker 1>because since I was 12 or 13 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to take all the panorama,</v>

452
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.010
<v Speaker 1>the full pallet of the sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wanted to use them among other</v>

453
00:24:13.011 --> 00:24:15.590
<v Speaker 1>things to understand ecstatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

454
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to understand how Hitler put</v>
<v Speaker 1>together this performance torchlight</v>

455
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:24.440
<v Speaker 1>parades where 15 guys are walking down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the streets abreast of each other,</v>

456
00:24:24.441 --> 00:24:28.670
<v Speaker 1>carrying torches at 10 o'clock at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people on the [inaudible] van</v>

457
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Linden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big boulevard are packed so tight</v>

458
00:24:30.921 --> 00:24:35.330
<v Speaker 1>that if you pulled up your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't topple over because the</v>

459
00:24:35.331 --> 00:24:38.210
<v Speaker 1>crowd would hold you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were crowded in on.</v>

460
00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:42.790
<v Speaker 1>I was a side of you supporting you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people had a sense of being lifted out</v>

461
00:24:42.791 --> 00:24:46.970
<v Speaker 1>of themselves and having a transcendent</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and becoming part of three</v>

462
00:24:46.971 --> 00:24:47.720
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

463
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I invoke one tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write one state,</v>

464
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm fewer her one leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it gave them,</v>

465
00:24:58.041 --> 00:25:01.220
<v Speaker 1>we all need a sense of being a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something bigger than ourselves.</v>

466
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:06.250
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to know how that sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecstatic disillusion into something</v>

467
00:25:08.061 --> 00:25:12.410
<v Speaker 1>bigger than yourself happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that we're in Hitler's case</v>

468
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:15.600
<v Speaker 1>that this was an accident?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

469
00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I think Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think designed this was,</v>

470
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:19.490
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did design it.</v>

471
00:25:19.491 --> 00:25:22.040
<v Speaker 1>He absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew that he could create this sort</v>

472
00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:24.350
<v Speaker 1>of ecstatic state and in these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bet.</v>

473
00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was an exotic and he was preaching to</v>

474
00:25:29.181 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 1>people to bring them to a state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecstasy.</v>

475
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.710
<v Speaker 1>How did he know all this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did he know?</v>

476
00:25:33.711 --> 00:25:37.970
<v Speaker 1>All of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this the way any artist knows how to</v>

477
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:40.250
<v Speaker 1>achieve things that he may never have</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen,</v>

478
00:25:40.251 --> 00:25:43.130
<v Speaker 1>achieved before in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's intuition.</v>

479
00:25:43.131 --> 00:25:45.770
<v Speaker 1>We're all built with certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

480
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.650
<v Speaker 1>super normal responses inside of us.</v>

481
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Certain gushes of emotion you can hit if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit just the right stimulus.</v>

482
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.450
<v Speaker 1>And he hired Albert speer to be as art</v>
<v Speaker 1>directors.</v>

483
00:25:57.451 --> 00:26:01.040
<v Speaker 1>So Albert speer would art direct these</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive events like this,</v>

484
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:06.250
<v Speaker 1>but it was Hitler who would go into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>state of ecstatic preaching as if</v>

485
00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:08.810
<v Speaker 1>preaching in tongues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but preaching in one tongue,</v>

486
00:26:08.811 --> 00:26:11.780
<v Speaker 1>German.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who could bring that audience to</v>

487
00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:14.270
<v Speaker 1>that ecstatic level?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

488
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:19.220
<v Speaker 1>he was disturb you to study someone as</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up as Hitler though,</v>

489
00:26:19.221 --> 00:26:22.920
<v Speaker 1>and look for the genius in his approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially as it chooses.</v>

490
00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Bet your ass.</v>

491
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

492
00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I figure if Hitler could use this</v>

493
00:26:28.311 --> 00:26:31.400
<v Speaker 1>for evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big trick is to understand it and</v>

494
00:26:31.401 --> 00:26:33.350
<v Speaker 1>use it for good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

495
00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:37.760
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that a rock concert has</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ecstatic elements in it.</v>

496
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.970
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear about audiences getting off.</v>

497
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.660
<v Speaker 1>That's what the put people stage are</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly trying to achieve.</v>

498
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.520
<v Speaker 1>That's an ecstatic state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this what was fascinating to you</v>

499
00:26:50.521 --> 00:26:53.420
<v Speaker 1>about rock in the first place that led</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to become a publicist?</v>

500
00:26:53.421 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because remember,</v>

501
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:57.060
<v Speaker 1>if I'd gone to Grad School,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have been giving paper and</v>

502
00:26:57.061 --> 00:27:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Pencil tests to 22 college students in</v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange for one psychology credit.</v>

503
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much was I going to learn about mass</v>

504
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:06.090
<v Speaker 1>x disease?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The forces of history in that college</v>

505
00:27:06.091 --> 00:27:07.690
<v Speaker 1>costs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not saying that you,</v>

506
00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:11.190
<v Speaker 1>you had this foresight because for many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

507
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:15.450
<v Speaker 1>the idea of going to Grad school and</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a professor like that was the,</v>

508
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.570
<v Speaker 1>that was the golden pot at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rainbow.</v>

509
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.840
<v Speaker 1>And everybody knew I was going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>college professor from the time I was 10</v>

510
00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the closer I got to it,</v>

511
00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:28.000
<v Speaker 1>the more I realize that this is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>being put in a sardine can and having</v>

512
00:27:28.001 --> 00:27:29.190
<v Speaker 1>the cam welded over you.</v>

513
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

514
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

515
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started a commercial art studio with a</v>

516
00:27:38.791 --> 00:27:40.710
<v Speaker 1>bunch of artists that I had worked with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

517
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.290
<v Speaker 1>one day I was in class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

518
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I was very serious about poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry set a lot of the tones.</v>

519
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.210
<v Speaker 1>It taught me how to lead a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

520
00:27:51.211 --> 00:27:55.230
<v Speaker 1>the love song of j l for proof rock says</v>
<v Speaker 1>shmuck listen up the way that Einstein,</v>

521
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.280
<v Speaker 1>except he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

522
00:27:56.281 --> 00:27:58.770
<v Speaker 1>he's an antisemite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's not going to say Schumacher ts</v>

523
00:27:58.771 --> 00:27:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Elliot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he said,</v>

524
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.640
<v Speaker 1>listen up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't start doing the,</v>

525
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.100
<v Speaker 1>the heroic stuff that you feel will</v>
<v Speaker 1>divine,</v>

526
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.420
<v Speaker 1>will define you and bring young women</v>
<v Speaker 1>crawling to your ankles and kissing your</v>

527
00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:11.220
<v Speaker 1>knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>

528
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.340
<v Speaker 1>if you have that in you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that vision of what you want to be and</v>

529
00:28:14.341 --> 00:28:16.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't start it now today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this hour,</v>

530
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.280
<v Speaker 1>you will put it off and put it off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it off.</v>

531
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.910
<v Speaker 1>And when you hit the age of 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll suddenly realize you don't have</v>

532
00:28:23.911 --> 00:28:27.840
<v Speaker 1>the life force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the life energy to do</v>

533
00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:31.140
<v Speaker 1>that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your whole life will have been a</v>

534
00:28:31.141 --> 00:28:34.800
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have something heroic to do,</v>

535
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:39.600
<v Speaker 1>start it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was in a poetry class cause poetry</v>

536
00:28:39.601 --> 00:28:44.601
<v Speaker 1>had had a huge influence on my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one day the poetry teacher,</v>

537
00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:48.780
<v Speaker 1>the poet and residents in Nyu said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloom when everybody leaves the</v>

538
00:28:48.781 --> 00:28:51.510
<v Speaker 1>classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close the door.</v>

539
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.060
<v Speaker 1>I need to talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that doesn't sound good.</v>

540
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:56.730
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

541
00:28:56.731 --> 00:28:58.890
<v Speaker 1>He sat me in the balling out chair and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

542
00:28:58.891 --> 00:28:59.724
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

543
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.910
<v Speaker 1>last year I asked you to be on the staff</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the literary magazine.</v>

544
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.580
<v Speaker 1>You never even showed up this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

545
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.700
<v Speaker 1>you are the literary magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The minute you walk out that door,</v>

546
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.980
<v Speaker 1>your it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even have a faculty adviser</v>

547
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.180
<v Speaker 1>now get out the door.</v>

548
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:18.930
<v Speaker 1>So I turned it into an experimental</v>
<v Speaker 1>graphics and literary magazine.</v>

549
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.950
<v Speaker 1>So I knew a bunch of artists and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them was being thrown out of his</v>

550
00:29:22.951 --> 00:29:24.900
<v Speaker 1>apartment and it was the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the summer.</v>

551
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his electricity was about to be cut off,</v>

552
00:29:28.081 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 1>his phone was about to be caught off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his furniture gallery being repossessed.</v>

553
00:29:31.051 --> 00:29:36.051
<v Speaker 1>He and his wife and child were sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a bear rug floor crying when I walked</v>

554
00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:38.850
<v Speaker 1>in and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

555
00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:41.800
<v Speaker 1>you're a bloody genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me your portfolio.</v>

556
00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it out for two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

557
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:45.610
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll get the,</v>

558
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:50.260
<v Speaker 1>allow you to pay your rent and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can move on and get a proper summer job.</v>

559
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.510
<v Speaker 1>While it didn't turn out to be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy,</v>

560
00:29:52.511 --> 00:29:55.990
<v Speaker 1>by the end of the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't gotten a single job.</v>

561
00:29:55.991 --> 00:29:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I got in New York magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addressed it and doing a feature on my</v>

562
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:01.510
<v Speaker 1>art studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I hadn't gotten the artists and the</v>

563
00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:03.520
<v Speaker 1>other artists in the studio a single</v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

564
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.810
<v Speaker 1>And I'm an obsessive compulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I call Columbia where I was supposed</v>

565
00:30:07.811 --> 00:30:10.700
<v Speaker 1>to go to Grad school and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

566
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a back problem.</v>

567
00:30:12.041 --> 00:30:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I won't be showing up this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

568
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.060
<v Speaker 1>The truth at any price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the price of your life,</v>

569
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.150
<v Speaker 1>is one of my religious principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the first rule of science.</v>

570
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:21.860
<v Speaker 1>The second rule of science is look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>things right under your nose,</v>

571
00:30:21.861 --> 00:30:23.170
<v Speaker 1>noses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've never seen them before.</v>

572
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And then proceed from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth at any price,</v>

573
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:27.700
<v Speaker 1>including the price of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

574
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:30.760
<v Speaker 1>So when people tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example about my book,</v>

575
00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:33.280
<v Speaker 1>the Mohammad Code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it desert profit brought you isis,</v>

576
00:30:33.281 --> 00:30:36.250
<v Speaker 1>al Qaeda in Boko Haram or Hama Hama and</v>
<v Speaker 1>met and Jihad.</v>

577
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So when people realized I was writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

578
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.440
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't write that you'll get killed.</v>

579
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first rule of science is the truth</v>

580
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:47.380
<v Speaker 1>and any price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the price of your life.</v>

581
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:50.260
<v Speaker 1>And if you tell me I can't write it</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's gonna get me killed,</v>

582
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I know that it's doubly important for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to write this because nobody else is</v>

583
00:30:54.281 --> 00:30:57.050
<v Speaker 1>going to have the guts to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

584
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.440
<v Speaker 1>it falls on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So screw that.</v>

585
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.793
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

586
00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:04.860
<v Speaker 2>you seem to be approaching all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things,</v>

587
00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.910
<v Speaker 2>whether it is sitting in the cafe</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to music,</v>

588
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:12.090
<v Speaker 2>being surrounded by people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poetry,</v>

589
00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

590
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.870
<v Speaker 2>the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ecstatic state that you were</v>

591
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.720
<v Speaker 2>studying when it comes to Hitler or</v>
<v Speaker 2>rocks,</v>

592
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.900
<v Speaker 2>rock music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're seem to be looking at this as</v>

593
00:31:21.901 --> 00:31:26.901
<v Speaker 2>almost like a form of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily uncharted energy but uh,</v>

594
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:33.090
<v Speaker 2>undocumented as almost as if it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

595
00:31:33.091 --> 00:31:38.091
<v Speaker 2>there's fuel out there that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're tapping into and utilizing that,</v>

596
00:31:38.581 --> 00:31:40.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody's kind of aware of.</v>

597
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.010
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think they're thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it the same way that you are.</v>

598
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm looking at this in the context</v>

599
00:31:46.141 --> 00:31:49.080
<v Speaker 1>of everything from the big bang to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in our brains while</v>

600
00:31:49.081 --> 00:31:50.850
<v Speaker 1>we're having this conversation in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

601
00:31:50.851 --> 00:31:54.360
<v Speaker 1>you and I are fashioning through our</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions at this point.</v>

602
00:31:54.361 --> 00:31:56.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at this in terms of very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

603
00:31:56.371 --> 00:32:00.180
<v Speaker 1>very big picture and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get disturbed when it looks like</v>

604
00:32:00.181 --> 00:32:02.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get typed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've spent so much time on,</v>

605
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:06.930
<v Speaker 1>on space in the last few years that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid people are going to type me.</v>

606
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.680
<v Speaker 1>And I refuse to be typed as the space</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

607
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

608
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Because I need to have access to every</v>
<v Speaker 1>field that I can possibly understand</v>

609
00:32:14.371 --> 00:32:16.890
<v Speaker 1>because I'm in the process of putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>together a big picture.</v>

610
00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.450
<v Speaker 2>When you say you worried about being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

611
00:32:19.451 --> 00:32:22.210
<v Speaker 2>after all you've accomplished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could you be tight?</v>

612
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real easy.</v>

613
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:28.750
<v Speaker 1>But by who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it partly by myself but also by</v>

614
00:32:29.721 --> 00:32:30.860
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

615
00:32:30.861 --> 00:32:31.960
<v Speaker 1>By yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

616
00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:34.160
<v Speaker 1>You're worried about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

617
00:32:34.161 --> 00:32:35.900
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely.</v>

618
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.370
<v Speaker 1>In order to be happy I need to be in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dozen simultaneously.</v>

619
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am much less intense about it,</v>

620
00:32:44.301 --> 00:32:48.410
<v Speaker 1>but I share a similar desire to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by many different things at</v>

621
00:32:48.411 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to see where they all fit</v>

622
00:32:50.631 --> 00:32:52.160
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real trick.</v>

623
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.810
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the real,</v>

624
00:32:53.811 --> 00:32:55.430
<v Speaker 1>and the tool for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

625
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.670
<v Speaker 1>when I was 12 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents,</v>

626
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.550
<v Speaker 1>I'd never paid attention in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read two books a day.</v>

627
00:33:01.551 --> 00:33:03.620
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I read a book on under the desk</v>

628
00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:06.890
<v Speaker 1>teacher who cared about the teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

629
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:10.790
<v Speaker 1>and my parents were going to send me off</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a small private school.</v>

630
00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:14.120
<v Speaker 1>But they made me promise to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work in school.</v>

631
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd never worked in school before and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget where I was going with this</v>

632
00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:18.790
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

633
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.590
<v Speaker 1>but there is one experience I had in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little high school.</v>

634
00:33:21.591 --> 00:33:26.591
<v Speaker 1>It's really relevant and that is okay by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time I'm 16 years old,</v>

635
00:33:26.631 --> 00:33:30.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to after the ecstatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience for four years in scientific</v>

636
00:33:30.621 --> 00:33:33.050
<v Speaker 1>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm 14 and here about a book called</v>

637
00:33:33.051 --> 00:33:35.870
<v Speaker 1>the varieties of the religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience by William James.</v>

638
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.470
<v Speaker 1>I spend four months looking for a copy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the book because there is no Amazon</v>

639
00:33:39.471 --> 00:33:40.940
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

640
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:43.100
<v Speaker 1>and finding books in buffalo isn't that</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

641
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:46.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm 16 and I've been elected</v>

642
00:33:46.851 --> 00:33:49.190
<v Speaker 1>the head of the program committee and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

643
00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.460
<v Speaker 1>the program committee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this every day starts for the entire</v>

644
00:33:52.461 --> 00:33:55.730
<v Speaker 1>student body with a 45 minute morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>session.</v>

645
00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:01.040
<v Speaker 1>And I mc those sessions and I program</v>
<v Speaker 1>two of them.</v>

646
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:05.810
<v Speaker 1>So the juniors come to me and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could we were having a dance?</v>

647
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Could you please advertise our dance for</v>
<v Speaker 1>us?</v>

648
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.160
<v Speaker 1>And they don't understand the irony of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they've just ask.</v>

649
00:34:12.161 --> 00:34:14.180
<v Speaker 1>If there's a dance anywhere in Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York.</v>

650
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.040
<v Speaker 1>People want me to park my feet</v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere,</v>

651
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:18.800
<v Speaker 1>preferably in Cleveland or Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

652
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so this is really weird request.</v>

653
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:26.780
<v Speaker 1>So I put a piece of music on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>turntable behind the stage and I get up</v>

654
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:29.120
<v Speaker 1>on the stage and I'm incompetent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't dance.</v>

655
00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent a year in dance class.</v>

656
00:34:31.101 --> 00:34:32.630
<v Speaker 1>My parents were trying to make me</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>

657
00:34:32.631 --> 00:34:34.180
<v Speaker 1>didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

658
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:38.600
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I dance and it's not like any dance</v>

659
00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:41.750
<v Speaker 1>you've ever seen before in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see the girl who hates me most,</v>

660
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:46.700
<v Speaker 1>I see her pupils start to dilate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I see all of the pupils,</v>

661
00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.870
<v Speaker 1>350 sets of pupils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>700 eyeballs dilating.</v>

662
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:55.790
<v Speaker 1>And then I see their faces melting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it feels as if their energy</v>

663
00:34:55.791 --> 00:35:00.791
<v Speaker 1>coalesces like a big Amoeba and reaches</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a pseudopod in the pseudopod sends</v>

664
00:35:01.551 --> 00:35:02.630
<v Speaker 1>itself through me.</v>

665
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:06.350
<v Speaker 1>And the energy goes up through me as if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I were an empty pipe,</v>

666
00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:11.120
<v Speaker 1>reaches something just above my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And His transmogrified utterly</v>

667
00:35:11.121 --> 00:35:14.990
<v Speaker 1>transformed and goes back down to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience again in a continuous feedback</v>

668
00:35:14.991 --> 00:35:18.800
<v Speaker 1>loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have an auto body experience.</v>

669
00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced that I'm on the ceiling</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching all of this happen,</v>

670
00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.850
<v Speaker 1>that I'm not under under any control</v>
<v Speaker 1>from me.</v>

671
00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm in control of this energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally when it's all over,</v>

672
00:35:30.231 --> 00:35:33.050
<v Speaker 1>remember these kids do not like me in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this school.</v>

673
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

674
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:39.000
<v Speaker 1>and they do something as if they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>practiced it all their lives.</v>

675
00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:41.670
<v Speaker 1>And I know for a fact they have never</v>
<v Speaker 1>done it before.</v>

676
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.040
<v Speaker 1>They surged down to the foot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

677
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.180
<v Speaker 1>They pick me up on their shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they carry me out of the auditory.</v>

678
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:52.140
<v Speaker 1>They carry me up the walkway to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>building above where we have our</v>

679
00:35:52.141 --> 00:35:52.620
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

680
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.170
<v Speaker 1>And then they put me down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never did it before.</v>

681
00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:58.680
<v Speaker 1>They never did it afterward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not for football stars,</v>

682
00:35:58.681 --> 00:36:00.750
<v Speaker 1>not for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a scene in a movie.</v>

683
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might be.</v>

684
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.710
<v Speaker 1>What is that for me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I then after,</v>

685
00:36:04.711 --> 00:36:05.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been the,</v>

686
00:36:05.221 --> 00:36:07.920
<v Speaker 1>after the ecstatic experience by then at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

687
00:36:07.921 --> 00:36:10.890
<v Speaker 1>that the carves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forces of history for four years of</v>

688
00:36:10.891 --> 00:36:13.710
<v Speaker 1>my bloody life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you think you tapped into?</v>

689
00:36:13.711 --> 00:36:15.560
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you think you had somehow another</v>

690
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.100
<v Speaker 1>manifested this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

691
00:36:17.101 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew I tacked into a part of me that's</v>

692
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:21.781
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

693
00:36:21.781 --> 00:36:24.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents tried to drag me off.</v>

694
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

695
00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going back in time.</v>

696
00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to when I was about to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 years old.</v>

697
00:36:29.281 --> 00:36:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

698
00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:34.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I realized sometime when I was 12</v>

699
00:36:34.021 --> 00:36:35.700
<v Speaker 1>and a half years old that I was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist.</v>

700
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 and a half.</v>

701
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:38.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

702
00:36:38.251 --> 00:36:40.290
<v Speaker 1>why 12 and a half at 12?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>

703
00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I have six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took me two and a half years of</v>

704
00:36:43.741 --> 00:36:46.210
<v Speaker 1>reading two books a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at,</v>

705
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:47.280
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

706
00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:50.940
<v Speaker 1>you can sometimes park something just</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of consciousness and a closet of</v>

707
00:36:50.941 --> 00:36:53.970
<v Speaker 1>your mind and keep it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I kept it there because I didn't want</v>

708
00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:56.010
<v Speaker 1>to miss out on the precedence for my bar</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitzvah.</v>

709
00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.260
<v Speaker 1>And plus it was the only party I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever going to be invited to my own Bar</v>

710
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Mitzvah party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

711
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Who could write you gotta kiss is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

712
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:09.900
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't until after the Bar Mitzvah</v>
<v Speaker 1>was over and all of the thank you notes</v>

713
00:37:09.901 --> 00:37:13.010
<v Speaker 1>had been written a sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was able to,</v>

714
00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.440
<v Speaker 1>to admit that I'm an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that means that I,</v>

715
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:20.100
<v Speaker 1>my bar Mitzvah was in June by the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm finished with all the thank you</v>

716
00:37:20.101 --> 00:37:21.030
<v Speaker 1>notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's August.</v>

717
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's just around the corner September</v>

718
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:25.950
<v Speaker 1>and in the Jewish calendar that high</v>
<v Speaker 1>holidays.</v>

719
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:30.300
<v Speaker 1>So my parents tried to drag me off to</v>
<v Speaker 1>high holidays and they get me as far as</v>

720
00:37:30.301 --> 00:37:35.190
<v Speaker 1>the street that the synagogue is on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I refused to go any further and</v>

721
00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.410
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

722
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:38.610
<v Speaker 1>well not by now it's 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

723
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm hanging on to these sturdily</v>

724
00:37:42.481 --> 00:37:47.010
<v Speaker 1>American craftsmen built doors of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fraser blue car.</v>

725
00:37:47.011 --> 00:37:50.400
<v Speaker 1>My Dad drives and my parents are at my</v>
<v Speaker 1>ankles trying,</v>

726
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.890
<v Speaker 1>spreading my socks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to pull me up toward the</v>

727
00:37:52.891 --> 00:37:57.450
<v Speaker 1>synagogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have a sudden realization Galileo</v>

728
00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:02.400
<v Speaker 1>had his insights by taking these new</v>
<v Speaker 1>fangled devices called lenses,</v>

729
00:38:02.401 --> 00:38:04.830
<v Speaker 1>putting them in a tube and pointing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tube,</v>

730
00:38:04.831 --> 00:38:07.470
<v Speaker 1>which was designed to be used for</v>
<v Speaker 1>horizontal viewing.</v>

731
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.280
<v Speaker 1>So you could see an army coming over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon towards you long before they</v>

732
00:38:11.281 --> 00:38:15.210
<v Speaker 1>could see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes this tube and he turns it in a</v>

733
00:38:15.211 --> 00:38:17.130
<v Speaker 1>totally unexpected direction up.</v>

734
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.600
<v Speaker 1>And another guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anton van Leeuwenhoek who uses the same</v>

735
00:38:21.601 --> 00:38:24.960
<v Speaker 1>high tech devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lenses cause he's a draper,</v>

736
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.950
<v Speaker 1>he sells fabric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he uses his magnifying glass to see</v>

737
00:38:28.951 --> 00:38:33.390
<v Speaker 1>how tight the weavers and as fabric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his great innovation is to take</v>

738
00:38:33.391 --> 00:38:38.391
<v Speaker 1>these lenses and turn down and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>pond water and look at his own sperm.</v>

739
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I suddenly had this realization why</v>

740
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.240
<v Speaker 1>parents are shredding my socks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to drag me up to the synagogue.</v>

741
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.320
<v Speaker 1>There are no gods in the heavens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no gods beneath the earth.</v>

742
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.650
<v Speaker 1>So where are the gods right now in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene?</v>

743
00:38:53.651 --> 00:38:58.651
<v Speaker 1>There in my parents and they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are tugging with astonishing force at my</v>

744
00:38:58.691 --> 00:39:01.690
<v Speaker 1>parents and my socks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there,</v>

745
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:04.540
<v Speaker 1>if the gods or in my parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the gods are in me too.</v>

746
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 1>So my task in life is going to be to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that lens that Galileo churned up</v>

747
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:14.640
<v Speaker 1>and that van Leeuwenhoek turned down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn it within to find the gods inside</v>

748
00:39:15.431 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 1>of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning finding those ecstatic</v>

749
00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:23.341
<v Speaker 1>experiences and that dance experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the most primal of these ecstatic,</v>

750
00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.870
<v Speaker 1>you could call them spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

751
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.730
<v Speaker 1>but for me it's sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual,</v>

752
00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:33.140
<v Speaker 1>secular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

753
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:34.360
<v Speaker 1>spirituality.</v>

754
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I got sex on the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was the,</v>

755
00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:43.580
<v Speaker 1>that was the closest I was going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what Hitler had summon forth.</v>

756
00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Those speeches that Hitler gave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand German,</v>

757
00:39:47.511 --> 00:39:52.310
<v Speaker 2>but there the intensity that he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving these speeches out,</v>

758
00:39:52.311 --> 00:39:57.170
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen this before with radical</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam speakers or with,</v>

759
00:39:57.171 --> 00:39:59.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many different religious leaders.</v>

760
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.940
<v Speaker 2>There's something about what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that is,</v>

761
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:04.220
<v Speaker 2>it's almost contagious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

762
00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.260
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see whatever there,</v>

763
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.410
<v Speaker 2>the energy that they're putting out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so compelling.</v>

764
00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:12.770
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bizarre thing that human beings</v>

765
00:40:12.771 --> 00:40:16.680
<v Speaker 2>have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this compulsion to pay attention to</v>

766
00:40:16.681 --> 00:40:20.910
<v Speaker 2>people that have achieved this extreme</v>
<v Speaker 2>level of performance.</v>

767
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Well because they seen locked into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

768
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:26.280
<v Speaker 2>That truth speaks to itself through</v>
<v Speaker 2>every muscle of their body.</v>

769
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Confident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

770
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.350
<v Speaker 2>Like the preacher on stage shouting out</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the heavens.</v>

771
00:40:31.351 --> 00:40:34.590
<v Speaker 2>And if you're that confident to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>that much energy and conviction,</v>

772
00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.270
<v Speaker 2>there must be some truth to what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying</v>

773
00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.950
<v Speaker 1>and there is a good chance that you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a kind of out of body experience</v>

774
00:40:39.951 --> 00:40:43.310
<v Speaker 1>of one kind or another because something</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper inside of you takes you over and</v>

775
00:40:43.311 --> 00:40:46.280
<v Speaker 1>performs through you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not you,</v>

776
00:40:46.281 --> 00:40:49.730
<v Speaker 1>but of course it is you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were going to come to me when</v>

777
00:40:49.731 --> 00:40:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I was in the rock and roll business and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want it to be my client,</v>

778
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:58.010
<v Speaker 1>I would give you a lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say you have to understand</v>

779
00:40:58.011 --> 00:41:01.010
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are coming to me to fashion and</v>

780
00:41:01.011 --> 00:41:06.011
<v Speaker 1>image to brand you and to make you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>superstar,</v>

781
00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you an appointment immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the hour with my best competitor.</v>

782
00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're going to work with me,</v>

783
00:41:15.711 --> 00:41:20.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that music is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>an exchange of pieces of plastic.</v>

784
00:41:20.031 --> 00:41:23.300
<v Speaker 1>It is not an exchange of downloads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not an exchange of money.</v>

785
00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not about markets and branding and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that stuff.</v>

786
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Music is about an exchange of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>

787
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:34.760
<v Speaker 1>When you sit in front of a blank piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>of or two o'clock in the afternoon to</v>

788
00:41:34.761 --> 00:41:37.070
<v Speaker 1>write a lyric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you can never write a lyric</v>

789
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.070
<v Speaker 1>again cause you have no idea of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've ever written lyrics in the past</v>

790
00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.610
<v Speaker 1>and at four o'clock in the afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very often there's a lyric there.</v>

791
00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:47.810
<v Speaker 1>My job is to find the self inside you</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wrote that lyric and introduce it to</v>

792
00:41:47.811 --> 00:41:50.030
<v Speaker 1>the self that says hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>

793
00:41:50.031 --> 00:41:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much and all the</v>

794
00:41:51.681 --> 00:41:56.570
<v Speaker 1>ritualistic aspects of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go on stage you have the kind</v>

795
00:41:56.571 --> 00:41:59.000
<v Speaker 1>of experience that I had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

796
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.830
<v Speaker 1>are out of your own body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your danced around as if you were a</v>

797
00:42:03.831 --> 00:42:07.610
<v Speaker 1>marionette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel a 17,000 souls coursing through</v>

798
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:11.660
<v Speaker 1>you to something higher being</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmogrified and channeling back to</v>

799
00:42:11.661 --> 00:42:13.430
<v Speaker 1>those people and a continuous loop.</v>

800
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:16.430
<v Speaker 1>My job is to find that soul inside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

801
00:42:16.431 --> 00:42:19.640
<v Speaker 1>the dances you on stage and introduce it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the self of hello,</v>

802
00:42:19.641 --> 00:42:21.290
<v Speaker 1>how you find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

803
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:25.400
<v Speaker 1>So if you're willing to give me six</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks to study you and then come out to</v>

804
00:42:25.401 --> 00:42:29.420
<v Speaker 1>your environment and see you in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment for anywhere from one to</v>

805
00:42:29.421 --> 00:42:32.930
<v Speaker 1>three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my job is secular shamanism.</v>

806
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Find that fucking soul that dances and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang out with them.</v>

807
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:40.640
<v Speaker 1>I have not really hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be a very intense interview</v>

808
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.040
<v Speaker 1>with John Mellencamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started at nine o'clock in the</v>

809
00:42:43.041 --> 00:42:45.080
<v Speaker 1>morning at his home in Seymour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indiana.</v>

810
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.510
<v Speaker 1>We finished at four o'clock in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>afternoon.</v>

811
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.481
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

812
00:42:48.481 --> 00:42:51.410
<v Speaker 1>the way that he only looked when he came</v>
<v Speaker 1>off stage,</v>

813
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.830
<v Speaker 1>he looked hollowed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked like a scarecrow.</v>

814
00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had empty caverns where his eyes</v>

815
00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:01.160
<v Speaker 1>should have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was wiped.</v>

816
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:06.230
<v Speaker 1>He was totally wiped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that interview allowed me to find</v>

817
00:43:06.831 --> 00:43:10.100
<v Speaker 1>the authentic John Mellencamp and preach</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to the press and turn depressed who</v>

818
00:43:10.101 --> 00:43:12.650
<v Speaker 1>hated John Mellencamp around why they</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate him.</v>

819
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:18.070
<v Speaker 1>They hated him because he had signed</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Tony to freeze who was managing</v>

820
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.310
<v Speaker 1>David Bowie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Tony Jeffries thought that his magic</v>

821
00:43:22.311 --> 00:43:26.720
<v Speaker 1>came from changing of people's names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David had dave go a been named David</v>

822
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Jones and he changed it to Bowie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he called John Johnny coover and</v>

823
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:35.780
<v Speaker 1>then he did something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds devilishly clever,</v>

824
00:43:35.781 --> 00:43:38.390
<v Speaker 1>but was the opposite of clever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

825
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:43.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a book made with one page on each of</v>

826
00:43:43.551 --> 00:43:47.900
<v Speaker 1>all of the dominant critics of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One page,</v>

827
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:51.560
<v Speaker 1>a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little write up on each of them and</v>

828
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:56.590
<v Speaker 1>the press perceive this as trying to buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they don't like being bought.</v>

829
00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they rebelled.</v>

830
00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:03.210
<v Speaker 1>And the word went out in the press that</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Cougar was a Prek,</v>

831
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:07.010
<v Speaker 1>that he was just an obnoxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible human being and that his music</v>

832
00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:07.844
<v Speaker 1>was crap.</v>

833
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:12.590
<v Speaker 1>And so even my friend can emerson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my impression from Ken,</v>

834
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Ken was at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the record reviews editor for rolling</v>

835
00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:19.370
<v Speaker 1>stone and eventually he'd be an editor</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the New York Times Sunday magazine,</v>

836
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:24.550
<v Speaker 1>a very influential magazine nationwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my impression was the Caen wrote his</v>

837
00:44:26.331 --> 00:44:31.331
<v Speaker 1>review of John's album without ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>opening the shrink wrap without ever</v>

838
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.230
<v Speaker 1>listening to it because everybody was</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumed in that community that you knew</v>

839
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 1>what John's music was crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what,</v>

840
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:44.250
<v Speaker 1>his personality was crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you open the album and listen to</v>

841
00:44:44.251 --> 00:44:46.590
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would be expelled.</v>

842
00:44:46.591 --> 00:44:49.500
<v Speaker 1>People would shun you at the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>launch.</v>

843
00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:53.130
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't want you there or the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shinar even listened to it.</v>

844
00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

845
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:56.160
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to,</v>

846
00:44:56.190 --> 00:45:01.020
<v Speaker 1>the group think had been established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pure pressure is tremendous within</v>

847
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:03.900
<v Speaker 1>the rock crit or was tremendous within</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rock critic.</v>

848
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Stablish um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rock among the rock critics and it</v>

849
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:09.480
<v Speaker 1>goes up so much power back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so crazy,</v>

850
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:12.660
<v Speaker 1>but they were so rigidly conformity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forest.</v>

851
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Now this wasn't unique to the 1970</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and 1980s because Carlisle,</v>

852
00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:22.260
<v Speaker 1>the social commentator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Carlyle and England and</v>

853
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:27.290
<v Speaker 1>approximately 1832 wrote about the pop</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture critics of his day and his day</v>

854
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:33.990
<v Speaker 1>pop culture was novels and plays and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

855
00:45:33.991 --> 00:45:38.991
<v Speaker 1>and he compared them to sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he explained how if you take a cane</v>

856
00:45:39.361 --> 00:45:41.760
<v Speaker 1>and you put it out with the sheep</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking single file,</v>

857
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.850
<v Speaker 1>you can get 2000 sheep all walking in</v>
<v Speaker 1>single file.</v>

858
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.450
<v Speaker 1>And if you put your cane out in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead sheep on the lead sheet,</v>

859
00:45:48.451 --> 00:45:51.060
<v Speaker 1>jumped over your cane and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrew the cane.</v>

860
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Every one of the other 4,999 sheep would</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump at precisely the same spot even</v>

861
00:45:58.861 --> 00:46:01.770
<v Speaker 1>though there was nothing to jump over</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

862
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I perceived the rock crit</v>

863
00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:08.160
<v Speaker 1>elite and my job was to turn them</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

864
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.360
<v Speaker 1>But my job was also to see true</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecstatics like prince,</v>

865
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:16.620
<v Speaker 1>like John Michael Jackson was not an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecstatic onstage.</v>

866
00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson wasn't incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>astonishing performer who had studied</v>

867
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:26.070
<v Speaker 1>his craft from the age of nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he worked out every single move</v>

868
00:46:26.071 --> 00:46:27.360
<v Speaker 1>and advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

869
00:46:27.361 --> 00:46:30.360
<v Speaker 1>you never knew from one night to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next what prince or John Mellencamp</v>

870
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:33.600
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do in performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know how well did you know</v>

871
00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought very,</v>

872
00:46:36.331 --> 00:46:39.780
<v Speaker 1>very well and he was the most remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 1>person I've ever met in my life.</v>

873
00:46:39.781 --> 00:46:42.510
<v Speaker 1>And when I tell people how remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't believe me,</v>

874
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:44.280
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

875
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:49.510
<v Speaker 1>and I and Jamie are on a certain level</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know we're on a certain</v>

876
00:46:51.751 --> 00:46:53.640
<v Speaker 1>level because we figured these are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>

877
00:46:53.641 --> 00:46:55.080
<v Speaker 1>This is the range of humanity.</v>

878
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we go out and meet anybody on the</v>

879
00:46:57.361 --> 00:47:00.720
<v Speaker 1>street or even anybody famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work with Buzz Aldrin these days,</v>

880
00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.780
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to encounter is another</v>
<v Speaker 1>person pretty much like costs.</v>

881
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Michael Jackson's case,</v>

882
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.110
<v Speaker 1>he did not fit on this normal plain at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

883
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:13.560
<v Speaker 1>He was on a plane somewhere where you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen a human being before.</v>

884
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.920
<v Speaker 1>So the first time I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were at his brother Marlin's</v>

885
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:25.230
<v Speaker 1>have pool house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little house with just enough</v>

886
00:47:25.231 --> 00:47:29.590
<v Speaker 1>room for one big room on the first floor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another big room on the second with</v>

887
00:47:29.591 --> 00:47:33.970
<v Speaker 1>a little tiny staircase between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a billiard table in the</v>

888
00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:36.130
<v Speaker 1>middle of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were arcade games,</v>

889
00:47:36.131 --> 00:47:39.670
<v Speaker 1>which at that point in particular in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1983,</v>

890
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were unattainable.</v>

891
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.040
<v Speaker 1>No human could afford arcade games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

892
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:48.430
<v Speaker 1>unless you were Steve Wynn and you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually equipping in arcade.</v>

893
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're in the middle.</v>

894
00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:54.670
<v Speaker 1>We're in this room and Michael and I are</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing next to each other,</v>

895
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:59.671
<v Speaker 1>so his elbow is at his left elbow is at</v>
<v Speaker 1>my right elbow.</v>

896
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:05.190
<v Speaker 1>His left knee is at my right knee and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a meeting with the art director</v>

897
00:48:05.231 --> 00:48:07.870
<v Speaker 1>from CBS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm condensing the story,</v>

898
00:48:07.871 --> 00:48:11.350
<v Speaker 1>there's lots more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're having a meeting with the art</v>

899
00:48:11.351 --> 00:48:14.830
<v Speaker 1>director and she walks in with five of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most gorgeous portfolios you've ever</v>

900
00:48:14.831 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 1>seen in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hand carved cherry wood,</v>

901
00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:21.640
<v Speaker 1>hand carved leather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are from guys I know because I</v>

902
00:48:21.641 --> 00:48:24.010
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started in pop culture in the art</v>

903
00:48:24.011 --> 00:48:27.400
<v Speaker 1>business and these were my legendary</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitors.</v>

904
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:32.910
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Michael opens the first page of the</v>

905
00:48:33.341 --> 00:48:36.190
<v Speaker 1>first portfolio and he gets a square</v>
<v Speaker 1>inch into it,</v>

906
00:48:36.191 --> 00:48:39.820
<v Speaker 1>a postage stamp size piece into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

907
00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:44.110
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his knees began to buckle and he</v>

908
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:48.700
<v Speaker 1>gets another two square inches into it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just lifts the page a little bit</v>

909
00:48:48.701 --> 00:48:49.534
<v Speaker 1>further.</v>

910
00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lifts it an even further.</v>

911
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael is seeing the infinite in the,</v>

912
00:48:56.210 --> 00:49:01.180
<v Speaker 1>the things that even the artist didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it with such infinity as Michael is</v>

913
00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:04.210
<v Speaker 1>singing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the time he gets to the full</v>

914
00:49:04.211 --> 00:49:07.630
<v Speaker 1>page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's having a full scale aesthetic</v>

915
00:49:07.631 --> 00:49:10.720
<v Speaker 1>orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have never seen anything like this in</v>

916
00:49:10.721 --> 00:49:11.950
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And remember,</v>

917
00:49:11.951 --> 00:49:14.920
<v Speaker 1>the first two rules of science are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth at any price,</v>

918
00:49:14.921 --> 00:49:17.230
<v Speaker 1>including the price of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look at things,</v>

919
00:49:17.231 --> 00:49:20.440
<v Speaker 1>run under right under your nose as if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've never seen them before.</v>

920
00:49:20.441 --> 00:49:23.560
<v Speaker 1>And then proceed from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael is seeing the infinite in the</v>

921
00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:28.030
<v Speaker 1>tiniest of things and you've never seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human with this degree of awe,</v>

922
00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:30.850
<v Speaker 1>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and surprise anywhere in your life.</v>

923
00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:35.050
<v Speaker 1>And I will never see another human like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that again in my lifetime.</v>

924
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Michael was beyond belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>utterly beyond belief and his commitment</v>

925
00:49:41.141 --> 00:49:42.400
<v Speaker 1>to his audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to his,</v>

926
00:49:42.401 --> 00:49:44.830
<v Speaker 1>the people he called his kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

927
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to turn this off.</v>

928
00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:48.980
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to call.</v>

929
00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.660

<v Speaker 3>so let's find,</v>

930
00:49:52.661 --> 00:49:54.970
<v Speaker 3>of course you're an android guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

931
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:56.290
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

932
00:49:56.291 --> 00:49:59.590

<v Speaker 3>I know we pulled down from here.</v>

933
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:03.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm an incompetent with this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could you be a people for people who</v>

934
00:50:03.431 --> 00:50:06.190
<v Speaker 3>don't see you right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because a lot of people are listening.</v>

935
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:10.830
<v Speaker 3>He has literally a Batman utility belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

936
00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:15.340
<v Speaker 3>with two Kendall's you have to kindle</v>
<v Speaker 3>strapped to you at all times,</v>

937
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have the headphones for the podcast</v>

938
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:21.340
<v Speaker 3>and I have spare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a total of three pair of</v>

939
00:50:21.341 --> 00:50:25.300
<v Speaker 3>headphones on me because they were out</v>
<v Speaker 3>so quickly and they're going to need to</v>

940
00:50:25.301 --> 00:50:26.470
<v Speaker 3>replace them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

941
00:50:26.471 --> 00:50:28.180
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing with them too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

942
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm petting dogs and that yanks them</v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

943
00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

944
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.440
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best quality sound that I've been</v>

945
00:50:33.441 --> 00:50:35.840
<v Speaker 3>able to get is in $8 headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

946
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:37.050
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

947
00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:41.360
<v Speaker 3>It's extraordinary sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that the wiring goes why,</v>

948
00:50:41.361 --> 00:50:43.670
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it the best quality sound?</v>

949
00:50:43.671 --> 00:50:47.600
<v Speaker 3>Those cheap ass headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has the best quality base that I've</v>

950
00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:50.300
<v Speaker 3>ever gotten worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though the ones that are like</v>

951
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.180
<v Speaker 3>straight wires with clear covers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>

952
00:50:53.181 --> 00:50:56.570
<v Speaker 3>I actually get very annoyed when apple</v>
<v Speaker 3>got rid of the microphone.</v>

953
00:50:56.571 --> 00:51:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Jack The headphone Jack on their phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While I would be annoyed too.</v>

954
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of that.</v>

955
00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Such a high quality sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

956
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:06.560
<v Speaker 3>So I'm surrounded with Electronica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to my phone,</v>

957
00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:10.010
<v Speaker 3>my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I do not agree on what a command is.</v>

958
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:13.370
<v Speaker 3>So whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well when I tried to pick up the phone</v>

959
00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:18.230
<v Speaker 3>and answer it and hangs up when I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do anything on the phone,</v>

960
00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.320
<v Speaker 3>it interprets that as a hand gesture of</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort and does something.</v>

961
00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.440
<v Speaker 3>Which one are you using?</v>

962
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:24.370
<v Speaker 3>The Samsung note eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

963
00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:25.520
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

964
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people think that Samson's uh,</v>

965
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.870
<v Speaker 3>got a little bit of bloatware and their</v>
<v Speaker 3>songs.</v>

966
00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Since you're an android guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever considered using like a</v>

967
00:51:32.901 --> 00:51:35.920
<v Speaker 3>google pixel two like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I like,</v>

968
00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:39.440
<v Speaker 3>I like a big screen pixel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two xl,</v>

969
00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:43.730
<v Speaker 3>a six inch screens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be very neat.</v>

970
00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.620
<v Speaker 3>6.2 would be terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also,</v>

971
00:51:45.621 --> 00:51:48.470
<v Speaker 3>when you squeeze the sides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google assistant pops up.</v>

972
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:49.311
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

973
00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:51.620
<v Speaker 3>You squeeze the sides and he gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>started asking a question.</v>

974
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to find one that is also got the</v>

975
00:51:53.961 --> 00:51:56.480
<v Speaker 3>headphone Jack on the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a headphone Jack.</v>

976
00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.150
<v Speaker 3>Google got rid of the headphone Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

977
00:51:59.151 --> 00:52:00.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying.</v>

978
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.870
<v Speaker 3>Because if you use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you use Bluetooth,</v>

979
00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.680
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's tuned to your cell phone,</v>

980
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:11.540
<v Speaker 3>you can't tune it to your kindle and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't tune it to your laptop.</v>

981
00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:15.140
<v Speaker 3>And I need to be able to switch between</v>
<v Speaker 3>those three devices simultaneously.</v>

982
00:52:15.141 --> 00:52:18.650
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you have that kindle fire hd</v>

983
00:52:18.651 --> 00:52:22.880
<v Speaker 3>application where you can listen to it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then as you're reading it,</v>

984
00:52:22.881 --> 00:52:24.530
<v Speaker 3>it picks up back where you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening?</v>

985
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Well it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to do that,</v>

986
00:52:27.501 --> 00:52:31.850
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes it really wimps out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes me 30 pages a far away from where</v>

987
00:52:31.851 --> 00:52:34.130
<v Speaker 3>I was reading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it becomes hard to find where I was</v>

988
00:52:34.131 --> 00:52:35.710
<v Speaker 3>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

989
00:52:35.711 --> 00:52:37.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why I curse jeff visas.</v>

990
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:40.430
<v Speaker 3>I hope he knows what he's doing in space</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than he knows what he's doing</v>

991
00:52:40.431 --> 00:52:41.960
<v Speaker 3>with the kindle hdx.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

992
00:52:41.961 --> 00:52:46.340
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think he could possibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>know all the things he's doing,</v>

993
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:48.110
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you'll hire good people who do know</v>

994
00:52:48.111 --> 00:52:50.480
<v Speaker 3>those things and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's supposed to be cheap.</v>

995
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:54.210
<v Speaker 3>Like in terms of like how he pays</v>
<v Speaker 3>workers at the Amazon fact.</v>

996
00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:57.140
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue origin,</v>

997
00:52:57.141 --> 00:52:59.630
<v Speaker 3>his rocket company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he is not cheap.</v>

998
00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know he had a rocket</v>

999
00:53:01.221 --> 00:53:02.750
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a rocket company.</v>

1000
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:04.160
<v Speaker 3>Elon Musk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1001
00:53:04.161 --> 00:53:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Look at you over these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff.</v>

1002
00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:10.300
<v Speaker 3>He thinks that he thinks that that space</v>
<v Speaker 3>x and Elon Musk are the hair and he's</v>

1003
00:53:11.361 --> 00:53:14.630
<v Speaker 3>the tortoise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he has launched a rocket,</v>

1004
00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:18.260
<v Speaker 3>the same rocket eight times now and</v>
<v Speaker 3>landed it again.</v>

1005
00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:19.081
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:53:19.081 --> 00:53:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Same rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same rocket.</v>

1007
00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:26.050
<v Speaker 3>So he's demonstrated multiple reuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that his rocket can't,</v>

1008
00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:28.560
<v Speaker 3>you can only get to the fringes of</v>
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>

1009
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.590
<v Speaker 3>It can't really get into orbital space</v>
<v Speaker 3>is right here.</v>

1010
00:53:31.591 --> 00:53:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Jamie just pulled it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could look at it right there.</v>

1011
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:36.110
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1012
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:37.800
<v Speaker 3>It's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a real,</v>

1013
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:39.480
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it look fake?</v>

1014
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:41.850
<v Speaker 3>You haven't seen it before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1015
00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:45.570
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't look like Cgi U.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sound like Eddie Bravo.</v>

1016
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.680
<v Speaker 3>So it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's actually launched this thing</v>

1017
00:53:49.681 --> 00:53:51.390
<v Speaker 3>eight times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's with the golf ball inside of</v>

1018
00:53:51.391 --> 00:53:53.370
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no clue.</v>

1019
00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:57.120
<v Speaker 3>It's probably demonstrating that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's weightless.</v>

1020
00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Really extraordinary time of super</v>
<v Speaker 3>genius.</v>

1021
00:54:00.361 --> 00:54:01.350
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible shit.</v>

1022
00:54:01.351 --> 00:54:03.900
<v Speaker 3>And this is how it lands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It lands the same way.</v>

1023
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:05.520
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

1024
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:07.830
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Elan says,</v>

1025
00:54:07.831 --> 00:54:12.270
<v Speaker 3>you know that Ellen has been landing his</v>
<v Speaker 3>rockets and he wants to read and he's</v>

1026
00:54:12.271 --> 00:54:15.210
<v Speaker 3>been reusing him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's done 11 reuses so far,</v>

1027
00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:18.090
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Elana sang that he's going to get so</v>

1028
00:54:18.091 --> 00:54:23.091
<v Speaker 3>precise in his landings that the rockets</v>
<v Speaker 3>will land precisely on the brackets from</v>

1029
00:54:24.121 --> 00:54:26.430
<v Speaker 3>which they took off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1030
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:27.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1031
00:54:27.991 --> 00:54:30.120
<v Speaker 3>and I was on the same pad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1032
00:54:30.121 --> 00:54:32.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a fairly small pad that the</v>

1033
00:54:32.461 --> 00:54:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Bayzos rocket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so basis is a very well controlled</v>

1034
00:54:35.131 --> 00:54:38.850
<v Speaker 3>rocket Elan's you saw after the Falcon</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy launch,</v>

1035
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:44.120
<v Speaker 3>the pictures of the two boosters landing</v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously within a hundred yards of</v>

1036
00:54:44.731 --> 00:54:45.564
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1037
00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:49.260
<v Speaker 3>You have to bring that up sometime</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's an astonishing,</v>

1038
00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:54.150
<v Speaker 3>I like psychosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Amazon prime videos they're putting</v>

1039
00:54:54.151 --> 00:54:55.830
<v Speaker 3>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting out some really great shows.</v>

1040
00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:58.400
<v Speaker 3>They're putting out a lot of standup</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy now as well.</v>

1041
00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:01.230
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which they're trying to somewhat compete</v>

1042
00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:03.750
<v Speaker 3>with Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you have a fair,</v>

1043
00:55:03.751 --> 00:55:08.650
<v Speaker 3>it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of those heavy,</v>

1044
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:11.250
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1045
00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:12.990
<v Speaker 3>That's the money shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:15.080
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's critical for landing</v>

1047
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:16.800
<v Speaker 3>simultaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable.</v>

1048
00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:20.430
<v Speaker 3>So the goal here is up until now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>NASA,</v>

1049
00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:23.850
<v Speaker 3>which has been dumbed down so much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous by Congress in the</v>

1050
00:55:23.851 --> 00:55:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Senate because Congress in the Senate or</v>
<v Speaker 3>insist on designing their own rockets</v>

1051
00:55:27.391 --> 00:55:31.590
<v Speaker 3>and ordered reus jobs programs not to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get us to space.</v>

1052
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:33.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what the problem is?</v>

1053
00:55:33.921 --> 00:55:35.430
<v Speaker 3>It's is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a funding issue too,</v>

1054
00:55:35.431 --> 00:55:37.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have to have immediate</v>

1055
00:55:37.411 --> 00:55:40.380
<v Speaker 3>results for the amount of money that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>put the worse than that.</v>

1056
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.060
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a little thing called the</v>

1057
00:55:42.061 --> 00:55:44.690
<v Speaker 3>Alabama Mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunch of senators and congress</v>

1058
00:55:44.691 --> 00:55:46.910
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Texas and Colorado and Ms</v>

1059
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi and all of the states that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have rocket jobs and they have designed</v>

1060
00:55:51.211 --> 00:55:55.560
<v Speaker 3>a rocket called the space launch system</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to cost $30 billion to</v>

1061
00:55:55.561 --> 00:55:57.870
<v Speaker 3>design it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a throwaway rocket.</v>

1062
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.990
<v Speaker 3>So it's going to cost one to $2 billion</v>
<v Speaker 3>for each flight.</v>

1063
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:03.310
<v Speaker 3>You think this is intentional?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1064
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:04.920
<v Speaker 3>it's intentionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1065
00:56:04.921 --> 00:56:06.750
<v Speaker 3>It's intentionally stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks that,</v>

1066
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:09.990
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's designed for jobs and the</v>

1067
00:56:09.991 --> 00:56:13.860
<v Speaker 3>result is we Americans haven't had</v>
<v Speaker 3>access to space on American made</v>

1068
00:56:13.861 --> 00:56:17.040
<v Speaker 3>vehicles since 2011 that's a long time</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1069
00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we do get access to me and space is</v>

1070
00:56:20.971 --> 00:56:23.530
<v Speaker 3>going to come from Ilan mosque,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to come from any of the</v>

1071
00:56:23.531 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 3>major space</v>

1072
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.440
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And $3 billion a year is sunk into the</v>

1073
00:56:27.441 --> 00:56:30.730
<v Speaker 1>space launch system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This Turkey and another Turkey called</v>

1074
00:56:30.731 --> 00:56:33.220
<v Speaker 1>the Orion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's money that needs,</v>

1075
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:38.250
<v Speaker 1>we need that money to actually designed</v>
<v Speaker 1>the habitats on the moon design mining</v>

1076
00:56:38.951 --> 00:56:43.450
<v Speaker 1>equipment to mine the ice on the moon</v>
<v Speaker 1>and turn it into a rocket fuel and</v>

1077
00:56:43.451 --> 00:56:48.451
<v Speaker 1>breathable oxygen and drinkable water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are tons of things we need,</v>

1078
00:56:48.551 --> 00:56:52.000
<v Speaker 1>but NASA is not producing them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to compete with Elon and</v>

1079
00:56:52.001 --> 00:56:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ilan and Jeff.</v>

1080
00:56:53.351 --> 00:56:54.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he secret.</v>

1081
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.320
<v Speaker 1>If I volunteered to fly you to New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>City,</v>

1082
00:56:57.010 --> 00:56:59.200
<v Speaker 1>and I told you I'm going to do this for</v>
<v Speaker 1>free,</v>

1083
00:56:59.201 --> 00:57:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to charge you a penny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to pay or the expenses.</v>

1084
00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:07.320
<v Speaker 1>And then I bought you a Boeing seven 37</v>
<v Speaker 1>for $325,000 and allowed you and one</v>

1085
00:57:10.211 --> 00:57:14.050
<v Speaker 1>friend to get into this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I flew you to New York and then</v>

1086
00:57:14.051 --> 00:57:19.051
<v Speaker 1>I flew the plane out into the Atlantic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the Atlantic and plowed it into the</v>

1087
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:20.433
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic Ocean and discarded it.</v>

1088
00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Now when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm doing this all without charging</v>

1089
00:57:23.801 --> 00:57:28.300
<v Speaker 1>you anything you realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you want to fly back from New</v>

1090
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:31.480
<v Speaker 1>York to California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll buy you another seven 37 and other</v>

1091
00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:35.620
<v Speaker 1>$325,000 um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fly you back.</v>

1092
00:57:35.621 --> 00:57:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll fly the seven 37 out over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific and I,</v>

1093
00:57:39.101 --> 00:57:42.250
<v Speaker 1>we'll ditch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the way we do space it NASA</v>

1094
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:45.340
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much would it cost you per ticket</v>

1095
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:49.720
<v Speaker 1>for you and a friend to go from La to</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York and back again?</v>

1096
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Approximately $325,000 per ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often would you fly from New York</v>

1097
00:57:56.861 --> 00:57:58.330
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from La to New York?</v>

1098
00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Not very often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if ever.</v>

1099
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:05.230
<v Speaker 1>So that's what NASA is doing with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>space launch system.</v>

1100
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:08.470
<v Speaker 1>And it's gobbling up so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no funding left for the stuff we</v>

1101
00:58:08.471 --> 00:58:10.570
<v Speaker 1>really need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it would be better if they</v>

1102
00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:12.850
<v Speaker 1>just privatized the entire venture?</v>

1103
00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:16.870
<v Speaker 1>It would be better if they offered word</v>
<v Speaker 1>called cots programs where you ask</v>

1104
00:58:16.871 --> 00:58:21.871
<v Speaker 1>companies to bid on getting a rocket</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever you want it to go and doing</v>

1105
00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:24.100
<v Speaker 1>with that rock up whatever you want it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1106
00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And then let Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos</v>
<v Speaker 1>and united launch alliance,</v>

1107
00:58:30.131 --> 00:58:32.380
<v Speaker 1>which is a big company underwritten by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>

1108
00:58:32.381 --> 00:58:35.380
<v Speaker 1>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can never remember the names of the</v>

1109
00:58:35.381 --> 00:58:37.360
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's Boeing and Lockheed Martin</v>

1110
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:41.680
<v Speaker 1>combined and allow them all to bid on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1111
00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Ilan is going to bring it in for</v>

1112
00:58:44.261 --> 00:58:48.040
<v Speaker 1>a 10th the cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elon has developed the falcon heavy for</v>

1113
00:58:48.041 --> 00:58:52.180
<v Speaker 1>approximately $2 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's developed all of his rockets for</v>

1114
00:58:52.181 --> 00:58:54.220
<v Speaker 1>approximately $2 billion for all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1115
00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:58.680
<v Speaker 1>It's costing NASA $30 billion to develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Turkey now.</v>

1116
00:58:58.681 --> 00:58:59.514
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they,</v>

1117
00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:05.020
<v Speaker 1>how do they keep doing that in the face</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these guys like Elon Musk and Jeff</v>

1118
00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Bezos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congressmen and senators don't care.</v>

1119
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:10.360
<v Speaker 1>They simply want to maintain the jobs in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their districts.</v>

1120
00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they feed the Smick,</v>

1121
00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:17.080
<v Speaker 1>the space military industrial complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the space military industrial complex</v>

1122
00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:21.040
<v Speaker 1>will kickback contributions to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign funds.</v>

1123
00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

1124
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:24.290
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a,</v>

1125
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:27.500
<v Speaker 1>an evil spiral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm buzz Aldrin calls these,</v>

1126
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:31.590
<v Speaker 1>the darth vader's of space for Lockheed</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martins and Northrop Grumman,</v>

1127
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:35.000
<v Speaker 1>the big aerospace swoop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional aerospace contractors.</v>

1128
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:36.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1129
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:41.450
<v Speaker 1>it congressmen set a certain number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cabal of senators and Congressmen</v>

1130
00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:44.270
<v Speaker 1>who are screwing us up because a</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

1131
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:48.500
<v Speaker 1>a country that dreams big gets big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A country that looks up,</v>

1132
00:59:48.501 --> 00:59:50.110
<v Speaker 1>goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a country that looks down,</v>

1133
00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:51.350
<v Speaker 1>goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've covered,</v>

1134
00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:56.380
<v Speaker 1>we become accustomed to looking down</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't have that glorious</v>

1135
00:59:56.691 --> 00:59:58.880
<v Speaker 1>option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moon is way behind us.</v>

1136
00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baas and,</v>

1137
01:00:00.621 --> 01:00:04.400
<v Speaker 1>and Neil Armstrong walking on the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a long time ago.</v>

1138
01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:07.760
<v Speaker 1>That's two generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two and a half generations ago.</v>

1139
01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:13.240
<v Speaker 1>And kids in America have lost that dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>of creating a paradise above the sky</v>

1140
01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>because NASA is a mandan them and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass has been forced to abandon them by</v>

1141
01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>these congressmen and senators who steal</v>
<v Speaker 1>this money from the NASA budget.</v>

1142
01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>But if that money were used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1143
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>that $3 billion a year would mean that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could develop an entire Elon musk</v>

1144
01:00:29.281 --> 01:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>pace club program and launch roughly 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>rocket.</v>

1145
01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.240
<v Speaker 2>That is the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1146
01:00:34.241 --> 01:00:36.370
<v Speaker 2>the actual engineers and the scientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

1147
01:00:36.371 --> 01:00:38.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean they must know it's politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1148
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:41.920
<v Speaker 2>But the politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they able to dictate what the actual</v>

1149
01:00:41.921 --> 01:00:43.930
<v Speaker 2>scientists and engineers create job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

1150
01:00:43.931 --> 01:00:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must create something that is</v>

1151
01:00:46.751 --> 01:00:48.600
<v Speaker 2>disposable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1152
01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Did they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that really a conversation that's</v>

1153
01:00:51.161 --> 01:00:52.810
<v Speaker 2>taken place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He asked me,</v>

1154
01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>guys have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1155
01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>we want to use um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a space shuttle,</v>

1156
01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>leftover space shuttle technology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1157
01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've mapped out the specifications of</v>

1158
01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:06.590
<v Speaker 1>the rocket that they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are doing.</v>

1159
01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1160
01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>How's that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1161
01:01:09.301 --> 01:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems disgusting.</v>

1162
01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>They control the budget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the treks that the Smith,</v>

1163
01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>the space military industrial complex is</v>
<v Speaker 1>known for a long time is you try to</v>

1164
01:01:19.351 --> 01:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>parcel our jobs to as many states as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1165
01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>So major programs like the latest a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>

1166
01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the air force,</v>

1167
01:01:29.491 --> 01:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>the navy are being told to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1168
01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>those represent jobs and roughly 45</v>
<v Speaker 1>states each.</v>

1169
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>That means that if your Lockheed Martin</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to keep your contract for a</v>

1170
01:01:43.471 --> 01:01:48.471
<v Speaker 1>plane that people are claiming can lose</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a 1951 era mig,</v>

1171
01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is hit the</v>

1172
01:01:52.021 --> 01:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>congressmen and senators from those 47</v>
<v Speaker 1>states and they'll all back you.</v>

1173
01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're counting on your</v>

1174
01:01:57.751 --> 01:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>campaign contributions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you going to get the money to</v>

1175
01:02:00.331 --> 01:02:05.331
<v Speaker 1>give them a campaign contributions from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that billion to $3 billion nipple per</v>

1176
01:02:05.491 --> 01:02:08.780
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that NASA has been forced to extend to</v>

1177
01:02:08.781 --> 01:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>you or that the air force has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced to extend to you?</v>

1178
01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a very corrupt system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a dirty system and it means that</v>

1179
01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:20.331
<v Speaker 1>the Russians and the Chinese can develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent aircraft for for one 10th the</v>

1180
01:02:21.211 --> 01:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>price and deliver them for one 10th the</v>
<v Speaker 1>price would be mean.</v>

1181
01:02:25.081 --> 01:02:27.360
<v Speaker 1>You're totally talking about two super</v>
<v Speaker 1>geniuses,</v>

1182
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine where it would be if they didn't</v>

1183
01:02:30.781 --> 01:02:33.150
<v Speaker 1>exist and exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The odds are very high that they</v>

1184
01:02:33.151 --> 01:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1185
01:02:34.231 --> 01:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>the odds are very high that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>could do away with them.</v>

1186
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>It would be fairly easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1187
01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:40.250
<v Speaker 1>don't even put that out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1188
01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Well the man on Friday or Sunday at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>National Space Society's annual event,</v>

1189
01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about China's new Silk Road</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus America's highway in the sky.</v>

1190
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>The new Silk Road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese government's going to put in</v>

1191
01:02:53.881 --> 01:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>$1 trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's total of a $20 trillion project.</v>

1192
01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:01.770
<v Speaker 1>It pulls together something like 66</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries and 3.3 billion people.</v>

1193
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:06.660
<v Speaker 1>And I co founded and chaired something</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Asian Space Technology Summit</v>

1194
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:11.460
<v Speaker 1>in Kuala Lumpur last May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just about exactly a year ago.</v>

1195
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:16.910
<v Speaker 1>And it was obvious being in Malaysia</v>
<v Speaker 1>that China has bought Malaysia's heart</v>

1196
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:23.550
<v Speaker 1>that Americans don't count for much</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore because the Chinese are already</v>

1197
01:03:23.551 --> 01:03:26.130
<v Speaker 1>spending money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They already own 15 to 20 ports.</v>

1198
01:03:26.131 --> 01:03:30.660
<v Speaker 1>They own 15 to 20 ports puramus which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the port of Athens,</v>

1199
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.050
<v Speaker 1>the city that was the cradle of western</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

1200
01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Guess who owns it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese and they are upgrading these</v>

1201
01:03:37.801 --> 01:03:42.420
<v Speaker 1>ports to do things that no port we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen before has been able to do so</v>

1202
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:46.080
<v Speaker 1>because they have a big vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really big vision.</v>

1203
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.300
<v Speaker 1>They're going to dominate the 21st</v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

1204
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:51.660
<v Speaker 1>The 20th was the American Century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be the Chinese century</v>

1205
01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:55.950
<v Speaker 1>unless we counter with an equally big</v>
<v Speaker 1>vision and the big visions are not</v>

1206
01:03:55.951 --> 01:04:00.390
<v Speaker 1>coming from Donald Trump in Washington</v>
<v Speaker 1>dc or from senators and congressmen.</v>

1207
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:03.330
<v Speaker 1>They are coming from precisely the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people you fingered.</v>

1208
01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:07.050
<v Speaker 1>They're coming from Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're coming from California.</v>

1209
01:04:07.051 --> 01:04:09.390
<v Speaker 1>They're coming from Elon Musk and Jeff</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bezos,</v>

1210
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:14.280
<v Speaker 1>the two guys who can save us by opening</v>
<v Speaker 1>a platinum highway in the sky.</v>

1211
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:16.950
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A platinum highway in the sky means the</v>

1212
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.720
<v Speaker 1>space economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One meteor called something like a amen.</v>

1213
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Three 35 has more resources than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gross domestic product of England,</v>

1214
01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:34.610
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italy and South Korea combined in one</v>

1215
01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.810
<v Speaker 1>meteor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meteor I want,</v>

1216
01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:40.500
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to throw in India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>India is in that list too combined.</v>

1217
01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:43.050
<v Speaker 1>So it was the idea to minus mean you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last on it.</v>

1218
01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1219
01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Another extract resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1220
01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:49.080
<v Speaker 1>bring them back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if NASA seriously wants us to</v>

1221
01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:51.780
<v Speaker 1>develop that space economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to do their part.</v>

1222
01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:56.160
<v Speaker 1>They have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elan and jeff are bringing the rockets</v>

1223
01:04:56.161 --> 01:05:01.050
<v Speaker 1>to the table right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reusable rockets like the seven 37 is</v>

1224
01:05:01.051 --> 01:05:04.980
<v Speaker 1>that we have now that we turn around in</v>
<v Speaker 1>La and send back to New York and then</v>

1225
01:05:04.981 --> 01:05:09.981
<v Speaker 1>turn around in New York and send back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>La for 35 to 40 years each.</v>

1226
01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.470
<v Speaker 1>They amortize their costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They allow you to get a round trip</v>

1227
01:05:13.471 --> 01:05:16.500
<v Speaker 1>ticket for as low as $220 on a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>good day.</v>

1228
01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1229
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:21.240
<v Speaker 1>that's what's happening with space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But where's the mining equipment going</v>

1230
01:05:21.241 --> 01:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>to come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something NASA needs to be</v>

1231
01:05:23.951 --> 01:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>working on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus the mining equipment for the moon</v>

1232
01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>to turn the moon basically into a fuel</v>
<v Speaker 1>station,</v>

1233
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking about this while also</v>

1234
01:05:31.571 --> 01:05:32.860
<v Speaker 1>thinking about all the other things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think are,</v>

1235
01:05:32.861 --> 01:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>because I do my best thinking when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about 15 things at once and</v>

1236
01:05:37.031 --> 01:05:40.450
<v Speaker 1>that's why the music is there because my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind is empty if I don't have,</v>

1237
01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.940
<v Speaker 1>cause that's another threat going on at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

1238
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I want to bring you back to something</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said earlier that you sort of</v>

1239
01:05:45.491 --> 01:05:47.770
<v Speaker 1>glossed over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you were talking about quantum</v>

1240
01:05:47.771 --> 01:05:49.050
<v Speaker 1>physicists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1241
01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Getting everything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I told him so I flew to Moscow.</v>

1242
01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've debunked that and a book called</v>

1243
01:05:56.441 --> 01:05:59.140
<v Speaker 1>the God problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How I godless cosmos creates that has</v>

1244
01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:02.980
<v Speaker 1>five heresies and Harrison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one is that one,</v>

1245
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:07.660
<v Speaker 1>is that a a does not equal a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's aristotle's primary law of</v>

1246
01:06:07.661 --> 01:06:08.530
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1247
01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:10.870
<v Speaker 1>it's not always true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1248
01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:15.560
<v Speaker 1>one of the laws is the theory of entropy</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so fucking wrong that it justifies</v>

1249
01:06:15.561 --> 01:06:19.090
<v Speaker 1>the entering means that all everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>is falling apart constantly.</v>

1250
01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:21.580
<v Speaker 1>And that in order to make something</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive happen,</v>

1251
01:06:21.581 --> 01:06:25.210
<v Speaker 1>you have to shed more negative energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really negative energy,</v>

1252
01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.580
<v Speaker 1>more dispersed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waste energy.</v>

1253
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.340
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe doesn't look work like</v>

1254
01:06:30.341 --> 01:06:33.220
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The universe in the very beginning at</v>

1255
01:06:33.221 --> 01:06:34.420
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarks from,</v>

1256
01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:38.670
<v Speaker 1>from nothing but motion quarks for</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

1257
01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1258
01:06:39.851 --> 01:06:43.660
<v Speaker 1>The first things from movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you joshing?</v>

1259
01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.150
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the quarks had to get together</v>

1260
01:06:46.151 --> 01:06:49.030
<v Speaker 1>in groups of three because this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>profoundly social universal,</v>

1261
01:06:49.031 --> 01:06:49.960
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't survive.</v>

1262
01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:54.910
<v Speaker 1>And one form of Cork like this with one</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and two down or something like that</v>

1263
01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:57.940
<v Speaker 1>is a neutron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other direction,</v>

1264
01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:03.210
<v Speaker 1>three quarks is a proton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of this is anti entropic.</v>

1265
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.300
<v Speaker 1>And then what do all of these billiard</v>
<v Speaker 1>balls do?</v>

1266
01:07:07.301 --> 01:07:10.960
<v Speaker 1>What are all these particles do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] hundred 80,000 years later,</v>

1267
01:07:10.961 --> 01:07:15.610
<v Speaker 1>they begin sweet themselves together in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these massive social agglomerations that</v>

1268
01:07:15.611 --> 01:07:19.180
<v Speaker 1>look like big potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are the beginnings of galaxies</v>

1269
01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.360
<v Speaker 1>before they form their spiral arms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

1270
01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then within the,</v>

1271
01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:30.210
<v Speaker 1>the spiral arms of these galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gravity balls are competing with each</v>

1272
01:07:30.431 --> 01:07:33.850
<v Speaker 1>other to see who's the biggest gravity</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball and the biggest wins and what does</v>

1273
01:07:33.851 --> 01:07:36.940
<v Speaker 1>he do to the losers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He swallows them and gets even bigger,</v>

1274
01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.600
<v Speaker 1>which makes it possible for that gravity</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball to confront another bunch of</v>

1275
01:07:40.601 --> 01:07:43.510
<v Speaker 1>gravity balls and beat them out for size</v>
<v Speaker 1>and swallow them.</v>

1276
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is you get so much gravity</v>

1277
01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:51.550
<v Speaker 1>and so much matter in this gravity ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the gravity ball explodes.</v>

1278
01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:56.790
<v Speaker 1>That's called a son a star and around it</v>
<v Speaker 1>are smaller gravity balls that managed</v>

1279
01:07:57.581 --> 01:08:01.570
<v Speaker 1>to hold their own in competitions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their planets and moons.</v>

1280
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.980
<v Speaker 1>How the hell do you go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even this short distance into the life</v>

1281
01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:10.240
<v Speaker 1>of galaxy that's been around for 13.7</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion years with precisely the</v>

1282
01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:13.330
<v Speaker 1>opposite of entropy happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the official definition of</v>

1283
01:08:13.331 --> 01:08:15.350
<v Speaker 1>venture be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's it defined by Webster's</v>

1284
01:08:15.351 --> 01:08:16.184
<v Speaker 1>dictionary?</v>

1285
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>

1286
01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:20.510
<v Speaker 1>It's usually a weasel definition weasel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1287
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:22.930
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's deliberately obscure.</v>

1288
01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's such a weird subject.</v>

1289
01:08:26.290 --> 01:08:30.280
<v Speaker 1>That's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every priesthood has a shibboleth.</v>

1290
01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.980
<v Speaker 1>A shibboleth is a magic word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't pronounce it,</v>

1291
01:08:32.981 --> 01:08:34.240
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1292
01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:39.330
<v Speaker 1>and so every tribe wants you to believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>in something that's impossible.</v>

1293
01:08:40.031 --> 01:08:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Remember the Red Queen or the White</v>
<v Speaker 1>Queen in Alice in Wonderland said,</v>

1294
01:08:42.941 --> 01:08:46.150
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I dream up six impossible</v>
<v Speaker 1>things before breakfast.</v>

1295
01:08:46.151 --> 01:08:46.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1296
01:08:46.781 --> 01:08:49.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to pass the test by showing</v>

1297
01:08:49.361 --> 01:08:52.810
<v Speaker 1>that you believe in something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously fatuously wrong.</v>

1298
01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:57.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's the the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Shibboleth for being considered</v>

1299
01:08:57.071 --> 01:09:02.071
<v Speaker 1>a legitimate scientist is preaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegiance to pledging allegiance and</v>

1300
01:09:03.011 --> 01:09:04.090
<v Speaker 1>terpene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull it up.</v>

1301
01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Let me see what it says here.</v>

1302
01:09:05.710 --> 01:09:10.710
<v Speaker 2>It says a measure of the unavailable</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy and a closed thermodynamic system</v>

1303
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:16.630
<v Speaker 2>that is also usually considered to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>measure of the systems disorder.</v>

1304
01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:22.230
<v Speaker 2>That is a property of the system state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that varies directly with any</v>

1305
01:09:24.311 --> 01:09:29.311
<v Speaker 2>reversible change in heat in the system</v>
<v Speaker 2>and inversely with the temperature of</v>

1306
01:09:29.831 --> 01:09:34.831
<v Speaker 2>the system broadly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the degree of disorder or uncertainty in</v>

1307
01:09:35.411 --> 01:09:37.090
<v Speaker 2>the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what they're saying is the</v>

1308
01:09:37.091 --> 01:09:39.730
<v Speaker 2>degree of disorder or uncertainty in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1309
01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's a very lucid</v>

1310
01:09:43.081 --> 01:09:46.560
<v Speaker 1>explanation and you could recite it to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>five year old and need to understand</v>

1311
01:09:46.561 --> 01:09:49.650
<v Speaker 1>exactly what you were saying or to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother easily.</v>

1312
01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:53.070
<v Speaker 1>It is a little reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very weasley.</v>

1313
01:09:53.071 --> 01:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>It has lots of outs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my book,</v>

1314
01:09:56.491 --> 01:09:59.250
<v Speaker 1>the God problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how a godless cosmos creates debunks</v>

1315
01:09:59.251 --> 01:10:04.140
<v Speaker 1>that along with a bunch of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions and current side is that</v>

1316
01:10:04.141 --> 01:10:08.400
<v Speaker 1>assumption exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believes because in the 19th century</v>

1317
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:13.550
<v Speaker 1>when this was formulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the metaphor of the day was the steam</v>

1318
01:10:13.831 --> 01:10:16.080
<v Speaker 1>engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the hot new technology.</v>

1319
01:10:16.081 --> 01:10:20.070
<v Speaker 1>It was to the the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what computers are due the 22nd century</v>

1320
01:10:20.071 --> 01:10:23.100
<v Speaker 1>or whatever we're living in now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 21st century.</v>

1321
01:10:23.101 --> 01:10:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1322
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:30.590
<v Speaker 1>so what they realized was you take this</v>
<v Speaker 1>steam and you push it into a piston and</v>

1323
01:10:32.911 --> 01:10:37.380
<v Speaker 1>it throws that piston up into the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the piston comes back down</v>

1324
01:10:37.381 --> 01:10:39.600
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's waste.</v>

1325
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:45.110
<v Speaker 1>The steam then has lost its energy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes out of an exhaust valve and you</v>

1326
01:10:45.391 --> 01:10:47.220
<v Speaker 1>put in more hot steam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1327
01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this was a theory about the waste</v>

1328
01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.840
<v Speaker 1>that comes out of the steam engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now that we don't have,</v>

1329
01:10:57.841 --> 01:10:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes they produce exhaust.</v>

1330
01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Now would you say that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solar power and solar power does not</v>

1331
01:11:04.981 --> 01:11:07.620
<v Speaker 1>produce exhaust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where's the entropy?</v>

1332
01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:10.060
<v Speaker 1>But where's the entropy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's story of the universe.</v>

1333
01:11:10.061 --> 01:11:11.890
<v Speaker 1>I was telling you aggregation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries</v>

1334
01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:13.800
<v Speaker 2>cause I mean they are all</v>

1335
01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:17.160
<v Speaker 1>listening by on whatever that could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

1336
01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:20.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a square edge compared to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction of a sun.</v>

1337
01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a squid compared to the</v>

1338
01:11:22.861 --> 01:11:27.540
<v Speaker 1>construction of a galaxy and all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>random stuff in the universe.</v>

1339
01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:29.910
<v Speaker 1>All those random particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1340
01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:32.880
<v Speaker 1>they're not random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all participate in something.</v>

1341
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:35.640
<v Speaker 1>The universe rings like a Gong and its</v>
<v Speaker 1>early days.</v>

1342
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.030
<v Speaker 1>It has pressure waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that these elementary</v>

1343
01:11:39.031 --> 01:11:42.930
<v Speaker 1>particles are sketching together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forming a wave.</v>

1344
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Is that a technical term?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1345
01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:47.820
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're squinching apart and</v>

1346
01:11:47.821 --> 01:11:51.330
<v Speaker 1>they're forming a trough and then there</v>
<v Speaker 1>scorching together again and that wave</v>

1347
01:11:51.331 --> 01:11:54.810
<v Speaker 1>ripples across the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that you see waves rippling</v>

1348
01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.790
<v Speaker 1>across the Pacific when you're flying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii.</v>

1349
01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that entropic,</v>

1350
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:05.670
<v Speaker 1>is that disorder constantly increasing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's the very opposite.</v>

1351
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:09.660
<v Speaker 1>What the universe does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes every form of waste and turns</v>

1352
01:12:09.661 --> 01:12:10.770
<v Speaker 1>it into an opportunity.</v>

1353
01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.060
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1354
01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:15.540
<v Speaker 1>what we call this place earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we naming it for?</v>

1355
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:21.080
<v Speaker 1>The Excreta of warms the shit of worms</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they produced what we call soil.</v>

1356
01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of the meaning of that word.</v>

1357
01:12:25.261 --> 01:12:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When something is soiled,</v>

1358
01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:32.010
<v Speaker 1>what does it like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not covered with earthy loam.</v>

1359
01:12:32.670 --> 01:12:35.430
<v Speaker 1>It's dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1360
01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:38.520
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we call it dirt when it's in the</v>

1361
01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:42.660
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we are taking this and tropic stuff,</v>

1362
01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:47.220
<v Speaker 1>the shit that came out of worms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're farming in it and plants are</v>

1363
01:12:47.221 --> 01:12:48.960
<v Speaker 1>growing in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trees are growing in it.</v>

1364
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Flowers are growing in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that entropy,</v>

1365
01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:54.660
<v Speaker 1>is that a continual slide toward</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder?</v>

1366
01:12:54.661 --> 01:12:58.860
<v Speaker 1>It's the very opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a continual slide toward order and</v>

1367
01:12:58.861 --> 01:13:03.390
<v Speaker 1>higher degrees of form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is this theory been received?</v>

1368
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1369
01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:07.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or your interpretation of it?</v>

1370
01:13:07.321 --> 01:13:09.930
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1371
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I really have no answer.</v>

1372
01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who I sent the book to in the</v>

1373
01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:18.540
<v Speaker 1>early days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them except w well including a</v>

1374
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Nobel prize winner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think three macarthur genius award</v>

1375
01:13:22.081 --> 01:13:27.081
<v Speaker 1>winners all said this is a great book</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one compared it to Charles lyles</v>

1376
01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:33.410
<v Speaker 1>history of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gave Darwin a lot of ideas and to</v>

1377
01:13:33.511 --> 01:13:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Darwin's origin of the species and</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked,</v>

1378
01:13:36.481 --> 01:13:38.820
<v Speaker 1>is this really a great book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those two books?</v>

1379
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.420
<v Speaker 1>And the answer has been yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the Lucifer principle.</v>

1380
01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the God problem.</v>

1381
01:13:43.801 --> 01:13:46.100
<v Speaker 1>How He godless cosmos creates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1382
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:48.390
<v Speaker 1>and let's not forget for the sake of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>

1383
01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:51.300
<v Speaker 1>we're actually here to promote how I</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally started the 60s.</v>

1384
01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.850
<v Speaker 1>The news is my newest book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1385
01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.700
<v Speaker 1>It's my sixth book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>

1386
01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.210
<v Speaker 1>But it was actually written during those</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years when I couldn't talk.</v>

1387
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:01.243
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1388
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:03.660
<v Speaker 1>the first draft was written during those</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years.</v>

1389
01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.030
<v Speaker 1>So there I was laying in bed not able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>

1390
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.710
<v Speaker 1>And I know from all of my research that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you are a human who feels of no</v>

1391
01:14:10.711 --> 01:14:13.150
<v Speaker 1>value to your fellow human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you begin to die.</v>

1392
01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Your immune system goes into under</v>
<v Speaker 1>underperformance and stops protecting</v>

1393
01:14:17.981 --> 01:14:22.120
<v Speaker 1>you from diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I needed to somehow maintain a social</v>

1394
01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:25.780
<v Speaker 1>set of connections despite the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't talk in my own wife,</v>

1395
01:14:25.781 --> 01:14:28.690
<v Speaker 1>couldn't walk into the room and read a</v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper with me.</v>

1396
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:31.600
<v Speaker 1>So what did I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured,</v>

1397
01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:34.220
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm most sick people churn,</v>

1398
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.730
<v Speaker 1>churn out what are called repulsion</v>
<v Speaker 1>cues.</v>

1399
01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Cues that drive other people away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be near you when</v>

1400
01:14:39.731 --> 01:14:42.760
<v Speaker 1>you're sick and suffering and we really</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't kind as they may be.</v>

1401
01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to put out attraction cues,</v>

1402
01:14:45.911 --> 01:14:50.911
<v Speaker 1>the opposite of repulsion cues and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's an a number one attraction queue.</v>

1403
01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:54.910
<v Speaker 1>It's humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there I was reading Dave Berry and</v>

1404
01:14:54.911 --> 01:14:59.530
<v Speaker 1>reading PG woodhouse and these guys were</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting me for an hour or two above my</v>

1405
01:14:59.531 --> 01:15:01.930
<v Speaker 1>misery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving me this transcendent humor that</v>

1406
01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:04.630
<v Speaker 1>just took me out of my state at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

1407
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:09.810
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to write transcendent humor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wrote this story of how I</v>

1408
01:15:09.911 --> 01:15:13.570
<v Speaker 1>accidentally help form a movement on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>west coast that had no name.</v>

1409
01:15:13.571 --> 01:15:17.230
<v Speaker 1>And then I left the country and when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got back the loose empire,</v>

1410
01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.230
<v Speaker 1>the time life empire had given her the</v>
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

1411
01:15:20.231 --> 01:15:23.550
<v Speaker 1>they called it the hippie movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I tried to write her does.</v>

1412
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny,</v>

1413
01:15:24.851 --> 01:15:28.180
<v Speaker 1>a manner as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I was finished writing it,</v>

1414
01:15:28.181 --> 01:15:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I wrote because I couldn't talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a letter in those days they had</v>

1415
01:15:32.801 --> 01:15:35.890
<v Speaker 1>to be snail mailed because most people</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have email back then.</v>

1416
01:15:35.891 --> 01:15:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people didn't.</v>

1417
01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:42.670
<v Speaker 1>And I snail mailed my friend Eric</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gardner because Eric Gardner had started</v>

1418
01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:47.380
<v Speaker 1>out in the music business as a Roadie</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Jefferson airplane.</v>

1419
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:50.470
<v Speaker 1>And I wrote Eric and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric,</v>

1420
01:15:50.471 --> 01:15:52.810
<v Speaker 1>I just written this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you get it to the Jefferson</v>

1421
01:15:52.811 --> 01:15:55.510
<v Speaker 1>airplane?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if I could get them to say</v>

1422
01:15:55.511 --> 01:15:57.310
<v Speaker 1>something positive about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

1423
01:15:57.311 --> 01:16:02.080
<v Speaker 1>that validated it cause they were a key</v>
<v Speaker 1>act in the 1960s and Eric said,</v>

1424
01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:02.621
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1425
01:16:02.621 --> 01:16:05.500
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have somebody better send me the</v>

1426
01:16:05.501 --> 01:16:07.720
<v Speaker 1>manuscript.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sent him the manuscript and he got</v>

1427
01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:10.960
<v Speaker 1>the manuscript to this other client of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his and the other client came back with</v>

1428
01:16:10.961 --> 01:16:12.910
<v Speaker 1>a quote that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a monumental masterpiece of</v>

1429
01:16:12.911 --> 01:16:16.570
<v Speaker 1>American literature and filled with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we want to have experiences and</v>

1430
01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:21.070
<v Speaker 1>nonstop waves of scientific comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>routines and nonstop waves of hilarity</v>

1431
01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.440
<v Speaker 1>and compared to does James Joyce and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1432
01:16:23.441 --> 01:16:26.560
<v Speaker 1>wow woo and it and signed it.</v>

1433
01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Timothy leary and I thought this can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be for real.</v>

1434
01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:34.360
<v Speaker 1>This just can't be for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was 1995 and what I didn't know,</v>

1435
01:16:34.361 --> 01:16:39.361
<v Speaker 1>it took me 15 years to find out is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Timothy leary got this book when he was</v>

1436
01:16:40.331 --> 01:16:44.260
<v Speaker 1>sick in bed like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was dying of prostate cancer.</v>

1437
01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:49.920
<v Speaker 1>This book reached him six months before</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would die of prostate cancer and I</v>

1438
01:16:49.931 --> 01:16:53.200
<v Speaker 1>had written the book to be on a plane of</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor that would yank you out of your</v>

1439
01:16:53.201 --> 01:16:57.370
<v Speaker 1>body and Yank you up to an ethereal</v>
<v Speaker 1>plane of humor cause you were trying to</v>

1440
01:16:57.371 --> 01:16:58.840
<v Speaker 1>do that to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed to,</v>

1441
01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:02.260
<v Speaker 1>since these two guys had done it for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed to do my best to do it for</v>

1442
01:17:02.261 --> 01:17:05.050
<v Speaker 1>others and to attract people to stick</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

1443
01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Cause I sent these things out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his letters,</v>

1444
01:17:06.731 --> 01:17:08.920
<v Speaker 1>the chapters out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his letters to friends,</v>

1445
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:10.910
<v Speaker 1>hoping a few friends would still stick</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

1446
01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.880
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when leary read it,</v>

1447
01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:18.500
<v Speaker 1>apparently it did for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would house and Dave Barry had done</v>

1448
01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:22.940
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was stunned when I found that out.</v>

1449
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely stoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

1450
01:17:25.701 --> 01:17:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Virginia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be in the worst of all possible</v>

1451
01:17:27.681 --> 01:17:32.681
<v Speaker 1>circumstances and you can pull together</v>
<v Speaker 1>something from low circumstances as a</v>

1452
01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:34.040
<v Speaker 1>gift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fellow humans.</v>

1453
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:36.230
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will doubt that it will ever be a</v>

1454
01:17:36.231 --> 01:17:38.600
<v Speaker 1>value to any human on the planet because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

1455
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.900
<v Speaker 1>that's how us humans feel about most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our endeavors.</v>

1456
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bought some day.</v>

1457
01:17:44.571 --> 01:17:48.980
<v Speaker 1>It just may save somebody who's in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>position equivalent to yours.</v>

1458
01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.740
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is amazing.</v>

1459
01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:55.910
<v Speaker 1>What are the other things that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum physicists got?</v>

1460
01:17:55.911 --> 01:17:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Ra?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

1461
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>

1462
01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:00.920
<v Speaker 1>For four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a four day conference,</v>

1463
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:03.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a pouncing own of just outside</v>

1464
01:18:03.351 --> 01:18:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Moscow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 miles outside of Moscow.</v>

1465
01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:08.810
<v Speaker 1>It was a worker's paradise built in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>1960s.</v>

1466
01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.610
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1467
01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:13.940
<v Speaker 1>and all the people there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the physicists were going around</v>

1468
01:18:13.941 --> 01:18:17.260
<v Speaker 1>drawing the same diagram on Napkins to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain what they were talking about.</v>

1469
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:21.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's a diagram of how short matures</v>
<v Speaker 1>equation manifest itself in one single</v>

1470
01:18:21.441 --> 01:18:23.810
<v Speaker 1>isolated electron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1471
01:18:23.811 --> 01:18:24.644
<v Speaker 1>guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jo,</v>

1472
01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:28.820
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as an isolated</v>
<v Speaker 1>electron in this universe.</v>

1473
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:30.870
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1474
01:18:30.970 --> 01:18:35.970
<v Speaker 1>an isolated Quanta of light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's isolated photon of light.</v>

1475
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:38.570
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as an isolated</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1476
01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:40.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look up at the night sky,</v>

1477
01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:46.120
<v Speaker 1>what do you see stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those stars are 13 billion light</v>

1478
01:18:46.701 --> 01:18:50.030
<v Speaker 1>years away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's taken 13 billion years for that</v>

1479
01:18:50.031 --> 01:18:53.600
<v Speaker 1>light to get to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we can still see those lights with a</v>

1480
01:18:53.601 --> 01:18:58.601
<v Speaker 1>telescope is if there is light flooding</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire universe from low stars,</v>

1481
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:03.110
<v Speaker 1>how could this be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could there ever be a particle</v>

1482
01:19:03.111 --> 01:19:05.930
<v Speaker 1>living on its own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not awash in light,</v>

1483
01:19:05.931 --> 01:19:09.620
<v Speaker 1>gravitational effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic effects from all the</v>

1484
01:19:09.621 --> 01:19:13.200
<v Speaker 1>other things in the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least a good many of them.</v>

1485
01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.680
<v Speaker 1>So why is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was his misconception prevalent?</v>

1486
01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because the,</v>

1487
01:19:17.331 --> 01:19:20.240
<v Speaker 1>the equation fit certain very</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial,</v>

1488
01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:23.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments that were set up in the lab</v>

1489
01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:28.010
<v Speaker 1>and once an experiment has done and</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted than everybody who doesn't get</v>

1490
01:19:28.011 --> 01:19:30.830
<v Speaker 1>the same results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks he's doing it wrong and does it</v>

1491
01:19:30.831 --> 01:19:35.660
<v Speaker 1>over and over again till he gets the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same results and the explanation.</v>

1492
01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.410
<v Speaker 1>For some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people in this universe think</v>

1493
01:19:39.411 --> 01:19:40.550
<v Speaker 1>we're on our own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1494
01:19:40.551 --> 01:19:43.370
<v Speaker 1>we're never on our own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're always under the influence of</v>

1495
01:19:43.371 --> 01:19:45.890
<v Speaker 1>other human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look at the SARS.</v>

1496
01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Only the light is reaching us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not determining,</v>

1497
01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're rural friends going to</v>

1498
01:19:50.421 --> 01:19:52.550
<v Speaker 1>argue with you tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your horoscope says.</v>

1499
01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:55.520
<v Speaker 1>But there's that influence of merely</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to see them.</v>

1500
01:19:55.850 --> 01:20:00.110
<v Speaker 1>So I was basically lecturing these guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a social cosmos in which</v>

1501
01:20:00.111 --> 01:20:03.290
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>information exchange is constantly</v>

1502
01:20:03.291 --> 01:20:04.970
<v Speaker 1>taking place all over the place.</v>

1503
01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.560
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that troubleshoots shirts</v>

1504
01:20:07.561 --> 01:20:12.561
<v Speaker 1>equation assumes an isolated entity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no isolated entities,</v>

1505
01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:15.000
<v Speaker 1>these in this universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I was finished,</v>

1506
01:20:15.001 --> 01:20:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I expected them to throw me out of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference.</v>

1507
01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:24.140
<v Speaker 1>And instead they sat there as if this</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been my bar Mitzvah and I just done</v>

1508
01:20:24.151 --> 01:20:26.850
<v Speaker 1>a half tour or whatever it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do what a bar Mitzvah.</v>

1509
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.940
<v Speaker 1>And they were my uncles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all sitting back,</v>

1510
01:20:29.941 --> 01:20:32.400
<v Speaker 1>their faces were beaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were smiling,</v>

1511
01:20:32.401 --> 01:20:33.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that radiance,</v>

1512
01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:37.560
<v Speaker 1>that redness that infects a faceless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excited about something.</v>

1513
01:20:37.890 --> 01:20:40.950
<v Speaker 1>It was astonishing and I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand why.</v>

1514
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:44.640
<v Speaker 1>And then three years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a collaborator in theoretical</v>

1515
01:20:44.641 --> 01:20:46.630
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potlicker rock of the Kelly [inaudible]</v>

1516
01:20:46.631 --> 01:20:49.680
<v Speaker 1>suit of applied mathematics of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian Academy of Sciences.</v>

1517
01:20:49.681 --> 01:20:53.820
<v Speaker 1>And Pavel emailed me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor [inaudible] go off the man who</v>

1518
01:20:53.821 --> 01:20:56.640
<v Speaker 1>ran that conference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man who gave you such a hard time</v>

1519
01:20:56.641 --> 01:20:58.650
<v Speaker 1>about your credit card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1520
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:59.790
<v Speaker 1>he's just written a book.</v>

1521
01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:01.560
<v Speaker 1>You have to download it from arcserve</v>
<v Speaker 1>org,</v>

1522
01:21:01.561 --> 01:21:05.220
<v Speaker 1>which is the leading site for preprints</v>
<v Speaker 1>and advanced mathematics and advanced</v>

1523
01:21:05.221 --> 01:21:08.730
<v Speaker 1>theoretical physics in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I downloaded it,</v>

1524
01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:12.240
<v Speaker 1>put it on my kindle and listened to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first half while I was taking my</v>

1525
01:21:12.241 --> 01:21:15.480
<v Speaker 1>afternoon walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These long walks through the park can be</v>

1526
01:21:15.481 --> 01:21:18.780
<v Speaker 1>very helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I got to the cafe where I was</v>

1527
01:21:18.781 --> 01:21:21.780
<v Speaker 1>working in those days and got my laptop</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of me,</v>

1528
01:21:21.781 --> 01:21:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I wrote to doctor Rouger cough and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1529
01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:26.400
<v Speaker 1>doctor Chekhov,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember me,</v>

1530
01:21:26.401 --> 01:21:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not crazy American who spoke at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference,</v>

1531
01:21:28.770 --> 01:21:31.710
<v Speaker 1>but I've just read the first half of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your book and it's phenomenal.</v>

1532
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:35.460
<v Speaker 1>He used every concept that I had given</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my presentation,</v>

1533
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:38.820
<v Speaker 1>every concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got one of those almost instant</v>

1534
01:21:38.821 --> 01:21:42.750
<v Speaker 1>emails back and email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes within two or three hours and</v>

1535
01:21:42.751 --> 01:21:44.730
<v Speaker 1>who should go have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember you,</v>

1536
01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.820
<v Speaker 1>didn't you read the first half of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>book?</v>

1537
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:51.600
<v Speaker 1>And we are accredited in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My partner,</v>

1538
01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:53.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pavel and I,</v>

1539
01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:58.550
<v Speaker 1>so to at least a bunch of quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicists from 11 times zones gathering</v>

1540
01:21:59.041 --> 01:22:00.810
<v Speaker 1>in Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1541
01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:03.630
<v Speaker 1>what I was saying made sense quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>physics.</v>

1542
01:22:03.631 --> 01:22:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Does it make sense to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1543
01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I've tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1544
01:22:06.691 --> 01:22:08.900
<v Speaker 1>I tried really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes about the same senses.</v>

1545
01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:10.940
<v Speaker 1>That definition you were just reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>event trippy.</v>

1546
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go over it and over it again and</v>

1547
01:22:13.141 --> 01:22:18.141
<v Speaker 1>get little chunks of it and that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand like sections of sentences.</v>

1548
01:22:18.301 --> 01:22:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'd have to try to put them</v>

1549
01:22:19.891 --> 01:22:21.810
<v Speaker 1>together with the other sections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

1550
01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.930
<v Speaker 1>It's tough stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the most important things,</v>

1551
01:22:24.931 --> 01:22:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Neil's war who said this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not quite sure,</v>

1552
01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:32.370
<v Speaker 1>but one of the members of the Copenhagen</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of quantum physics said</v>

1553
01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:37.490
<v Speaker 1>that basically a particle exists in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>states simultaneously and it's not until</v>

1554
01:22:37.591 --> 01:22:39.840
<v Speaker 1>it's measured that a collapses into one</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

1555
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.970
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the basic principles of</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum physics.</v>

1556
01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what,</v>

1557
01:22:43.531 --> 01:22:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Niels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every particle is being measured in some</v>

1558
01:22:46.711 --> 01:22:51.120
<v Speaker 1>way all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of its life by other particles that</v>

1559
01:22:51.121 --> 01:22:53.610
<v Speaker 1>are basically taking its measure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then responding.</v>

1560
01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is isolated.</v>

1561
01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is isolated in this particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmos.</v>

1562
01:22:59.490 --> 01:23:01.920
<v Speaker 1>You were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched a video where you were talking</v>

1563
01:23:01.921 --> 01:23:05.280
<v Speaker 1>about that there is essentially a</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal brain.</v>

1564
01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1565
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:09.550
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you and I right now we're going</v>

1566
01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:13.420
<v Speaker 3>to be talking to possibly out of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>500 words,</v>

1567
01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:16.780
<v Speaker 3>it's more like 1 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1568
01:23:16.810 --> 01:23:19.960
<v Speaker 3>total viewers and listeners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more than that.</v>

1569
01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:22.180
<v Speaker 3>So it's probably closer to three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1570
01:23:22.181 --> 01:23:26.500
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to be talking to let's</v>
<v Speaker 3>say 100,000 of them or 200,000 of them.</v>

1571
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:29.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're processing what we are</v>

1572
01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:34.000
<v Speaker 3>saying right now there are bacteria and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your gut and mine who live in enormous</v>

1573
01:23:34.001 --> 01:23:36.100
<v Speaker 3>colonies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And An orb is bacterial colony.</v>

1574
01:23:36.101 --> 01:23:38.740
<v Speaker 3>If you had it on the palm of your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be the size of your hand,</v>

1575
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:41.560
<v Speaker 3>but you couldn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you thinking of this while you're</v>

1576
01:23:41.561 --> 01:23:43.690
<v Speaker 3>saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you thinking of that vast numbers of</v>

1577
01:23:43.691 --> 01:23:47.860
<v Speaker 3>people that are listening and watching</v>
<v Speaker 3>or are you just relaying the</v>

1578
01:23:47.861 --> 01:23:48.980
<v Speaker 3>information?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like are you</v>

1579
01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.980
<v Speaker 3>cognizant?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>

1580
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.080
<v Speaker 3>both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both.</v>

1581
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:55.930
<v Speaker 3>Because I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember Einstein gave me my marching</v>

1582
01:23:55.931 --> 01:23:56.440
<v Speaker 3>orders.</v>

1583
01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:01.060
<v Speaker 3>You have to take complex ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 3>simplify them so much that anyone with a</v>

1584
01:24:01.061 --> 01:24:04.420
<v Speaker 3>high school education and a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 3>degree of on intelligence can understand</v>

1585
01:24:04.421 --> 01:24:06.490
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I want to make good radio for your</v>

1586
01:24:06.491 --> 01:24:07.740
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But once you,</v>

1587
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:11.200
<v Speaker 3>what I'm trying to get at is once you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have got an established in your head</v>

1588
01:24:11.201 --> 01:24:14.380
<v Speaker 3>that nothing is isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that everything is connected.</v>

1589
01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:17.920
<v Speaker 3>When you speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you aware when you're speaking that</v>

1590
01:24:17.921 --> 01:24:19.390
<v Speaker 3>everything is connected?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1591
01:24:19.391 --> 01:24:24.040
<v Speaker 3>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you actually consciously thinking of</v>

1592
01:24:24.041 --> 01:24:27.970
<v Speaker 3>all of these different minds taking into</v>
<v Speaker 3>account all these different mind blowing</v>

1593
01:24:27.971 --> 01:24:31.240
<v Speaker 3>things that you're saying and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>applying them out in the world?</v>

1594
01:24:31.930 --> 01:24:33.370
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1595
01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1596
01:24:34.241 --> 01:24:37.210
<v Speaker 3>if you hear it coming out of my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's what's churning around in my</v>

1597
01:24:37.211 --> 01:24:37.961
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

1598
01:24:37.961 --> 01:24:39.760
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're such a bright guy.</v>

1599
01:24:39.761 --> 01:24:43.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to understand if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the moment or if you're in the</v>

1600
01:24:43.601 --> 01:24:46.600
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well as being consciously aware of</v>

1601
01:24:46.601 --> 01:24:48.550
<v Speaker 3>the spread of information.</v>

1602
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:51.150
<v Speaker 3>My obligation is to do both</v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously,</v>

1603
01:24:51.151 --> 01:24:53.320
<v Speaker 3>simultaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my obligation.</v>

1604
01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:54.540
<v Speaker 3>That's what I assumed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1605
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.190
<v Speaker 3>So at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>

1606
01:24:57.250 --> 01:25:01.060
<v Speaker 3>the entropic theory doesn't make any</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

1607
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:02.440
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1608
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:03.640
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1609
01:25:03.641 --> 01:25:04.780
<v Speaker 3>I was in a bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1610
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:06.730
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you would think I'm totally isolated</v>

1611
01:25:06.731 --> 01:25:07.990
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

1612
01:25:08.050 --> 01:25:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1613
01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:11.530
<v Speaker 3>once upon a time I wrote an essay about</v>
<v Speaker 3>descartes.</v>

1614
01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>descartes came up with the idea of,</v>

1615
01:25:13.781 --> 01:25:16.220
<v Speaker 3>I think therefore I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1616
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:21.270
<v Speaker 3>he took a retreat in Amsterdam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He rented a second floor apartment and</v>

1617
01:25:22.181 --> 01:25:25.970
<v Speaker 3>he was trying to isolate himself the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>that those particles are isolated with</v>

1618
01:25:25.971 --> 01:25:28.450
<v Speaker 3>the short mushers equation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the particles that were being drawn on</v>

1619
01:25:28.451 --> 01:25:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Napkins in Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1620
01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:35.440
<v Speaker 3>and so that he could strip everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>away and find out what were the most</v>

1621
01:25:35.441 --> 01:25:40.420
<v Speaker 3>basic thing and the most basic axiom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most basic thing we take for granted</v>

1622
01:25:40.421 --> 01:25:42.460
<v Speaker 3>in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he came up with,</v>

1623
01:25:42.461 --> 01:25:45.670
<v Speaker 3>I think therefore I am now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about this for a minute.</v>

1624
01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:51.780
<v Speaker 3>While he was trying to think this out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was needing a rubbery gum eraser with</v>

1625
01:25:52.991 --> 01:25:55.990
<v Speaker 3>which he erased is inc he was sitting on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second floor,</v>

1626
01:25:55.991 --> 01:25:59.170
<v Speaker 3>which means somebody had invented the</v>
<v Speaker 3>architecture that he was sitting in and</v>

1627
01:25:59.171 --> 01:26:03.380
<v Speaker 3>the concept of the floor and the concept</v>
<v Speaker 3>of beams that go across from one wall to</v>

1628
01:26:03.381 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 3>the other</v>

1629
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.010
<v Speaker 1>that were holding him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was looking out the window and he was</v>

1630
01:26:07.011 --> 01:26:11.120
<v Speaker 1>looking at the hats that the Amsterdam</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women were wearing as they</v>

1631
01:26:11.121 --> 01:26:15.410
<v Speaker 1>walked by and he was fucking in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaning lady whom he made pregnant.</v>

1632
01:26:15.710 --> 01:26:17.790
<v Speaker 1>So how isolated really was he</v>

1633
01:26:20.230 --> 01:26:23.650
<v Speaker 2>the universal mind theory this or this</v>
<v Speaker 2>concept?</v>

1634
01:26:23.651 --> 01:26:25.430
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't say theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1635
01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:30.250
<v Speaker 2>w the way you were describing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting that there is no</v>

1636
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:33.070
<v Speaker 2>individual thought that essentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1637
01:26:33.090 --> 01:26:36.040
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of individual thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all connected,</v>

1638
01:26:36.041 --> 01:26:38.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To all the other people that are around</v>

1639
01:26:38.921 --> 01:26:41.230
<v Speaker 2>you and all the people that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>interacted with and all the places</v>

1640
01:26:41.231 --> 01:26:44.740
<v Speaker 2>you've been and the things you've seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the people that are constantly</v>

1641
01:26:44.741 --> 01:26:47.170
<v Speaker 2>thinking simultaneously around you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're aware of</v>

1642
01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.640
<v Speaker 1>and the people that you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence because you're trying to</v>

1643
01:26:49.641 --> 01:26:51.430
<v Speaker 1>influence people all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1644
01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want somebody to bring you a</v>

1645
01:26:53.601 --> 01:26:55.880
<v Speaker 1>sandwich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get across that.</v>

1646
01:26:55.881 --> 01:26:59.540
<v Speaker 1>You want that sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially if you want somebody like</v>

1647
01:26:59.541 --> 01:27:02.570
<v Speaker 1>a wife or an assistant to bring you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwich and that's not normally what</v>

1648
01:27:02.571 --> 01:27:04.970
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you really have to work hard and</v>

1649
01:27:04.971 --> 01:27:05.804
<v Speaker 1>influence going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1650
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:11.050
<v Speaker 1>but the the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the living part of the universe</v>

1651
01:27:11.481 --> 01:27:13.610
<v Speaker 1>and so far we only know of life on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

1652
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:16.760
<v Speaker 1>It's all interconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those bacteria I was talking about there</v>

1653
01:27:16.761 --> 01:27:19.250
<v Speaker 1>in your gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are making your vitamin B.</v>

1654
01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:22.220
<v Speaker 1>They are making your vitamin K,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are making an awful lot of the</v>

1655
01:27:22.221 --> 01:27:25.490
<v Speaker 1>things that you use to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're also making chemicals that</v>

1656
01:27:25.491 --> 01:27:29.090
<v Speaker 1>influence your mind and your moods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're manipulating you.</v>

1657
01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:34.480
<v Speaker 1>So when you go down to the corner store</v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy some chocolate,</v>

1658
01:27:34.881 --> 01:27:37.490
<v Speaker 1>a claire's and you go home and you eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1659
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:39.770
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only digest a small portion of</v>

1660
01:27:39.771 --> 01:27:40.730
<v Speaker 1>the chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a claire,</v>

1661
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:43.070
<v Speaker 1>those bacterial colonies living in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>gut.</v>

1662
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:45.380
<v Speaker 1>They do the rest of that I adjusting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1663
01:27:45.650 --> 01:27:49.040
<v Speaker 1>So who's really going to the corner</v>
<v Speaker 1>store?</v>

1664
01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Who's really the boss who's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving you the vehicle of</v>

1665
01:27:53.421 --> 01:27:56.690
<v Speaker 1>transportation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are these bacteria driving you down to</v>

1666
01:27:56.691 --> 01:28:00.200
<v Speaker 1>the corner store so that you will feed</v>
<v Speaker 1>them the stuff that they love the most</v>

1667
01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:03.410
<v Speaker 1>or ours your will driving you to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>corner store?</v>

1668
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:07.730
<v Speaker 1>While the answer's a little of both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little of both.</v>

1669
01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Not as much of both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>

1670
01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:15.700
<v Speaker 1>there's this example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this fungus and the fungus has a</v>

1671
01:28:16.851 --> 01:28:20.570
<v Speaker 1>very peculiar lifestyle and I'm very</v>
<v Speaker 1>curious to find out how it got this</v>

1672
01:28:20.571 --> 01:28:23.630
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it lives half of its life in an ant</v>

1673
01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:28.631
<v Speaker 1>colony and half of its life and a sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when it comes out of the phase of</v>

1674
01:28:30.170 --> 01:28:32.060
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes through in the ant colony and is</v>

1675
01:28:32.061 --> 01:28:37.061
<v Speaker 1>ready to go into the sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes over the brain of an ant and it</v>

1676
01:28:37.521 --> 01:28:41.990
<v Speaker 1>gets that ant to climb to the top of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stalk of grass.</v>

1677
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when the sheep come along to</v>

1678
01:28:44.541 --> 01:28:46.670
<v Speaker 1>graze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will inhale the ant.</v>

1679
01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:52.840
<v Speaker 1>What you're telling me that a fungus can</v>
<v Speaker 1>control the mind of an ant and ways that</v>

1680
01:28:54.111 --> 01:28:59.111
<v Speaker 1>we're just beginning to explore now this</v>
<v Speaker 1>year and maybe last year a tiny little</v>

1681
01:28:59.871 --> 01:29:03.270
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it can actually be that precise in</v>

1682
01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:06.480
<v Speaker 1>how it takes over the controls of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to one of those,</v>

1683
01:29:06.481 --> 01:29:08.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fungus that gets inside those ants</v>

1684
01:29:08.611 --> 01:29:12.030
<v Speaker 1>and the ants are aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they take the ant away because the</v>

1685
01:29:12.031 --> 01:29:15.600
<v Speaker 1>aunt will explode and spray spores into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the air and it will affect the,</v>

1686
01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:19.170
<v Speaker 1>in fact I'm not aware of that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds cordyceps.</v>

1687
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds similar but the real deal</v>

1688
01:29:23.371 --> 01:29:24.570
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1689
01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:28.710
<v Speaker 1>life on this earth functions the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a beehive functions and how does it</v>

1690
01:29:28.711 --> 01:29:33.711
<v Speaker 1>be high functioning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>95% of the bees are conformist peas and</v>

1691
01:29:34.831 --> 01:29:39.690
<v Speaker 1>they out go out to the hot flower patch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the day and they mine the nectar and</v>

1692
01:29:39.691 --> 01:29:42.450
<v Speaker 1>they have a public stomach in which they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can carry this stuff.</v>

1693
01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean built into them inside of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have these carrying Harris on</v>

1694
01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:51.510
<v Speaker 1>their thighs and they carry pollen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>those and when they arrive at the</v>

1695
01:29:51.511 --> 01:29:55.320
<v Speaker 1>unloading bay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an unloading bay and the hive</v>

1696
01:29:55.710 --> 01:29:57.510
<v Speaker 1>and when they arrive at the unloading</v>
<v Speaker 1>bay,</v>

1697
01:29:57.511 --> 01:30:01.620
<v Speaker 1>if the unloaders no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the interior really needs pollen</v>

1698
01:30:01.621 --> 01:30:05.490
<v Speaker 1>and nectar and they see you carrying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pollen and nectar,</v>

1699
01:30:05.491 --> 01:30:08.430
<v Speaker 1>they stick their tongues down your</v>
<v Speaker 1>throat to check out what's in your</v>

1700
01:30:08.431 --> 01:30:10.740
<v Speaker 1>public stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go wild with excitement.</v>

1701
01:30:10.770 --> 01:30:12.480
<v Speaker 1>When they discover it's filled with</v>
<v Speaker 1>nectar,</v>

1702
01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:16.140
<v Speaker 1>they check out your thighs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the caring hairs on your thighs.</v>

1703
01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:19.500
<v Speaker 1>They go wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they see that you're carrying pond,</v>

1704
01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:21.630
<v Speaker 1>they feel you all over with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>antenna.</v>

1705
01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:25.920
<v Speaker 1>They are intensely excited when they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>unloading you and that gets you excited.</v>

1706
01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:29.720
<v Speaker 1>You feel like a rockstar because this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of attention a rockstar</v>

1707
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:30.623
<v Speaker 1>gets.</v>

1708
01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:34.410
<v Speaker 1>So you go back out to the flower patch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the day and mine some more.</v>

1709
01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are these lazy good for nothing.</v>

1710
01:30:38.701 --> 01:30:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Bohemian bees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are anywhere from 5% to 20% of the</v>

1711
01:30:42.151 --> 01:30:46.860
<v Speaker 1>colony and they don't do a single useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing at all.</v>

1712
01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:49.620
<v Speaker 1>And so far as you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't do anything to earn their</v>

1713
01:30:49.621 --> 01:30:51.360
<v Speaker 1>keep in the colony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1714
01:30:51.570 --> 01:30:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Because they're out doing loop after</v>
<v Speaker 1>loop after loop and lazy eights after</v>

1715
01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:58.880
<v Speaker 1>lazy aids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after lazy aids,</v>

1716
01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:01.560
<v Speaker 1>they'll fly eight miles just following</v>
<v Speaker 1>their whims,</v>

1717
01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:04.620
<v Speaker 1>following their whims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you were their mother,</v>

1718
01:31:04.621 --> 01:31:08.050
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wasting your fucking life for God</v>

1719
01:31:08.051 --> 01:31:09.000
<v Speaker 1>sakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1720
01:31:09.150 --> 01:31:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Eventually you the conformance be star</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming back without pollen and you're</v>

1721
01:31:14.131 --> 01:31:18.360
<v Speaker 1>carrying Harris and without nectar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your public stomach because the flower</v>

1722
01:31:18.361 --> 01:31:20.340
<v Speaker 1>patch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that flower patches of the day has been</v>

1723
01:31:20.341 --> 01:31:24.060
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly plundered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you arrive at the unloading</v>

1724
01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:27.920
<v Speaker 1>dock of the hive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unloading be stick their tongue into</v>

1725
01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:29.730
<v Speaker 1>your public stomach empty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

1726
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.740
<v Speaker 1>They see are carrying Harris empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They turn their backs on you so savagely</v>

1727
01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:38.070
<v Speaker 1>that you feel as if you've been cut dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it finally,</v>

1728
01:31:38.071 --> 01:31:41.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't believe that the old</v>
<v Speaker 1>factories not delivering anymore and</v>

1729
01:31:41.731 --> 01:31:44.880
<v Speaker 1>it's not giving you a paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you keep going back to the same patch</v>

1730
01:31:44.881 --> 01:31:48.870
<v Speaker 1>over and over again more slowly each</v>
<v Speaker 1>time until finally you give up and you</v>

1731
01:31:48.871 --> 01:31:53.430
<v Speaker 1>literally crawl into the hive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Thomas Sealy,</v>

1732
01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:56.850
<v Speaker 1>the guy who's done most of the research</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this,</v>

1733
01:31:57.390 --> 01:32:01.790
<v Speaker 1>calls you on unemployed b and you are as</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed as if you were an employee.</v>

1734
01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:03.880
<v Speaker 1>How do we know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because your body temperature is down</v>

1735
01:32:03.881 --> 01:32:08.881
<v Speaker 1>and you're crawling instead of walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're begging for food from other</v>

1736
01:32:09.191 --> 01:32:10.600
<v Speaker 1>bees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1737
01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:13.660
<v Speaker 1>you look for something to perk you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1738
01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:18.661
<v Speaker 1>what do humans use a football game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A movie bees use pretty much the same</v>

1739
01:32:19.181 --> 01:32:19.690
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1740
01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:23.350
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go to the unloading dock out of the</v>

1741
01:32:23.351 --> 01:32:27.070
<v Speaker 1>200 lazy good for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bohemian be simply following their</v>

1742
01:32:27.071 --> 01:32:31.330
<v Speaker 1>instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five have come back having found new</v>

1743
01:32:31.331 --> 01:32:36.331
<v Speaker 1>flower patches and they are dancing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dancing excites you and they're</v>

1744
01:32:36.821 --> 01:32:40.690
<v Speaker 1>dancing in competition with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some will dance 27 seconds,</v>

1745
01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:45.100
<v Speaker 1>some will dance 27 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you find the dance of one of</v>

1746
01:32:45.101 --> 01:32:49.270
<v Speaker 1>those dancers sufficiently persuasive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lifts you out of your lethargy,</v>

1747
01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:54.220
<v Speaker 1>gets you excited and you fly out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's giving a little in a little figure</v>

1748
01:32:54.221 --> 01:32:57.010
<v Speaker 1>eight dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is giving precise instructions on</v>

1749
01:32:57.011 --> 01:32:59.990
<v Speaker 1>how to get to the flower patch and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the headwinds are and what the tail</v>

1750
01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:03.160
<v Speaker 1>winds are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you pick up her message,</v>

1751
01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:06.700
<v Speaker 1>you fly out to the flower patch to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has recommended and you check it out</v>

1752
01:33:06.701 --> 01:33:09.670
<v Speaker 1>for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you get excited about it,</v>

1753
01:33:09.671 --> 01:33:11.560
<v Speaker 1>you come back and you start dancing.</v>

1754
01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:16.570
<v Speaker 1>And ultimately the be who gets the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest number of backup dancers wins</v>

1755
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:19.540
<v Speaker 1>and you all go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you can form us.</v>

1756
01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Bees were now unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go out to the new hot flower patch of</v>

1757
01:33:23.741 --> 01:33:25.690
<v Speaker 1>the day in the same pattern repeats</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

1758
01:33:26.170 --> 01:33:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a collective mind operating</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the basis of 20,000 independent bees</v>

1759
01:33:31.090 --> 01:33:36.090
<v Speaker 1>and the the living world operates and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much the same way bacteria are</v>

1760
01:33:38.171 --> 01:33:43.171
<v Speaker 1>using you to get them chocolate eclairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are using them to digest chocolate,</v>

1761
01:33:43.691 --> 01:33:47.620
<v Speaker 1>a eclairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are teasing our scientists and to</v>

1762
01:33:47.621 --> 01:33:51.670
<v Speaker 1>wild activity by threatening to develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>illnesses that can bypass all of our</v>

1763
01:33:51.671 --> 01:33:55.030
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way are chemical weapons</v>

1764
01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:58.240
<v Speaker 1>that microorganisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>colonies of microorganisms,</v>

1765
01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.720
<v Speaker 1>organisms use to kill entire competing</v>
<v Speaker 1>colonies.</v>

1766
01:34:02.230 --> 01:34:05.650
<v Speaker 1>We stole him from microorganisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we didn't admit them antibiotics.</v>

1767
01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:09.770
<v Speaker 1>So the scientists are very worth fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the bees are,</v>

1768
01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:14.020
<v Speaker 1>that the bacteria are getting ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us in research and development and are</v>

1769
01:34:14.021 --> 01:34:16.960
<v Speaker 1>beginning to develop techniques to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>around all of our drugs.</v>

1770
01:34:17.230 --> 01:34:22.230
<v Speaker 1>So they are researching their ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is there any common brain that links</v>

1771
01:34:23.530 --> 01:34:25.990
<v Speaker 1>the bacteria to the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>community?</v>

1772
01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:29.650
<v Speaker 1>You bet they're competing with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and in the process of competing</v>

1773
01:34:29.651 --> 01:34:31.120
<v Speaker 1>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing?</v>

1774
01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:34.330
<v Speaker 1>They are both creating new options for</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of life.</v>

1775
01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we're talking about antibiotics,</v>

1776
01:34:40.670 --> 01:34:42.680
<v Speaker 2>penicillin or amoxicillin and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1777
01:34:42.710 --> 01:34:45.440
<v Speaker 2>these are bacteria created</v>

1778
01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Korean boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria make war with each other.</v>

1779
01:34:49.191 --> 01:34:51.590
<v Speaker 1>When people tell you we are the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures that make war,</v>

1780
01:34:51.591 --> 01:34:52.424
<v Speaker 1>they're allying.</v>

1781
01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:56.660
<v Speaker 2>So is this why also when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're experimenting with</v>

1782
01:34:56.661 --> 01:34:58.280
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1783
01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:01.490
<v Speaker 2>people that have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very sugar based diet,</v>

1784
01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:06.520
<v Speaker 2>they have a high number of certain kinds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of bacteria in their stomach that craves</v>

1785
01:35:07.491 --> 01:35:10.130
<v Speaker 2>that kind of sugar and it makes it very</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to get off that,</v>

1786
01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:11.473
<v Speaker 2>that kind of a diet.</v>

1787
01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1788
01:35:12.461 --> 01:35:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not aware of that,</v>

1789
01:35:13.690 --> 01:35:16.990
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds logical given gut bacteria</v>

1790
01:35:17.050 --> 01:35:18.130
<v Speaker 1>about the biome.</v>

1791
01:35:18.510 --> 01:35:19.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1792
01:35:19.281 --> 01:35:20.690
<v Speaker 2>When you find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1793
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:23.240
<v Speaker 2>one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you try to alter your diet,</v>

1794
01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:27.800
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a very high refined</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate diet and you try to get off</v>

1795
01:35:27.801 --> 01:35:28.300
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1796
01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:32.780
<v Speaker 2>you have intense cravings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those eventually go away.</v>

1797
01:35:32.781 --> 01:35:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you supplement with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of probiotics and then you'd go to a</v>

1798
01:35:36.561 --> 01:35:38.990
<v Speaker 2>high fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low carbohydrate diet,</v>

1799
01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:43.100
<v Speaker 2>you start to crave those kinds of foods</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the cravings for sugar and bread go</v>

1800
01:35:43.101 --> 01:35:44.270
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>

1801
01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting because I am on a</v>

1802
01:35:45.851 --> 01:35:50.851
<v Speaker 1>very restricted diet myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I developed it myself.</v>

1803
01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:54.470
<v Speaker 1>It's take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took 30 years down.</v>

1804
01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:58.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a diet that maximizes my energy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ability to concentrate.</v>

1805
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:59.850
<v Speaker 1>What's a tangle meal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1806
01:35:59.890 --> 01:36:01.540
<v Speaker 1>there are only two meals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1807
01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:06.850
<v Speaker 1>breakfast is a can of tuna fish and</v>
<v Speaker 1>avocado and mango.</v>

1808
01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's at 10 30 in the morning,</v>

1809
01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:14.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner,</v>

1810
01:36:14.021 --> 01:36:16.840
<v Speaker 1>which is at three o'clock or two 30 in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning,</v>

1811
01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.850
<v Speaker 1>two 30 in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1812
01:36:19.150 --> 01:36:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Remember I'm an odd schedule that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily nocturnal because of my</v>

1813
01:36:22.781 --> 01:36:23.614
<v Speaker 1>illness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1814
01:36:23.770 --> 01:36:28.030
<v Speaker 1>So dinner is a half a pound of ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken,</v>

1815
01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:31.630
<v Speaker 1>a pound of frozen vegetables and apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an orange and a banana.</v>

1816
01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Why frozen vegetables?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can get them in one pound</v>

1817
01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:37.780
<v Speaker 1>bags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's precisely premeasured for you.</v>

1818
01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they freeze them when they're fresh</v>

1819
01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:44.770
<v Speaker 1>and you can throw them along with a slab</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1820
01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chopped chicken.</v>

1821
01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frozen slab,</v>

1822
01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:50.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a microwaveable container and</v>

1823
01:36:50.981 --> 01:36:52.960
<v Speaker 1>microwave them for 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1824
01:36:52.961 --> 01:36:55.510
<v Speaker 1>throw a lot of spices in so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>change the flavor,</v>

1825
01:36:55.930 --> 01:37:00.930
<v Speaker 1>but a day after day and you've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner and that's all you ever eat.</v>

1826
01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:03.200
<v Speaker 1>That's all I ever had except,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1827
01:37:03.210 --> 01:37:08.210
<v Speaker 1>on Friday I allow myself to eat sauces</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cheese sauces out of a jar because I</v>

1828
01:37:08.891 --> 01:37:13.180
<v Speaker 1>don't eat things that have artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients or additives of any kind</v>

1829
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:17.740
<v Speaker 1>normally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I have this wanking huge meal and</v>

1830
01:37:17.741 --> 01:37:21.430
<v Speaker 1>then on Saturday alr and myself to</v>
<v Speaker 1>splurge on absolutely anything I want to</v>

1831
01:37:21.431 --> 01:37:22.810
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's your cheat day?</v>

1832
01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you find yourself going to on a</v>

1833
01:37:24.761 --> 01:37:25.810
<v Speaker 1>cheat day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1834
01:37:25.811 --> 01:37:29.680
<v Speaker 1>these days I've sort of settled into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern and I take one frozen bag,</v>

1835
01:37:29.681 --> 01:37:32.440
<v Speaker 1>all a big one out of the refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I slice it in half.</v>

1836
01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I put huge amounts of peanut butter on</v>
<v Speaker 1>one hand when he first,</v>

1837
01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.870
<v Speaker 1>I use a quarter of a pound of butter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I slather on the two halves of the</v>

1838
01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Bagel.</v>

1839
01:37:41.710 --> 01:37:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm not allowed to eat any of</v>

1840
01:37:43.271 --> 01:37:45.310
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bread not allowed to eat butter?</v>

1841
01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:46.840
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

1842
01:37:46.930 --> 01:37:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Well we're told that butter is bad for</v>
<v Speaker 1>us and it and dairy turned out to be a</v>

1843
01:37:51.641 --> 01:37:55.500
<v Speaker 1>problem for me and I had a workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to work away around my food</v>

1844
01:37:55.501 --> 01:37:58.170
<v Speaker 1>allergies and this is the Diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] allergy to dairy.</v>

1845
01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I apparently did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I still do but so these</v>

1846
01:38:03.001 --> 01:38:07.860
<v Speaker 1>huge honking amounts of butter and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take these giant slabs of peanut</v>

1847
01:38:07.861 --> 01:38:12.861
<v Speaker 1>butter and I pile them up with a leaving</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little hole in the center and in the</v>

1848
01:38:13.531 --> 01:38:17.880
<v Speaker 1>hole in the center I put grape jam and</v>
<v Speaker 1>strawberry jam and then I take out the</v>

1849
01:38:17.881 --> 01:38:22.881
<v Speaker 1>marshmallow fluff and I put on almost an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire jar of marshmallow fluff on top</v>

1850
01:38:23.011 --> 01:38:25.850
<v Speaker 1>of this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half a bangle cause I really want to</v>

1851
01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:31.140
<v Speaker 1>taste the bagel naked with just butter</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it because I haven't had bread all</v>

1852
01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:36.140
<v Speaker 1>week and it can taste really good and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>am indulging myself with this other half</v>

1853
01:38:37.531 --> 01:38:39.720
<v Speaker 1>of the Bagel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How bad do you feel after you digest</v>

1854
01:38:39.721 --> 01:38:40.740
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel bad.</v>

1855
01:38:40.741 --> 01:38:45.741
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat before I go to sleep and well,</v>

1856
01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:48.600
<v Speaker 1>eating puts you to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should you have to slog through the</v>

1857
01:38:48.601 --> 01:38:52.550
<v Speaker 1>gray goo of your after meal experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1858
01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:53.880
<v Speaker 1>with your friends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1859
01:38:54.130 --> 01:38:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm with a friend,</v>

1860
01:38:55.381 --> 01:38:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I want to be at my maximum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1861
01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:02.250
<v Speaker 1>I want to enjoy then how do I enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself with my mouth open and my tongue</v>

1862
01:39:02.251 --> 01:39:03.084
<v Speaker 1>going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1863
01:39:03.210 --> 01:39:07.560
<v Speaker 1>So even having food in your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just preventing you from having a</v>

1864
01:39:07.561 --> 01:39:08.394
<v Speaker 1>good coffee.</v>

1865
01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fascinating way to approach it.</v>

1866
01:39:12.621 --> 01:39:15.170
<v Speaker 2>So you just will also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you carb up like that,</v>

1867
01:39:15.370 --> 01:39:17.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all that sugar and carbs,</v>

1868
01:39:17.061 --> 01:39:19.310
<v Speaker 2>you're going to want to crash in about</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 minutes after you,</v>

1869
01:39:19.630 --> 01:39:21.310
<v Speaker 1>and that turns out to be the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

1870
01:39:21.311 --> 01:39:24.760
<v Speaker 1>So I sleep immediately after my</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast and then I sleep immediately</v>

1871
01:39:24.761 --> 01:39:26.920
<v Speaker 1>after my dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way the day is a range.</v>

1872
01:39:26.921 --> 01:39:30.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a range to maximize the useful high</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

1873
01:39:30.851 --> 01:39:32.680
<v Speaker 1>high focus time.</v>

1874
01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Now did they ever try to put you on any</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of unfettered means or anything?</v>

1875
01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1876
01:39:37.131 --> 01:39:38.750
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1877
01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my experience,</v>

1878
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:42.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I helped start the 60s.</v>

1879
01:39:42.591 --> 01:39:44.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1880
01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I helped start the drug culture and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant I did amphetamine twice.</v>

1881
01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:52.490
<v Speaker 1>It was brand new back then and whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>form it was popular</v>

1882
01:39:52.650 --> 01:39:56.040
<v Speaker 2>provigil or Nuvigil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who has chronic fatigue</v>

1883
01:39:56.041 --> 01:39:57.030
<v Speaker 2>and that's where they put him on.</v>

1884
01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff,</v>

1885
01:39:58.701 --> 01:40:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm on work so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to mess with it at this</v>

1886
01:40:01.671 --> 01:40:03.410
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky to be out of that bad.</v>

1887
01:40:03.411 --> 01:40:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I thought I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Joe,</v>

1888
01:40:04.491 --> 01:40:07.130
<v Speaker 1>I thought I would never be out of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>bedroom again in my life.</v>

1889
01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:09.150
<v Speaker 1>And you've been out of the bed for 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1890
01:40:09.730 --> 01:40:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 15 years.</v>

1891
01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:11.960
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1892
01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:14.620
<v Speaker 1>So I'm giving three speeches this week</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the</v>

1893
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:16.640
<v Speaker 2>18 and 15 out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1894
01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:17.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1895
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:19.400
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1896
01:40:19.570 --> 01:40:22.450
<v Speaker 2>you have so much energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to imagine you being</v>

1897
01:40:22.451 --> 01:40:23.410
<v Speaker 2>bedridden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1898
01:40:23.411 --> 01:40:24.660
<v Speaker 2>it really is your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1899
01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't form a single syllable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1900
01:40:29.321 --> 01:40:30.440
<v Speaker 2>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1901
01:40:30.490 --> 01:40:32.220
<v Speaker 2>I do believe you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying it.</v>

1902
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Seeing you in this state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're smiling,</v>

1903
01:40:34.661 --> 01:40:35.494
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1904
01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:39.520
<v Speaker 2>and obviously what you said about</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoying conversations and it's so</v>

1905
01:40:39.521 --> 01:40:42.880
<v Speaker 2>parent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really enjoy getting these ideas</v>

1906
01:40:42.881 --> 01:40:43.360
<v Speaker 2>across.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1907
01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:43.860
<v Speaker 2>this is</v>

1908
01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:44.671
<v Speaker 1>tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1909
01:40:44.671 --> 01:40:46.680
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still dealing with how to get across</v>

1910
01:40:46.681 --> 01:40:50.400
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a global brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically every creature on the</v>

1911
01:40:50.401 --> 01:40:52.560
<v Speaker 1>face of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This in some way contributing to our</v>

1912
01:40:52.561 --> 01:40:54.970
<v Speaker 1>knowledge base and our hunter gatherer</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1913
01:40:55.330 --> 01:40:58.240
<v Speaker 1>If we were going to bring down a d or an</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat it for dinner,</v>

1914
01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:00.670
<v Speaker 1>we had to get to know the mentality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that deer.</v>

1915
01:41:00.671 --> 01:41:04.060
<v Speaker 1>We had to be able to shape it in our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds so we can anticipate its</v>

1916
01:41:04.061 --> 01:41:06.880
<v Speaker 1>movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we anticipated the movements of</v>

1917
01:41:06.881 --> 01:41:09.250
<v Speaker 1>lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We anticipated the movements of eagles.</v>

1918
01:41:09.251 --> 01:41:14.251
<v Speaker 1>We turned lions and Eagles and bears and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to totems and named ourselves after them</v>

1919
01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.860
<v Speaker 1>because we were trying to learn from</v>
<v Speaker 1>their very spirit.</v>

1920
01:41:17.861 --> 01:41:22.240
<v Speaker 1>We were trying to learn muscularly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally how to be them so that we</v>

1921
01:41:22.241 --> 01:41:24.670
<v Speaker 1>could defeat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the time came.</v>

1922
01:41:25.810 --> 01:41:27.370
<v Speaker 1>There's a connection there.</v>

1923
01:41:27.370 --> 01:41:29.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a global brain taking place</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there,</v>

1924
01:41:29.501 --> 01:41:33.880
<v Speaker 1>and the deer and the block and the Bison</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other creatures we were hunting.</v>

1925
01:41:33.881 --> 01:41:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Even the wooly mammoths could not have</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived without those bacteria in their</v>

1926
01:41:37.301 --> 01:41:38.500
<v Speaker 1>guts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1927
01:41:38.501 --> 01:41:42.700
<v Speaker 1>we didn't discover those bacteria and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell Anton van Leeuwenhoek dare to take</v>

1928
01:41:42.701 --> 01:41:46.420
<v Speaker 1>his lens and instead of having it</v>
<v Speaker 1>horizontal to measure fabrics or we're</v>

1929
01:41:46.421 --> 01:41:49.240
<v Speaker 1>looking at fabrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started looking down at his own sperm,</v>

1930
01:41:49.241 --> 01:41:50.380
<v Speaker 1>which was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1931
01:41:50.381 --> 01:41:53.200
<v Speaker 1>look at what this guy did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a tradesman.</v>

1932
01:41:53.230 --> 01:41:56.200
<v Speaker 1>He's not a trained scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1933
01:41:56.201 --> 01:42:01.201
<v Speaker 1>the word scientist didn't exist until</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight roughly 1850 but nonetheless,</v>

1934
01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:07.020
<v Speaker 1>he is taking his observations of fresh</v>
<v Speaker 1>human sperm through his newly invented</v>

1935
01:42:07.361 --> 01:42:09.640
<v Speaker 1>microscope and he's sending the</v>
<v Speaker 1>observations.</v>

1936
01:42:09.641 --> 01:42:13.270
<v Speaker 1>He's discovered that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>animalcules little animals,</v>

1937
01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:17.770
<v Speaker 1>totally independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flailing around in this farm and he</v>

1938
01:42:17.771 --> 01:42:20.560
<v Speaker 1>writes a lengthy letter about this to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the royal society.</v>

1939
01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Now what has he just John Joe to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Royal Society.</v>

1940
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:26.950
<v Speaker 1>He's confessed to masturbation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1941
01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think he got the sperm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1942
01:42:28.901 --> 01:42:30.910
<v Speaker 1>it took me about 40 years of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1943
01:42:30.911 --> 01:42:35.230
<v Speaker 1>it may be 50 to work it out and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly realized this guy is,</v>

1944
01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.330
<v Speaker 1>why does masturbation keep showing up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life?</v>

1945
01:42:37.331 --> 01:42:39.790
<v Speaker 1>One look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boy scouts threw me out when I was</v>

1946
01:42:39.791 --> 01:42:41.890
<v Speaker 1>11 years old for incompetence at Morse</v>
<v Speaker 1>code.</v>

1947
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:44.200
<v Speaker 1>And if they hadn't thrown me out for</v>
<v Speaker 1>incompetence of that,</v>

1948
01:42:44.201 --> 01:42:46.360
<v Speaker 1>they could have thrown me out for</v>
<v Speaker 1>incompetence at knot tying.</v>

1949
01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Now admittedly I've never heard of</v>
<v Speaker 1>another human being ever being thrown</v>

1950
01:42:49.661 --> 01:42:53.500
<v Speaker 1>out of the boy scouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still then in my thrown out of the</v>

1951
01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:54.370
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1952
01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:59.080
<v Speaker 1>For a long time code and sit Morse code</v>
<v Speaker 1>being competent at Morse code.</v>

1953
01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems so simple</v>

1954
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:05.080
<v Speaker 1>to me it wasn't simple.</v>

1955
01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.780
<v Speaker 1>So at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was too busy with theoretical</v>

1956
01:43:07.781 --> 01:43:11.380
<v Speaker 1>physics and cosmology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just uninterested.</v>

1957
01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that you were in competent,</v>

1958
01:43:13.001 --> 01:43:15.060
<v Speaker 1>you really never bothered to learn it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was to,</v>

1959
01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I had other better things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something better than Morse code before</v>

1960
01:43:19.831 --> 01:43:20.664
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1961
01:43:20.710 --> 01:43:24.850
<v Speaker 1>So at any rate then in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the summer between my freshman and</v>

1962
01:43:24.851 --> 01:43:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Sophomore Year of college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1963
01:43:26.601 --> 01:43:30.160
<v Speaker 1>I dropped out for three or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to back to freshman year at</v>

1964
01:43:30.161 --> 01:43:31.870
<v Speaker 1>the age of 21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why'd you drop out?</v>

1965
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to find the beatniks.</v>

1966
01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to find zen Buddhist Satori,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Zen Buddha state of enlightenment.</v>

1967
01:43:38.890 --> 01:43:43.660
<v Speaker 1>I was dead serious about those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the top 10% of a class that had</v>

1968
01:43:43.661 --> 01:43:46.120
<v Speaker 1>higher meeting sats than the classes at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard,</v>

1969
01:43:46.121 --> 01:43:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Mit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Caltech.</v>

1970
01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:48.940
<v Speaker 1>That year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was at Reed College.</v>

1971
01:43:48.941 --> 01:43:52.640
<v Speaker 1>The school that Steve Jobs would</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually drop out of very tough</v>

1972
01:43:52.641 --> 01:43:53.474
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

1973
01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:56.270
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't realize I was in the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>10%.</v>

1974
01:43:56.271 --> 01:43:59.390
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had these things I wanted to do.</v>

1975
01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I was inspired by on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt the beatniks are the first people</v>

1976
01:44:03.621 --> 01:44:06.100
<v Speaker 1>who would ever accept me and my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1977
01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:10.040
<v Speaker 1>you were reliving the time you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>carried away by the children.</v>

1978
01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:10.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1979
01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:12.800
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

1980
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I drop out of school and went seeking</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satori and the beatniks and hitchhiked</v>

1981
01:44:18.711 --> 01:44:20.950
<v Speaker 1>from Seattle down to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1982
01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:24.320
<v Speaker 1>the city lights bookstore op,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was Lawrence Ferlinghetti is</v>

1983
01:44:24.321 --> 01:44:26.300
<v Speaker 1>bookshop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the beatniks yeah,</v>

1984
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:27.290
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1985
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:29.480
<v Speaker 1>that's where the beatniks are supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be hanging out.</v>

1986
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:33.440
<v Speaker 1>And I walked into the store and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>empty and there was a guy behind the</v>

1987
01:44:33.441 --> 01:44:36.020
<v Speaker 1>counter and I probably said something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1988
01:44:36.021 --> 01:44:38.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are the beatniks?</v>

1989
01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:41.060
<v Speaker 1>And he acted as if I wasn't even there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that was hard,</v>

1990
01:44:41.061 --> 01:44:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had a Jew for over kind.</v>

1991
01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:47.240
<v Speaker 1>People have been wearing their short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hair,</v>

1992
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:49.550
<v Speaker 1>their haircuts and military haircuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crew cuts.</v>

1993
01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:54.970
<v Speaker 1>And I had this long curly hair and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one had ever seen anything like it</v>

1994
01:44:54.981 --> 01:44:57.740
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The closest to it was the wig that Harpo</v>

1995
01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Marx used to wear wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't the,</v>

1996
01:45:00.230 --> 01:45:02.120
<v Speaker 1>some of the members of the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get you there.</v>

1997
01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:04.850
<v Speaker 1>There's a photo of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that photo from?</v>

1998
01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Probably 1965,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1966.</v>

1999
01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:15.880
<v Speaker 1>That is a patient and the guy who so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how could you ignore if that walked</v>

2000
01:45:16.671 --> 01:45:20.180
<v Speaker 1>into your bookstore and you'd never seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>a haircut like that before and the</v>

2001
01:45:20.181 --> 01:45:24.530
<v Speaker 1>person was barefoot in addition to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and carrying a sleeping bag,</v>

2002
01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:27.860
<v Speaker 1>you were barefoot with a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been barefoot for six months and</v>

2003
01:45:27.861 --> 01:45:30.680
<v Speaker 1>your feet get so thick that you go walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>over gravel.</v>

2004
01:45:30.681 --> 01:45:32.660
<v Speaker 1>I will ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you barefoot for six months?</v>

2005
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:37.090
<v Speaker 1>It felt like the right thing to do under</v>
<v Speaker 1>the circumstances or the swelling?</v>

2006
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:38.600
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually I gave it up.</v>

2007
01:45:38.601 --> 01:45:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any houses left?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2008
01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:41.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2009
01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:45.920
<v Speaker 1>I can't walk over gravel anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long for those days where you can do no,</v>

2010
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I like current shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love her and choose.</v>

2011
01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:50.930
<v Speaker 1>So at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would,</v>

2012
01:45:50.931 --> 01:45:54.440
<v Speaker 1>you ignore what you just saw that person</v>
<v Speaker 1>with hair coming out of his head,</v>

2013
01:45:54.441 --> 01:45:56.150
<v Speaker 1>like electrocuted worms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love.</v>

2014
01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:59.240
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy has got something to say.</v>

2015
01:45:59.241 --> 01:46:00.074
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2016
01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:04.640
<v Speaker 1>the guy ignored me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I walked out of the bookstore looking</v>

2017
01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:08.360
<v Speaker 1>crushed and somebody walking down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sidewalk said,</v>

2018
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:11.090
<v Speaker 1>you look troubled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I help you with something?</v>

2019
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:12.950
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2020
01:46:12.951 --> 01:46:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking for the beatniks.</v>

2021
01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:17.540
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2022
01:46:17.541 --> 01:46:22.541
<v Speaker 1>and he rolled his pupils up into his</v>
<v Speaker 1>forehead and he scratched his head and</v>

2023
01:46:23.211 --> 01:46:24.530
<v Speaker 1>he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he thought,</v>

2024
01:46:24.531 --> 01:46:26.900
<v Speaker 1>and he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he came out of it and he said,</v>

2025
01:46:26.901 --> 01:46:29.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you tried Colorado?</v>

2026
01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Well that was just a little too vague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A destination for Colorado.</v>

2027
01:46:35.150 --> 01:46:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With a beat.</v>

2028
01:46:36.261 --> 01:46:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Nixon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado.</v>

2029
01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.920
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought they might be.</v>

2030
01:46:40.190 --> 01:46:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I ended up hitchhiking up and down</v>

2031
01:46:43.191 --> 01:46:45.680
<v Speaker 1>the west coast with several friends gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2032
01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:48.530
<v Speaker 1>You gave up on the beatniks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gave up on the beatniks because I</v>

2033
01:46:48.531 --> 01:46:50.520
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a specific address and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to leave.</v>

2034
01:46:50.521 --> 01:46:52.860
<v Speaker 1>What year is the West Coast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was 1962.</v>

2035
01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were early.</v>

2036
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:57.720
<v Speaker 1>It was two years before the sixties woke</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and realized that it was a distinct</v>

2037
01:46:57.721 --> 01:47:01.110
<v Speaker 1>decade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was two years before the electric</v>

2038
01:47:01.111 --> 01:47:04.980
<v Speaker 1>koolaid acid test and hung around a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

2039
01:47:04.981 --> 01:47:06.930
<v Speaker 1>You would have been their perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2040
01:47:06.931 --> 01:47:09.090
<v Speaker 1>I prefer starting my own groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

2041
01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:13.410
<v Speaker 1>And this group gathered around me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>around on one of my traveling</v>

2042
01:47:13.411 --> 01:47:17.610
<v Speaker 1>companions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we eventually ended up in a big pink</v>

2043
01:47:17.611 --> 01:47:18.300
<v Speaker 1>condemned house.</v>

2044
01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:21.360
<v Speaker 1>This is all in how I accidentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>started in the 60s and a big pink</v>

2045
01:47:21.361 --> 01:47:24.510
<v Speaker 1>condemned house in Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three blocks away from the Berkeley</v>

2046
01:47:24.511 --> 01:47:26.970
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we didn't care if it was going to</v>

2047
01:47:26.971 --> 01:47:28.980
<v Speaker 1>fall down at any minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2048
01:47:29.010 --> 01:47:32.220
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were no close zero clothing during</v>

2049
01:47:32.221 --> 01:47:34.500
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And My,</v>

2050
01:47:34.501 --> 01:47:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I guess co leader was a guy named Dick</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] who had the body of an</v>

2051
01:47:38.071 --> 01:47:40.560
<v Speaker 1>autonomous when we walked down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street together,</v>

2052
01:47:40.561 --> 01:47:43.440
<v Speaker 1>women could not take their eyes off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and,</v>

2053
01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:48.500
<v Speaker 1>but they slice through me as if I were</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't there is if I were invisible and</v>

2054
01:47:48.501 --> 01:47:50.520
<v Speaker 1>every woman wanted to sleep with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2055
01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:55.350
<v Speaker 1>and he had this sense of somehow he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived a life up to that point with never</v>

2056
01:47:55.351 --> 01:47:57.420
<v Speaker 1>having a depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never having a doubt,</v>

2057
01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:00.690
<v Speaker 1>never having a psychic pain of any kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was uncanny,</v>

2058
01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:02.820
<v Speaker 1>was unreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2059
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:06.120
<v Speaker 1>and remember Michael Jackson is still</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most remarkable person I've ever</v>

2060
01:48:06.121 --> 01:48:07.890
<v Speaker 1>met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to cough was pretty remarkable.</v>

2061
01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:13.400
<v Speaker 1>And so dick set the tone being naked and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick would go into the bathroom to do</v>

2062
01:48:14.971 --> 01:48:17.580
<v Speaker 1>the things you do in the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but leave the door open and continuous</v>

2063
01:48:17.581 --> 01:48:20.400
<v Speaker 1>conversation with you while he was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there going.</v>

2064
01:48:20.401 --> 01:48:25.080
<v Speaker 1>So that was the norm for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was the spiritual leader of the</v>

2065
01:48:25.081 --> 01:48:30.081
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the time I was 19 or 18 years old.</v>

2066
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:36.300
<v Speaker 1>So I like to be a spiritual leader at 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels very good when people believe</v>

2067
01:48:36.301 --> 01:48:38.550
<v Speaker 1>in the things that you say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels very good when you're</v>

2068
01:48:38.551 --> 01:48:42.570
<v Speaker 1>hitchhiking and somebody takes you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>macarthur park in La and there are all</v>

2069
01:48:42.571 --> 01:48:47.520
<v Speaker 1>these guys on soapboxes and or aiding</v>
<v Speaker 1>their heads off about Marxism or the</v>

2070
01:48:47.521 --> 01:48:51.860
<v Speaker 1>coming of Jesus or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somebody in the crowd while you're</v>

2071
01:48:51.870 --> 01:48:54.450
<v Speaker 1>just watching what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walks up to you and says,</v>

2072
01:48:54.690 --> 01:48:57.360
<v Speaker 1>you look like the idiot and the Dusky</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking novel.</v>

2073
01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:00.630
<v Speaker 1>So he doesn't mean that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look like an idiot.</v>

2074
01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:04.370
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about something unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2075
01:49:04.670 --> 01:49:07.470
<v Speaker 1>and I start explaining to him what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

2076
01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:10.590
<v Speaker 1>And before long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the crowds around,</v>

2077
01:49:10.591 --> 01:49:15.591
<v Speaker 1>all the guys on soap boxes with all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Marxist and Jesus lectures have</v>

2078
01:49:16.231 --> 01:49:20.520
<v Speaker 1>abandoned their speakers and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to me.</v>

2079
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell I really get off.</v>

2080
01:49:22.741 --> 01:49:27.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to an audience of anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>from one person to 100,000 people,</v>

2081
01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:30.480
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

2082
01:49:30.570 --> 01:49:34.860
<v Speaker 1>It lights me up and so did it feel good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2083
01:49:34.890 --> 01:49:38.280
<v Speaker 1>So you feel like that doing that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're calling?</v>

2084
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2085
01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:43.560
<v Speaker 1>That that's what I'm here for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm here to write the books to now</v>

2086
01:49:43.561 --> 01:49:46.230
<v Speaker 1>writing the books is a lonely</v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>

2087
01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Writing is very lonely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to isolate</v>

2088
01:49:48.370 --> 01:49:51.070
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I do it at a coffee shop.</v>

2089
01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:55.120
<v Speaker 3>We're out of the corner of my eye can</v>
<v Speaker 3>see humans around me and where I can</v>

2090
01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:58.420
<v Speaker 3>spend four hours in and be profoundly</v>
<v Speaker 3>rude.</v>

2091
01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Because when you're in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>balancing seven ideas and you're</v>

2092
01:50:01.871 --> 01:50:05.050
<v Speaker 3>fashioning a sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if somebody interrupts you for half a</v>

2093
01:50:05.051 --> 01:50:05.950
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2094
01:50:05.970 --> 01:50:07.970
<v Speaker 3>All those things can go crashing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>disappear.</v>

2095
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.680
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand the need to do it in</v>

2096
01:50:11.681 --> 01:50:15.370
<v Speaker 3>front of all these people because I need</v>
<v Speaker 3>the energy of other people with a lot of</v>

2097
01:50:15.371 --> 01:50:18.040
<v Speaker 3>people that live in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Jeff said that he wouldn't</v>

2098
01:50:18.041 --> 01:50:20.110
<v Speaker 3>live anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loves New York City because he gets</v>

2099
01:50:20.111 --> 01:50:21.730
<v Speaker 3>energy out all the people that live</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2100
01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:22.700
<v Speaker 3>And I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2101
01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:24.640
<v Speaker 3>I've tried Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Portland,</v>

2102
01:50:25.210 --> 01:50:27.220
<v Speaker 3>San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>San Pedro,</v>

2103
01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:30.160
<v Speaker 3>and the only does it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>

2104
01:50:30.161 --> 01:50:31.600
<v Speaker 3>In ways I never imagined.</v>

2105
01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:34.270
<v Speaker 3>I never thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long did it take before you realized</v>

2106
01:50:34.271 --> 01:50:37.030
<v Speaker 3>that that was the spot for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that long.</v>

2107
01:50:37.031 --> 01:50:42.031
<v Speaker 3>Because what I realized about seven</v>
<v Speaker 3>months into it was I don't fit into</v>

2108
01:50:42.581 --> 01:50:45.970
<v Speaker 3>clique's clique's don't want me and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not comfortable.</v>

2109
01:50:46.710 --> 01:50:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm generally not lotted in clique's.</v>

2110
01:50:49.770 --> 01:50:50.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be whining.</v>

2111
01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:52.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't really have one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

2112
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:56.560
<v Speaker 3>that's very sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very nice.</v>

2113
01:50:56.561 --> 01:51:00.070
<v Speaker 3>But so at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I discovered that in New York there are</v>

2114
01:51:00.071 --> 01:51:04.420
<v Speaker 3>so many people that you can pick people</v>
<v Speaker 3>one by one and put them together into</v>

2115
01:51:04.421 --> 01:51:07.600
<v Speaker 3>your own clique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you put them together in your own</v>

2116
01:51:07.601 --> 01:51:09.700
<v Speaker 3>clique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you always maintain a certain central</v>

2117
01:51:09.701 --> 01:51:11.060
<v Speaker 3>role,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you would,</v>

2118
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:14.920
<v Speaker 3>the people that are in the clique and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really want to advance them it,</v>

2119
01:51:14.921 --> 01:51:17.980
<v Speaker 3>you're still accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I um,</v>

2120
01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:20.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm around giant groups of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2121
01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:26.040
<v Speaker 3>so often because of the UFC doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>commentary and in these huge arenas,</v>

2122
01:51:26.141 --> 01:51:26.974
<v Speaker 3>Philippine wow.</v>

2123
01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:32.040
<v Speaker 3>And then doing standup in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of bees and then the podcast</v>

2124
01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:34.990
<v Speaker 3>reaching all these people I need alone</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2125
01:51:35.230 --> 01:51:39.490
<v Speaker 3>Like I have the opposite requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need that.</v>

2126
01:51:39.491 --> 01:51:42.970
<v Speaker 3>If I don't get like my writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to write a loan.</v>

2127
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.650
<v Speaker 3>I right when everyone's asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right house.</v>

2128
01:51:45.010 --> 01:51:48.550
<v Speaker 3>I wait until everyone goes to bed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I do my writing and I've learned,</v>

2129
01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:50.860
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's a discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2130
01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:53.230
<v Speaker 3>How would it be alone in the midst of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people?</v>

2131
01:51:53.420 --> 01:51:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you need the energy,</v>

2132
01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:57.810
<v Speaker 3>the energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I want you to describe to me,</v>

2133
01:51:57.811 --> 01:52:00.730
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the energy of these people</v>

2134
01:52:00.731 --> 01:52:02.500
<v Speaker 3>around you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is happening?</v>

2135
01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:04.720
<v Speaker 3>First you have to understand it's not a</v>
<v Speaker 3>distraction.</v>

2136
01:52:04.750 --> 01:52:07.660
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are built to take in input from other</v>

2137
01:52:07.661 --> 01:52:10.480
<v Speaker 3>human beings and to give output to other</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>

2138
01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:12.700
<v Speaker 3>And when we feel unnecessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I sat,</v>

2139
01:52:12.701 --> 01:52:17.701
<v Speaker 3>her immune system goes into under dive</v>
<v Speaker 3>nose dive and so we need to be around</v>

2140
01:52:18.611 --> 01:52:21.700
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if you're a writer and you write and</v>

2141
01:52:21.701 --> 01:52:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I write as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to isolate yourself.</v>

2142
01:52:24.491 --> 01:52:27.880
<v Speaker 3>So I've figured out a way to be utterly</v>
<v Speaker 3>isolated in the midst of a bunch of</v>

2143
01:52:27.881 --> 01:52:30.370
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need the energy from those people</v>

2144
01:52:30.371 --> 01:52:34.540
<v Speaker 3>because otherwise I do my best writing</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm feeling the energy of my</v>

2145
01:52:34.541 --> 01:52:36.130
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you don't,</v>

2146
01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:39.490
<v Speaker 3>you you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you do get interrupted,</v>

2147
01:52:39.491 --> 01:52:42.190
<v Speaker 3>I should say it does fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>

2148
01:52:42.191 --> 01:52:46.110
<v Speaker 3>so I simply writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying writing.</v>

2149
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do it without ever lifting my eyes</v>

2150
01:52:49.311 --> 01:52:51.990
<v Speaker 1>from the page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've learned to discipline my mind.</v>

2151
01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you manage one and a cigarette.</v>

2152
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2172
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:03.340
<v Speaker 1>one night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was walking out in the middle of that</v>

2173
01:54:03.341 --> 01:54:08.341
<v Speaker 1>meadow in the park looking at the stars</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my phone be answering now 1140 at</v>

2174
01:54:08.421 --> 01:54:11.660
<v Speaker 1>night or 1240 at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're commuting with the stars,</v>

2175
01:54:11.661 --> 01:54:13.400
<v Speaker 1>you don't really want to answer the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

2176
01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:17.300
<v Speaker 1>But I'm on call for coast to coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought always on call.</v>

2177
01:54:17.301 --> 01:54:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it 237 times.</v>

2178
01:54:19.491 --> 01:54:22.010
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they call me the human computer.</v>

2179
01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:24.500
<v Speaker 1>So cause they can ask me questions about</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2180
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Did you do it during the art bell days</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well?</v>

2181
01:54:26.241 --> 01:54:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but art would have me on for four to</v>

2182
01:54:28.071 --> 01:54:32.090
<v Speaker 1>five hours and that was a hoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was really a hoot.</v>

2183
01:54:32.150 --> 01:54:35.930
<v Speaker 1>I did his show once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a highlight of my life.</v>

2184
01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Well art was one of the most energetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk show host you've ever seen in your</v>

2185
01:54:40.311 --> 01:54:41.480
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have that guy.</v>

2186
01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:45.020
<v Speaker 1>So he would call at four in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>afternoon and he'd say,</v>

2187
01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:47.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to look at this website.</v>

2188
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:49.760
<v Speaker 1>So I go look at the website and call me</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at it.</v>

2189
01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:52.250
<v Speaker 1>So I'd call him again and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2190
01:54:52.251 --> 01:54:55.730
<v Speaker 1>now look at this website now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gradually I got the idea that he was</v>

2191
01:54:55.731 --> 01:55:00.731
<v Speaker 1>trying to tell me that there were extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>galactic civilizations and that they</v>

2192
01:55:01.161 --> 01:55:04.820
<v Speaker 1>were coming to earth and signaling us</v>
<v Speaker 1>through crop circles and a whole bunch</v>

2193
01:55:04.821 --> 01:55:07.550
<v Speaker 1>of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was the way he did it.</v>

2194
01:55:07.610 --> 01:55:10.130
<v Speaker 1>He did it with such energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lit a fire in you.</v>

2195
01:55:10.490 --> 01:55:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you totally disagreed with</v>

2196
01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:16.160
<v Speaker 1>everything he was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lit that fire.</v>

2197
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I used to drive home from the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>store at night,</v>

2198
01:55:18.261 --> 01:55:19.850
<v Speaker 1>and it was the only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the only things that I would</v>

2199
01:55:19.851 --> 01:55:22.970
<v Speaker 1>listen to because it was am radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would get it from a,</v>

2200
01:55:22.971 --> 01:55:26.750
<v Speaker 1>believe it was a San Diego station and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could usually get it better late at</v>

2201
01:55:26.751 --> 01:55:27.560
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2202
01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:28.820
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be like one o'clock in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

2203
01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:31.850
<v Speaker 1>I was driving into the valley and I'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to the coast to coast with art</v>

2204
01:55:31.851 --> 01:55:32.571
<v Speaker 1>bell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2205
01:55:32.571 --> 01:55:35.660
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people that came to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a lot of people did that.</v>

2206
01:55:35.690 --> 01:55:38.900
<v Speaker 1>A lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of intellectuals do that as their</v>

2207
01:55:38.901 --> 01:55:43.901
<v Speaker 1>secret sin and because they're awake</v>
<v Speaker 1>late at night and there's nothing</v>

2208
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:48.120
<v Speaker 3>else really on the radio and this at</v>
<v Speaker 3>least teases a little bit of your brain.</v>

2209
01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:52.410
<v Speaker 3>So I do global,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do global history,</v>

2210
01:55:52.411 --> 01:55:56.400
<v Speaker 3>I do global geopolitics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a geoeconomics.</v>

2211
01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:58.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do psychology,</v>

2212
01:55:58.891 --> 01:56:01.560
<v Speaker 3>I do murders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do bacteria.</v>

2213
01:56:01.561 --> 01:56:06.561
<v Speaker 3>I do stars do your own show while I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the guy who created the show with art</v>

2214
01:56:07.441 --> 01:56:09.570
<v Speaker 3>bell who created coast to coast with art</v>
<v Speaker 3>bell,</v>

2215
01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:13.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to do a radio show where I can</v>

2216
01:56:13.141 --> 01:56:14.940
<v Speaker 3>have as many nights of the week as I</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted.</v>

2217
01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:19.170
<v Speaker 3>And the guy who wrote conversations with</v>
<v Speaker 3>God would have the other nights.</v>

2218
01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:21.240
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you just do a podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>

2219
01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:21.791
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

2220
01:56:21.791 --> 01:56:23.550
<v Speaker 3>not a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a youtube.</v>

2221
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:24.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2222
01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:26.430
<v Speaker 3>Thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you put it out as a podcast as</v>

2223
01:56:26.431 --> 01:56:27.870
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just take the audio from it.</v>

2224
01:56:27.930 --> 01:56:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have very little time in which to do</v>

2225
01:56:30.361 --> 01:56:33.300
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I know how to put it up on youtube</v>

2226
01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:35.220
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't get that many hits.</v>

2227
01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:38.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to do Tj Kincaid,</v>

2228
01:56:38.071 --> 01:56:40.140
<v Speaker 3>the show with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amazing atheist.</v>

2229
01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:41.611
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2230
01:56:41.611 --> 01:56:44.930
<v Speaker 3>he's fabulous and six foot eight or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2231
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:45.783
<v Speaker 3>He's a good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

2232
01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like him too.</v>

2233
01:56:46.891 --> 01:56:50.250
<v Speaker 3>And so he had me on for two years</v>
<v Speaker 3>running and then said,</v>

2234
01:56:50.251 --> 01:56:53.100
<v Speaker 3>you've got to start your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started up my own and he of course</v>

2235
01:56:53.101 --> 01:56:57.690
<v Speaker 3>at this point has 950,000 subscribers or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2236
01:56:57.990 --> 01:57:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I have 13,400 subscribers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try to pump you up.</v>

2237
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:03.360
<v Speaker 3>That will be neat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be terrific.</v>

2238
01:57:03.361 --> 01:57:06.030
<v Speaker 3>You really should do your own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not difficult to do.</v>

2239
01:57:06.090 --> 01:57:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once it gets set up,</v>

2240
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:09.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fairly easy.</v>

2241
01:57:09.770 --> 01:57:11.960
<v Speaker 3>Recorder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd have to set me up out.</v>

2242
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.230
<v Speaker 3>Meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2243
01:57:13.590 --> 01:57:17.280
<v Speaker 3>but look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm I buzz Aldrin said 12 years ago.</v>

2244
01:57:17.281 --> 01:57:21.660
<v Speaker 3>We've got a presidential election coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and we've got to try to get space on</v>

2245
01:57:21.661 --> 01:57:25.500
<v Speaker 3>the agenda of the things that candidates</v>
<v Speaker 3>are talking about.</v>

2246
01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:27.420
<v Speaker 3>We've got two years in which to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

2247
01:57:27.421 --> 01:57:29.010
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll form a group to do that.</v>

2248
01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:31.770
<v Speaker 3>So do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you this,</v>

2249
01:57:31.771 --> 01:57:34.770
<v Speaker 3>because you're this big coast to coast</v>
<v Speaker 3>Art Bell Fan,</v>

2250
01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:39.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much of that Ufo stuff do you pay</v>

2251
01:57:39.751 --> 01:57:40.930
<v Speaker 3>attention to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>None.</v>

2252
01:57:40.990 --> 01:57:42.180
<v Speaker 3>None.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero.</v>

2253
01:57:42.181 --> 01:57:46.740
<v Speaker 3>When when people contact me on Linkedin</v>
<v Speaker 3>and their major credential as they do us</v>

2254
01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:49.980
<v Speaker 3>a Ufo magazine or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't add them.</v>

2255
01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:53.160
<v Speaker 3>I used to love that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was so interesting and</v>

2256
01:57:53.161 --> 01:57:55.200
<v Speaker 3>intriguing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell us I started actually paying</v>

2257
01:57:55.201 --> 01:57:56.110
<v Speaker 3>attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2258
01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:59.100
<v Speaker 3>And I started interviewing some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that involved in the movement.</v>

2259
01:57:59.310 --> 01:58:01.080
<v Speaker 3>You find the same thing over and over</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2260
01:58:01.081 --> 01:58:06.081
<v Speaker 3>This just wanton disregard for reality</v>
<v Speaker 3>is absolute desire to prove something</v>

2261
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:13.410
<v Speaker 3>instead of looking at the objective</v>
<v Speaker 3>facts that proving that aliens are real,</v>

2262
01:58:13.411 --> 01:58:18.120
<v Speaker 3>proving that we've been contacted these</v>
<v Speaker 3>eye witness testimonies are legitimate.</v>

2263
01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:20.910
<v Speaker 3>Let me try to get across a weird idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2264
01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2265
01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:25.680
<v Speaker 3>once upon a time in the 1940s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were two guys,</v>

2266
01:58:25.681 --> 01:58:27.420
<v Speaker 3>Connor Lorenza,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Niko Tinbergen,</v>

2267
01:58:27.421 --> 01:58:30.240
<v Speaker 3>who got a Nobel prize for inventing a</v>
<v Speaker 3>field called pathology,</v>

2268
01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:33.390
<v Speaker 3>which is a certain kind of observation</v>
<v Speaker 3>of animal behavior.</v>

2269
01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:38.900
<v Speaker 3>And Niko Tinbergen will go off to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>coastal cliffs around northern Europe</v>

2270
01:58:40.530 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 3>and he would observe</v>

2271
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:44.230
<v Speaker 1>the seabirds and the seabirds will go</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

2272
01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 30 40 miles and outs of the ocean to</v>

2273
01:58:49.091 --> 01:58:50.800
<v Speaker 1>feed and bring back food for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

2274
01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:53.770
<v Speaker 1>And then they would come back at the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the day and their desks,</v>

2275
01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:55.810
<v Speaker 1>they'd have 200 nests next to each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

2276
01:58:56.170 --> 01:59:00.880
<v Speaker 1>but the ness had very low walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the seabird came back from her</v>

2277
01:59:00.881 --> 01:59:05.680
<v Speaker 1>fishing and waddled herself into place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving her hind back and forth to get in</v>

2278
01:59:05.681 --> 01:59:09.550
<v Speaker 1>place to incubator chicks to warm the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs,</v>

2279
01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:14.860
<v Speaker 1>she'd often knock an egg out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when the egg was knocked out of the</v>

2280
01:59:14.861 --> 01:59:18.300
<v Speaker 1>nest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bird would reach her beak out past</v>

2281
01:59:18.301 --> 01:59:23.301
<v Speaker 1>the egg and then pull her beak back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards your chest to pull the egg</v>

2282
01:59:23.441 --> 01:59:27.430
<v Speaker 1>toward the nest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she do it over and over again until</v>

2283
01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:30.890
<v Speaker 1>she got the egg in the nest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Niko Tinbergen have this word idea.</v>

2284
01:59:30.890 --> 01:59:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I wish I knew where it came from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a reflux.</v>

2285
01:59:33.971 --> 01:59:36.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when your doctor takes a hammer and</v>

2286
01:59:36.371 --> 01:59:40.540
<v Speaker 1>hammers your knee and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your black shoots out and you had</v>

2287
01:59:40.541 --> 01:59:43.510
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He figured this is the same kind of a</v>

2288
01:59:43.511 --> 01:59:48.511
<v Speaker 1>reflex and he figured that if you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflex you need a trigger for the</v>

2289
01:59:49.391 --> 01:59:51.160
<v Speaker 1>reflex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that Patellar Hammer,</v>

2290
01:59:51.161 --> 01:59:54.790
<v Speaker 1>that hammer journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he looked to see if there was a</v>

2291
01:59:54.791 --> 01:59:59.791
<v Speaker 1>trigger that triggered this yanking your</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat back on in order to scoop the ag</v>

2292
02:00:00.641 --> 02:00:04.930
<v Speaker 1>back into the nest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he tried building artificial eggs to</v>

2293
02:00:04.931 --> 02:00:09.220
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find out what the cues</v>
<v Speaker 1>were in the ag that were causing this</v>

2294
02:00:09.221 --> 02:00:13.180
<v Speaker 1>reaction in the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally he got a super vague,</v>

2295
02:00:13.930 --> 02:00:16.120
<v Speaker 1>which means I knew it was bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the normal ag.</v>

2296
02:00:16.150 --> 02:00:20.380
<v Speaker 1>It was browner than the normal ag and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd put the real egg.</v>

2297
02:00:20.590 --> 02:00:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Now if you're the bird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that real egg has your genetic legacy.</v>

2298
02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:28.000
<v Speaker 1>It's your genetic future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot is riding on that egg.</v>

2299
02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>A lot of you and the phony egg and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phony ag would attract the bird so</v>

2300
02:00:35.591 --> 02:00:39.760
<v Speaker 1>strongly that she would ignore her own</v>
<v Speaker 1>egg and Yank,</v>

2301
02:00:39.790 --> 02:00:40.571
<v Speaker 1>Yank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yank.</v>

2302
02:00:40.571 --> 02:00:45.010
<v Speaker 1>With her beak until she pulled the phony</v>
<v Speaker 1>egg into the nest and they continued to</v>

2303
02:00:45.011 --> 02:00:47.680
<v Speaker 1>do research with this kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they discovered that they could</v>

2304
02:00:47.681 --> 02:00:52.681
<v Speaker 1>trick some songbirds into taking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball into their nest.</v>

2305
02:00:53.530 --> 02:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>And then when the poor little birds</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to get on top of the basketball to</v>

2306
02:00:57.141 --> 02:01:00.010
<v Speaker 1>incubate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would slide off and they'd be very</v>

2307
02:01:00.011 --> 02:01:03.160
<v Speaker 1>frustrated and they would climb back on</v>
<v Speaker 1>again and slide off again.</v>

2308
02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>It was cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the phony eggs like fake tits,</v>

2309
02:01:06.730 --> 02:01:08.980
<v Speaker 1>those are things called supernormal</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimuli.</v>

2310
02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:12.880
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that they bring these</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflexive reactions.</v>

2311
02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well underlying what Adolf Hitler was</v>

2312
02:01:15.341 --> 02:01:18.520
<v Speaker 1>doing underlying what I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing on that stage,</v>

2313
02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:21.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying what you do in front of an</v>

2314
02:01:21.611 --> 02:01:26.500
<v Speaker 1>audience when you get incandescents and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose yourself and something else talks</v>

2315
02:01:26.501 --> 02:01:28.030
<v Speaker 1>through you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2316
02:01:28.210 --> 02:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>all that is related to some super normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern in us.</v>

2317
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>So Hitler was basically saying the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>is about to end and the Kingdom of God</v>

2318
02:01:39.681 --> 02:01:44.681
<v Speaker 1>is coming except the Kingdom of God in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his case was the world will be</v>

2319
02:01:45.231 --> 02:01:49.490
<v Speaker 1>controlled by the master race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blonde and blue eyed ariens.</v>

2320
02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>And all other people will be slave</v>
<v Speaker 1>people or will be exterminated.</v>

2321
02:01:55.450 --> 02:01:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was this golden paradise that he</v>

2322
02:01:58.851 --> 02:02:01.850
<v Speaker 1>was inviting the Germans too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which they ruled the world because</v>

2323
02:02:01.851 --> 02:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>they were born to rule the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did you describe the stimulation?</v>

2324
02:02:05.271 --> 02:02:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Super supernormal stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the silver tsunami,</v>

2325
02:02:08.490 --> 02:02:13.340
<v Speaker 1>still a stimulus of this artificial egg</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like supernormal stimulus of this</v>

2326
02:02:13.341 --> 02:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>extreme behavior at the podium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2327
02:02:17.010 --> 02:02:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Attract people in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically Hitler was saying,</v>

2328
02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:25.640
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about the equivalent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>extra terrestrials.</v>

2329
02:02:25.641 --> 02:02:28.280
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about this magic quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Germans.</v>

2330
02:02:28.281 --> 02:02:33.050
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about the shared soul of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans and how the people in Wagner</v>

2331
02:02:33.051 --> 02:02:34.520
<v Speaker 1>operas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2332
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:39.790
<v Speaker 1>and the gods of the old Germans had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the souls of these people and he was</v>

2333
02:02:40.371 --> 02:02:43.250
<v Speaker 1>evoking the group soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Zeitgeists.</v>

2334
02:02:43.730 --> 02:02:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2335
02:02:44.841 --> 02:02:49.841
<v Speaker 1>in this case is the Volk geist the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit of a people and the flying saucer</v>

2336
02:02:51.231 --> 02:02:55.970
<v Speaker 1>people are after an end of the world in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the world will be remade.</v>

2337
02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:01.040
<v Speaker 1>And a guy named while there was a Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid from a backward town,</v>

2338
02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:04.160
<v Speaker 1>a really backward town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll only had been trained in</v>

2339
02:03:04.161 --> 02:03:07.190
<v Speaker 1>manual skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he started preaching and he preached</v>

2340
02:03:07.191 --> 02:03:10.100
<v Speaker 1>that the world was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we know it was about to end,</v>

2341
02:03:10.101 --> 02:03:12.170
<v Speaker 1>and we were about to enter a new kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise.</v>

2342
02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>And because he was Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he figured it's got to happen at</v>

2343
02:03:16.181 --> 02:03:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Passover because of Passover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put out a cup for Elijah and Elijah</v>

2344
02:03:20.691 --> 02:03:23.630
<v Speaker 1>is there to proceed the savior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2345
02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:26.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who will save the Jewish people.</v>

2346
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:31.160
<v Speaker 1>So he went up to the holiest city in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judaism to Jerusalem,</v>

2347
02:03:31.490 --> 02:03:33.740
<v Speaker 1>and he had a dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2348
02:03:33.770 --> 02:03:37.640
<v Speaker 1>the Passover dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they put out the cop and that's when</v>

2349
02:03:37.641 --> 02:03:39.740
<v Speaker 1>the Kingdom of God was supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrive.</v>

2350
02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:44.210
<v Speaker 1>His prediction of a kingdom of God</v>
<v Speaker 1>arriving at that particular Passover</v>

2351
02:03:44.211 --> 02:03:47.300
<v Speaker 1>ceremony turned out to be utterly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

2352
02:03:47.301 --> 02:03:52.301
<v Speaker 1>the Romans seized him and nailed him to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cross and he died.</v>

2353
02:03:54.090 --> 02:03:56.390
<v Speaker 1>It was the opposite of everything he</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted,</v>

2354
02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:00.500
<v Speaker 1>but the religion he'd put together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the religion really that Paul put</v>

2355
02:04:00.501 --> 02:04:04.460
<v Speaker 1>together because Paul was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>international figure.</v>

2356
02:04:04.461 --> 02:04:07.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was comfortable in the global world</v>

2357
02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:08.720
<v Speaker 1>of the Roman Empire.</v>

2358
02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:14.200
<v Speaker 1>But what Paul put together around Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a supernormal stimulus and it evoked</v>

2359
02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:20.690
<v Speaker 1>a super normal response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a supernormal reflex and the flying</v>

2360
02:04:20.691 --> 02:04:23.300
<v Speaker 1>saucer ideas that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2361
02:04:23.330 --> 02:04:26.840
<v Speaker 1>here we are on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's this brace that's above us</v>

2362
02:04:27.230 --> 02:04:29.430
<v Speaker 1>that can save us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2363
02:04:30.230 --> 02:04:34.200
<v Speaker 1>that's pushing at the same buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2364
02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Hitler was pushing at the same buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world as know it was about and when</v>

2365
02:04:38.221 --> 02:04:40.740
<v Speaker 1>there's a new paradise and while the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans will rule everything,</v>

2366
02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:45.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we are built to receive certain kinds</v>

2367
02:04:45.181 --> 02:04:48.660
<v Speaker 1>of stimuli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God knows how we got built that way.</v>

2368
02:04:49.050 --> 02:04:53.490
<v Speaker 1>And when I went out in quest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecstatic of God that God's inside of us,</v>

2369
02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:57.980
<v Speaker 1>that the age of 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for that super normal,</v>

2370
02:04:57.990 --> 02:05:02.990
<v Speaker 1>those super normal responses in us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the supernormal stimuli that have</v>

2371
02:05:03.611 --> 02:05:05.760
<v Speaker 1>oic them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're doing art,</v>

2372
02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:08.340
<v Speaker 1>when you were doing commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing comedy,</v>

2373
02:05:08.970 --> 02:05:13.770
<v Speaker 1>you are hitting the buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are creating supernormal stimuli,</v>

2374
02:05:13.771 --> 02:05:18.771
<v Speaker 1>you are testing out jokes until they</v>
<v Speaker 1>reached just the right shape and you</v>

2375
02:05:18.901 --> 02:05:22.050
<v Speaker 1>know what you can feel in the audience</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that shape is and then you repeat</v>

2376
02:05:22.051 --> 02:05:24.720
<v Speaker 1>that shape knowing what its impact is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be on the audience.</v>

2377
02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a new book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2378
02:05:29.070 --> 02:05:31.260
<v Speaker 1>it took me a long time to write all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my previous books,</v>

2379
02:05:31.261 --> 02:05:33.140
<v Speaker 1>including how I accidentally started the</v>
<v Speaker 1>60s.</v>

2380
02:05:33.210 --> 02:05:36.150
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't the same 1995 manuscript.</v>

2381
02:05:36.151 --> 02:05:40.410
<v Speaker 1>I had 20 years of additional processing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was able to put a lot more meaning</v>

2382
02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:43.620
<v Speaker 1>and to the book and hopefully it's still</v>
<v Speaker 1>really funny.</v>

2383
02:05:44.190 --> 02:05:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was able to write a book in six</v>

2384
02:05:46.981 --> 02:05:51.600
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first draft of 178,000 word book and</v>

2385
02:05:51.601 --> 02:05:56.601
<v Speaker 1>a normal book is 90,000 words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is almost twice the length of a</v>

2386
02:05:56.761 --> 02:05:59.250
<v Speaker 1>normal book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was able to do it because I had</v>

2387
02:05:59.251 --> 02:06:04.251
<v Speaker 1>told all the stories in the book and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had felt out how the audiences responded</v>

2388
02:06:04.650 --> 02:06:09.270
<v Speaker 1>to the stories and I knew the words to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use and they were a well worn path in my</v>

2389
02:06:09.271 --> 02:06:14.271
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I simply put down on paper an oral</v>

2390
02:06:14.461 --> 02:06:19.461
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the audience who shapes you by</v>

2391
02:06:19.891 --> 02:06:23.070
<v Speaker 1>giving you feedback and eventually you</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect something.</v>

2392
02:06:23.071 --> 02:06:25.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's like Niko Tinbergen Super Egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2393
02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:28.290
<v Speaker 1>newport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Niko Tinbergen was a eventually able to</v>

2394
02:06:28.291 --> 02:06:32.160
<v Speaker 1>make egg super eggs that had dayglo on</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2395
02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:37.410
<v Speaker 1>had polka dots on them that were absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they still had the ability,</v>

2396
02:06:37.470 --> 02:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>the way that flying saucer myths have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to evoke the sense that</v>

2397
02:06:42.751 --> 02:06:45.750
<v Speaker 1>there is a paradise beyond the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we know.</v>

2398
02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think when you think of</v>
<v Speaker 2>supernormal stimulus that when you see,</v>

2399
02:06:50.170 --> 02:06:50.921
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2400
02:06:50.921 --> 02:06:54.130
<v Speaker 2>like a preacher on the pulpit that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming with confidence.</v>

2401
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:59.310
<v Speaker 2>When you see any of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even when it comes to fake breasts,</v>

2402
02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:02.440
<v Speaker 2>like you're seeing something like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what you want,</v>

2403
02:07:02.441 --> 02:07:06.940
<v Speaker 2>you want a woman to be uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good at bearing children,</v>

2404
02:07:06.941 --> 02:07:09.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To have the right hip to waist ratio,</v>

2405
02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:12.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she's a designed to breastfeed.</v>

2406
02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:16.120
<v Speaker 2>She has large press even though you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fake,</v>

2407
02:07:16.330 --> 02:07:19.480
<v Speaker 2>it's still hits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that genetic button is inside</v>

2408
02:07:19.481 --> 02:07:24.460
<v Speaker 2>of your head and the alien theme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea behind it,</v>

2409
02:07:24.461 --> 02:07:26.620
<v Speaker 2>the archetype is kind of like Space</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daddy,</v>

2410
02:07:26.730 --> 02:07:27.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2411
02:07:27.611 --> 02:07:28.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we're stupid,</v>

2412
02:07:28.991 --> 02:07:31.630
<v Speaker 2>but just like this guy who is screaming</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the pope,</v>

2413
02:07:31.631 --> 02:07:35.800
<v Speaker 2>it has all the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like thank God someone has all the we'll</v>

2414
02:07:35.801 --> 02:07:36.340
<v Speaker 2>space</v>

2415
02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:39.490
<v Speaker 1>daddy is for the atheists space daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for the people that,</v>

2416
02:07:39.491 --> 02:07:41.110
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've listened to all these people down</v>

2417
02:07:41.111 --> 02:07:42.820
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're full of shit,</v>

2418
02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:46.720
<v Speaker 1>but space daddy's going to help us out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While that's the general idea,</v>

2419
02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:47.820
<v Speaker 1>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2420
02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:49.210
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

2421
02:07:49.211 --> 02:07:51.730
<v Speaker 1>when you fashioned a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fashioning it to be a supernormal</v>

2422
02:07:51.731 --> 02:07:56.020
<v Speaker 1>stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But space daddy might be real.</v>

2423
02:07:56.021 --> 02:08:01.021
<v Speaker 1>Some were because we're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers as a science person.</v>

2424
02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2425
02:08:02.290 --> 02:08:05.590
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell you that there's only one</v>
<v Speaker 1>place in which we've ever discovered any</v>

2426
02:08:05.591 --> 02:08:07.330
<v Speaker 1>evidence of life and it's down here on</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

2427
02:08:07.331 --> 02:08:12.100
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a skeptic about life being</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere now changing to a different</v>

2428
02:08:12.101 --> 02:08:15.850
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this thing that I call a super</v>

2429
02:08:15.851 --> 02:08:20.851
<v Speaker 1>simultaneity super synchrony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when the universe starts as a</v>

2430
02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:25.810
<v Speaker 1>rapidly expanding sheet of nothing but</v>
<v Speaker 1>space and time,</v>

2431
02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:27.040
<v Speaker 1>it space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and speed,</v>

2432
02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:27.933
<v Speaker 1>that's all it is.</v>

2433
02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:33.510
<v Speaker 1>And when it precipitates in quarks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is unlikely house,</v>

2434
02:08:35.290 --> 02:08:37.860
<v Speaker 1>how can space time and speed become</v>
<v Speaker 1>particles?</v>

2435
02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:38.703
<v Speaker 1>Quarks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2436
02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is that there are only</v>

2437
02:08:40.991 --> 02:08:44.680
<v Speaker 1>something like 16 different forms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those quirks and there are a gazillion</v>

2438
02:08:44.681 --> 02:08:47.710
<v Speaker 1>of identical copies of each quark</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

2439
02:08:47.711 --> 02:08:50.260
<v Speaker 1>And they all sprang into existence at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

2440
02:08:50.830 --> 02:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Fast forward a couple of million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Galaxies all are pretty much the same.</v>

2441
02:08:57.610 --> 02:09:02.610
<v Speaker 1>And all of them spring into existence</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much at the same time,</v>

2442
02:09:03.610 --> 02:09:06.010
<v Speaker 1>at least the first generation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxies,</v>

2443
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:10.990
<v Speaker 1>stars ignite within those galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all following pretty much the same</v>

2444
02:09:10.991 --> 02:09:12.910
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all just big gravity balls.</v>

2445
02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity's gravity balls all the way.</v>

2446
02:09:15.881 --> 02:09:17.440
<v Speaker 1>That's planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's moons,</v>

2447
02:09:17.710 --> 02:09:21.490
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is this tendency for the</v>

2448
02:09:21.491 --> 02:09:25.030
<v Speaker 1>universe to do the same damn thing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much the same damn time,</v>

2449
02:09:25.031 --> 02:09:28.300
<v Speaker 1>pretty much same damned everywhere in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cosmos.</v>

2450
02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:31.660
<v Speaker 1>And we do know that there are bio</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules,</v>

2451
02:09:31.661 --> 02:09:36.340
<v Speaker 1>carbon based molecules being formed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>interstellar,</v>

2452
02:09:36.341 --> 02:09:38.800
<v Speaker 1>cold gas clouds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interstellar,</v>

2453
02:09:38.801 --> 02:09:42.340
<v Speaker 1>hot gas clouds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of unlikely places in the</v>

2454
02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:44.590
<v Speaker 1>cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those are very simple little</v>

2455
02:09:44.591 --> 02:09:47.670
<v Speaker 1>molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though we call them bio molecules</v>

2456
02:09:47.671 --> 02:09:51.040
<v Speaker 1>is simply means I've got carbon life</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on molecules.</v>

2457
02:09:51.041 --> 02:09:53.590
<v Speaker 1>In the case of your genome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we yanked just,</v>

2458
02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:56.350
<v Speaker 1>we took just one cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't miss it.</v>

2459
02:09:56.680 --> 02:09:58.780
<v Speaker 1>You have 100 trillion others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2460
02:09:58.870 --> 02:10:02.970
<v Speaker 1>so we took just one cell from your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we took out the genome,</v>

2461
02:10:02.971 --> 02:10:03.500
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2462
02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:04.710
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prompt,</v>

2463
02:10:04.810 --> 02:10:08.380
<v Speaker 1>what dwells to actually the genome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we took out the genome and we</v>

2464
02:10:08.381 --> 02:10:10.990
<v Speaker 1>stretched it out cause it's all tangled</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the cell.</v>

2465
02:10:11.890 --> 02:10:16.890
<v Speaker 1>It would be three feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a big distance between a tiny</v>

2466
02:10:17.711 --> 02:10:22.711
<v Speaker 1>little molecule of ammonia in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interstellar cloud and that huge,</v>

2467
02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:28.270
<v Speaker 1>very complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly ordered three foot long molecule</v>

2468
02:10:28.271 --> 02:10:31.720
<v Speaker 1>or molecule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single molecule that's your genome.</v>

2469
02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we haven't learned very much at all</v>

2470
02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:39.860
<v Speaker 1>about how you go from the simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules to that incredibly complex</v>

2471
02:10:39.861 --> 02:10:41.960
<v Speaker 1>molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The origin of life is still one of the</v>

2472
02:10:41.961 --> 02:10:43.550
<v Speaker 1>big puzzles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

2473
02:10:43.820 --> 02:10:47.590
<v Speaker 1>because they're super synchrony and</v>
<v Speaker 1>super simultaneity all over the Cosmos</v>

2474
02:10:47.591 --> 02:10:50.810
<v Speaker 1>is pretty much the same thing happens at</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much the same time.</v>

2475
02:10:51.230 --> 02:10:56.230
<v Speaker 1>The odds are that there are millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other planets that have life.</v>

2476
02:10:56.930 --> 02:11:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Those are the odds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I settle out of side because we</v>

2477
02:11:01.401 --> 02:11:05.720
<v Speaker 1>don't have evidence of any life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'd been looking since there.</v>

2478
02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a story that seems to have</v>

2479
02:11:07.791 --> 02:11:12.791
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once upon a time a manager gave me</v>

2480
02:11:14.391 --> 02:11:16.100
<v Speaker 1>an act to work with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was earth,</v>

2481
02:11:16.101 --> 02:11:19.280
<v Speaker 1>wind and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I read all their lyrics,</v>

2482
02:11:19.281 --> 02:11:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I read everything about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I studied them like a Talmudic scholar I</v>

2483
02:11:22.971 --> 02:11:23.804
<v Speaker 1>always did.</v>

2484
02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:28.460
<v Speaker 1>And finally got to their album covers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I got together with,</v>

2485
02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:30.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader of the band,</v>

2486
02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Maurice White for lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2487
02:11:34.220 --> 02:11:37.340
<v Speaker 1>cause I hadn't yet learned to set up my</v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries and tell people,</v>

2488
02:11:37.341 --> 02:11:40.520
<v Speaker 1>only work with you if I can see you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own environment for between one and</v>

2489
02:11:40.521 --> 02:11:43.040
<v Speaker 1>three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't quite at that point yet.</v>

2490
02:11:44.090 --> 02:11:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I sat with my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2491
02:11:45.110 --> 02:11:46.670
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Maurice and said,</v>

2492
02:11:46.671 --> 02:11:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Maurice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I've got you right,</v>

2493
02:11:48.141 --> 02:11:50.780
<v Speaker 1>you believe that approximately 11,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

2494
02:11:50.810 --> 02:11:54.440
<v Speaker 1>people from another civilization</v>
<v Speaker 1>someplace else and now our galaxy or</v>

2495
02:11:54.441 --> 02:11:58.670
<v Speaker 1>beyond or a galaxy came to this earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and brought us all of our technologies</v>

2496
02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:01.940
<v Speaker 1>and left the messages of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies and the pyramids.</v>

2497
02:12:01.941 --> 02:12:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Have I got that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Maurice Smile hold?</v>

2498
02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:10.700
<v Speaker 1>And he said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

2499
02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:14.240
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this scientist from Cornell</v>

2500
02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:18.980
<v Speaker 1>University and he has just had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous success with the science</v>

2501
02:12:18.981 --> 02:12:20.330
<v Speaker 1>series on pbs.</v>

2502
02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:25.540
<v Speaker 1>It's the most watched series pbs has</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever had and he's trying to put together</v>

2503
02:12:25.821 --> 02:12:29.870
<v Speaker 1>an organization to find extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrestrial intelligence.</v>

2504
02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:34.100
<v Speaker 1>So if I introduced the two of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you be willing to do a benefit</v>

2505
02:12:34.101 --> 02:12:36.320
<v Speaker 1>concert for him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because right now he's struggling to get</v>

2506
02:12:36.321 --> 02:12:41.321
<v Speaker 1>money together and Marie said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we tracked down Carl Sagan,</v>

2507
02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:46.910
<v Speaker 1>summer cottage telephone number and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>put together a conference call between</v>

2508
02:12:46.911 --> 02:12:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Maurice White and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

2509
02:12:50.391 --> 02:12:53.870
<v Speaker 1>what's his name again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billions and billions and billions of</v>

2510
02:12:53.871 --> 02:12:55.520
<v Speaker 1>planets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Sagan.</v>

2511
02:12:55.670 --> 02:12:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2512
02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:01.190
<v Speaker 1>as soon as carl got wind of where</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maurice was coming from,</v>

2513
02:13:01.730 --> 02:13:06.730
<v Speaker 1>pseudoscience conversation was over</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Karl was already gambling too</v>

2514
02:13:07.281 --> 02:13:11.150
<v Speaker 1>much on ideas that could get them</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally laughed out of science.</v>

2515
02:13:12.170 --> 02:13:14.610
<v Speaker 1>So it was unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's ever,</v>

2516
02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:18.680
<v Speaker 1>that was the early 1980s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably about nine,</v>

2517
02:13:18.710 --> 02:13:20.450
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably about 1980.</v>

2518
02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Didn't you want to just sit down with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maurice and sort of explain what we know</v>

2519
02:13:23.961 --> 02:13:24.470
<v Speaker 1>so far?</v>

2520
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:26.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't afford stuff based on was it</v>

2521
02:13:26.931 --> 02:13:28.370
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2522
02:13:28.371 --> 02:13:30.170
<v Speaker 1>it's all kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's everywhere.</v>

2523
02:13:30.650 --> 02:13:32.610
<v Speaker 1>You can find it all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did it make?</v>

2524
02:13:32.730 --> 02:13:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Did he have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a source?</v>

2525
02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that I asked him.</v>

2526
02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was too busy trying to put this,</v>

2527
02:13:38.511 --> 02:13:39.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing together.</v>

2528
02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:41.490
<v Speaker 1>And it was unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2529
02:13:41.491 --> 02:13:44.250
<v Speaker 1>It would have been neat if the two of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them had been able to sit down and talk.</v>

2530
02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:45.750
<v Speaker 1>But Carl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

2531
02:13:45.751 --> 02:13:47.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he had,</v>

2532
02:13:47.250 --> 02:13:52.250
<v Speaker 1>because his first wife Lynn Margulis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the National Academy of Science Award</v>

2533
02:13:53.101 --> 02:13:58.101
<v Speaker 1>winner and I became friends and she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind enough to almost mentor me and</v>

2534
02:13:58.501 --> 02:14:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Dorian Sagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Sagan,</v>

2535
02:14:00.001 --> 02:14:04.050
<v Speaker 1>his oldest son has been a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an absolutely brilliant science</v>

2536
02:14:04.051 --> 02:14:05.640
<v Speaker 1>writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You read his essays,</v>

2537
02:14:05.641 --> 02:14:08.010
<v Speaker 1>they change your perception of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

2538
02:14:08.430 --> 02:14:10.310
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2539
02:14:11.370 --> 02:14:15.990
<v Speaker 1>just by having the television show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people in quote legitimate science,</v>

2540
02:14:15.991 --> 02:14:19.590
<v Speaker 1>we're saying Carl's not a legitimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist as a whole television show.</v>

2541
02:14:19.650 --> 02:14:21.670
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he's getting more attention than</v>

2542
02:14:21.690 --> 02:14:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I am now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would never admit that.</v>

2543
02:14:23.221 --> 02:14:26.850
<v Speaker 1>That's really what was in their hearts</v>
<v Speaker 1>from people about Neil degrasse Tyson.</v>

2544
02:14:26.851 --> 02:14:28.590
<v Speaker 1>And I've heard the exact same thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>

2545
02:14:28.591 --> 02:14:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And the question is whether Neil</v>
<v Speaker 1>degrasse Tyson was ever,</v>

2546
02:14:31.650 --> 02:14:32.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scientist,</v>

2547
02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:35.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he's primarily been a showman most</v>

2548
02:14:35.821 --> 02:14:37.770
<v Speaker 1>of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you should see him.</v>

2549
02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2550
02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:43.440
<v Speaker 1>when did I see him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2551
02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:46.440
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was at God knows what event and why.</v>

2552
02:14:46.441 --> 02:14:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I was probably there because a friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>was giving a sold out lecture at the</v>

2553
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:54.090
<v Speaker 1>American Museum of natural history and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't realize that I'm Neil degrasse</v>

2554
02:14:54.091 --> 02:14:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Tyson was going to show up and when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>showed up on stage,</v>

2555
02:14:57.151 --> 02:15:00.390
<v Speaker 1>because I consider myself competing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them because I've always wanted my own</v>

2556
02:15:00.391 --> 02:15:04.590
<v Speaker 1>television series and Neil has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead of me on everything and I'm older</v>

2557
02:15:04.591 --> 02:15:05.424
<v Speaker 1>than he is.</v>

2558
02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:06.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2559
02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:12.090
<v Speaker 1>the little pieces of grit that we pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and carry in her shoes and walk with.</v>

2560
02:15:12.330 --> 02:15:15.090
<v Speaker 1>So at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him on stage,</v>

2561
02:15:15.150 --> 02:15:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That man is astonishing on stage.</v>

2562
02:15:19.710 --> 02:15:24.540
<v Speaker 1>He's beyond your imaginings onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went up when it was over and it was</v>

2563
02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:28.890
<v Speaker 1>buzz Aldrin who had originally</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced us via email and said,</v>

2564
02:15:28.891 --> 02:15:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy that Buzz Aldrin introduced</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to 12 years ago,</v>

2565
02:15:31.981 --> 02:15:34.650
<v Speaker 1>who's been emailing you every once in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while ever since.</v>

2566
02:15:34.890 --> 02:15:37.230
<v Speaker 1>And he was in the middle of a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people who wanted to take</v>

2567
02:15:37.231 --> 02:15:38.790
<v Speaker 1>selfies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get a lot of graphs setting</v>

2568
02:15:38.791 --> 02:15:41.700
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take selfies and there were lined</v>

2569
02:15:41.701 --> 02:15:45.900
<v Speaker 1>up to get selfies with Neil degrasse</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyson and Neil degrasse Tyson turned his</v>

2570
02:15:45.901 --> 02:15:47.640
<v Speaker 1>back on all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not right.</v>

2571
02:15:47.641 --> 02:15:49.380
<v Speaker 1>This is not proper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not polite.</v>

2572
02:15:49.770 --> 02:15:53.190
<v Speaker 1>In order to give me a lecture about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard it had been to make himself into a</v>

2573
02:15:53.191 --> 02:15:54.570
<v Speaker 1>showman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it looks easy,</v>

2574
02:15:54.571 --> 02:15:58.380
<v Speaker 1>but it takes decades of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2575
02:15:58.381 --> 02:16:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I appreciated him giving me the little</v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture,</v>

2576
02:16:00.331 --> 02:16:03.090
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people were waiting for him.</v>

2577
02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:06.420
<v Speaker 1>But he is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we talk about that incandescent</v>

2578
02:16:06.421 --> 02:16:09.810
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go transcendent onstage and you</v>

2579
02:16:10.020 --> 02:16:13.740
<v Speaker 1>become an empty pipe through which</v>
<v Speaker 1>something speaks through you,</v>

2580
02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:16.710
<v Speaker 1>even though they're words that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought out for years,</v>

2581
02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:19.980
<v Speaker 1>but all of a sudden they're speaking in</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves through you.</v>

2582
02:16:20.430 --> 02:16:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how it's the essence of the forces</v>

2583
02:16:23.641 --> 02:16:26.460
<v Speaker 1>of history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ability to give people the sense</v>

2584
02:16:26.461 --> 02:16:29.160
<v Speaker 1>that they've been yanked out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and are a part,</v>

2585
02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:34.180
<v Speaker 1>something bigger than themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the super normal reflex that is</v>

2586
02:16:34.181 --> 02:16:37.690
<v Speaker 1>the most profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the one that grabs history by</v>

2587
02:16:37.691 --> 02:16:40.090
<v Speaker 1>the balls and changes its direction and</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>

2588
02:16:40.091 --> 02:16:42.820
<v Speaker 1>wind and fire had that with music and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they certainly did.</v>

2589
02:16:42.820 --> 02:16:46.570
<v Speaker 1>They just didn't have it when it came to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the understanding of civilizations from</v>

2590
02:16:46.571 --> 02:16:47.920
<v Speaker 1>11,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2591
02:16:47.921 --> 02:16:51.100
<v Speaker 1>That specialty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you and I specialize in the</v>

2592
02:16:51.101 --> 02:16:54.640
<v Speaker 1>things we do in order to add to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>collective mind that enriches the people</v>

2593
02:16:54.641 --> 02:16:56.620
<v Speaker 1>around us and us too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2594
02:16:56.621 --> 02:17:00.790
<v Speaker 1>that is so attractive to people to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we got it from somewhere else.</v>

2595
02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly because no individual creates the</v>

2596
02:17:06.161 --> 02:17:07.480
<v Speaker 1>stone tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2597
02:17:07.481 --> 02:17:09.430
<v Speaker 1>there may be an individual who did it</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

2598
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:14.410
<v Speaker 1>but then it takes off the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>gazillions of particles of identical</v>

2599
02:17:14.411 --> 02:17:17.260
<v Speaker 1>kinds show up all across the face of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmos.</v>

2600
02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:20.710
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hits the Zeitgeists with just the</v>

2601
02:17:20.711 --> 02:17:24.850
<v Speaker 1>right supernormal stimulus and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden it takes off.</v>

2602
02:17:25.090 --> 02:17:28.780
<v Speaker 1>And we're all aware of the fact that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do this and we're all aware of</v>

2603
02:17:28.781 --> 02:17:31.780
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there is some super normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

2604
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't realize that it's we who</v>

2605
02:17:35.801 --> 02:17:40.801
<v Speaker 1>are the neurons and in the same way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred billion our arts now 86</v>

2606
02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:43.960
<v Speaker 1>billion as the figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got 86 billion neurons in your</v>

2607
02:17:43.961 --> 02:17:45.130
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2608
02:17:45.131 --> 02:17:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I got news for your Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The folks in science are saying that 86</v>

2609
02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:51.190
<v Speaker 1>billion neurons as you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bloody miracle and they're</v>

2610
02:17:51.191 --> 02:17:53.650
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a bloody miracle that or Joe Rogan</v>

2611
02:17:53.651 --> 02:17:56.770
<v Speaker 1>emerges from 86 billion neurons working</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

2612
02:17:57.340 --> 02:18:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Bod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more than 86 billion neurons</v>

2613
02:18:00.221 --> 02:18:03.610
<v Speaker 1>working together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're 86 billion neurons working with 7</v>

2614
02:18:03.610 --> 02:18:07.930
<v Speaker 1>billion fellow human beings and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole bacterial world and the plant</v>

2615
02:18:07.931 --> 02:18:11.800
<v Speaker 1>world and the animal world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all contributing to who you are</v>

2616
02:18:11.890 --> 02:18:15.580
<v Speaker 1>minute by minute by minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we are individual cells in this</v>

2617
02:18:15.581 --> 02:18:18.340
<v Speaker 1>collective brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that individual neurons who are</v>

2618
02:18:18.370 --> 02:18:20.710
<v Speaker 1>individually quite stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2619
02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:25.090
<v Speaker 1>are part of the collective brain that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Joe Rogan or Howard Bloom or anybody</v>

2620
02:18:25.091 --> 02:18:28.180
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's such an attractive subject that</v>

2621
02:18:28.181 --> 02:18:29.980
<v Speaker 1>you have these shows like ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens,</v>

2622
02:18:30.010 --> 02:18:30.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2623
02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like one of the longest running</v>

2624
02:18:32.531 --> 02:18:35.650
<v Speaker 1>shows in the history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well because it,</v>

2625
02:18:35.651 --> 02:18:37.870
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we,</v>

2626
02:18:38.390 --> 02:18:43.060
<v Speaker 1>we become is something larger than</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

2627
02:18:43.061 --> 02:18:48.061
<v Speaker 1>It's much larger than ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there is something that's super</v>

2628
02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:49.840
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2629
02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:52.450
<v Speaker 1>and we can think of it as something</v>
<v Speaker 1>supernatural,</v>

2630
02:18:52.690 --> 02:18:55.270
<v Speaker 1>but we ache,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ache for salvation.</v>

2631
02:18:55.840 --> 02:18:58.120
<v Speaker 1>And I tried to tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a book called the genius of the</v>

2632
02:18:58.121 --> 02:18:59.950
<v Speaker 1>beast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a radical revision of capitalism.</v>

2633
02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:02.860
<v Speaker 1>And it says that there's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>underpinning,</v>

2634
02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:06.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imperative in capitalism nobody gets,</v>

2635
02:19:06.610 --> 02:19:10.600
<v Speaker 1>although capitalists have to obey it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to make money and it's saved my</v>

2636
02:19:10.601 --> 02:19:13.480
<v Speaker 1>neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me messianic save a hundred neighbors.</v>

2637
02:19:13.481 --> 02:19:15.370
<v Speaker 1>You get $100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>save a million neighbors,</v>

2638
02:19:15.371 --> 02:19:17.530
<v Speaker 1>you've got $1 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2639
02:19:18.010 --> 02:19:21.310
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the book talks about material</v>

2640
02:19:21.311 --> 02:19:25.450
<v Speaker 1>miracles and about secular salvation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

2641
02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:29.540
<v Speaker 1>when Joan jets manager came to my office</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

2642
02:19:29.570 --> 02:19:30.680
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got the service,</v>

2643
02:19:30.681 --> 02:19:32.810
<v Speaker 1>she's been turned down by 23 rocket</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

2644
02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Could you just as a favor get me one</v>
<v Speaker 1>line and cashbox that'll record company</v>

2645
02:19:36.471 --> 02:19:39.110
<v Speaker 1>and we'll sign her and the record</v>
<v Speaker 1>company will make her career.</v>

2646
02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:40.820
<v Speaker 1>And I had a psych.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenny,</v>

2647
02:19:40.850 --> 02:19:42.380
<v Speaker 1>listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2648
02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:44.600
<v Speaker 1>once you get a record company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your troubles begin.</v>

2649
02:19:44.601 --> 02:19:46.430
<v Speaker 1>That's not when your troubles in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>record company.</v>

2650
02:19:46.431 --> 02:19:49.790
<v Speaker 1>We'll throw every conceivable obstacle</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some inconceivable obstacles in your</v>

2651
02:19:49.791 --> 02:19:52.970
<v Speaker 1>path and you have to have a panzer tank</v>
<v Speaker 1>brigade strategy.</v>

2652
02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:57.800
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you let me do the strategy,</v>

2653
02:19:57.801 --> 02:20:00.070
<v Speaker 1>if you work as hard as I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 hours a day,</v>

2654
02:20:00.071 --> 02:20:01.980
<v Speaker 1>seven days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2655
02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:05.360
<v Speaker 1>if you do everything I tell you too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you will have a star in two</v>

2656
02:20:05.361 --> 02:20:09.980
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What she's been turned down by 23 record</v>

2657
02:20:09.981 --> 02:20:12.470
<v Speaker 1>companies were where is there left to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go?</v>

2658
02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:15.200
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that means she should stop?</v>

2659
02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:18.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only said this to two people in my</v>

2660
02:20:18.801 --> 02:20:20.540
<v Speaker 1>lifetime that I will give you a star.</v>

2661
02:20:21.350 --> 02:20:24.830
<v Speaker 1>The first one was to the manager of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>band called Rufus,</v>

2662
02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:28.970
<v Speaker 1>which had a number three single on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>charts at that time called tell me</v>

2663
02:20:28.971 --> 02:20:31.360
<v Speaker 1>something good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trapped them in a limousine.</v>

2664
02:20:31.370 --> 02:20:34.580
<v Speaker 1>I picked her up at the airport and knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were going to be trapped in rush hour</v>

2665
02:20:34.581 --> 02:20:36.110
<v Speaker 1>traffic and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2666
02:20:36.111 --> 02:20:40.280
<v Speaker 1>I know your band has prides itself on</v>
<v Speaker 1>its democracy,</v>

2667
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:45.920
<v Speaker 1>but if you let me put all the attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your lead singer and you cover my ass</v>

2668
02:20:45.921 --> 02:20:48.710
<v Speaker 1>with the band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you I will give you a star.</v>

2669
02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Those the only two times over resetting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lead singer I was talking about with</v>

2670
02:20:53.501 --> 02:20:56.980
<v Speaker 1>this band called Rufus is named now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you remember her name,</v>

2671
02:20:57.010 --> 02:20:59.200
<v Speaker 1>because this is a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shaka Khan.</v>

2672
02:20:59.830 --> 02:21:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did the prediction.</v>

2673
02:21:03.290 --> 02:21:04.970
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But are we off track here?</v>

2674
02:21:05.180 --> 02:21:07.400
<v Speaker 2>We're off track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm talking about have to do with</v>

2675
02:21:07.401 --> 02:21:09.410
<v Speaker 2>ancient aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what does this have to do with this</v>

2676
02:21:09.411 --> 02:21:11.300
<v Speaker 2>desire?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These have to,</v>

2677
02:21:11.570 --> 02:21:14.240
<v Speaker 2>to know that we got our wisdom from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stars.</v>

2678
02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not directly about that,</v>

2679
02:21:16.991 --> 02:21:19.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's occasionally you tap into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something bigger than yourself.</v>

2680
02:21:20.110 --> 02:21:25.110
<v Speaker 1>And occasionally I had visions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally those visions came true.</v>

2681
02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:29.290
<v Speaker 1>And so there's something super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not supernatural,</v>

2682
02:21:29.740 --> 02:21:34.210
<v Speaker 1>but certainly super normal about being</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to have two visions only to one</v>

2683
02:21:34.211 --> 02:21:35.950
<v Speaker 1>with Chaka Khan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one with Joan Jett.</v>

2684
02:21:36.910 --> 02:21:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are ways in which we form a larger</v>

2685
02:21:40.841 --> 02:21:44.770
<v Speaker 1>collective intelligence and we can some</v>
<v Speaker 1>times tap into it,</v>

2686
02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:48.880
<v Speaker 1>but if we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we better believe in something</v>

2687
02:21:48.881 --> 02:21:52.210
<v Speaker 1>higher than ourselves or we have a hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>time making it on the face of the earth.</v>

2688
02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:55.210
<v Speaker 1>A very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this make sense?</v>

2689
02:21:55.490 --> 02:21:58.380
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it necessarily make</v>

2690
02:21:58.381 --> 02:22:03.381
<v Speaker 2>sense in the context of people having</v>
<v Speaker 2>this desire to believe that we've been</v>

2691
02:22:03.411 --> 02:22:06.870
<v Speaker 2>visited by extraterrestrials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we'd been shaped and molded and</v>

2692
02:22:06.890 --> 02:22:07.730
<v Speaker 2>helped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

2693
02:22:08.090 --> 02:22:08.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2694
02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:12.410
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation recently and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast with someone and we were talking</v>

2695
02:22:12.411 --> 02:22:13.244
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2696
02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:15.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic inner,</v>

2697
02:22:15.940 --> 02:22:17.600
<v Speaker 2>was it theo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about,</v>

2698
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:20.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people being a product of genetic</v>

2699
02:22:20.871 --> 02:22:21.940
<v Speaker 2>engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2700
02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Alien DNA being introduced into primate</v>
<v Speaker 2>DNA.</v>

2701
02:22:26.290 --> 02:22:30.900
<v Speaker 3>And where's the missing link?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I tried to crudely explain with my</v>

2702
02:22:30.901 --> 02:22:33.120
<v Speaker 3>limited knowledge of us that that's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>really the case,</v>

2703
02:22:33.140 --> 02:22:36.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know how humans evolved from ancient</v>

2704
02:22:36.871 --> 02:22:38.000
<v Speaker 3>hominids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2705
02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:39.840
<v Speaker 3>While we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of mysteries,</v>

2706
02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:41.250
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's slot.</v>

2707
02:22:42.590 --> 02:22:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the deal.</v>

2708
02:22:44.151 --> 02:22:46.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm imagining that there is a higher</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>

2709
02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:49.200
<v Speaker 3>literally hire we humans have a thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how sure.</v>

2710
02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:50.830
<v Speaker 3>And we're not alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crayfish,</v>

2711
02:22:50.900 --> 02:22:53.280
<v Speaker 3>half a thing about heights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lobsters have a thing about heights.</v>

2712
02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:55.290
<v Speaker 3>Lizards have a thing about heights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bobby dogs.</v>

2713
02:22:55.291 --> 02:22:58.190
<v Speaker 3>I have a thing about heights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in that we're not alone and look me</v>

2714
02:22:58.191 --> 02:23:01.230
<v Speaker 3>for a higher power in the sense of up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2715
02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:03.180
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smarter than us.</v>

2716
02:23:03.240 --> 02:23:06.420
<v Speaker 3>More evolved us in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes it an architect.</v>

2717
02:23:06.421 --> 02:23:08.790
<v Speaker 3>I've always said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems like what we're going to look</v>

2718
02:23:08.791 --> 02:23:09.624
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2719
02:23:09.660 --> 02:23:12.780
<v Speaker 3>if that architect has artificially</v>
<v Speaker 3>shaped our DNA,</v>

2720
02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:15.110
<v Speaker 3>then who shaped the DNA of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>architects?</v>

2721
02:23:15.450 --> 02:23:17.130
<v Speaker 3>The archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying that,</v>

2722
02:23:17.131 --> 02:23:17.731
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2723
02:23:17.731 --> 02:23:20.390
<v Speaker 3>the large head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right guys,</v>

2724
02:23:20.430 --> 02:23:24.270
<v Speaker 3>the tiny body is that we're slowly but</v>
<v Speaker 3>surely becoming less muscular,</v>

2725
02:23:24.271 --> 02:23:28.920
<v Speaker 3>more reliant on our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our minds will get larger or sex organs</v>

2726
02:23:28.921 --> 02:23:33.921
<v Speaker 3>will be thought of as being problematic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the cause of many worries and</v>

2727
02:23:34.270 --> 02:23:38.220
<v Speaker 3>clothes and wars and strife and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>will eliminate those.</v>

2728
02:23:38.490 --> 02:23:41.520
<v Speaker 3>And that will exist almost entirely in</v>
<v Speaker 3>our minds.</v>

2729
02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:45.250
<v Speaker 3>And that this is what we're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we see the gray early.</v>

2730
02:23:45.251 --> 02:23:49.650
<v Speaker 3>And so race seems to be a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people wanting to pick sides and decide</v>

2731
02:23:49.651 --> 02:23:52.440
<v Speaker 3>which one's better or worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there'll be no more race.</v>

2732
02:23:52.441 --> 02:23:56.330
<v Speaker 3>Everyone will be one homogenized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tamala John,</v>

2733
02:23:57.060 --> 02:23:58.750
<v Speaker 3>what's that word?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Homogenize.</v>

2734
02:23:58.751 --> 02:24:01.920
<v Speaker 3>It was the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Homologue homolog the whole log us.</v>

2735
02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:03.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that word?</v>

2736
02:24:03.900 --> 02:24:05.260
<v Speaker 3>Amala guys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2737
02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Homologous [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that word I'm looking for?</v>

2738
02:24:08.910 --> 02:24:10.890
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A collection.</v>

2739
02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the races brought to one form and</v>

2740
02:24:15.271 --> 02:24:20.271
<v Speaker 3>everybody will share this form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there'll be no pros or cons.</v>

2741
02:24:20.851 --> 02:24:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Nothing better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everything will exist in the mind.</v>

2742
02:24:23.611 --> 02:24:25.620
<v Speaker 3>So it's another version of the Kingdom</v>
<v Speaker 3>of God.</v>

2743
02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2744
02:24:27.090 --> 02:24:30.320
<v Speaker 3>and it's strange thing is space daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2745
02:24:30.330 --> 02:24:33.750
<v Speaker 3>So the strange thing is that Jesus made</v>
<v Speaker 3>these predictions that the Kingdom of</v>

2746
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:35.430
<v Speaker 3>God was going to arrive at any minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2747
02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:39.390
<v Speaker 3>And the first Christians waited around</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going to happen at any minute.</v>

2748
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:41.820
<v Speaker 3>So first it was going to happen to any</v>
<v Speaker 3>eighth day now,</v>

2749
02:24:41.821 --> 02:24:43.590
<v Speaker 3>then any week now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then any month now,</v>

2750
02:24:43.591 --> 02:24:47.640
<v Speaker 3>then in a year now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then any decade or century now</v>

2751
02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:52.640
<v Speaker 3>millennium now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so did Jesus religion disappear</v>

2752
02:24:53.370 --> 02:24:56.010
<v Speaker 3>because it made a prediction and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>prediction didn't come true?</v>

2753
02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:57.713
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>

2754
02:24:58.110 --> 02:25:01.620
<v Speaker 3>So apparently the religion is somehow a</v>
<v Speaker 3>supernormal stimulus,</v>

2755
02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:03.900
<v Speaker 3>even though its predictions don't come</v>
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>

2756
02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:09.420
<v Speaker 3>There is something in us that needs a</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher something.</v>

2757
02:25:09.930 --> 02:25:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't the prediction of religion just</v>

2758
02:25:11.521 --> 02:25:13.230
<v Speaker 3>wait around because it's gone to come</v>
<v Speaker 3>true?</v>

2759
02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been very hard to justify that</v>

2760
02:25:16.350 --> 02:25:19.710
<v Speaker 3>after it didn't come true tomorrow and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't come through next year and it</v>

2761
02:25:19.711 --> 02:25:22.830
<v Speaker 3>didn't to read the scrolls and correctly</v>

2762
02:25:24.270 --> 02:25:27.130
<v Speaker 1>that has the power to hang in there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 years.</v>

2763
02:25:27.131 --> 02:25:30.160
<v Speaker 1>That's astonishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it's basic prediction is utterly</v>

2764
02:25:30.161 --> 02:25:31.570
<v Speaker 1>false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always a,</v>

2765
02:25:31.650 --> 02:25:35.460
<v Speaker 2>every decade or so there's some group</v>
<v Speaker 2>that decides.</v>

2766
02:25:35.461 --> 02:25:36.800
<v Speaker 2>They know when the next</v>

2767
02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:39.400
<v Speaker 1>William Miller in the 18 hundreds</v>

2768
02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:43.580
<v Speaker 2>let just a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was billboards all across the</v>

2769
02:25:43.581 --> 02:25:47.420
<v Speaker 2>country by some group that had decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was going to take place on a certain</v>

2770
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:49.220
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

2771
02:25:49.221 --> 02:25:50.450
<v Speaker 2>are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2772
02:25:50.451 --> 02:25:52.240
<v Speaker 2>there's the rapture's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2773
02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:56.150
<v Speaker 2>protect these billboards out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he came and went and many</v>

2774
02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:56.841
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2775
02:25:56.841 --> 02:25:57.501
<v Speaker 2>and then they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2776
02:25:57.501 --> 02:26:01.550
<v Speaker 2>we made some calculations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we made some mistakes and there's some</v>

2777
02:26:01.551 --> 02:26:02.370
<v Speaker 2>errors.</v>

2778
02:26:02.370 --> 02:26:03.203
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happened,</v>

2779
02:26:03.210 --> 02:26:06.060
<v Speaker 1>it happened in the 1840 William Miller</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a prediction.</v>

2780
02:26:06.090 --> 02:26:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Everybody sold their goods and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the rapture and it didn't</v>

2781
02:26:10.561 --> 02:26:11.910
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So William o said,</v>

2782
02:26:11.911 --> 02:26:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I must have gotten my predict by my</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculations wrong.</v>

2783
02:26:14.611 --> 02:26:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Went back to the calculating board and</v>
<v Speaker 1>came back with a new calculation</v>

2784
02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:22.410
<v Speaker 1>calculation that was a year later and</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

2785
02:26:22.650 --> 02:26:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Remember those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember those jeans?</v>

2786
02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:24.833
<v Speaker 1>I never saw them.</v>

2787
02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:27.740
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 21st 2011 he is coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2788
02:26:27.850 --> 02:26:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2789
02:26:29.071 --> 02:26:31.620
<v Speaker 1>but the point is that William Miller</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

2790
02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:35.280
<v Speaker 1>even after it got it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twice is still around.</v>

2791
02:26:35.490 --> 02:26:38.280
<v Speaker 1>It's the adventist religion and it's on</v>
<v Speaker 1>two different sacks in,</v>

2792
02:26:38.281 --> 02:26:41.760
<v Speaker 1>there are at least 22 million of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>planted around the planet.</v>

2793
02:26:42.060 --> 02:26:47.060
<v Speaker 1>And Michael Jackson and his mother were</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jehovah's Witnesses.</v>

2794
02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I believe is one of the William</v>

2795
02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Miller based religions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it if you fashion the religion right</v>

2796
02:26:55.470 --> 02:26:59.020
<v Speaker 1>as a supernormal stimulus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those eggs with Polka dots and day</v>

2797
02:26:59.180 --> 02:27:04.180
<v Speaker 1>that still were able to outfox the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs or out stimulate the mother.</v>

2798
02:27:05.191 --> 02:27:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2799
02:27:07.270 --> 02:27:11.620
<v Speaker 1>it'll last and we humans think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all about rational prediction and</v>

2800
02:27:11.621 --> 02:27:12.760
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2801
02:27:12.761 --> 02:27:13.530
<v Speaker 1>we're not.</v>

2802
02:27:13.530 --> 02:27:18.530
<v Speaker 2>But in the face and the understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the greater view of the</v>

2803
02:27:19.111 --> 02:27:20.790
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we understand about the universe,</v>

2804
02:27:20.791 --> 02:27:23.160
<v Speaker 2>we are so minuscule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2805
02:27:23.161 --> 02:27:25.650
<v Speaker 2>More we pay attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more we,</v>

2806
02:27:25.651 --> 02:27:29.760
<v Speaker 2>it's just sort of embedded into our</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness that there is,</v>

2807
02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:34.680
<v Speaker 2>there is a vast universe out there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are so many possibilities and it's</v>

2808
02:27:34.681 --> 02:27:39.681
<v Speaker 2>so overwhelming that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this framework of religion or a cult or</v>

2809
02:27:40.890 --> 02:27:45.000
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like a scaffolding in which you</v>

2810
02:27:45.001 --> 02:27:50.001
<v Speaker 2>can sort of operate inside of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>impossibly large thing that we exist in</v>

2811
02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:53.993
<v Speaker 2>and yet still have,</v>

2812
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.780
<v Speaker 1>well that's a good hypothesis that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>brings things down to a scale we can</v>

2813
02:27:57.781 --> 02:27:58.580
<v Speaker 1>comprehend.</v>

2814
02:27:58.580 --> 02:28:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I think of it as almost like a a a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bridge to evolution of us being wild aid</v>

2815
02:28:05.241 --> 02:28:10.241
<v Speaker 2>creatures to us having language and</v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehension and this concept of our</v>

2816
02:28:10.881 --> 02:28:14.600
<v Speaker 2>position in the university being so</v>
<v Speaker 2>small and then what is the point of all</v>

2817
02:28:14.601 --> 02:28:15.670
<v Speaker 2>this and we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll it,</v>

2818
02:28:15.671 --> 02:28:17.990
<v Speaker 2>let's give them a points that they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it to the next juncture.</v>

2819
02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a rabbinic idea and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>from 1500 or something like that</v>

2820
02:28:23.601 --> 02:28:26.330
<v Speaker 1>probably in Poland and the rabbi said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2821
02:28:26.331 --> 02:28:28.910
<v Speaker 1>left creation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half finished show we should be forced</v>

2822
02:28:28.911 --> 02:28:32.160
<v Speaker 1>to finish the other half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the version I like.</v>

2823
02:28:32.220 --> 02:28:36.200
<v Speaker 1>I like because it puts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it puts the onus on us.</v>

2824
02:28:36.650 --> 02:28:38.990
<v Speaker 1>And God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had my computer,</v>

2825
02:28:38.991 --> 02:28:42.050
<v Speaker 1>my laptop here because I'd read you an</v>
<v Speaker 1>epigram that I wrote.</v>

2826
02:28:42.051 --> 02:28:44.280
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically Jamie,</v>

2827
02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:46.810
<v Speaker 1>for all we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>

2828
02:28:46.811 --> 02:28:50.360
<v Speaker 1>it's in the laptop and your laptop over</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2829
02:28:50.390 --> 02:28:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2830
02:28:53.420 --> 02:28:57.260
<v Speaker 1>one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is every time we do something</v>

2831
02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:59.420
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like inventing the smartphone,</v>

2832
02:28:59.750 --> 02:29:03.430
<v Speaker 1>which Steve Jobs did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we add to the repertoire,</v>

2833
02:29:03.660 --> 02:29:05.660
<v Speaker 1>but we add to the repertoire of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmos.</v>

2834
02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the cosmos has never done it</v>

2835
02:29:07.611 --> 02:29:08.810
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far as we know.</v>

2836
02:29:09.500 --> 02:29:11.870
<v Speaker 1>And even if there were civilizations on</v>
<v Speaker 1>other planets,</v>

2837
02:29:11.871 --> 02:29:13.640
<v Speaker 1>they be taking a path different than</v>
<v Speaker 1>ours.</v>

2838
02:29:14.090 --> 02:29:19.090
<v Speaker 1>So we are like the searcher bees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our entire civilization is like one</v>

2839
02:29:19.311 --> 02:29:21.710
<v Speaker 1>search or be in a possible cosmic</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

2840
02:29:21.711 --> 02:29:24.440
<v Speaker 1>assuming that there are other living</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2841
02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:27.800
<v Speaker 1>conscious things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent things elsewhere.</v>

2842
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:30.380
<v Speaker 1>And eventually we will patch all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces together.</v>

2843
02:29:30.650 --> 02:29:33.530
<v Speaker 1>But right now we're patching together</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pieces from</v>

2844
02:29:35.180 --> 02:29:36.710
<v Speaker 1>trillions more than true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2845
02:29:36.711 --> 02:29:40.010
<v Speaker 1>if they're just a trillion cells in you</v>
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>

2846
02:29:40.430 --> 02:29:42.470
<v Speaker 1>then think of all the cells were</v>
<v Speaker 1>patching where you got there.</v>

2847
02:29:42.471 --> 02:29:44.840
<v Speaker 1>When we bring together all the creatures</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the sea,</v>

2848
02:29:44.841 --> 02:29:48.050
<v Speaker 1>all of the creatures of the land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the microbial creatures,</v>

2849
02:29:48.051 --> 02:29:52.910
<v Speaker 1>all of the visible creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and somehow allowing them to influence</v>

2850
02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:55.790
<v Speaker 1>our collective brain as we influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2851
02:29:56.840 --> 02:30:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Imagine what life would be like for</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria if they couldn't have you as a</v>

2852
02:30:00.741 --> 02:30:05.741
<v Speaker 1>vehicle and they couldn't force you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into your car and go down to Ralph's</v>

2853
02:30:06.950 --> 02:30:09.620
<v Speaker 1>and by low them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those damn chocolate eclairs,</v>

2854
02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:13.130
<v Speaker 1>the bacterial world would not be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

2855
02:30:13.490 --> 02:30:15.680
<v Speaker 1>You have given bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new powers,</v>

2856
02:30:16.190 --> 02:30:20.540
<v Speaker 1>and they have given you powers you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have without them possibly</v>

2857
02:30:20.541 --> 02:30:22.910
<v Speaker 1>powers that allowed you to evolve in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

2858
02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think it changes your personality.</v>

2859
02:30:24.741 --> 02:30:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Now the gut biome actually affects the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way you think about the world that you</v>

2860
02:30:29.151 --> 02:30:31.180
<v Speaker 1>live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know about some or another</v>

2861
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:33.740
<v Speaker 1>shaping you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know about this illness that you get</v>

2862
02:30:33.741 --> 02:30:34.760
<v Speaker 1>from cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2863
02:30:34.761 --> 02:30:37.660
<v Speaker 1>when it takes over a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toxoplasmosis,</v>

2864
02:30:37.700 --> 02:30:39.620
<v Speaker 1>when it's actually what it takes over a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rat.</v>

2865
02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Rats are normally repelled by the smell</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cat urine.</v>

2866
02:30:43.940 --> 02:30:46.700
<v Speaker 1>And when toxoplasmosis takes over and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rat's brain,</v>

2867
02:30:46.701 --> 02:30:50.060
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden the raddison attracted</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

2868
02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:51.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smell of rat urine.</v>

2869
02:30:51.890 --> 02:30:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the toxoplasmosis spends its</v>

2870
02:30:55.401 --> 02:31:00.401
<v Speaker 1>life part of it in the mouse or rat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it in the cat.</v>

2871
02:31:01.250 --> 02:31:04.190
<v Speaker 1>So at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to drive you over to where the</v>

2872
02:31:04.191 --> 02:31:08.000
<v Speaker 1>cat is likely to find you in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get itself into the cat.</v>

2873
02:31:08.450 --> 02:31:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Now think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the hell does a bacteria learn or</v>

2874
02:31:13.970 --> 02:31:17.240
<v Speaker 1>bacterial colony because they think in</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups of 7 trillion,</v>

2875
02:31:17.810 --> 02:31:20.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they think</v>

2876
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:23.910
<v Speaker 3>out how to drive the rat as if it were a</v>
<v Speaker 3>robot?</v>

2877
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:27.420
<v Speaker 3>And as if it were a tank and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the controls?</v>

2878
02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:32.070
<v Speaker 3>How do they manage to evolve a lifestyle</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which they spent part of their life</v>

2879
02:31:32.071 --> 02:31:34.500
<v Speaker 3>in one creature and another part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their life?</v>

2880
02:31:34.501 --> 02:31:37.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't another creature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do they know the anatomy and the</v>

2881
02:31:37.201 --> 02:31:40.710
<v Speaker 3>brains of those creatures so incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>well?</v>

2882
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have no idea.</v>

2883
02:31:43.650 --> 02:31:45.810
<v Speaker 3>We haven't even considered the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2884
02:31:45.811 --> 02:31:48.540
<v Speaker 3>it's a fascinating concept because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the cat,</v>

2885
02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:53.780
<v Speaker 3>the bacterial colony has to actually get</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the cat's Gut,</v>

2886
02:31:54.260 --> 02:31:55.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reproduce.</v>

2887
02:31:55.610 --> 02:31:57.810
<v Speaker 3>You can't reproduce outside of the cats</v>
<v Speaker 3>gut,</v>

2888
02:31:57.930 --> 02:31:59.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is just insane.</v>

2889
02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:02.490
<v Speaker 3>And so it has to figure out a way to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the cat's gut.</v>

2890
02:32:02.520 --> 02:32:06.390
<v Speaker 3>And the best way to do that is to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a rat and rewire the red sexual</v>

2891
02:32:06.391 --> 02:32:07.380
<v Speaker 3>reward system.</v>

2892
02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:10.230
<v Speaker 3>We had some Paul ski on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul skis,</v>

2893
02:32:10.231 --> 02:32:11.880
<v Speaker 3>terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Broke it all down for us.</v>

2894
02:32:11.881 --> 02:32:15.840
<v Speaker 3>And as he's talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just trying to imagine how long</v>

2895
02:32:15.841 --> 02:32:17.060
<v Speaker 3>this took.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2896
02:32:17.090 --> 02:32:20.760
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] one of the macarthur genius</v>
<v Speaker 3>award winners who said that the God</v>

2897
02:32:20.761 --> 02:32:24.210
<v Speaker 3>problem was a great book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gospel Album,</v>

2898
02:32:24.240 --> 02:32:26.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how a godless cosmos creates.</v>

2899
02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:27.151
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2900
02:32:27.151 --> 02:32:30.240
<v Speaker 3>we have all these mysteries I had of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every mystery we solve,</v>

2901
02:32:30.241 --> 02:32:32.910
<v Speaker 3>for all we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the very first time that the cosmos</v>

2902
02:32:32.911 --> 02:32:37.911
<v Speaker 3>is ever pondered that mystery and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>solve the mystery and then turn the</v>

2903
02:32:38.401 --> 02:32:43.200
<v Speaker 3>result into a tool that is a hard thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people to acknowledge or even</v>

2904
02:32:43.201 --> 02:32:47.820
<v Speaker 3>consider that we might be the only ones</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have gotten to this point.</v>

2905
02:32:48.060 --> 02:32:51.840
<v Speaker 3>And that some say if human intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 3>and exists and we know it does,</v>

2906
02:32:52.290 --> 02:32:55.950
<v Speaker 3>that it is as far as we know on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>

2907
02:32:55.980 --> 02:33:00.450
<v Speaker 3>the peak of intelligence and least in</v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of its ability to affect and</v>

2908
02:33:00.451 --> 02:33:01.500
<v Speaker 3>change its environment.</v>

2909
02:33:01.530 --> 02:33:06.530
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we assume that if something can</v>

2910
02:33:06.751 --> 02:33:09.180
<v Speaker 3>reach this point here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's reached that point somewhere</v>

2911
02:33:09.181 --> 02:33:10.470
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not necessarily,</v>

2912
02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:12.360
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be different,</v>

2913
02:33:12.450 --> 02:33:15.060
<v Speaker 3>but somewhere it had to have been the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first place.</v>

2914
02:33:15.290 --> 02:33:17.430
<v Speaker 3>And why wouldn't it be here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2915
02:33:17.460 --> 02:33:18.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2916
02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:20.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>James fallows new book,</v>

2917
02:33:21.390 --> 02:33:24.240
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Dakota and there's some</v>

2918
02:33:24.241 --> 02:33:27.960
<v Speaker 3>river that goes through Dakota and on</v>
<v Speaker 3>one side of the river,</v>

2919
02:33:27.961 --> 02:33:30.480
<v Speaker 3>the culture is one way on the other side</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the river.</v>

2920
02:33:30.481 --> 02:33:33.240
<v Speaker 3>The culture is another way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even with all of our modern</v>

2921
02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:36.540
<v Speaker 3>communications technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are still differences and the</v>

2922
02:33:36.541 --> 02:33:40.860
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least the universe in the case of</v>

2923
02:33:40.861 --> 02:33:45.861
<v Speaker 3>life and we only know of life on planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is constantly stretching out fingers</v>

2924
02:33:46.291 --> 02:33:51.291
<v Speaker 3>into an use territories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's constantly taking,</v>

2925
02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:55.140
<v Speaker 3>it's doing the opposite of entropy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's todd certainly taking chaff and</v>

2926
02:33:55.141 --> 02:33:59.070
<v Speaker 3>garbage and stuff that seems like it</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have nothing to do with life and</v>

2927
02:33:59.071 --> 02:34:04.071
<v Speaker 3>turning it into Pistons and pillars and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuel for life.</v>

2928
02:34:07.290 --> 02:34:08.490
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we humans,</v>

2929
02:34:08.491 --> 02:34:12.780
<v Speaker 3>right now we're under the influence of</v>
<v Speaker 3>another end of the world religion</v>

2930
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:14.790
<v Speaker 3>looking toward a different kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>paradise.</v>

2931
02:34:14.970 --> 02:34:18.400
<v Speaker 3>It's called environmentalism and says</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we humans</v>

2932
02:34:18.460 --> 02:34:21.700
<v Speaker 1>are causing climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now that's,</v>

2933
02:34:21.730 --> 02:34:25.330
<v Speaker 1>this is a little silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We humans may be contributing to climate</v>

2934
02:34:25.331 --> 02:34:28.090
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but climate change has been the norm on</v>

2935
02:34:28.091 --> 02:34:32.500
<v Speaker 1>this planet for 4.5 billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of those sacred</v>

2936
02:34:32.590 --> 02:34:35.070
<v Speaker 2>science subjects that's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2937
02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:36.580
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific.</v>

2938
02:34:36.581 --> 02:34:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Jesus cannot question the the ancient</v>
<v Speaker 2>scrolls</v>

2939
02:34:39.700 --> 02:34:41.310
<v Speaker 1>and it's an end times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2940
02:34:41.311 --> 02:34:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2941
02:34:42.490 --> 02:34:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Because it says the world's about to end</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of things we've done because</v>

2942
02:34:46.421 --> 02:34:49.900
<v Speaker 1>we've sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we simply sacrifice to the</v>

2943
02:34:49.901 --> 02:34:53.320
<v Speaker 1>goddess of nature to Geyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2944
02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:57.790
<v Speaker 1>the universal go back to being a stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a climatically stable garden of Eden.</v>

2945
02:34:57.791 --> 02:34:59.050
<v Speaker 1>While I got news for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2946
02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:03.730
<v Speaker 1>this planet has never been climatically</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable in the very beginning.</v>

2947
02:35:04.090 --> 02:35:07.330
<v Speaker 1>It wheeled around its access once every</v>
<v Speaker 1>six hours.</v>

2948
02:35:07.690 --> 02:35:10.060
<v Speaker 1>That means we pick any point on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>

2949
02:35:10.450 --> 02:35:15.450
<v Speaker 1>It was in this poisonous stuff called</v>
<v Speaker 1>radiation for three hours.</v>

2950
02:35:16.810 --> 02:35:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Then it was yanked into darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is equally destructive.</v>

2951
02:35:20.590 --> 02:35:24.880
<v Speaker 1>And the temperature would go up a</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum of 86 degrees every whoops,</v>

2952
02:35:24.910 --> 02:35:27.640
<v Speaker 1>up and down 86 degrees every three</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

2953
02:35:28.210 --> 02:35:31.930
<v Speaker 1>That's climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus it was on a tilt and it was</v>

2954
02:35:31.931 --> 02:35:35.830
<v Speaker 1>rotating around the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as it rotated,</v>

2955
02:35:35.890 --> 02:35:37.840
<v Speaker 1>the climate went through hideous</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>

2956
02:35:38.110 --> 02:35:38.750
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is</v>

2957
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:42.470
<v Speaker 2>way in the past and when people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned with what our role and what</v>

2958
02:35:42.471 --> 02:35:44.020
<v Speaker 2>impact human racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it</v>

2959
02:35:44.090 --> 02:35:46.400
<v Speaker 1>matter what we need to be after his</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate state.</v>

2960
02:35:46.401 --> 02:35:50.270
<v Speaker 1>If we really want the climate to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way it wasn't 1650 before the industrial</v>

2961
02:35:50.271 --> 02:35:51.860
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our human choice.</v>

2962
02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:57.770
<v Speaker 1>That's biogenic in origin and we need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge that.</v>

2963
02:35:57.771 --> 02:36:01.310
<v Speaker 1>That's what we have decided and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to develop climate</v>

2964
02:36:01.311 --> 02:36:02.770
<v Speaker 1>stabilization to my questions.</v>

2965
02:36:02.950 --> 02:36:05.830
<v Speaker 2>Those what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it such a sacred subject?</v>

2966
02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:07.570
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you've just said,</v>

2967
02:36:07.690 --> 02:36:11.110
<v Speaker 2>even just questioning for a moment and</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that environmentalism is a type</v>

2968
02:36:11.111 --> 02:36:14.320
<v Speaker 2>of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>climate denialist uhmm you could be</v>

2969
02:36:14.321 --> 02:36:18.340
<v Speaker 2>labeled with that and then people would</v>
<v Speaker 2>love to break it down in a very simple</v>

2970
02:36:18.490 --> 02:36:23.490
<v Speaker 2>one sentence statement and call you</v>
<v Speaker 2>climate denialist right.</v>

2971
02:36:24.430 --> 02:36:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Climate Change denialist that son of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch and the next thing you know what?</v>

2972
02:36:27.971 --> 02:36:30.100
<v Speaker 2>People will repeat that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to have any,</v>

2973
02:36:30.101 --> 02:36:33.630
<v Speaker 2>nobody will want to sign you anymore for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a book contract or anything for any,</v>

2974
02:36:34.180 --> 02:36:37.990
<v Speaker 2>any complexity or context in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in what you're trying to say.</v>

2975
02:36:37.991 --> 02:36:40.810
<v Speaker 2>They don't want the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the subtle nuance of what you're trying</v>

2976
02:36:40.811 --> 02:36:41.980
<v Speaker 2>to express.</v>

2977
02:36:42.030 --> 02:36:45.280
<v Speaker 1>While there was a blunt nuance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to develop climate stabilization</v>

2978
02:36:45.281 --> 02:36:46.870
<v Speaker 1>technologies have taken Carmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2979
02:36:46.871 --> 02:36:50.860
<v Speaker 1>The atmosphere is a carpet stabilization</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology than so be it.</v>

2980
02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:53.380
<v Speaker 1>But we have to develop others because</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2981
02:36:53.410 --> 02:36:58.180
<v Speaker 1>this globe goes through ice ages and</v>
<v Speaker 1>global warming's it went through.</v>

2982
02:36:58.181 --> 02:37:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Answer is in technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2983
02:37:01.390 --> 02:37:03.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what the answer is always been</v>
<v Speaker 1>for humans.</v>

2984
02:37:03.191 --> 02:37:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why were we born?</v>

2985
02:37:05.410 --> 02:37:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this chemical in our gut called</v>

2986
02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.630
<v Speaker 1>assist to Keenan and it only goes off</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we eat meat.</v>

2987
02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:14.500
<v Speaker 1>So we're bilty meet and it's a bonding</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone like Clark.</v>

2988
02:37:14.501 --> 02:37:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Oxytocin brings people together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2989
02:37:17.150 --> 02:37:19.670
<v Speaker 1>so if you're having a good meat meal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a bunch of people,</v>

2990
02:37:19.940 --> 02:37:22.670
<v Speaker 1>this is a chemical in your routes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>says these are good people.</v>

2991
02:37:22.671 --> 02:37:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Stick with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell the Vegan says,</v>

2992
02:37:25.300 --> 02:37:27.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how,</v>

2993
02:37:27.471 --> 02:37:31.610
<v Speaker 1>why if we were born to eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't we have claws?</v>

2994
02:37:32.210 --> 02:37:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we have ripping fangs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we have for,</v>

2995
02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:40.130
<v Speaker 1>cause we figured out a way to cook it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we make clothes,</v>

2996
02:37:40.380 --> 02:37:41.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gardens.</v>

2997
02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:45.290
<v Speaker 1>We figured out a way to figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way to isolate ourselves from the</v>

2998
02:37:45.291 --> 02:37:48.100
<v Speaker 1>environment in terms of housing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>

2999
02:37:48.110 --> 02:37:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Troll of fire.</v>

3000
02:37:49.250 --> 02:37:52.550
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that we were born naked.</v>

3001
02:37:52.580 --> 02:37:57.580
<v Speaker 1>We were naked apes for a reason because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are homo [inaudible],</v>

3002
02:37:58.070 --> 02:38:00.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever that word would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are the people of tools.</v>

3003
02:38:01.370 --> 02:38:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we developed the first stone tool to</v>

3004
02:38:03.741 --> 02:38:08.300
<v Speaker 1>the best of our knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately 3.1 to 3.4 million years</v>

3005
02:38:08.301 --> 02:38:10.760
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long before we became modern humans.</v>

3006
02:38:11.180 --> 02:38:16.180
<v Speaker 1>So we were born in this peculiar way at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is naked and without claws and</v>

3007
02:38:16.331 --> 02:38:18.590
<v Speaker 1>without ripping things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3008
02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:23.240
<v Speaker 1>after we developed the tools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took like fire and cooking,</v>

3009
02:38:23.241 --> 02:38:25.100
<v Speaker 1>which you just cited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3010
02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:30.280
<v Speaker 1>to allow us to have artificial clause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial ripping fangs to cook our</v>

3011
02:38:31.341 --> 02:38:32.174
<v Speaker 1>meals.</v>

3012
02:38:32.380 --> 02:38:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big conclusion of a book that I've</v>

3013
02:38:34.461 --> 02:38:37.340
<v Speaker 1>just read on what makes us different</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a neural scientist,</v>

3014
02:38:37.341 --> 02:38:41.330
<v Speaker 1>she's the neuroscientist who corrected</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard figure for the number of</v>

3015
02:38:41.331 --> 02:38:46.331
<v Speaker 1>neurons in the brain from 100 billion to</v>
<v Speaker 1>86 billion by actually counting them.</v>

3016
02:38:47.450 --> 02:38:50.030
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what made us human was cooking just what</v>

3017
02:38:50.031 --> 02:38:53.150
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you cook,</v>

3018
02:38:53.151 --> 02:38:56.570
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you liberate all whole mess of calories</v>

3019
02:38:56.571 --> 02:39:01.571
<v Speaker 1>and nutritive sources that are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>available to a gorilla that's eating</v>

3020
02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:06.080
<v Speaker 1>leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do we know that?</v>

3021
02:39:06.081 --> 02:39:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Because the gorillas born with a pot</v>
<v Speaker 1>belly the size of a Franklin stove,</v>

3022
02:39:10.530 --> 02:39:12.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it needs is huge digestive</v>

3023
02:39:12.831 --> 02:39:15.410
<v Speaker 1>apparatus in order to handle those</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves,</v>

3024
02:39:15.470 --> 02:39:17.330
<v Speaker 1>to break them down into food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3025
02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:21.140
<v Speaker 1>While when you cook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need that huge got now the</v>

3026
02:39:21.141 --> 02:39:24.320
<v Speaker 1>bacteria or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ape is not able to go very far.</v>

3027
02:39:24.321 --> 02:39:26.960
<v Speaker 1>The gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's certainly can't migrate.</v>

3028
02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Once you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see Jane Goodall and she is pleading</v>

3029
02:39:30.411 --> 02:39:32.900
<v Speaker 1>for us to save the habitat of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees.</v>

3030
02:39:33.230 --> 02:39:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen Jane Goodall pleading</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us to save the Habitat of baboons?</v>

3031
02:39:38.030 --> 02:39:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The baboons are the rats of Africa.</v>

3032
02:39:41.570 --> 02:39:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Baboons are extraordinarily adaptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're extraordinarily curious.</v>

3033
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:49.550
<v Speaker 1>They're always finding new environments</v>
<v Speaker 1>and figuring out ways to turn them into</v>

3034
02:39:49.551 --> 02:39:53.510
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzees don't have that quality.</v>

3035
02:39:53.511 --> 02:39:56.660
<v Speaker 1>The reason we need to save their</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment is because they're so dumb</v>

3036
02:39:56.661 --> 02:40:01.490
<v Speaker 1>as a group because the collective</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence of a group of chimpanzees</v>

3037
02:40:01.491 --> 02:40:05.390
<v Speaker 1>is so low that now that they're adapted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to an environment that's the only</v>

3038
02:40:05.391 --> 02:40:08.510
<v Speaker 1>environment they can adapt to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas baboons who have smaller</v>

3039
02:40:08.511 --> 02:40:12.700
<v Speaker 1>individual brains have greater</v>
<v Speaker 1>collective smarts.</v>

3040
02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you seen how baboons have</v>
<v Speaker 1>domesticated dogs?</v>

3041
02:40:16.170 --> 02:40:17.670
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3042
02:40:17.850 --> 02:40:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The divest domesticated house dogs and</v>

3043
02:40:20.791 --> 02:40:24.690
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way to keep the dogs near</v>
<v Speaker 1>them so they can be alerted to when some</v>

3044
02:40:24.691 --> 02:40:29.691
<v Speaker 1>bad intruders or in that's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy kidnap these dogs and hold them</v>

3045
02:40:30.421 --> 02:40:32.640
<v Speaker 1>hostage and feed them right.</v>

3046
02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:35.080
<v Speaker 1>And the dog's just kind of learned to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang around them.</v>

3047
02:40:35.090 --> 02:40:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ideal of hunting companion.</v>

3048
02:40:37.081 --> 02:40:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very bizarre.</v>

3049
02:40:39.530 --> 02:40:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did once upon a time and,</v>

3050
02:40:41.351 --> 02:40:44.400
<v Speaker 1>and you could say very easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't us who tame dogs.</v>

3051
02:40:44.401 --> 02:40:48.030
<v Speaker 1>It was dogs who team Gos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how well we treat them.</v>

3052
02:40:48.210 --> 02:40:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Here it is right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the,</v>

3053
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:52.080
<v Speaker 1>they hold onto these dogs that dogs</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to get away.</v>

3054
02:40:52.110 --> 02:40:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a puppy in its shoulder?</v>

3055
02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:55.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a puppy on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3056
02:40:55.620 --> 02:40:56.970
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

3057
02:40:57.030 --> 02:40:59.880
<v Speaker 1>they eventually stay with them in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>camps,</v>

3058
02:40:59.881 --> 02:41:01.620
<v Speaker 1>but they hold them hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3059
02:41:01.650 --> 02:41:03.330
<v Speaker 1>amaze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragging this dog.</v>

3060
02:41:03.331 --> 02:41:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not killing it,</v>

3061
02:41:04.171 --> 02:41:07.470
<v Speaker 1>not eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have somehow or another figured</v>

3062
02:41:07.471 --> 02:41:09.960
<v Speaker 1>out that if they keep these dogs around</v>
<v Speaker 1>long enough,</v>

3063
02:41:09.961 --> 02:41:12.840
<v Speaker 1>the dogs will bark when intruders and</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators are near.</v>

3064
02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

3065
02:41:13.670 --> 02:41:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely amazing.</v>

3066
02:41:15.300 --> 02:41:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Really crazy stuff.</v>

3067
02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:19.020
<v Speaker 1>But remember that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just looking at baboons.</v>

3068
02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Baboons have brains smaller than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain of a chimpanzee.</v>

3069
02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:23.760
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever seen a chimpanzee do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3070
02:41:23.970 --> 02:41:24.780
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3071
02:41:24.780 --> 02:41:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzees are not highly adaptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the measure of intelligence?</v>

3072
02:41:28.021 --> 02:41:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Ability to adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3073
02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's see how we measure the</v>

3074
02:41:31.501 --> 02:41:35.940
<v Speaker 1>intelligence of bacteria knowing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria work in a group of 7 trillion</v>

3075
02:41:35.941 --> 02:41:38.340
<v Speaker 1>and have a collective intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>within that group.</v>

3076
02:41:38.580 --> 02:41:42.960
<v Speaker 1>And they have a collective multi colony</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence because they,</v>

3077
02:41:43.050 --> 02:41:48.050
<v Speaker 1>once they develop certain genetic trex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pass the tricks around and little</v>

3078
02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:50.610
<v Speaker 1>tiny envelopes for all practical</v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>

3079
02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're constantly sharing new</v>

3080
02:41:53.581 --> 02:41:57.630
<v Speaker 1>bacterial tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we are told by the environmentalist</v>

3081
02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:00.920
<v Speaker 1>the new end times movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3082
02:42:01.230 --> 02:42:05.490
<v Speaker 1>that we have used up all the resources</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this planet.</v>

3083
02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:10.200
<v Speaker 1>We have vastly overburdened this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are eking it out of existence,</v>

3084
02:42:11.340 --> 02:42:16.110
<v Speaker 1>but bacteria are 12 miles beneath our</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet right now.</v>

3085
02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:21.210
<v Speaker 1>And they are turning raw rock granite</v>
<v Speaker 1>into bio stuff.</v>

3086
02:42:21.750 --> 02:42:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Now if the task of life is to kidnap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seduce,</v>

3087
02:42:23.941 --> 02:42:28.530
<v Speaker 1>and recruit as many dead Adams as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible into the grand project of life,</v>

3088
02:42:29.370 --> 02:42:34.140
<v Speaker 1>who's doing the best job right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who recognizes that for every ounce of</v>

3089
02:42:34.141 --> 02:42:38.430
<v Speaker 1>living stuff on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a hundred million ounces of</v>

3090
02:42:38.431 --> 02:42:42.300
<v Speaker 1>dead stuff waiting to be kidnapped and</v>
<v Speaker 1>seduced to recruited into the grand</v>

3091
02:42:42.301 --> 02:42:47.301
<v Speaker 1>project of life bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet it our bacteria nature.</v>

3092
02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:51.900
<v Speaker 1>You Bet your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does nature telling us through</v>

3093
02:42:51.901 --> 02:42:55.770
<v Speaker 1>these bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have 100 trillion more ounces.</v>

3094
02:42:56.430 --> 02:42:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred trillion more ounces or a</v>

3095
02:42:59.940 --> 02:43:03.150
<v Speaker 1>hundred million more ounces of dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff for every living outs you've got.</v>

3096
02:43:03.420 --> 02:43:07.590
<v Speaker 1>And your obligation on behalf of life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do what the bacteria are doing,</v>

3097
02:43:07.890 --> 02:43:10.050
<v Speaker 1>kidnap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seduce and recruit as many dead animals</v>

3098
02:43:10.051 --> 02:43:12.100
<v Speaker 1>as possible and bring them into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>project of life.</v>

3099
02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Use Technology to stabilize the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

3100
02:43:16.250 --> 02:43:17.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what we choose.</v>

3101
02:43:17.230 --> 02:43:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is what we've chosen and but</v>

3102
02:43:20.051 --> 02:43:23.350
<v Speaker 1>people are not regarding it as a choice</v>
<v Speaker 1>there regarding it as something imposed</v>

3103
02:43:23.351 --> 02:43:25.250
<v Speaker 1>on them by a higher force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3104
02:43:25.330 --> 02:43:26.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

3105
02:43:26.430 --> 02:43:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Gaya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mother Nature is not a higher force.</v>

3106
02:43:29.411 --> 02:43:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Mother Nature is a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mother nature throws every conceivable</v>

3107
02:43:33.371 --> 02:43:35.740
<v Speaker 1>obstacle warpath and she can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3108
02:43:35.770 --> 02:43:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Because our planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition to the fact that we are on a</v>

3109
02:43:38.261 --> 02:43:41.920
<v Speaker 1>tilted access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we go through a climate change called</v>

3110
02:43:41.921 --> 02:43:42.401
<v Speaker 1>summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall,</v>

3111
02:43:42.401 --> 02:43:44.740
<v Speaker 1>winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and spring every single year.</v>

3112
02:43:44.770 --> 02:43:46.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's a pretty violent climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

3113
02:43:47.020 --> 02:43:49.560
<v Speaker 1>And we have a planet that's been ice</v>
<v Speaker 1>baller,</v>

3114
02:43:49.580 --> 02:43:51.760
<v Speaker 1>snowball or twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's history.</v>

3115
02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:55.960
<v Speaker 1>The fact is the planet is on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trajectory,</v>

3116
02:43:55.961 --> 02:43:57.490
<v Speaker 1>on a path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a voyage,</v>

3117
02:43:57.491 --> 02:44:01.920
<v Speaker 1>on a mission that is scarier than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission of Frodo,</v>

3118
02:44:01.940 --> 02:44:06.370
<v Speaker 1>the hobbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is circling the core of the galaxy</v>

3119
02:44:06.550 --> 02:44:10.290
<v Speaker 1>approximately every 235 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as it,</v>

3120
02:44:10.330 --> 02:44:14.200
<v Speaker 1>as it goes through that long voyage</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the center of the galaxy,</v>

3121
02:44:14.650 --> 02:44:19.650
<v Speaker 1>it goes through spiral arms of galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The change our climate dramatically.</v>

3122
02:44:20.350 --> 02:44:24.670
<v Speaker 1>It gathers something like a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion tons of cosmic dust,</v>

3123
02:44:25.270 --> 02:44:27.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>per year.</v>

3124
02:44:28.510 --> 02:44:33.510
<v Speaker 1>And at certain points it goes through</v>
<v Speaker 1>clouds of cosmic fluff that triple the</v>

3125
02:44:34.991 --> 02:44:39.991
<v Speaker 1>amount of that dust that we gathered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which changes the climate considerably.</v>

3126
02:44:40.450 --> 02:44:44.680
<v Speaker 1>And we go through a milankovitch cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changes the climate every twenty two</v>

3127
02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:46.660
<v Speaker 1>thousand forty thousand and 110,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

3128
02:44:48.940 --> 02:44:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Not Precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in that range.</v>

3129
02:44:52.270 --> 02:44:55.150
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we want to stabilize the climate,</v>

3130
02:44:55.151 --> 02:44:57.850
<v Speaker 1>take responsibility for your decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

3131
02:44:58.420 --> 02:45:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Admit that this is a biogenic decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then go after climate stabilization</v>

3132
02:45:03.851 --> 02:45:04.900
<v Speaker 1>technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3133
02:45:04.930 --> 02:45:08.620
<v Speaker 1>try removing carbon from the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if it works,</v>

3134
02:45:09.250 --> 02:45:14.250
<v Speaker 1>but in the long haul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are on a 12,000 year passage and what</v>

3135
02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:16.480
<v Speaker 1>school climate has been relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable.</v>

3136
02:45:16.780 --> 02:45:21.780
<v Speaker 1>That's not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The norm is rapid climate change much</v>

3137
02:45:21.971 --> 02:45:26.971
<v Speaker 1>more rapidly than we've seen an ice ages</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they alter so we better damn well</v>

3138
02:45:27.491 --> 02:45:28.301
<v Speaker 1>learn these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3139
02:45:28.301 --> 02:45:33.301
<v Speaker 1>when I was in Japan a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a conference about harvesting</v>

3140
02:45:33.671 --> 02:45:36.460
<v Speaker 1>solar power in space and transmitting it</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to Earth,</v>

3141
02:45:37.300 --> 02:45:42.100
<v Speaker 1>which is carbon neutral and a source of</v>
<v Speaker 1>such tremendous amounts of power that it</v>

3142
02:45:42.310 --> 02:45:46.330
<v Speaker 1>defies description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a woman from the European</v>

3143
02:45:46.330 --> 02:45:47.141
<v Speaker 1>Space Agency and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3144
02:45:47.141 --> 02:45:51.220
<v Speaker 1>if you guys are going to build these</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant solar harvesting farms,</v>

3145
02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:55.060
<v Speaker 1>these five mile by five mile raise of</v>
<v Speaker 1>photovoltaic panels,</v>

3146
02:45:55.990 --> 02:45:58.840
<v Speaker 1>when you see a hurricane heading for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamaica,</v>

3147
02:46:00.100 --> 02:46:05.100
<v Speaker 1>send down a laser beam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lays the outer edges of the hurricane so</v>

3148
02:46:06.611 --> 02:46:11.611
<v Speaker 1>that you change the heat at a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>point on that hurricane and redirect it</v>

3149
02:46:12.111 --> 02:46:13.400
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't hit Jamaica.</v>

3150
02:46:13.970 --> 02:46:16.550
<v Speaker 1>So it goes harmlessly out to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3151
02:46:16.551 --> 02:46:19.820
<v Speaker 1>that's the beginning of harnessing these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

3152
02:46:19.821 --> 02:46:22.760
<v Speaker 1>harnessing disasters as energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities.</v>

3153
02:46:23.630 --> 02:46:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Now have we ever done that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3154
02:46:25.761 --> 02:46:29.150
<v Speaker 1>what about flyer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you'd been the first one to start</v>

3155
02:46:29.151 --> 02:46:31.160
<v Speaker 1>playing with fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your momma would have told you,</v>

3156
02:46:31.460 --> 02:46:33.440
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see all those dead animals in there</v>

3157
02:46:33.441 --> 02:46:35.960
<v Speaker 1>that have been roasted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a barbecued by this forest fire.</v>

3158
02:46:36.350 --> 02:46:39.350
<v Speaker 1>You want to become one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put that back where it belongs.</v>

3159
02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:42.620
<v Speaker 1>And fire saved us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3160
02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:46.250
<v Speaker 1>at the heart of a jet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the heart of a piston and the person</v>

3161
02:46:46.251 --> 02:46:47.540
<v Speaker 1>of a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we have?</v>

3162
02:46:47.660 --> 02:46:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Explosions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explosions.</v>

3163
02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:54.410
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the most devastating</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes we can imagine.</v>

3164
02:46:54.470 --> 02:46:56.660
<v Speaker 1>An explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What causes this?</v>

3165
02:46:56.661 --> 02:47:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Very rigid and I don't want to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific dogma,</v>

3166
02:47:01.160 --> 02:47:06.160
<v Speaker 1>but dogma in terms of the way you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to talk about climate change.</v>

3167
02:47:07.340 --> 02:47:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain aspects of science</v>

3168
02:47:09.621 --> 02:47:13.220
<v Speaker 1>that our religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we science people are built with</v>

3169
02:47:13.221 --> 02:47:17.870
<v Speaker 1>the same super normal responses in us</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the flying saucer people have in</v>

3170
02:47:17.871 --> 02:47:18.590
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3171
02:47:18.590 --> 02:47:22.970
<v Speaker 1>And that the Christians who still</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in the coming of the Kingdom of</v>

3172
02:47:22.970 --> 02:47:24.140
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't debate this.</v>

3173
02:47:24.141 --> 02:47:26.650
<v Speaker 1>This is not something like even what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>said so far is,</v>

3174
02:47:26.651 --> 02:47:28.040
<v Speaker 1>is out heresy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3175
02:47:28.041 --> 02:47:30.280
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of solute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harrison people would get angry at you.</v>

3176
02:47:30.410 --> 02:47:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one person did.</v>

3177
02:47:32.091 --> 02:47:33.920
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an astronomer,</v>

3178
02:47:34.250 --> 02:47:36.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would go on up to Canada for God</v>

3179
02:47:36.741 --> 02:47:39.410
<v Speaker 1>knows what reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book on the evolution of the</v>

3180
02:47:39.411 --> 02:47:41.090
<v Speaker 1>cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was brilliant.</v>

3181
02:47:41.390 --> 02:47:44.960
<v Speaker 1>My friend Eshel Been Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my colleague who was the head of the</v>

3182
02:47:44.961 --> 02:47:49.670
<v Speaker 1>physics department at the University of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tel Aviv and the head of the Physical</v>

3183
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Association of all physicists in</v>

3184
02:47:52.790 --> 02:47:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Israel where they have some pretty good</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicists said,</v>

3185
02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:57.410
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee will talk to you.</v>

3186
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:59.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very open guy.</v>

3187
02:47:59.630 --> 02:48:02.210
<v Speaker 1>And when I got hold of Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget his last name,</v>

3188
02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:05.360
<v Speaker 1>but you would recognize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee sent me a note saying,</v>

3189
02:48:05.361 --> 02:48:06.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pleasure to meet you,</v>

3190
02:48:06.591 --> 02:48:09.740
<v Speaker 1>but that article that you are in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street Journal about climate was</v>

3191
02:48:09.741 --> 02:48:10.574
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate.</v>

3192
02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was something a little harsher than</v>

3193
02:48:12.771 --> 02:48:14.300
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3194
02:48:14.330 --> 02:48:18.770
<v Speaker 1>meaning you have sinned and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I watched this movement developed</v>

3195
02:48:18.771 --> 02:48:23.300
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning and it developed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>using conformity enforcers.</v>

3196
02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Will that Al Gore movie tipped it over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top.</v>

3197
02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:30.190
<v Speaker 1>It helped a lot of things that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>people had,</v>

3198
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:31.730
<v Speaker 1>they realized they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3199
02:48:31.731 --> 02:48:33.800
<v Speaker 1>if you want a virtue signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to get on board.</v>

3200
02:48:34.190 --> 02:48:35.023
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3201
02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:39.950
<v Speaker 1>what really put the environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement on the map was Earth Day and</v>

3202
02:48:39.951 --> 02:48:44.240
<v Speaker 1>the guy who pulled that off really</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled off an amazing pr stunt that was</v>

3203
02:48:44.241 --> 02:48:47.720
<v Speaker 1>just an astonishing pr stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that's what started it off,</v>

3204
02:48:47.870 --> 02:48:49.160
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3205
02:48:49.430 --> 02:48:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Because in the 1950s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was the head of the program</v>

3206
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:56.690
<v Speaker 1>committee at my high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I programmed in a guy who talked to us</v>

3207
02:48:56.691 --> 02:49:01.100
<v Speaker 1>about what was being done to Wales and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pictures were horrifying.</v>

3208
02:49:01.430 --> 02:49:05.200
<v Speaker 1>This guy was a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was about six foot two and and it</v>

3209
02:49:05.201 --> 02:49:09.660
<v Speaker 1>always days that was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really tall and he was most severe</v>

3210
02:49:09.661 --> 02:49:10.920
<v Speaker 1>person I'd ever met.</v>

3211
02:49:11.490 --> 02:49:15.540
<v Speaker 1>He walked in without acknowledging me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had booked him at all.</v>

3212
02:49:15.930 --> 02:49:18.810
<v Speaker 1>He had a frown on his face that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>

3213
02:49:19.470 --> 02:49:22.770
<v Speaker 1>He walked out with that same serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>frown,</v>

3214
02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:27.720
<v Speaker 1>uncompromising without saying goodbye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without saying thank you without any of</v>

3215
02:49:27.721 --> 02:49:31.800
<v Speaker 1>the normal social graces and he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a name for what he was doing.</v>

3216
02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Conservation was the name of what he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing back then and it was Earth Day.</v>

3217
02:49:36.871 --> 02:49:40.680
<v Speaker 1>That put another word on the map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentalism and that God</v>

3218
02:49:40.681 --> 02:49:45.000
<v Speaker 1>environmentalism into first grades and</v>
<v Speaker 1>second grades and fourth grades.</v>

3219
02:49:45.001 --> 02:49:48.540
<v Speaker 1>When kids are at an imprinting age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when their brains are little relieving</v>

3220
02:49:48.541 --> 02:49:52.920
<v Speaker 1>fashioned around some of the key things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they absorb at that age.</v>

3221
02:49:53.070 --> 02:49:56.340
<v Speaker 1>When we talk about impressionable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a certain element of</v>

3222
02:49:56.341 --> 02:49:59.790
<v Speaker 1>the morphology of the brain that wraps</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself around certain things and then</v>

3223
02:49:59.791 --> 02:50:03.480
<v Speaker 1>never lets them go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And environmentalism was built to get</v>

3224
02:50:03.481 --> 02:50:05.970
<v Speaker 1>into the brains of young people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>never leave.</v>

3225
02:50:06.690 --> 02:50:11.690
<v Speaker 1>And eventually environmentalism</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed its own end of the earth</v>

3226
02:50:12.750 --> 02:50:16.470
<v Speaker 1>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tried to develop one in 1968 when</v>

3227
02:50:16.471 --> 02:50:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Paul Ehrlich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a butterfly specialist,</v>

3228
02:50:20.050 --> 02:50:24.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that by 1980 which rimmer in 1968</v>

3229
02:50:24.661 --> 02:50:27.300
<v Speaker 1>was 12 years away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's like my talking about</v>

3230
02:50:27.301 --> 02:50:32.301
<v Speaker 1>something that will happen in 2030.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed a long ways away and he said</v>

3231
02:50:34.141 --> 02:50:37.830
<v Speaker 1>by 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by 1980 we would get to the point where</v>

3232
02:50:37.831 --> 02:50:40.770
<v Speaker 1>there were so many people on the planet</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we'd have to stand on each other's</v>

3233
02:50:40.771 --> 02:50:42.840
<v Speaker 1>shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There would be no room for us.</v>

3234
02:50:43.080 --> 02:50:47.200
<v Speaker 1>We would vastly outstrip the carrying</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity of the universe,</v>

3235
02:50:47.250 --> 02:50:51.690
<v Speaker 1>meaning the food supply would run out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would not be able to keep up with our</v>

3236
02:50:51.691 --> 02:50:54.060
<v Speaker 1>population growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence,</v>

3237
02:50:54.061 --> 02:50:57.240
<v Speaker 1>in the early 1980s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would die by the hundreds of</v>

3238
02:50:57.240 --> 02:51:00.960
<v Speaker 1>millions in India and China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even the United States now.</v>

3239
02:51:01.140 --> 02:51:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Rumor back to those days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

3240
02:51:03.061 --> 02:51:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3241
02:51:05.250 --> 02:51:10.080
<v Speaker 1>You were probably born after it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did remember all the hundreds of</v>

3242
02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:13.260
<v Speaker 1>millions of people dying in India and</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and the United States.</v>

3243
02:51:13.261 --> 02:51:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Remember how your parents had a stand on</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other's shoulders in order to find</v>

3244
02:51:16.651 --> 02:51:19.050
<v Speaker 1>room to live and I don't recall that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

3245
02:51:19.500 --> 02:51:23.010
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand so much like the</v>

3246
02:51:23.011 --> 02:51:24.960
<v Speaker 1>apocalyptic cults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They moved the goalposts.</v>

3247
02:51:24.990 --> 02:51:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3248
02:51:26.220 --> 02:51:30.240
<v Speaker 1>And so now it's climate change and</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally it was global warming and</v>

3249
02:51:30.241 --> 02:51:33.390
<v Speaker 1>then they smartened up to the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they better cover their ass just in case</v>

3250
02:51:33.391 --> 02:51:37.230
<v Speaker 1>we had an ice age instead of warming and</v>
<v Speaker 1>glass.</v>

3251
02:51:37.260 --> 02:51:42.000
<v Speaker 1>What is the planet of global warming and</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change?</v>

3252
02:51:42.030 --> 02:51:43.210
<v Speaker 1>This one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3253
02:51:43.410 --> 02:51:46.440
<v Speaker 1>big time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they are right and they are wrong.</v>

3254
02:51:47.850 --> 02:51:51.330
<v Speaker 1>We need to do these climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>stabilization technologies.</v>

3255
02:51:51.450 --> 02:51:53.850
<v Speaker 1>We must,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've been doing them.</v>

3256
02:51:53.910 --> 02:51:57.420
<v Speaker 1>You said it best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been doing ever since we invented</v>

3257
02:51:57.720 --> 02:52:01.050
<v Speaker 1>the fur coat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which allowed us to get out of Africa</v>

3258
02:52:01.051 --> 02:52:03.330
<v Speaker 1>and go to the forest ends of Asia.</v>

3259
02:52:03.330 --> 02:52:08.010
<v Speaker 1>When we were still far from being modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans that uh,</v>

3260
02:52:08.050 --> 02:52:12.610
<v Speaker 1>the technology of the cave and beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the technology of the hot,</v>

3261
02:52:13.210 --> 02:52:16.420
<v Speaker 1>all these are climate stabilization</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies on a small scale.</v>

3262
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Now we need to do climate stabilization</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and our big soul scale.</v>

3263
02:52:20.560 --> 02:52:22.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does not mean that we have to put</v>

3264
02:52:22.391 --> 02:52:26.410
<v Speaker 1>software droplets into the atmosphere to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the sun from warming the surface of</v>

3265
02:52:26.411 --> 02:52:28.270
<v Speaker 1>the earth that we so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

3266
02:52:28.420 --> 02:52:33.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not a reversible move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you have a laser for her</v>

3267
02:52:33.850 --> 02:52:35.440
<v Speaker 1>harnessing space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solar power,</v>

3268
02:52:35.680 --> 02:52:39.520
<v Speaker 1>and you use it to redirect hurricanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see what worked the first time</v>

3269
02:52:39.521 --> 02:52:42.910
<v Speaker 1>and try something different the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and the third time until you</v>

3270
02:52:42.911 --> 02:52:47.170
<v Speaker 1>perfect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that with sulfur docs to</v>

3271
02:52:47.180 --> 02:52:49.760
<v Speaker 1>droplets Lutsen the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the stupidest things I've</v>

3272
02:52:49.761 --> 02:52:50.600
<v Speaker 1>ever heard in my life.</v>

3273
02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:55.250
<v Speaker 1>But that's the first solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological solution to come out of</v>

3274
02:52:55.251 --> 02:52:57.410
<v Speaker 1>all of their climate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's smells,</v>

3275
02:52:58.120 --> 02:52:59.900
<v Speaker 1>but we need to do what they're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

3276
02:52:59.901 --> 02:53:02.570
<v Speaker 1>We just have to take ownership of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Howard Bloom,</v>

3277
02:53:02.600 --> 02:53:04.220
<v Speaker 1>we've got to wrap this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

3278
02:53:04.221 --> 02:53:07.350
<v Speaker 1>very enjoyable conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm having really appreciate it.</v>

3279
02:53:07.400 --> 02:53:11.060
<v Speaker 1>I having a great deal of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you need me in the future,</v>
