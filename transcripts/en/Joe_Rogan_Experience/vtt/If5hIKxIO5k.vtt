00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.873
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.730
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that giving someone a gun makes them more likely to kill people.</v>

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if I buy that.</v>

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>When the La riots were going on,</v>

5
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.050
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people had their own personal firearms and uh,</v>

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>this guy I know he said he had to like go on the roof of his apartment with a</v>

7
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:25.250
<v Speaker 1>gun because they were trying to break into his house and stuff like that and he</v>

8
00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:29.960
<v Speaker 1>actually had to shoot somebody shot somebody in the arm or something like that.</v>

9
00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:30.794
<v Speaker 1>I think he said,</v>

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.173
<v Speaker 1>who is this guy?</v>

11
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.193
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say.</v>

12
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>It might be a bullshitter.</v>

13
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you off air a bullshitter.</v>

14
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

15
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.803
<v Speaker 1>absolutely not.</v>

16
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally,</v>

17
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.420
<v Speaker 1>never know.</v>

18
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>What's the dictates like</v>

19
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.973
<v Speaker 1>popcorn group,</v>

20
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.873
<v Speaker 1>your poop.</v>

21
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not that far away.</v>

22
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.620
<v Speaker 1>This is</v>

23
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

24
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 2>We don't even know.</v>

25
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know they're working on these things.</v>

26
00:00:57.921 --> 00:00:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows of them,</v>

27
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.050
<v Speaker 2>but yet they are like that close to going public and they're fucking.</v>

28
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has to swipe key cards before they go into the building.</v>

29
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 2>They check your bag,</v>

30
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.140
<v Speaker 2>they make sure you don't bring your phone.</v>

31
00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Your phone has to go into a bucket when you go into the,</v>

32
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 2>into the laboratory,</v>

33
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 2>because this is all propriety.</v>

34
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Proprietary Shit.</v>

35
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 2>They're checking their.</v>

36
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.820
<v Speaker 2>They probably have this fucking fake buttons that are really cameras and shit.</v>

37
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

38
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.071
<v Speaker 2>See your glasses.</v>

39
00:01:21.071 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to see?</v>

40
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.630
<v Speaker 2>Was fucking glasses glasses.</v>

41
00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Now they have glasses with little tiny cameras and I'm literally like so hard to</v>

42
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:27.410
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

43
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.970
<v Speaker 2>If you look at your selfie camera,</v>

44
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.540
<v Speaker 2>look how little that goddamn lenses like the selfie one,</v>

45
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.550
<v Speaker 2>like the one on the back is tiny,</v>

46
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:34.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

47
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Look at my iphone here,</v>

48
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.390
<v Speaker 2>but the one the front is fucking stupid.</v>

49
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Tiny.</v>

50
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 2>It's so little and it's good.</v>

51
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.070
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>

52
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.671
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

53
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 2>look how good a selfie camera is.</v>

54
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.521
<v Speaker 2>I mean they.</v>

55
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:50.600
<v Speaker 2>They do a fucking incredible job of capturing your image.</v>

56
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.733
<v Speaker 2>Like look at this,</v>

57
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.620
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

58
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

59
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.580
<v Speaker 2>That's a tiny ass little little pinpoint camera and it's got everyone in this</v>

60
00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 2>room to the point where you could broadcast periscope from this thing that's</v>

61
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 2>like a sharpie if you took a sharpie and dotted a page with it.</v>

62
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Just that's how big that cameras and yet it's crystal clear.</v>

63
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.740
<v Speaker 2>So that could be in your button.</v>

64
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 2>That could be in any.</v>

65
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.280
<v Speaker 2>If they're not physically patting you down,</v>

66
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.380
<v Speaker 2>you could easily have something like that going on.</v>

67
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

68
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:20.800
<v Speaker 1>The one I use in massage parlors looks like a car.</v>

69
00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:21.880
<v Speaker 1>A car alarm.</v>

70
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>See you're on the air kitchen.</v>

71
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh the fuck man.</v>

72
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.791
<v Speaker 1>But it's a video.</v>

73
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I filmed a 10 80 p,</v>

74
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>a film massage parlors.</v>

75
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

76
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.663
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

77
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

78
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.953
<v Speaker 1>I mean the one,</v>

79
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.671
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

81
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>it's like actually just looks like a little key chain,</v>

82
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:40.404
<v Speaker 1>but if it does,</v>

83
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.281
<v Speaker 1>it does 10,</v>

84
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:42.001
<v Speaker 1>80 p.</v>

85
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>like if you had a little memory card,</v>

86
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:45.630
<v Speaker 1>just put it in your computer and next thing you know,</v>

87
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:46.231
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

88
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:46.441
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

89
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>you got full video.</v>

90
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>You just put it on the nightstand next to it,</v>

91
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:50.071
<v Speaker 1>pointed towards it.</v>

92
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>The girl hats.</v>

93
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's really illegal though.</v>

94
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>

95
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.661
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it.</v>

96
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:57.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the only you do.</v>

97
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>There's other thing you were telling me where in Brazil or I</v>

98
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>thought was fascinating was that there,</v>

99
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.351
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

100
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 2>there's a new type of testosterone that they are making testosterone from Yams,</v>

101
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

102
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

103
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 2>That now they're doing it through animals.</v>

104
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

105
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:11.340
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

106
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

107
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.420
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

108
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

109
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 2>one of the most accurate test now to use is called the carbon isotope ratio test</v>

110
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 2>and what that's able to do is differentiate between natural testosterone which</v>

111
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 2>all men and women have in their body and foreign testosterone because there's a</v>

112
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 2>different carbon atom in that testosterone because it's made from a plant</v>

113
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 2>instead of an animal.</v>

114
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.813
<v Speaker 2>There's now,</v>

115
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 2>at least in research supply companies,</v>

116
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's approved for use,</v>

117
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 2>but there's animal based testosterone floating around which has the potential to</v>

118
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 2>possibly defeat a carbon isotope ratio tests because it has the same carbon atom</v>

119
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 2>as natural testosterone does.</v>

120
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Is there any hesitation and talking about these things because you worry that</v>

121
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 2>you might educate cheaters?</v>

122
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

123
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.951
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

124
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

125
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

126
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 2>I've always found that,</v>

127
00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 2>your credibility rises when you're forthright about what's going on.</v>

129
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

130
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 2>and [inaudible] on the other side of things,</v>

131
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

132
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.460
<v Speaker 2>the sciences,</v>

134
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

135
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 2>looking at these things and always coming up with new tests.</v>

136
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I think something that's fact,</v>

137
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 2>I just read it today,</v>

138
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.551
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

139
00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 2>and we do this in our program as well,</v>

140
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.673
<v Speaker 2>is uh,</v>

141
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 2>there was in cycling,</v>

142
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 2>they will freeze samples both urine and blood and keep them for years at a time</v>

143
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.100
<v Speaker 2>and cycling just recently went back and retested some of the frozen urine and</v>

144
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 2>blood from a few years ago,</v>

145
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

146
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 2>for a new drug with shade,</v>

147
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 2>just develop a test for and they were able to catch a guy from a couple of years</v>

148
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.861
<v Speaker 2>ago that had used it.</v>

149
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do that and UFC as well.</v>

150
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:41.314
<v Speaker 2>So even if,</v>

151
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

152
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 2>there's a new drug out there that,</v>

153
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

154
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.851
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>

155
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 2>chemists are saying there's no test for potentially a couple years down the line</v>

156
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:51.200
<v Speaker 2>when there is a test forward,</v>

157
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 2>we'd have the ability to go back and test that.</v>

158
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Now maybe that athletes no longer with the UFC are no longer competing at all</v>

159
00:04:57.191 --> 00:04:57.611
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

160
00:04:57.611 --> 00:04:58.760
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

161
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 2>there's still reputation and legacy at stake.</v>

162
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.111
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

163
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:02.711
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

164
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:06.730
<v Speaker 2>So the UFC is going to have like a giant meat locker filled with old blood and p</v>

165
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.580
<v Speaker 2>laboratories will have that.</v>

166
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

167
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.241
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

168
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:10.841
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

169
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 2>that's fascinating stuff.</v>

170
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:12.934
<v Speaker 2>But doesn't that.</v>

171
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.421
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

172
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:15.560
<v Speaker 2>there's a chain of evidence issue with that isn't there?</v>

173
00:05:15.561 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Which just sitting around in some sort of a lab somewhere.</v>

174
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.113
<v Speaker 2>What was.</v>

175
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

176
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 2>there'll be secure freezers where there is a chain of custody that goes along</v>

177
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:24.581
<v Speaker 2>with each sample.</v>

178
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:27.040
<v Speaker 2>So outside that freezer will be guard.</v>

179
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:27.840
<v Speaker 2>That's paperwork.</v>

180
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

181
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.600
<v Speaker 2>the water laboratories are very secure.</v>

182
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:32.434
<v Speaker 2>Laboratories is this,</v>

183
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to get in than before.</v>

184
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.141
<v Speaker 2>Tough.</v>

185
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:37.930
<v Speaker 2>You're signing off your life to get in one of those things.</v>

186
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:38.960
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

187
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.611
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

188
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:40.121
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

189
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 2>the chain of custody will be good,</v>

190
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

191
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.990
<v Speaker 2>going on indefinitely on those things.</v>

192
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.651
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

193
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 2>so far as you know,</v>

194
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:49.650
<v Speaker 2>this hasn't been approved where people haven't used this animal based</v>

195
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 2>testosterone yet.</v>

196
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's being used now.</v>

197
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 2>You believe it is?</v>

198
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

199
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>But he came to you out of nowhere and I've got to remember the job we came to</v>

200
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.800
<v Speaker 1>you out of here.</v>

201
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>You're just listening and boom,</v>

202
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 1>that's the home run that people remember because it wasn't thought about ahead</v>

203
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>of time was just listening to the mountain looking and you know,</v>

204
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>when you're roasting people listening is also looking like taking a good look at</v>

205
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>assessing exactly what's been put in front of you.</v>

206
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

207
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>when you were doing the prison thing and you talked to the guy and you said you</v>

208
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:22.150
<v Speaker 1>look at a combination of a child and a child molester.</v>

209
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

210
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 1>You're the rare person looks like a child and a child molester at the same time.</v>

211
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 1>And he did,</v>

212
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like he did.</v>

214
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:32.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

215
00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Nailed it there.</v>

216
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I just say try to say out loud what people normally would say behind people's</v>

217
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:37.784
<v Speaker 1>backs.</v>

218
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Hence the karate self defense.</v>

219
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I do remember early instances of hecklers before I knew anything about roasting.</v>

220
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 1>It was just a comedian,</v>

221
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:46.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:47.850
<v Speaker 1>usually emceeing,</v>

223
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

224
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>on the road or in Jersey,</v>

226
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:50.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

227
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:55.850
<v Speaker 1>or you had a lot of characters and in the audience.</v>

228
00:06:55.851 --> 00:07:00.851
<v Speaker 1>And I remember a few times people taking swings at me or just walking on stage.</v>

229
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I was working with rich vos at a firehouse,</v>

230
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I'd only been doing comedy a year or two,</v>

232
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.960
<v Speaker 1>and I opened for him at some sort of fundraiser to firehouse and</v>

233
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 1>I was about five minutes into my routine,</v>

234
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.040
<v Speaker 1>a Saturday night.</v>

235
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:18.290
<v Speaker 1>These firemen are in their firehouse.</v>

236
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:18.670
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

237
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.503
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

238
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:20.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

239
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 1>this is before there were any rules to anything as far as,</v>

240
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.661
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

242
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:28.970
<v Speaker 1>and they kept telling me,</v>

243
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 1>make fun of Larry,</v>

244
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 1>make fun of Larry.</v>

245
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:31.401
<v Speaker 1>He loves it.</v>

246
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Make Fun of Larry and I don't know who Larry is and you know,</v>

247
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 1>of course Larry turned out to be the biggest asshole on the planet who doesn't</v>

248
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 1>love it at all.</v>

249
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.940
<v Speaker 1>And he literally was gigantic and walked up on stage and took the microphone out</v>

250
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:44.490
<v Speaker 1>of my hand,</v>

251
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 1>put it in the mic stand and said,</v>

252
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.813
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

253
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

254
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Was the audience laughing before that?</v>

255
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

256
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they weren't laughing enough.</v>

257
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I just remember it being so hard and it just builds up.</v>

258
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:05.110
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna have to have thick skin and you got to be able to like stare.</v>

259
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.380
<v Speaker 1>You got to have confidence that you know you're,</v>

260
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 1>you're in the right.</v>
