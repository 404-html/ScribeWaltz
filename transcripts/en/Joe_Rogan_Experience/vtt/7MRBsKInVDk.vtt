<v Speaker 1>we would go play ball on this league and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then afterwards we'd go to a bar and</v>

<v Speaker 1>cheetos and you'll wipe the finger dust</v>

<v Speaker 1>the game in a totally different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 2>unapologetic man who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank God there's so few.</v>

48
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a hard time to be</v>

49
00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.171
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And shame on you say that.</v>

51
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.720
<v Speaker 1>If you say that people like booth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

52
00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to be a man with all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>male privilege.</v>

53
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cisgendered males complaining.</v>

54
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.510
<v Speaker 1>But how hard it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was being judged folks from all judged</v>

55
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 1>harshly white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight male and the literal enemy,</v>

56
00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:19.750
<v Speaker 1>public enemy number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now I walk around,</v>

57
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.360
<v Speaker 1>you are the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're automatically a rapist and a</v>

58
00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:26.080
<v Speaker 1>massage therapist and an ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maniacal money,</v>

59
00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:27.040
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>driven,</v>

60
00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:29.290
<v Speaker 1>bad human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucked up.</v>

61
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 2>This is how ridiculous it's gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an article,</v>

62
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still complaining about being a</v>

63
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was an article that I just read that</v>

64
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:40.770
<v Speaker 2>was advocating that women should never</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to prison.</v>

65
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's stop putting women in prison.</v>

66
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if he could find that would fund.</v>

67
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea was that women are suppressed</v>

68
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 2>and they already represents such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>significantly small portion of the u s</v>

69
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:57.850
<v Speaker 2>population that really needs no for</v>

70
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>heinous crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't then they don't deserve</v>

71
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.640
<v Speaker 3>the same punishment as other people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have heinous crimes.</v>

72
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 3>The number of women hit men would just</v>
<v Speaker 3>go through the fucking roof.</v>

73
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:06.304
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My God,</v>

74
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.940
<v Speaker 3>if they couldn't be arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

75
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much.</v>

76
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 3>So much domestic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's like saying,</v>

77
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you're saying,</v>

78
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 3>if that's what that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's the article is trying to say</v>

79
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 3>then then say any other repress group in</v>
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>

80
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 3>then then minorities can't go to prison</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

81
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 3>That's the same logic day represent a</v>
<v Speaker 3>much larger percentage though.</v>

82
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 3>So the thing there she saying about</v>
<v Speaker 3>women is there so few women in prison</v>

83
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 3>already and women are like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their behaviors due to the fact they've</v>

84
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 3>been suppressed by men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

85
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my gosh.</v>

86
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Well it's just the idea of us being on</v>
<v Speaker 3>two teams is so crazy.</v>

87
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 3>The penis team and the vagina team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that simple.</v>

88
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 3>Shirts and skins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that simple,</v>

89
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're all,</v>

90
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.950
<v Speaker 3>all people on your side are good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All people in our side of the bed.</v>

91
00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Do you know how fucking crazy that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane that,</v>

92
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 3>well that's what I said like um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to sound like I'm plugging my</v>

93
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 3>special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in my special,</v>

94
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 3>I talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was shot in Chicago where I'm from and</v>

95
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 3>at the time there was a lot going on in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chicago as there always is a lot of cop</v>

96
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 3>shootings and I think there's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an immediate uproar of like fuck</v>

97
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 3>cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I hate that because I've cops in my</v>

98
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 3>family and you can't just blanket</v>
<v Speaker 3>statement an entire thing.</v>

99
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.840
<v Speaker 3>Just like you can't blanket an entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>race of people,</v>

100
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 3>sex class of people and say you're all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same.</v>

101
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 3>That's the same thing as saying like</v>
<v Speaker 3>every cop is a bad person.</v>

102
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Like are you out of your fucking mind?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Green was millions of police officers</v>

103
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 3>that are great people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You happen to hear stories about bad</v>

104
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 3>humans that happens in any industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

105
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 3>And honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it statistically like the</v>

106
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 3>number of bad cops versus the number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>cops,</v>

107
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 3>and then you have to break down the</v>
<v Speaker 3>number of interactions cops have with</v>

108
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's stunning.</v>

109
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.910
<v Speaker 3>Have you been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you met people?</v>

110
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 3>They're awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are fucking awful.</v>

111
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine every day who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but imagine how awful they are.</v>

112
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 3>If you are a professional enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know that you're just a person just</v>

113
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.870
<v Speaker 3>like them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're pulling this guy over,</v>

114
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 3>this guy's done a crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know he's going to lie to you and</v>

115
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 3>you're the enemy and you don't even know</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking guy.</v>

116

<v Speaker 3>haven't seen that video.</v>

135
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that they're terrified</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're going to be the next guy</v>

136
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 3>that's on some fucking youtube clip that</v>
<v Speaker 3>to comics are talking about on a podcast</v>

137
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 3>because it could happen easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time you pull the guy over,</v>

138
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 3>your life's on the line and the stress</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that is ungodly and we expect them to</v>

139
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 3>manage it like robots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We expect them to be like no person</v>

140
00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:56.870
<v Speaker 3>we've ever met,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

141
00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 3>Where just no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No stress.</v>

142
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 3>If you're a fucking accountant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the worst shit that can happen</v>

143
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 3>to you once you're in the office?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Printer breaks almost nothing is life</v>

144
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:07.874
<v Speaker 3>threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

145
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Microsoft Excel crashed this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's going crazy in fucking</v>

146
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 3>accounting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beat cop,</v>

147
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same way with,</v>

148
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

149
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 3>I know this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all this has been said,</v>

150
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 3>but the way we treat veterans and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

151
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up with a kid who was a really</v>

152
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 3>close friend of mine.</v>

153
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 3>They killed himself a couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

154
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.880
<v Speaker 3>It was a veteran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the expectation of the</v>

155
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:33.881
<v Speaker 3>return to normalcy is not only it</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous and insane request,</v>

156
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.260
<v Speaker 3>but it's just so illogical that that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

157
00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 3>that's not approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

158
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people can't come back from any</v>

159
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 3>sort of combat and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just be pushed back into the real</v>

160
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:44.151
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

161
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:44.631
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're good.</v>

162
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're good.</v>

163
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 3>Did we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you turn off the switch when you</v>

164
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:48.750
<v Speaker 3>landed back in the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

165
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 3>And it was just a little toggle in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>head and then I'm good now I should go</v>

166
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 3>get a regular job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess John,</v>

167
00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 3>the just the lack of responsibility that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have for like taking care of those</v>

168
00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

169
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.720
<v Speaker 3>The lack of a emphasis on psychological</v>
<v Speaker 3>recovery on a giving them coping skills,</v>

170
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.741
<v Speaker 3>mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

171
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 3>that's a biggest issue in the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

172
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 3>I say that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's so much lack of help</v>

173
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:14.240
<v Speaker 3>for mental health dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see it so constantly in so many</v>

174
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 3>different facets now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's coming out more because of</v>

175
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 3>the Internet because you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

176
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 3>violent crimes and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

177
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.990
<v Speaker 3>and you see where mental health has kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of led our country now.</v>

178
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.320
<v Speaker 3>There should be a bigger focus on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did I had a psychiatrist in the podcast</v>

179
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:29.880
<v Speaker 3>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kelly Brogan who uh,</v>

180
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.840
<v Speaker 3>she wrote a book called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it called?</v>

181
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 3>The mind of your own mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your own is the name of rubella.</v>

182
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 3>We talked all about these psychiatric</v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs and when they prescribed them and</v>

183
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 3>why they prescribed and what are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>side effects and how easily they</v>

184
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:42.134
<v Speaker 3>prescribed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

185
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 3>And how so many of these same exact</v>
<v Speaker 3>symptoms can be cured by exercise and</v>

186
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 3>diet and they don't even advocate that.</v>

187
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 3>And she's talking about like how</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible it is like her coming from a</v>

188
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 3>background of psychiatry being an md,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going through the whole training thing,</v>

189
00:07:56.901 --> 00:07:59.420
<v Speaker 3>writing a book about it and you realize</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Oh my God,</v>

190
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 3>they're just doping people up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

191
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's easy fix man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want short term,</v>

192
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.490
<v Speaker 3>short term solution as fast as you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>working out and exercise sounds like</v>

193
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:10.070
<v Speaker 3>such a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like a marathon and they just,</v>

194
00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:11.960
<v Speaker 3>they're like give me the theme of the 40</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yard Dash.</v>

195
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.270
<v Speaker 3>Like what can we do to get them in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 yard dash and they're like here,</v>

196
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 3>take this pill and that that changes</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

197
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Just the disassociative quality of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>pills are so dangerous and we just hand</v>

198
00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:23.190
<v Speaker 3>them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not we obviously you and I aren't</v>

199
00:08:23.191 --> 00:08:24.880
<v Speaker 3>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but someone's not as far as their</v>

200
00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:25.910
<v Speaker 3>audience knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't do it.</v>

201
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.290
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you're a guy right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>work at first pharmaceutical company and</v>

202
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:33.490
<v Speaker 3>every day you read the news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see some fucking mass killing.</v>

203
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.190
<v Speaker 3>Please don't let it be on our shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please don't let them be Pfizer every</v>

204
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like rolling the dice online.</v>

205
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.570
<v Speaker 3>Hope hoping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't some guy on one of their</v>

206
00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:44.000
<v Speaker 3>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was talking about how the numbers of</v>

207
00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 3>people that commit these mass killings</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are on drugs,</v>

208
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.190
<v Speaker 3>they're on psych,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive,</v>

209
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 3>some sort of cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical drugs.</v>

210
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.310
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

211
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:54.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like a hundred percent yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well let me get,</v>

212
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 3>let me get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me give you something.</v>

213
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 3>This is how powerful</v>

214
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 1>that world is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably shouldn't say this,</v>

215
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 1>but I'm with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't really give a shit,</v>

216
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.890
<v Speaker 1>but on the only one thing I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to talk about,</v>

217
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.090
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but specifically say on my showtime</v>

218
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.840
<v Speaker 1>special was about accutane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want an accutane when I was a kid.</v>

219
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you know this drug?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what?</v>

220
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit dry.</v>

221
00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:13.874
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

222
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's unbelievably unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

223
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 1>It's caused a lot of suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People got real fucked up from it.</v>

224
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 1>So it caused a lot of chemical and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental reaction that they didn't</v>

225
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 1>anticipate for youth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youthful,</v>

226
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids under 18 with underdeveloped</v>

227
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 1>brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you used to have sign a form to say I</v>

228
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:32.340
<v Speaker 1>can die from this medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a risk of death.</v>

229
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 1>That was a real thing for pimple</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>

230
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.470
<v Speaker 1>But on the special showtimes lawyers</v>
<v Speaker 1>called us and said,</v>

231
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I can mention the company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't say the joke.</v>

232
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

233
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.300
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know what accutane was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was developed in the eighties and the</v>

234
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 1>nineties to kill acne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people and they,</v>

235
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't say that.</v>

236
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.420
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't I say that's a,</v>

237
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guys,</v>

238
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyers were like,</v>

239
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.700
<v Speaker 1>there are massive sponsor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

240
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.290
<v Speaker 1>That was the crooked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the control.</v>

241
00:09:58.291 --> 00:09:59.950
<v Speaker 1>They were like the first of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>

242
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Showtime didn't have any sponsors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CBS,</v>

243
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.150
<v Speaker 1>CBS is their mothership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Viacom.</v>

244
00:10:06.151 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also a spite thing.</v>

245
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the only thing that they were</v>

246
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just can't say that,</v>

247
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 1>which has a respectively removed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I was like,</v>

248
00:10:13.261 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 1>I didn't need that piece anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>

249
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 1>that's so weird that they are that</v>
<v Speaker 1>meticulous about this one small thing</v>

250
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.450
<v Speaker 1>because they wanted to cover up the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people,</v>

251
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.520
<v Speaker 1>people used to die from it.</v>

252
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.840
<v Speaker 1>People want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids who are,</v>

253
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 1>who are the most insecure point of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

254
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.170
<v Speaker 1>You've got shit all over your face and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just want to fix it with a pill.</v>

255
00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Cause you want to feel better about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

256
00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:37.551
<v Speaker 1>You're already so vulnerable and ugly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and weird and they're willing to risk</v>

257
00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 1>their life for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this company won't recognize that</v>

258
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.270
<v Speaker 1>that was a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

259
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.990
<v Speaker 1>what numbers of people died off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was at one point I,</v>

260
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like three kids.</v>

261
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it made national news cause there's like</v>

262
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 1>three kids in a row committed suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a consecutive like three young</v>

263
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet boom that committed suicide.</v>

264
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.150
<v Speaker 1>And of course you can't just attribute</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to one thing.</v>

265
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you can point a finger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say that's what it was,</v>

266
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:04.200
<v Speaker 1>but there's enough evidence surrounding</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that that made the company</v>

267
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.650
<v Speaker 1>put more legal action behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

268
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 1>release forms from when you take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>

269
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowadays I think it's,</v>

270
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I think there's different levels of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't give to people under,</v>

271
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 1>under 16 or a certain age because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength of the medication.</v>

272
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

273
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Because all I wanted to do was not be</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly anymore.</v>

274
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:24.000
<v Speaker 1>So what did it do to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's funny,</v>

275
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:26.880
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It cleared my skin up and I never had to</v>

276
00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:28.890
<v Speaker 1>take it over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people that did it two or three</v>

277
00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:31.180
<v Speaker 1>times and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

278
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.600
<v Speaker 1>it gave me a lot of joy because I felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine again.</v>

279
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had such bad acne.</v>

280
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I say I had such bad acne when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid that it made me not believe in God.</v>

281
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

282
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.200
<v Speaker 1>nothing exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm alone on this earth.</v>

283
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.720
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I was the ugliest person to</v>

284
00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 1>ever walk the planet because you felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

285
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 1>So this thing [inaudible] it fixed me so</v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak.</v>

286
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:52.350
<v Speaker 1>It made me feel like everything was good</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

287
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 1>which is gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's how</v>

288
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.370
<v Speaker 3>like shallow we are kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause you're just like so vulnerable</v>

289
00:11:57.371 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 3>around your peers.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just want to be normal.</v>

291
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.480
<v Speaker 3>When you're like 16 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a horrible acne attack,</v>

<v Speaker 3>The only thing what,</v>

370
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.830
<v Speaker 3>what changed it for me was exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

371
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I started,</v>

372
00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started like really heavily working</v>

373
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:38.860
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of went away like towards like</v>

374
00:15:38.861 --> 00:15:42.410
<v Speaker 3>17 and 18 by the time I was 18 and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped.</v>

375
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.210
<v Speaker 3>But man for for that 15 and 16 it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

376
00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:49.070
<v Speaker 3>Well I played sports all through high</v>
<v Speaker 3>school so that was an issue cause it was</v>

377
00:15:49.071 --> 00:15:51.710
<v Speaker 3>always sweating and it was making him to</v>
<v Speaker 3>exacerbate it made it worse.</v>

378
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.060
<v Speaker 3>And then in college all I did was work</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and didn't play a lot active sports.</v>

379
00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:57.980
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that time it was all cleared up and</v>

380
00:15:57.981 --> 00:15:59.600
<v Speaker 3>I was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in high school was just like,</v>

381
00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 3>I did everything to make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everything possible.</v>

382
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Everybody would get a sunburn to kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>their zits.</v>

383
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.150
<v Speaker 3>Remember that we'll look at me.</v>

384
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.520

<v Speaker 3>I would get cancer and get worse skin.</v>

475
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.640
<v Speaker 4>He told you to jerk off and swear to God</v>
<v Speaker 4>and tell me what time,</v>

<v Speaker 4>he said at 2022 I want you to come close</v>

480
00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:09.970

<v Speaker 4>If you're talking about a guy jerking</v>

481
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.650
<v Speaker 4>off and you're telling them how to do it</v>
<v Speaker 4>during military tiny 22 I want to watch</v>

482
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:14.310
<v Speaker 4>no dude.</v>

483
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.930
<v Speaker 4>This guy said it was a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not kidding.</v>

484
00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:18.990
<v Speaker 4>He said it was a build up of semen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My Dad flew into town because he was</v>

485
00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:20.730
<v Speaker 4>concerned cause I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

486
00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:21.600
<v Speaker 4>it freaked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

487
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:24.930
<v Speaker 4>I have this thing on my nut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went to the best doctor we could find</v>

488
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.740
<v Speaker 4>and the guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should fucking have this other dude.</v>

489
00:20:28.741 --> 00:20:31.410
<v Speaker 4>Like get his medical license removed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

490
00:20:31.411 --> 00:20:33.600
<v Speaker 4>this is spilled up of semen is</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely incorrect.</v>

491
00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:36.330
<v Speaker 4>This is a cyst on your testicle is not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

492
00:20:36.331 --> 00:20:37.560
<v Speaker 4>it's benign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's you're fine.</v>

493
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:39.970
<v Speaker 4>But the fact that that's someone on</v>
<v Speaker 4>campus,</v>

494
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.570
<v Speaker 4>like a campus doctor told you that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a real medical professional.</v>

495
00:20:42.571 --> 00:20:44.670
<v Speaker 4>He was probably high out of his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eight out of his fucking,</v>

496
00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:46.410
<v Speaker 4>I went to Arizona state so he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking lost.</v>

497
00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just a dude.</v>

498
00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 4>They</v>

499
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.550
<v Speaker 3>found that morning at the bus stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't even make sense to me.</v>

500
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:54.270
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have no medical training.</v>

501
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.211
<v Speaker 3>He said it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

502
00:20:55.211 --> 00:20:58.570
<v Speaker 3>there's no chance send in video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>

503
00:20:58.571 --> 00:20:59.770
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a video of it.</v>

504
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.120
<v Speaker 3>That's what I want you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to take your nuts and hold</v>

505
00:21:04.121 --> 00:21:07.780
<v Speaker 3>them over a lamp so I could see through</v>
<v Speaker 3>your nuts and then take as many pictures</v>

506
00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:09.160
<v Speaker 3>as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No filter.</v>

507
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to bring in a couple other</v>
<v Speaker 3>boys in here.</v>

508
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.750
<v Speaker 3>Young boys don't use filters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that?</v>

509
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.210
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that movie tickled?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that documentary tickled?</v>

510
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.140
<v Speaker 3>I have not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it keeps getting recommended some.</v>

511
00:21:18.141 --> 00:21:20.830
<v Speaker 3>We're all going to have to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unreal.</v>

512
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.100
<v Speaker 3>If blows your fucking mind how these</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys were tricked into this.</v>

513
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.170
<v Speaker 3>It's as simple as young actors being</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

514
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:28.990
<v Speaker 3>you gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta just make a living.</v>

515
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.150
<v Speaker 3>Can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you let another guy tickle you on</v>

516
00:21:31.151 --> 00:21:34.630
<v Speaker 3>the Internet for five minutes for a $100</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these young kids were like,</v>

517
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.210
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had friends get hit on by guys</v>

518
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.550
<v Speaker 3>during casting sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just all,</v>

519
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:41.470
<v Speaker 3>just straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you want to fuck.</v>

520
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've had friends,</v>

521
00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:47.080
<v Speaker 3>like literally get propositioned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a few friends get propositioned</v>

522
00:21:47.081 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 3>by some very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very famous,</v>

523
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.620
<v Speaker 3>very famous people that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come to so's house.</v>

524
00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.200
<v Speaker 3>No one will know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one will say anything.</v>

525
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.690
<v Speaker 3>But as a in the public eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people think they're straight.</v>

526
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.990
<v Speaker 3>There's such a leap man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're a dude and you're straight</v>

527
00:22:01.991 --> 00:22:02.741
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

528
00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:05.940
<v Speaker 3>how much money is that really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

529
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:10.900
<v Speaker 3>that is the crazy leap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I honestly absolutely firmly</v>

530
00:22:10.901 --> 00:22:14.320
<v Speaker 3>believe that prostitution should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal when you're 100% it doesn't make</v>

531
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:16.960
<v Speaker 3>any sense that you can decide to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone for free.</v>

532
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.050
<v Speaker 3>And we all agree that nobody got hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if some,</v>

533
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:25.110
<v Speaker 3>for some reason there's something wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>with like someone paying you to jerk</v>

534
00:22:25.301 --> 00:22:26.470
<v Speaker 3>them off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why?</v>

535
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:26.860
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

536
00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.290
<v Speaker 3>What's the hires?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine?</v>

537
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Do you imagine if fucking tiger woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if tiger woods could have had</v>

538
00:22:33.671 --> 00:22:36.040
<v Speaker 3>prostitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this would have never gotten exposed.</v>

539
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.380
<v Speaker 3>Do you think if that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if prostitution was legal and it was</v>

540
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:41.110
<v Speaker 3>kind of not a full pot thing in society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think he would have never had</v>

541
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:45.370
<v Speaker 3>this moment of collapse in his career?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would change the way we look at sex.</v>

542
00:22:45.371 --> 00:22:48.520
<v Speaker 3>If prostitution was legal like right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

543
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:52.780
<v Speaker 3>it's so illegal and it's been illegal</v>
<v Speaker 3>for so long that if someone,</v>

544
00:22:52.781 --> 00:22:56.500
<v Speaker 3>male or female has someone pay them for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex,</v>

545
00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:57.880
<v Speaker 3>you're a whore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

546
00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a label right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we know for a fact that there's gold</v>

547
00:23:01.541 --> 00:23:03.460
<v Speaker 3>diggers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like gold diggers are real,</v>

548
00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:04.041
<v Speaker 3>but they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

<v Speaker 3>In my act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>

576
00:24:02.271 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She set the tone that's setting the</v>

577
00:24:03.771 --> 00:24:06.230
<v Speaker 3>fucking town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the gold standard of gold</v>

578
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.210
<v Speaker 1>diggers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

579
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.103
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

580
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.690
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's mourning.</v>

581
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.830
<v Speaker 3>Are there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is that not prostitution?</v>

582
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.020
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the funniest things</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody said.</v>

583
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.030
<v Speaker 3>Go back to that photo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zoom in on his face.</v>

584
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.300
<v Speaker 3>Look at how unhappy he looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's remarkable.</v>

585
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 3>This guy is so fucking old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't formulate a smile when he's</v>

586
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:27.560
<v Speaker 3>marrying a woman his age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think at the time she was a</v>

587
00:24:27.561 --> 00:24:30.620
<v Speaker 3>lesbian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she was just eating pussy and hanging</v>

588
00:24:30.621 --> 00:24:33.440
<v Speaker 3>out with him and she had to do like</v>
<v Speaker 3>marital relations with them.</v>

589
00:24:33.441 --> 00:24:35.390
<v Speaker 3>And when she would do the marital</v>
<v Speaker 3>relations with them,</v>

590
00:24:35.391 --> 00:24:36.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would just like tell them to go to</v>

591
00:24:36.921 --> 00:24:38.630
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does she,</v>

592
00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:40.040
<v Speaker 3>what does she got to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't fuck.</v>

593
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:40.874
<v Speaker 3>What does she got to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just that</v>

594
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:41.780
<v Speaker 1>tug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suck his dick.</v>

595
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I suck them exclusive.</v>

596
00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.780
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they have Viagara back then?</v>

597
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.400
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

598
00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.340
<v Speaker 3>I think they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we came up with the timeline for</v>

599
00:24:51.341 --> 00:24:53.350
<v Speaker 3>Viagara.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they came up with it for him</v>

600
00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 3>is all his research money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that close to Mary and Anna Nicole</v>

601
00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.870
<v Speaker 3>Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You piece of shit.</v>

602
00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:07.990
<v Speaker 3>Make something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep my tick hard for an hour and a</v>

603
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.240
<v Speaker 3>half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got $10 billion and not a lot of</v>

604
00:25:10.241 --> 00:25:13.030
<v Speaker 3>time and watch or listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You son of a bitch.</v>

605
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:15.820
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

606
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
<v Speaker 3>Good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go out with a bang or at least attempt</v>

607
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.640
<v Speaker 3>and attempted a bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he dead?</v>

608
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's dead as fuck.</v>

609
00:25:25.751 --> 00:25:27.440
<v Speaker 3>What'd he say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of Happiness data.</v>

610
00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.080
<v Speaker 3>Being a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He died in joy.</v>

611
00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.690
<v Speaker 3>The world blessed him in his final</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

612
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.210
<v Speaker 3>but that's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's totally legal.</v>

613
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.360
<v Speaker 3>Totally marry someone and have sex with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them for money as long as you marry them</v>

614
00:25:37.361 --> 00:25:40.960
<v Speaker 3>and then get to steal all their money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like a small transaction.</v>

615
00:25:40.961 --> 00:25:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Like if he could just pay her like for j</v>
<v Speaker 3>Howard Marshall,</v>

616
00:25:44.461 --> 00:25:48.340
<v Speaker 3>a multibillionaire type character up a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred grand's not out of the question.</v>

617
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.810
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

618
00:25:49.811 --> 00:25:52.600
<v Speaker 3>one evening for a hundred grand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like a worthy proposition.</v>

619
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:53.381
<v Speaker 1>Here's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

620
00:25:53.381 --> 00:25:54.210
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he's a b,</v>

621
00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:55.500
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone told me this recently,</v>

622
00:25:55.501 --> 00:25:56.880
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing.</v>

623
00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.330
<v Speaker 1>The different between a million and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion because I think in America we</v>

624
00:26:00.331 --> 00:26:02.280
<v Speaker 1>just kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even think about it.</v>

625
00:26:02.281 --> 00:26:03.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just hear it.</v>

626
00:26:03.001 --> 00:26:03.750
<v Speaker 1>You're like billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

627
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.800
<v Speaker 1>he must be a billionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

628
00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>

629
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.710
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's got to be a fucking billionaire</v>

630
00:26:07.711 --> 00:26:09.390
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the difference that people don't</v>

631
00:26:09.391 --> 00:26:13.350
<v Speaker 1>realize a million seconds is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is how many days would you guess?</v>

632
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.780
<v Speaker 1>A million seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done this before and I always</v>

633
00:26:15.781 --> 00:26:18.480
<v Speaker 1>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know a million second million?</v>

634
00:26:18.481 --> 00:26:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Second 30 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great guess.</v>

635
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

636
00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.380
<v Speaker 1>It's 11 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

637
00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Most people are fucking way off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's 11 days chance.</v>

638
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

639
00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.270
<v Speaker 1>A million seconds is 11 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many days is a billion seconds?</v>

640
00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.630
<v Speaker 1>How many 31 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

641
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:37.380
<v Speaker 1>11 days to 31 fucking years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

642
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.560
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when</v>

643
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.460
<v Speaker 3>trillion seconds is 31,000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when tries to fucking say like they</v>

644
00:26:44.461 --> 00:26:45.810
<v Speaker 3>understand what a billion is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

645
00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 3>you have no fucking idea what a billion</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

646
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Speaker 3>Up to billion is so beyond far away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

647
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.150
<v Speaker 3>as far as it's been explained to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've never researched this at all,</v>

648
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.800
<v Speaker 3>so I wonder if you could find this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone said to me that when you look at</v>

649
00:26:58.801 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 3>the richest man in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they look at like Warren Buffet and</v>

650
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Bill Gates and all those George Soros,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all or characters that they're not</v>

651
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:09.180
<v Speaker 3>really the richest men in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the real richest man in the world</v>

652
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.530
<v Speaker 3>are these Saudi guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

653
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:14.040
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of these oil guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're their monarchs and they</v>

654
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.860
<v Speaker 3>don't have to disclose their wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never do.</v>

655
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.900
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they're the CEO of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>corporation there.</v>

656
00:27:19.901 --> 00:27:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Their head of a royal family that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no government,</v>

657
00:27:22.561 --> 00:27:24.600
<v Speaker 3>any indication of what their earnings</v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

658
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.740
<v Speaker 3>So this dude who knows one of those cats</v>
<v Speaker 3>was telling me that he's probably a</v>

659
00:27:28.741 --> 00:27:31.260
<v Speaker 3>trillionaire fuck me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

660
00:27:31.261 --> 00:27:32.100
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

661
00:27:32.101 --> 00:27:33.510
<v Speaker 3>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

662
00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:33.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to,</v>

663
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.310
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know there was trillionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

664
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 3>it's very likely this guy might have</v>
<v Speaker 3>access to $1 trillion.</v>

665
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.920
<v Speaker 3>Because the only thing that we know is</v>
<v Speaker 3>our famous billionaires were infatuated</v>

666
00:27:43.921 --> 00:27:47.820
<v Speaker 3>with our billionaires that we kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>have as these social icons.</v>

667
00:27:47.821 --> 00:27:49.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Zuckerberg and these guys that are</v>

668
00:27:49.561 --> 00:27:51.540
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did something that we can recognize</v>

669
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.580
<v Speaker 3>these Saudi families that have had that</v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

670
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:56.130
<v Speaker 3>have had that money for a fucking long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

671
00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:57.420
<v Speaker 3>It's not new money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

672
00:27:57.421 --> 00:27:59.250
<v Speaker 3>this is old bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had,</v>

673
00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.280
<v Speaker 3>they had hundreds of millions 50 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

674
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now it's only accumulated into</v>

675
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.360
<v Speaker 3>billions of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they own,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's balling on a whole new level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's just new shit.</v>

692
00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.890
<v Speaker 3>One point 4 trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

693
00:28:58.891 --> 00:29:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Who is this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Rothschild Rothschild's.</v>

694
00:29:01.381 --> 00:29:02.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

695
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.100
<v Speaker 3>There's probably a bunch of those little</v>
<v Speaker 3>scoundrels running around taking a piece</v>

696
00:29:05.101 --> 00:29:07.250
<v Speaker 3>of that pie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's a,</v>

697
00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:12.270
<v Speaker 3>so a billion is a thousand million</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand 700 trillion.</v>

698
00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:18.690
<v Speaker 3>The rothschilds estimated between 1</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion and 700 trillion.</v>

699
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:20.490
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about you do a better job?</v>

700
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I could do as good a job of estimating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that no shit.</v>

701
00:29:25.111 --> 00:29:27.390
<v Speaker 3>That's so far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably a kazillion.</v>

702
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:31.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you ask a kid how much a</v>
<v Speaker 3>car is and they're like eight $8 and</v>

703
00:29:31.681 --> 00:29:32.041
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

704
00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:33.600
<v Speaker 3>it's like $8.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how much cars are.</v>

705
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.950
<v Speaker 3>$8 hundred dollars yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

706
00:29:35.951 --> 00:29:37.210
<v Speaker 3>It is a Mercedes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

707
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.620
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck could they have such</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible like gap in there?</v>

708
00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 3>They're guesstimate.</v>

709
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gotta be key that see those kind</v>

710
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 1>of old families that have been around</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that long,</v>

711
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:51.270
<v Speaker 1>you know that they hide money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like when they say x amount</v>

712
00:29:51.791 --> 00:29:54.550
<v Speaker 1>of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because that's what they've been</v>

713
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:57.130
<v Speaker 1>told this for so many sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to know that.</v>

714
00:29:57.131 --> 00:29:58.400
<v Speaker 1>You know the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Guy George Soros,</v>

715
00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.910
<v Speaker 3>do you know who that is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got to bring them back in</v>

716
00:29:59.911 --> 00:30:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the name,</v>

717
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.570
<v Speaker 3>because everyone brings it up when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about like anyone on the rights.</v>

718
00:30:04.571 --> 00:30:08.380
<v Speaker 3>I like Alex Jones and said that George</v>
<v Speaker 3>Soros was making the marijuana stronger</v>

719
00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.960
<v Speaker 3>from mind control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take it once a year.</v>

720
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.450
<v Speaker 3>I smoked marijuana to test the</v>
<v Speaker 3>efficiency.</v>

721
00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.350
<v Speaker 3>I like how he's the gauge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do it for America.</v>

722
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will smoke.</v>

723
00:30:18.371 --> 00:30:21.150
<v Speaker 3>He says he's functioning once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that during his custody trial</v>

724
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:22.061
<v Speaker 3>once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

725
00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 3>Just once a year to test its potency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's George Soros.</v>

726
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:30.370
<v Speaker 3>So I party with his kid one time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>25.2 billion.</v>

727
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.300
<v Speaker 3>I party with this kid</v>

728
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:36.450
<v Speaker 1>time with one of these Hollywood things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've never seen someone so,</v>

729
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.230
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not gonna say anything negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>about him and I just never seen that</v>

730
00:30:40.231 --> 00:30:41.460
<v Speaker 1>kind of money firsthand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

731
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I'd never known a billionaire I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>been friends with a billionaire and this</v>

732
00:30:44.461 --> 00:30:49.350
<v Speaker 1>kid was so lucid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was almost as if he's not living now</v>

733
00:30:49.351 --> 00:30:50.550
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just kind of go,</v>

734
00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.230
<v Speaker 1>it's just flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so floating.</v>

735
00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like whatever happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

736
00:30:53.371 --> 00:30:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you staying while you're here?</v>

737
00:30:54.481 --> 00:30:55.740
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these guys,</v>

738
00:30:55.741 --> 00:30:56.880
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

739
00:30:56.881 --> 00:30:58.230
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have suitcases and shit.</v>

740
00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:59.280
<v Speaker 1>You're in town from New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

741
00:30:59.281 --> 00:31:00.150
<v Speaker 1>are you not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

742
00:31:00.151 --> 00:31:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking,</v>

743
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to figure it out.</v>

744
00:31:02.791 --> 00:31:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I guess bounce around a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just like there is no,</v>

745
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.160
<v Speaker 1>there's no groundedness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're that rich,</v>

746
00:31:08.161 --> 00:31:09.240
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

747
00:31:09.241 --> 00:31:12.780
<v Speaker 1>I can do anything all the time forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no source of</v>

748
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.420
<v Speaker 3>repetitiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

749
00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a good thing.</v>

750
00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.410
<v Speaker 3>It's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

751
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.170
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

752
00:31:20.171 --> 00:31:25.171
<v Speaker 3>I would think the only way you would get</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kid through that is you got to take</v>

753
00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:27.820
<v Speaker 3>them to sports or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to get them involved in some</v>

754
00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:29.560
<v Speaker 3>adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got to lose at something.</v>

755
00:31:29.561 --> 00:31:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>

756
00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:31.760
<v Speaker 3>If you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you lose it,</v>

757
00:31:31.761 --> 00:31:31.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

758
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you start to understand how human</v>

759
00:31:34.581 --> 00:31:35.780
<v Speaker 1>you are when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

760
00:31:35.781 --> 00:31:38.240
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people better than me at</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many fucking things,</v>

761
00:31:38.241 --> 00:31:40.100
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're given everything,</v>

762
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:41.480
<v Speaker 1>you never lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never,</v>

763
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:43.850
<v Speaker 1>you never heard no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no negative in your life.</v>

764
00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get any sense of fucking,</v>

765
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any normalcy or anything grounded in</v>

766
00:31:49.971 --> 00:31:51.230
<v Speaker 1>your hands when you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and that's okay and that's terrible and</v>

769
00:31:56.841 --> 00:31:59.180
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

770
00:31:59.181 --> 00:32:01.610
<v Speaker 1>spectrum of in the social world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why so many rich kids are</v>

771
00:32:01.611 --> 00:32:04.490
<v Speaker 1>socially so fucking awkward because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>never had to,</v>

949
00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 3>color pattern or the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a bunch of different kinds of</v>

979
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.650
<v Speaker 2>in the wild and seeing them move around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems so different than seeing</v>

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:45.000
<v Speaker 1>it felt so fake when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking,</v>

1039
00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.270
<v Speaker 1>I remember getting older and asking my</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad if it happened because I thought,</v>

1040
00:42:48.271 --> 00:42:48.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in your childhood sometimes you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did I see that in a fucking thing?</v>

1042
00:42:51.541 --> 00:42:53.100
<v Speaker 1>And that it wasn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1043
00:42:53.101 --> 00:42:55.830
<v Speaker 1>and you formulate these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories in your brain as a kid cause</v>

00:45:17.011 --> 00:45:17.844
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1103
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.370
<v Speaker 3>They don't know if he was drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1104
00:45:20.371 --> 00:45:22.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when he got caught either,</v>

1105
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.290
<v Speaker 3>but it was a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was in the news and I remember it was</v>

1106
00:45:25.291 --> 00:45:26.030
<v Speaker 3>in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1107
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:29.820
<v Speaker 3>I was delivering newspapers at the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I saw it like in the newspapers that</v>

1108
00:45:29.821 --> 00:45:32.820
<v Speaker 3>I was delivering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird to have known someone and</v>

1109
00:45:32.821 --> 00:45:36.000
<v Speaker 3>then know that they ran over somebody in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a car and then dragged it around.</v>

1110
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know him well,</v>

1111
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:38.940
<v Speaker 3>but he was like one of those guys in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>town.</v>

1112
00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.700
<v Speaker 3>I think he was a little older than me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was one of those guys that was</v>

1113
00:45:41.701 --> 00:45:43.500
<v Speaker 3>always kind of hanging out with a nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

1114
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:47.900
<v Speaker 3>He has had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nice trans-am IROC Z was about the,</v>

1115
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his family had money and uh,</v>

1116
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.560
<v Speaker 3>he ran over someone and dragged them</v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

1117
00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:55.950
<v Speaker 3>There was always this thing about people</v>
<v Speaker 3>whose families had money,</v>

1118
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.810
<v Speaker 3>like the rich kids get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it was,</v>

1119
00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.130
<v Speaker 3>it was a weird thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we knew that there were like a</v>

1120
00:46:02.131 --> 00:46:04.920
<v Speaker 3>little off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you always knew that the rich kids</v>

1121
00:46:04.921 --> 00:46:08.110
<v Speaker 3>were never like a complete human right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were always like,</v>

1122
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.250
<v Speaker 3>like there was just a few of them that</v>
<v Speaker 3>were just a little like if you knew</v>

1123
00:46:11.251 --> 00:46:12.720
<v Speaker 3>their rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's probably a lot of kids that we</v>

1124
00:46:12.721 --> 00:46:14.820
<v Speaker 3>did know they were rich and they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>rich,</v>

1125
00:46:14.821 --> 00:46:16.770
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't fucked up so it didn't come</v>

1126
00:46:16.771 --> 00:46:17.310
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

1127
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.350
<v Speaker 3>But the ones that wanted everybody to</v>
<v Speaker 3>know they were rich.</v>

1128
00:46:19.351 --> 00:46:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Like I always had designer clothes on</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they always had the nicest shit and</v>

1129
00:46:23.371 --> 00:46:26.280
<v Speaker 3>they always had like brand new cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when they were 17,</v>

1130
00:46:26.281 --> 00:46:28.860
<v Speaker 3>this guy had a brand new car there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like there are,</v>

1131
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:30.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit,</v>

1132
00:46:30.741 --> 00:46:32.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>animatronic like,</v>

1133
00:46:32.071 --> 00:46:35.760
<v Speaker 3>or something robotic about really rich</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids where it's just kind of like a</v>

1134
00:46:35.761 --> 00:46:39.120
<v Speaker 3>super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super high functioning in a very like,</v>

1135
00:46:39.121 --> 00:46:43.110
<v Speaker 3>disconnected level because they're so</v>
<v Speaker 3>unaware of what it's like to not have.</v>

1136
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm watching these shows.</v>

1137
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.550
<v Speaker 3>My kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went to see this,</v>

1138
00:46:47.551 --> 00:46:49.950
<v Speaker 3>a diary of a wimpy kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yay.</v>

1139
00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Thankfully a funny movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1140
00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.390
<v Speaker 3>This is a funny shit in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I laughed hard a couple of times.</v>

1141
00:46:54.391 --> 00:46:55.224
<v Speaker 3>That movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1142
00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 3>I just went because they wanted to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in this movie,</v>

1143
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really strikes home is like everyone</v>

1144
00:47:02.491 --> 00:47:03.270
<v Speaker 3>is struggling.</v>

1145
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:06.090
<v Speaker 3>It's fuck kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everything has fallen apart always</v>

1146
00:47:06.091 --> 00:47:07.050
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1147
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:09.990
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of got a fun personality.</v>

1148
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:12.840
<v Speaker 3>Like he gets checked all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as he gets cocky,</v>

1149
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:14.140
<v Speaker 3>he gets crushed again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1150
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:18.210
<v Speaker 3>It just keeps happening through and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole series of these movies,</v>

1151
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.480
<v Speaker 3>but I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not happening to that.</v>

1152
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:23.530
<v Speaker 3>The rich kid that I grew up with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no fuss.</v>

1153
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:28.530
<v Speaker 3>That's why probably when he hit the guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his car and had the guy stuck under</v>

1154
00:47:28.531 --> 00:47:29.080
<v Speaker 3>his car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't,</v>

1155
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.560
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1156
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.630
<v Speaker 3>he just thought he was gonna get away</v>
<v Speaker 3>with whatever he figured.</v>

1157
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:36.460
<v Speaker 3>He figured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just gotta get,</v>

1158
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.500
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just cleaned the car.</v>

1159
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:39.910
<v Speaker 3>There was a kid I went to high school</v>

1160
00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.970
<v Speaker 1>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1161
00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.030
<v Speaker 1>had a hit and run and didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they got,</v>

1162
00:47:44.031 --> 00:47:45.380
<v Speaker 1>he got away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1163
00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:46.850
<v Speaker 1>obviously I didn't know it was this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to high school,</v>

1164
00:47:46.851 --> 00:47:48.440
<v Speaker 1>but he got away with it for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking time.</v>

1165
00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:53.360
<v Speaker 1>It was such a public story that f a</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous nascar driver at the time painted</v>

1166
00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:57.410
<v Speaker 1>her name on his car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like find so-and-so's killer because it</v>

1167
00:47:57.411 --> 00:48:01.190
<v Speaker 1>was such a fucking big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This girl that was hit and run and he</v>

1168
00:48:01.191 --> 00:48:03.440
<v Speaker 1>came out years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

1169
00:48:03.441 --> 00:48:06.770
<v Speaker 1>He was pilled pilled the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he showed up to her sister's house</v>

1170
00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.370
<v Speaker 1>and admitted the whole thing to her</v>
<v Speaker 1>sister and was saying he was gonna like</v>

1171
00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:11.600
<v Speaker 1>run away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill himself,</v>

1172
00:48:11.601 --> 00:48:13.160
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she cleverly,</v>

1173
00:48:13.161 --> 00:48:16.760
<v Speaker 1>she spoke Polish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she told her husband to fucking call the</v>

1174
00:48:16.761 --> 00:48:19.040
<v Speaker 1>cops and was trying to call him this kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>down in the meanwhile,</v>

1175
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:22.160
<v Speaker 1>telling him to call the cops and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally caught this kid before he could</v>

1176
00:48:22.161 --> 00:48:25.070
<v Speaker 1>fucking off himself or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he killed this girl on a hit and run</v>

1177
00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.870
<v Speaker 1>and thought he and God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what it's worth,</v>

1178
00:48:26.871 --> 00:48:28.940
<v Speaker 1>got away with it for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1179
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:32.690
<v Speaker 3>But he was probably not a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just was weak at the time.</v>

1180
00:48:32.691 --> 00:48:34.000
<v Speaker 3>And it haunted for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1181
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.800
<v Speaker 3>he had it had to come out fuck crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1182
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.840
<v Speaker 3>That's a mistake that if you make it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn it.</v>

1183
00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.590
<v Speaker 3>She liked that happened like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like from from your area of where you</v>

1184
00:48:42.591 --> 00:48:44.540
<v Speaker 3>grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you read stuff now years later</v>

1185
00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:47.630
<v Speaker 3>that you hear about fucked up shit from</v>
<v Speaker 3>back then but like said gotten exposed</v>

1186
00:48:47.631 --> 00:48:50.900
<v Speaker 3>now like these teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these teachers I knew ran a fucking</v>

1187
00:48:50.901 --> 00:48:54.710
<v Speaker 3>prostitution ring</v>
<v Speaker 3>came out in the paper.</v>

1188
00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.750
<v Speaker 3>The teachers did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Teachers did the shop.</v>

1189
00:48:56.751 --> 00:48:58.730
<v Speaker 3>The old shop teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his daughter,</v>

1190
00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:03.290
<v Speaker 3>the shop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shop teacher has pivot.</v>

1191
00:49:03.291 --> 00:49:04.520
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's insane.</v>

1192
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:06.800
<v Speaker 3>Who the girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the girls were high school students?</v>

1193
00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:08.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not high school students.</v>

1194
00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.020
<v Speaker 3>They were fucking just like girls in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>community probably grows.</v>

1195
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:13.550
<v Speaker 3>I went to high school and graduated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all the girls said they were pimping</v>

1196
00:49:13.551 --> 00:49:16.700
<v Speaker 3>out from the school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were pimping from school.</v>

1197
00:49:16.701 --> 00:49:19.400
<v Speaker 3>What school was this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is out in the suburbs of Chicago.</v>

1198
00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.500
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the question.</v>

1199
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:25.280
<v Speaker 3>If they did make prostitution legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's set up just like you go get a</v>

1200
00:49:25.281 --> 00:49:26.840
<v Speaker 3>massage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go off sex with somebody.</v>

1201
00:49:26.841 --> 00:49:28.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much would that change?</v>

1202
00:49:28.611 --> 00:49:31.790
<v Speaker 3>Like the notion of marriage</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>

1203
00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's getting married.</v>

1204
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:37.250
<v Speaker 3>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's over.</v>

1205
00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:41.450
<v Speaker 3>It's all only a law that's keeping like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what percentage of people married,</v>

1206
00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said it before when we were,</v>

1207
00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:45.810
<v Speaker 1>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we touched on this prior,</v>

1208
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:49.320
<v Speaker 1>the reason that we make it okays cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>the church gets involved,</v>

1209
00:49:49.321 --> 00:49:50.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the church says it's okay,</v>

1210
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like my dad was a drug addict grown</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1211
00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:54.840
<v Speaker 1>my dad was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in and out of prison my whole life</v>

1212
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:57.750
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid and my mother divorced</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father when I was one.</v>

1213
00:49:58.050 --> 00:49:59.640
<v Speaker 1>So I don't really have any recollection</v>
<v Speaker 1>of any of that.</v>

1214
00:49:59.641 --> 00:50:01.080
<v Speaker 1>So I don't have that like damage that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1215
00:50:01.081 --> 00:50:03.240
<v Speaker 1>like my dad got divorced when we were 16</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it.</v>

1216
00:50:03.241 --> 00:50:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my mom came from such a hardcore</v>

1217
00:50:06.781 --> 00:50:11.781
<v Speaker 1>Irish Catholic world that my family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the older generation didn't approve and</v>

1218
00:50:13.801 --> 00:50:16.050
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't divorce this man that's</v>

1219
00:50:16.051 --> 00:50:18.720
<v Speaker 1>against our religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my mom was like,</v>

1220
00:50:18.721 --> 00:50:23.010
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking terrible person to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to get out of this relationship.</v>

1221
00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:24.900
<v Speaker 1>And now she was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were both young,</v>

1222
00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just wanted to make the right move</v>

1223
00:50:26.401 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a baby.</v>

1224
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>But the</v>

1225
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.300
<v Speaker 3>church has so much influence on certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>parts of society that my grandmother was</v>

1226
00:50:32.301 --> 00:50:34.880
<v Speaker 3>like almost disowning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1227
00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.370
<v Speaker 3>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's such a reality for that</v>

1228
00:50:37.371 --> 00:50:39.380
<v Speaker 3>generation that it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could you,</v>

1229
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.680
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean divorce?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's like you're,</v>

1230
00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:43.514
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1231
00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:44.900
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's it.</v>

1232
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:49.400
<v Speaker 3>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my mom had that kind of fuck up in</v>

1233
00:50:49.401 --> 00:50:52.460
<v Speaker 3>her brain of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how much influence the church</v>

1234
00:50:52.461 --> 00:50:55.130
<v Speaker 3>has over marriage and coupling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's crazy.</v>

1235
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.520
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievably ridiculous that people</v>

1236
00:50:58.521 --> 00:51:00.320
<v Speaker 3>succumb to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>

1237
00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:01.790
<v Speaker 3>It's controlling man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1238
00:51:01.791 --> 00:51:03.650
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Catholic church in particular is one</v>

1239
00:51:03.651 --> 00:51:05.890
<v Speaker 3>of the weirdest ones ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll show strangest,</v>

1240
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:10.490
<v Speaker 3>this insanely high percentage of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are involved in child abuse.</v>

1241
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:13.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what other religion has that connected</v>

1242
00:51:13.611 --> 00:51:18.611
<v Speaker 3>to it like that there's none.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a Muslim is the biggest in the</v>

1243
00:51:18.891 --> 00:51:19.724
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1244
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:21.320
<v Speaker 3>The biggest religion in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1245
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:23.640
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not Christianity.</v>

1246
00:51:23.641 --> 00:51:24.171
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start there.</v>

1247
00:51:24.171 --> 00:51:26.120
<v Speaker 3>Probably Toto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either way.</v>

1248
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:29.000
<v Speaker 3>You don't hear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So are they covering up shit?</v>

1249
00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.900
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing about the priests and the</v>

1250
00:51:32.901 --> 00:51:37.901
<v Speaker 3>priests being forced to be celibate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then spending time with boys like that</v>

1251
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.220
<v Speaker 3>shit has always gone bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1252
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Forcing guys to be celibate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad forcing guys to hang out with boys</v>

1253
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.050
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awful.</v>

1254
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:46.670
<v Speaker 3>Someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something is weird.</v>

1255
00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Weird Shit's going to happen if there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>no parents in the room,</v>

1256
00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:49.581
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it,</v>

1257
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:51.290
<v Speaker 3>when as soon as you deprive someone of</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1258
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.290
<v Speaker 3>they are going to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want it immediately.</v>

1259
00:51:54.330 --> 00:51:56.990
<v Speaker 3>Then you attach to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ultimate power that comes from being</v>

1260
00:51:56.991 --> 00:51:58.910
<v Speaker 3>a representative of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1261
00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.180
<v Speaker 3>Like you're wearing a priest outfit to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little kid.</v>

1262
00:52:02.181 --> 00:52:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Like that kid will suck your Dick.</v>

<v Speaker 3>went to Tony and guy the hairstylist</v>

1342
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:07.620
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The color of his hair is like the color</v>

1343
00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:12.030
<v Speaker 3>of every retired Florida Golfer in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>70 [inaudible] so gross.</v>

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.540
<v Speaker 3>He's got this weird blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grey thing going on.</v>

1345
00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:20.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like he moves it around a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some days it's like a darker Brown</v>

1346
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:22.230
<v Speaker 3>Sundays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a blog on gray.</v>

1347
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:23.790
<v Speaker 3>It looks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like sand.</v>

1348
00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:26.400
<v Speaker 3>He's getting it worked on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what I'm saying like this is not</v>

1349
00:55:26.401 --> 00:55:29.370
<v Speaker 3>the color of the hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what you do one or two things.</v>

1350
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Let me be clear about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either you work on your hair or you</v>

1351
00:55:32.641 --> 00:55:34.110
<v Speaker 3>don't work on your hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1352
00:55:34.111 --> 00:55:37.890
<v Speaker 3>so either you die your fucking hair or</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't dye your hair.</v>

1353
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:39.420
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those two things.</v>

1354
00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.120
<v Speaker 3>How fucking when you dye your hair be</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistent.</v>

1355
00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:46.590
<v Speaker 3>You can't go gray and then be blonde</v>
<v Speaker 3>again and it'd be dark haired.</v>

1356
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.980
<v Speaker 3>It's too confusing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to know what kind of a person to</v>

1357
00:55:49.981 --> 00:55:51.990
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how much you working on your hair,</v>

1358
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:56.490
<v Speaker 3>what's your level of haircare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much time you spending putting that</v>

1359
00:55:56.491 --> 00:55:57.780
<v Speaker 3>together every day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

1360
00:55:57.781 --> 00:55:58.890
<v Speaker 3>Did Donald Trump changes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eric?</v>

1361
00:55:58.891 --> 00:56:00.350
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just fucking obvious and of</v>

1362
00:56:00.351 --> 00:56:02.250
<v Speaker 3>course he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's changed his hair color.</v>

1363
00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:04.860
<v Speaker 3>It goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's moving it around as his hair is</v>

1364
00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:07.590
<v Speaker 3>probably very great at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in his seventies there's nothing</v>

1365
00:56:07.591 --> 00:56:09.120
<v Speaker 3>wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you think about all this,</v>

1366
00:56:09.121 --> 00:56:10.080
<v Speaker 3>Kathy Griffin?</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's fucking insane.</v>

1368
00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:14.040
<v Speaker 3>She needs friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you doing that?</v>

1369
00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:16.020
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a hundred percent attention.</v>

1370
00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:16.830
<v Speaker 3>Attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1371
00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:20.610

<v Speaker 3>She thought she was being edgy and she</v>

1372
00:56:20.611 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 3>probably was talking with the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and got the wrong in her head and</v>

1373
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.860
<v Speaker 2>went with it and had no one like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and go,</v>

1374
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:30.850
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's the president.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a person.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to human.</v>

1377
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:33.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

1378
00:56:33.551 --> 00:56:35.620
<v Speaker 2>you can't pretend you want to murder</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1379
00:56:35.621 --> 00:56:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Isis style on the hold his head up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the camera like a hostage video.</v>

1380
00:56:38.711 --> 00:56:39.850
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy.</v>

1381
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1382
00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:45.630
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where both both</v>
<v Speaker 1>parties,</v>

1383
00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:50.690
<v Speaker 1>both extreme left and extreme right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are at such a heightened version of</v>

1384
00:56:50.761 --> 00:56:55.650
<v Speaker 1>what's happening that people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming blind to like logic.</v>

1385
00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I 100% right.</v>

1386
00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Logic is like it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1387
00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:04.230
<v Speaker 1>You would fucking never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody did that with Obama,</v>

1388
00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:06.840
<v Speaker 1>a holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1389
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean the fucking world would stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinning.</v>

1390
00:57:08.881 --> 00:57:12.060
<v Speaker 1>There'd be so much chaos from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be fucking,</v>

1391
00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.570
<v Speaker 1>it w it would be an insane thing to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happen.</v>

1392
00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1393
00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:20.930
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not any one solution.</v>

1394
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not a real sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>holding up that head is not a real</v>

1395
00:57:24.561 --> 00:57:26.520
<v Speaker 2>solution like killing anybody like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1396
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:29.180
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's like the worst person in</v>

1397
00:57:29.181 --> 00:57:31.520
<v Speaker 2>the world cutting their head off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>holding it up like that,</v>

1398
00:57:31.521 --> 00:57:35.300
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't even want that from Osama</v>

1399
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:36.380
<v Speaker 2>bin Ladin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we found the,</v>

1400
00:57:36.381 --> 00:57:40.250
<v Speaker 2>the video of Osama bin Ladin and one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seals held him down and cut his head</v>

1401
00:57:40.251 --> 00:57:43.010
<v Speaker 2>off and then held it up to the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd be fucking extremely like,</v>

1402
00:57:43.011 --> 00:57:44.570
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you just kill him,</v>

1403
00:57:44.571 --> 00:57:45.650
<v Speaker 2>kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're not them.</v>

1404
00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.230
<v Speaker 2>We're not torturing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not trying to terrorize all these</v>

1405
00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:50.450
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not going to become what we're</v>

1406
00:57:50.451 --> 00:57:51.320
<v Speaker 2>afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1407
00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And B,</v>

1408
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.990
<v Speaker 2>that's what she's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By holding that head up,</v>

1409
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.270
<v Speaker 2>you are becoming what you were afraid</v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

1410
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Your becoming a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're yours,</v>

1411
00:57:58.531 --> 00:58:01.010
<v Speaker 2>your tread face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not even emotionally attached.</v>

1412
00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.140
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you're holding up this</v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody head.</v>

1413
00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:04.940
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of nonsense?</v>

1414
00:58:04.941 --> 00:58:07.970
<v Speaker 2>False imagery is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't really think that.</v>

1415
00:58:07.971 --> 00:58:09.410
<v Speaker 2>You don't really feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it art?</v>

1416
00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.580
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it art?</v>

1417
00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.610
<v Speaker 1>That's what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that's what the argument from</v>

1418
00:58:12.611 --> 00:58:15.320
<v Speaker 1>from Bruce Sake was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an artistic piece where the with</v>

1419
00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:16.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a photographer who's,</v>

1420
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:19.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's about a real person that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>Medusa.</v>

1421
00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:22.810
<v Speaker 2>You decide like a dragon's head you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>holding up if it's just crazy.</v>

1422
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:23.220
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1423
00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Is he here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's your own head,</v>

1424
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.800
<v Speaker 1>it's your own head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a funny statement trying to</v>

1425
00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:27.634
<v Speaker 1>make a statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1426
00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:30.620
<v Speaker 2>But it's like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're terrorizing that person if you're</v>

1427
00:58:30.621 --> 00:58:32.700
<v Speaker 2>that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know everybody thinks that the</v>

1428
00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:37.000
<v Speaker 2>president has to assume a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of mockery and I agree that he does.</v>

1429
00:58:37.001 --> 00:58:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1430
00:58:37.851 --> 00:58:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Everybody in any position of power like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is going to,</v>

1431
00:58:40.011 --> 00:58:41.460
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have people coming at</v>
<v Speaker 2>you of course.</v>

1432
00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:46.760
<v Speaker 2>But there's a difference between that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and advocating a brutal assassination</v>

1433
00:58:46.761 --> 00:58:51.050
<v Speaker 2>and terror video that's head removal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>

1434
00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:51.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1435
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:54.530
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's going to be sympathetic towards</v>

1436
00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:57.920
<v Speaker 2>your idea and in fact you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>empower the people that are opposed to</v>

1437
00:58:57.921 --> 00:58:59.570
<v Speaker 2>you cause they're gonna Think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1438
00:58:59.571 --> 00:59:04.490
<v Speaker 2>these people are these crazy ideologues</v>
<v Speaker 2>who want to like literally promote the</v>

1439
00:59:04.491 --> 00:59:07.550
<v Speaker 2>murderer and torture of someone cutting</v>
<v Speaker 2>their head off.</v>

1440
00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:11.540
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>

1441
00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.300
<v Speaker 2>it's still something that people do</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're trying to get attention</v>

1442
00:59:14.301 --> 00:59:16.790
<v Speaker 2>and they're trying to entertain or</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to be shocking that just,</v>

1443
00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.920
<v Speaker 1>it's [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a continuation of,</v>

1444
00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:23.300
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to be in people's,</v>

1445
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:24.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frontal lobe.</v>

1446
00:59:24.891 --> 00:59:26.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like people in Hollywood at some</v>

1447
00:59:26.541 --> 00:59:30.980
<v Speaker 1>point just want to stay in Hollywood and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's what she,</v>

1448
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:32.510
<v Speaker 1>she does a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to stay,</v>

1449
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:35.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to do something controversial on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking New Year's eve hosts that</v>

1450
00:59:35.841 --> 00:59:38.360
<v Speaker 1>she does or whatever so she can stay in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood.</v>

1451
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:41.240
<v Speaker 1>It's such this great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this great director once told me that</v>

1452
00:59:41.241 --> 00:59:43.630
<v Speaker 1>the sat is never that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if this is a,</v>

1453
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:48.230
<v Speaker 1>if this is an actor and and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if we're the sun and the sun and the</v>

1454
00:59:48.231 --> 00:59:50.330
<v Speaker 1>earth and moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving around one another.</v>

1455
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Just like an actor in a spotlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says if the spotlight has is on the</v>

1456
00:59:54.411 --> 00:59:56.570
<v Speaker 1>actor at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it moves away,</v>

1457
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:59.570
<v Speaker 1>if he actually tried to move towards it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when it becomes sad.</v>

1458
00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.880
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it shifted out of your line of</v>

1459
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:02.630
<v Speaker 1>sight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1460
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:06.860
<v Speaker 1>when your work and your progress has</v>
<v Speaker 1>shifted as if your time perhaps maybe</v>

1461
01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:10.760
<v Speaker 1>coming to a close as far as it's worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you are continuing to search for</v>

1462
01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:12.320
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more desperate and more</v>

1463
01:00:12.321 --> 01:00:13.280
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1464
01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:17.090
<v Speaker 1>you can always see when someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting for it again,</v>

1465
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:18.890
<v Speaker 1>it looks sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks,</v>

1466
01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.413
<v Speaker 1>it looks desperate.</v>

1467
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.260
<v Speaker 2>It's also contrary to the very reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like you in the first place.</v>

1468
01:00:24.261 --> 01:00:27.640
<v Speaker 2>Like people like you because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing things they enjoy exact,</v>

1469
01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.700
<v Speaker 2>doing good work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing good comedy,</v>

1470
01:00:29.701 --> 01:00:31.340
<v Speaker 2>you make it a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck you do,</v>

1471
01:00:31.341 --> 01:00:33.230
<v Speaker 2>making a good song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they like you.</v>

1472
01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to like you because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to get attention or that</v>

1473
01:00:37.461 --> 01:00:40.730
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to get people to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just,</v>

1474
01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:41.901
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1475
01:00:41.901 --> 01:00:42.770
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1476
01:00:42.771 --> 01:00:43.460
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1477
01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:47.210
<v Speaker 2>what do you get out of holding ahead?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of attention do you get?</v>

1478
01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Like what did she say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go girl.</v>

1479
01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:50.601
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1480
01:00:50.601 --> 01:00:53.080
<v Speaker 2>we're with you fucking him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kill him.</v>

1481
01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that do things like that</v>

1482
01:00:55.941 --> 01:00:58.220
<v Speaker 2>and they could have easily been right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1483
01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:00.080
<v Speaker 2>might be left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could have easily been,</v>

1484
01:01:00.081 --> 01:01:00.920
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1485
01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:04.760
<v Speaker 2>it's a way of thinking and you get that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way of thinking and then you program</v>

1486
01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:07.280
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get locked into this predetermined</v>

1487
01:01:07.281 --> 01:01:08.210
<v Speaker 2>pattern of behavior.</v>

1488
01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Like all right wing people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a giant percentage of them have</v>

1489
01:01:12.891 --> 01:01:15.260
<v Speaker 2>like an established series of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1490
01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:17.990
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of opinions about certain things that we</v>

1491
01:01:17.991 --> 01:01:20.180
<v Speaker 2>count on because they're the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1492
01:01:20.181 --> 01:01:23.120
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like abortion or even it used to be gay</v>

1493
01:01:23.121 --> 01:01:25.580
<v Speaker 2>marriage was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always a bunch of them that are</v>

1494
01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:30.110
<v Speaker 2>just climate change is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like halfway there,</v>

1495
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.020
<v Speaker 2>like maybe 25% of them hardcore on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1496
01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:35.870
<v Speaker 2>Where's the left?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Climate change is almost 100% accepted</v>

1497
01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.790
<v Speaker 2>without it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without question.</v>

1498
01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.290
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I counted these,</v>

1499
01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:44.270
<v Speaker 2>these ideas become right or left ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>who logged them into the database of</v>

1500
01:01:44.271 --> 01:01:46.850
<v Speaker 2>which side do they belong on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's talking points.</v>

1501
01:01:46.851 --> 01:01:49.010
<v Speaker 2>People on Fox News started talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1502
01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:51.770
<v Speaker 2>People agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They liked convenient things.</v>

1503
01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:52.730
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a cycle.</v>

1504
01:01:52.731 --> 01:01:53.590
<v Speaker 2>It comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

1505
01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we need is jobs.</v>

1506
01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.220
<v Speaker 2>And then they run with that and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tall,</v>

1507
01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:01.310
<v Speaker 2>it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this predetermined pattern that people</v>

1508
01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:02.840
<v Speaker 2>just love to fall into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1509
01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:04.170
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

1510
01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>It's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should no longer be separation of</v>

1511
01:02:06.901 --> 01:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>just permanent party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be.</v>

1512
01:02:09.271 --> 01:02:11.780
<v Speaker 1>You're always left an always right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so fucked up.</v>

1513
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Too Vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel it myself.</v>

1514
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.690
<v Speaker 2>I feel myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The urge to be a part of groups.</v>

1515
01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.140
<v Speaker 2>I do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all do.</v>

1516
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.033
<v Speaker 2>We all do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1517
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:20.700
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>

1518
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:21.400
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1519
01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.530
<v Speaker 1>that is nature and habit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1520
01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:25.870
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone wants to belong to a community.</v>

1521
01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:28.690
<v Speaker 1>That's why fraternities exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why when you join a gym,</v>

1522
01:02:28.691 --> 01:02:31.030
<v Speaker 1>you start to eat in the moment you join</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gym.</v>

1523
01:02:31.031 --> 01:02:32.740
<v Speaker 1>You start to see people repetitively</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

1524
01:02:32.741 --> 01:02:33.910
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts off with a,</v>

1525
01:02:33.970 --> 01:02:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

1526
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>That guy you see all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's,</v>

1527
01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've out it.</v>

1528
01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it becomes a relationship you</v>

1529
01:02:39.941 --> 01:02:41.710
<v Speaker 1>create because it's communal because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1530
01:02:41.711 --> 01:02:43.480
<v Speaker 1>we both do this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both enjoy ICU.</v>

1531
01:02:43.481 --> 01:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Often we do this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we create tribes.</v>

1532
01:02:46.001 --> 01:02:48.880
<v Speaker 1>We Love Haciendas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like to be a part of our little</v>

1533
01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:52.530
<v Speaker 1>tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it gets infiltrated it you,</v>

1534
01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>you become vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're,</v>

1535
01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>the walls are weakening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like when the word</v>

1536
01:02:57.151 --> 01:03:02.151
<v Speaker 1>gentrification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentrification really just means a tr,</v>

1537
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes area has been compromised.</v>

1538
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this has been this for so</v>

1539
01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:10.680
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When white people or people of privilege</v>

1540
01:03:10.681 --> 01:03:15.300
<v Speaker 1>or money move into anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to overtake that tribe.</v>

1541
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.320
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's so much backlash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people fucking get so angry</v>

1542
01:03:19.321 --> 01:03:21.390
<v Speaker 1>about neighborhoods turning over quote</v>
<v Speaker 1>unquote,</v>

1543
01:03:21.391 --> 01:03:23.100
<v Speaker 1>cause they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can be ours?</v>

1544
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:24.960
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a fucking delicate thing</v>

1545
01:03:24.961 --> 01:03:27.360
<v Speaker 1>because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't stop that.</v>

1546
01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:28.590
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to stop that.</v>

1547
01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there's a game being played in your</v>

1548
01:03:33.261 --> 01:03:35.150
<v Speaker 2>part of it because you're paying rent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1549
01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.490
<v Speaker 2>And there's a game being played.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your part of it,</v>

1550

<v Speaker 2>you're getting paid for your time during</v>

1551
01:03:39.831 --> 01:03:41.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you have to decide what you're</v>

1552
01:03:41.031 --> 01:03:45.590
<v Speaker 2>going to do with that time and you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel very stuck in this game that you're</v>

<v Speaker 2>and he's giving you a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money and it all kind of evens out at</v>

1555
01:03:51.651 --> 01:03:52.850
<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing leftover,</v>

1556
01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.430
<v Speaker 2>but you're still playing a game.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to keep playing that fucking</v>

1560

<v Speaker 2>game cause this is all legal and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you pay me rent.</v>

01:05:38.461 --> 01:05:41.810
<v Speaker 1>this Cuban guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just brilliant chef and he key,</v>

1604
01:05:41.811 --> 01:05:44.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got sued for illegal wage wage</v>

1605
01:05:44.491 --> 01:05:47.010
<v Speaker 1>garnishing these illegal employees that</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't speak English.</v>

1606
01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:49.110
<v Speaker 1>She had sued to the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut them the fuck down.</v>

1607
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Some other fucking white rich guy came</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1608
01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.200
<v Speaker 1>bought the recipes from the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took to help him out with his lawsuit,</v>

1609
01:05:55.900 --> 01:06:00.240
<v Speaker 1>still runs just as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it can be done if someone does it</v>

1610
01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:02.670
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He bought the recipes.</v>

1611
01:06:02.671 --> 01:06:03.670
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1612
01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:05.880
<v Speaker 1>the mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when people buy a bar or buy a</v>

1613
01:06:05.881 --> 01:06:07.320
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they're buying the place.</v>

1614
01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:08.341
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more,</v>

1615
01:06:08.341 --> 01:06:10.620
<v Speaker 1>there's more than just the brick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortar.</v>

1616
01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.520
<v Speaker 1>There's more to it than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he knew the food success was because</v>

1617
01:06:14.521 --> 01:06:15.630
<v Speaker 1>of this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he did it,</v>

1618
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:18.090
<v Speaker 1>but you can't just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a Cuban restaurant or a</v>

1619
01:06:18.091 --> 01:06:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Caribbean restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1620
01:06:19.591 --> 01:06:23.160
<v Speaker 1>I want to do it exactly how you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he paid for him to give him those</v>

1621
01:06:23.161 --> 01:06:26.530
<v Speaker 1>recipes so he could just the recipe just</v>
<v Speaker 1>to show him how he was cooking and she</v>

1622
01:06:26.531 --> 01:06:28.290
<v Speaker 1>would cook that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He paid him for the recipes,</v>

1623
01:06:28.291 --> 01:06:31.710
<v Speaker 1>not to know the rest of the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is to get it back to where it</v>

1624
01:06:31.711 --> 01:06:34.410
<v Speaker 1>was and this dude from Costa Rica was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like still the same.</v>

1625
01:06:34.411 --> 01:06:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1626
01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.620
<v Speaker 1>He was just a couple of white guys that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are back there now.</v>

1627
01:06:37.621 --> 01:06:38.340
<v Speaker 1>He's the same food.</v>

1628
01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.440
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean that I don't appreciate</v>

1629
01:06:40.441 --> 01:06:43.110
<v Speaker 2>people that live in these neighborhoods</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are being forced out and you'd have</v>

1630
01:06:43.111 --> 01:06:45.660
<v Speaker 2>to get a new place to live and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>afford it.</v>

1631
01:06:45.661 --> 01:06:47.520
<v Speaker 2>You can't afford to live in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood anymore because people are</v>

1632
01:06:47.521 --> 01:06:49.230
<v Speaker 2>buying it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1633
01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:52.830
<v Speaker 2>I understand that it sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately it's probably good for</v>

1634
01:06:52.831 --> 01:06:54.570
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely good for the</v>

1635
01:06:54.571 --> 01:06:56.190
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The neighborhood's going to get like</v>

1636
01:06:56.191 --> 01:06:58.290
<v Speaker 2>these nice houses now and people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to move in.</v>

1637
01:06:58.291 --> 01:07:00.270
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be more value.</v>

1638
01:07:00.271 --> 01:07:03.780
<v Speaker 2>If you did buy a place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you did take the risk and bought a</v>

1639
01:07:03.781 --> 01:07:05.250
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that place can be worth more money.</v>

1640
01:07:05.251 --> 01:07:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Now I know maybe you couldn't buy a</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

1641
01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.041
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1642
01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:09.570
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to buy a place when I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid.</v>

1643
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to do that,</v>

1644
01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:11.910
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1645
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel like you have to do that and</v>

1646
01:07:13.651 --> 01:07:17.040
<v Speaker 2>they can come up with a bunch of excuses</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody would argue all day long</v>

1647
01:07:17.041 --> 01:07:20.040
<v Speaker 2>about white privilege and you're lucky</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this and that,</v>

1648
01:07:20.041 --> 01:07:22.530
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is you're not in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cage.</v>

1649
01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:24.390
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not in a cage and you're out</v>

1650
01:07:24.391 --> 01:07:26.580
<v Speaker 2>there doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could figure out a way.</v>

1651
01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a month from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's six months from now to</v>

1652
01:07:29.041 --> 01:07:32.010
<v Speaker 2>transition into something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Figure your way through the maze.</v>

1653
01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't all start at the same spot in</v>

1654
01:07:33.901 --> 01:07:34.734
<v Speaker 2>the maze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1655
01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:35.603
<v Speaker 2>Agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could it,</v>

1656
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:38.640
<v Speaker 2>but don't ever complain about your spot</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the maze.</v>

1657
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:40.680
<v Speaker 2>Just figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure your way through that thing.</v>

1658
01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in the mace.</v>

1659
01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sucks.</v>

1660
01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Definitely hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Easy.</v>

1661
01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep moving.</v>

1662
01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:48.120
<v Speaker 2>Don't jam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This up with your tears.</v>

1663
01:07:48.121 --> 01:07:48.954
<v Speaker 2>You Fuck,</v>

1664
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:49.863
<v Speaker 1>keep moving.</v>

1665
01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:54.980
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand capitalism and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I'm a socialist and okay,</v>

1666
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:56.430
<v Speaker 2>just keep moving though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

1667
01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just talking too much and not move in</v>

1668
01:07:58.531 --> 01:07:59.540
<v Speaker 2>and I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1669
01:07:59.541 --> 01:08:02.090
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough happening here that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining about other things</v>

1670
01:08:02.091 --> 01:08:03.380
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1671
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:04.790
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

1672
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:08.090
<v Speaker 2>The climate change agreement is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible thing to leave.</v>

1673
01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:12.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad thing to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His own daughter told them not to leave,</v>

1674
01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.760
<v Speaker 1>but I never liked [inaudible] so we got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out of Paris.</v>

1675
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:19.250
<v Speaker 4>She did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She has owned his own daughter was like,</v>

1676
01:08:19.251 --> 01:08:21.080
<v Speaker 4>this is a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's crazy.</v>

1677
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.160
<v Speaker 4>He didn't want he and science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is perfectly out of his fucking mind.</v>

1678
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:28.670
<v Speaker 4>He's going against science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The scientists are saying,</v>

1679
01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:32.240
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got to reduce emissions 100% we're</v>

1680
01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:33.980
<v Speaker 4>polluting the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We breathe.</v>

1681
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:38.210
<v Speaker 4>We're ruining the very air that we need</v>
<v Speaker 4>to exist on.</v>

1682
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.130
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that true,</v>

1683
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:41.770
<v Speaker 4>don't agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We bike.</v>

1684
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:44.420
<v Speaker 4>We bought new air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's show by Jay.</v>

1685
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:45.860
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen a chair?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is.</v>

1686
01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.210
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he's doing this because he's about</v>
<v Speaker 4>to move.</v>

1687
01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:53.270
<v Speaker 4>Move into position to use one of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>gigantic building sized air filter</v>

1688
01:08:53.271 --> 01:08:54.830
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's going to have a trump air</v>

1689
01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:57.170
<v Speaker 4>filter filters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Set them up in every city.</v>

1690
01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:01.340
<v Speaker 4>You could all go back and buy diesel</v>
<v Speaker 4>trucks and no one's going to care</v>

1691
01:09:01.341 --> 01:09:02.510
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to clean that air.</v>

1692
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:04.280
<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like idiocracy do you ever</v>

1693
01:09:04.281 --> 01:09:07.290
<v Speaker 4>see that movie I ever saw that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

1694
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.750
<v Speaker 4>It was that kind of thing where the</v>
<v Speaker 4>future is like,</v>

1695
01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:10.700
<v Speaker 4>they don't drink water anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They be convinced by this,</v>

1696
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:12.950
<v Speaker 4>this like gatorade type drink where it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1697
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:16.400
<v Speaker 4>this is better than water and people</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's gotta be so everyone fucking</v>

1698
01:09:16.401 --> 01:09:18.170
<v Speaker 4>drinks it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The big sense.</v>

1699
01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:21.050
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's better than water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can convince enough people what</v>

1700
01:09:21.051 --> 01:09:22.700
<v Speaker 4>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people will get on board.</v>

1701
01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.520
<v Speaker 4>Regard blind faith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to talk about that on stage</v>

1702
01:09:25.521 --> 01:09:27.800
<v Speaker 4>right now about blind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have so much blind faith.</v>

1703
01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.170
<v Speaker 4>Like I had a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would at the gas station to get this</v>

1704
01:09:30.171 --> 01:09:31.460
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a Brownie.</v>

1705
01:09:31.461 --> 01:09:32.294
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>protein packed Brownie or whatever.</v>

1708
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:37.100
<v Speaker 4>I just trusted it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all real.</v>

1709
01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't fucking know what the next is.</v>

1710
01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:41.210
<v Speaker 4>Probably just a bullshit ass Brownie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's packed with protein.</v>

1711
01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:43.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you actually got the real statistics</v>

1712
01:09:43.251 --> 01:09:44.061
<v Speaker 4>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably,</v>

<v Speaker 4>but it looked like gatorade.</v>

1719
01:09:54.831 --> 01:09:55.280
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1720
01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.930
<v Speaker 4>they were watering their plants with it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and shit.</v>

1721
01:09:56.931 --> 01:10:00.890
<v Speaker 4>Nothing was alive anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But out of the sink would come this</v>

1722
01:10:00.891 --> 01:10:04.460
<v Speaker 4>fucking gatorade type looking drink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] that's right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Bronto thirst.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Muda lunar.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the left.</v>

1727

<v Speaker 4>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1728
01:10:19.581 --> 01:10:21.500
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the world has become.</v>

1729
01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.570
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see the size of that Costco.</v>

1730
01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.110
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could happen.</v>

1731
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:29.990
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all totally possible.</v>

1732
01:10:29.991 --> 01:10:31.400
<v Speaker 4>Have you been watching this handmaid's</v>
<v Speaker 4>tale?</v>

1733
01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:32.713
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that,</v>

1734
01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.020
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you know about this,</v>

1735
01:10:34.021 --> 01:10:37.450
<v Speaker 4>it on Hulu man was a book written.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1736
01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:40.160
<v Speaker 4>I want to say 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1737
01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:43.430
<v Speaker 4>it's Elizabeth Moss is the star of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's essentially about,</v>

1738
01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.160
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if world war three broke out and we</v>

1739
01:10:46.161 --> 01:10:49.040
<v Speaker 4>became like an ultimate police state and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was like a sub government that</v>

1740
01:10:49.041 --> 01:10:52.430
<v Speaker 4>took over and we went back to</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially biblical times when women</v>

1741
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.880
<v Speaker 4>who were fertile were used for the rich</v>
<v Speaker 4>as handmaids for making babies.</v>

1742
01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.391
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

1743
01:10:59.391 --> 01:11:02.030
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking trippiest shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1744
01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:03.290
<v Speaker 4>You got to watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>

1745
01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.090
<v Speaker 4>You will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's based on modern time.</v>

1746
01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.640
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes place in modern time as if</v>

1747
01:11:07.641 --> 01:11:09.410
<v Speaker 4>world war three broke out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to give you too many</v>

1748
01:11:09.411 --> 01:11:10.960
<v Speaker 4>details,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then two,</v>

1749
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:12.770
<v Speaker 4>we're under a police state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these handmaids,</v>

1750
01:11:12.771 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 4>these fertile women who are of</v>

1751
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.430
<v Speaker 1>lower socioeconomic status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they must wear these things and abide by</v>

1752
01:11:17.431 --> 01:11:19.710
<v Speaker 1>their masters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the wealthy one percenters of</v>

1753
01:11:19.711 --> 01:11:22.590
<v Speaker 1>the world who own these fertile women</v>
<v Speaker 1>because their wives are infertile.</v>

1754
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:25.620
<v Speaker 1>So they must repopulate this new</v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

1755
01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1756
01:11:27.151 --> 01:11:31.320
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking right up your alley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insanely good.</v>

1757
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:34.860
<v Speaker 1>But it was a book that was written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a total possibility.</v>

1758
01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:35.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I do.</v>

1759
01:11:35.611 --> 01:11:36.840
<v Speaker 1>It's getting so much love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1760
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:39.780
<v Speaker 1>some of the parallels in the show of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in society now and some</v>

1761
01:11:39.781 --> 01:11:42.360
<v Speaker 1>of the commentary cause this was shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>prior to the election.</v>

1762
01:11:42.690 --> 01:11:45.660
<v Speaker 1>It's so specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why people are falling in</v>

1763
01:11:45.661 --> 01:11:48.030
<v Speaker 1>love with it because they're like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is creepily real.</v>

1764
01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Like it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1765
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I think with what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially from a for,</v>

1766
01:11:52.981 --> 01:11:54.840
<v Speaker 1>for what I've heard from women's</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1767
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:59.870
<v Speaker 1>you know like taking the fear of women's</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights being removed as far as things</v>

1768
01:12:00.421 --> 01:12:02.490
<v Speaker 1>like planned parenthood or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what have you,</v>

1769
01:12:02.491 --> 01:12:06.780
<v Speaker 1>the choices of your own fucking body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's so much echoed in the</v>

1770
01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:11.781
<v Speaker 1>show that it feels creepily real where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you could one day just go like</v>

1771
01:12:12.271 --> 01:12:14.250
<v Speaker 1>they do in one of the scenes without</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving anything away.</v>

1772
01:12:14.251 --> 01:12:16.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like all the women are fired today.</v>

1773
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Well you know that I ran of today is</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing like I ran of like the 1960s no.</v>

1774
01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen like the difference</v>
<v Speaker 2>between I ran then and now?</v>

1775
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:30.250
<v Speaker 2>No they became when I think when it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the shop took no,</v>

1776
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:33.270
<v Speaker 2>when the ayatollah took over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause the ayatollah was a religious</v>

1777
01:12:33.271 --> 01:12:37.470
<v Speaker 2>figure and he took over and the change</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the country,</v>

1778
01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:39.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible with Iranian history.</v>

1779
01:12:39.241 --> 01:12:41.250
<v Speaker 2>So if you listen to this and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset that I'm getting it wrong,</v>

1780
01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:45.480
<v Speaker 2>Iranians would fucking piss essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to dress like much more free.</v>

1781
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it is like much more</v>

1782
01:12:46.951 --> 01:12:47.784
<v Speaker 2>Westernized.</v>

1783
01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:49.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like the seventies in the seventies</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1784
01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Looked like seventies the United States.</v>

1785
01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then shit changed.</v>

1786
01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:57.650
<v Speaker 2>And now if you go there today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look,</v>

1787
01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.680
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East is with a shiny example</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what is possible in 2017 as far as</v>

1788
01:13:03.591 --> 01:13:05.600
<v Speaker 2>like suppression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her shirt is there.</v>

1789
01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dead if you'd wear that.</v>

1790
01:13:08.421 --> 01:13:11.750
<v Speaker 2>No big old titties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's chocolate.</v>

1791
01:13:11.751 --> 01:13:12.584
<v Speaker 2>Chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chocolate.</v>

1792
01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you ended up yet,</v>

1793
01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:15.740
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd be fucking slain for now.</v>

1794
01:13:15.741 --> 01:13:18.740
<v Speaker 2>They have to cover their head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have like religious scarf</v>

1795
01:13:18.741 --> 01:13:23.540
<v Speaker 2>laws and you know what's really crazy is</v>
<v Speaker 2>there better than like Saudi Arabia.</v>

1796
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:27.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia's what you can and can't do</v>

1797
01:13:27.831 --> 01:13:29.090
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1798
01:13:29.091 --> 01:13:32.090
<v Speaker 2>you're essentially like a second class</v>
<v Speaker 2>citizen if you're a woman below.</v>

1799
01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's they allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive now.</v>

1800
01:13:34.221 --> 01:13:36.240
<v Speaker 2>They changed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

1801
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:38.060
<v Speaker 2>I know there's some people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to change that.</v>

1802
01:13:38.061 --> 01:13:40.250
<v Speaker 2>There's some people that are progressive</v>
<v Speaker 2>over there that are trying to change</v>

1803
01:13:40.251 --> 01:13:40.620
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1804
01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.800
<v Speaker 2>They're straight property man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that they view him as a</v>

1805
01:13:42.801 --> 01:13:45.230
<v Speaker 2>straight numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that you have to keep your head</v>

1806
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:46.870
<v Speaker 2>covered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to wear the those,</v>

1807
01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:50.960
<v Speaker 2>those robes and the garb and and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>this women that are trying to say that</v>

1808
01:13:50.961 --> 01:13:53.750
<v Speaker 2>that's a source of empowerment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of crazy people out</v>

1809
01:13:53.751 --> 01:13:58.010
<v Speaker 2>there just like there was always uncle</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom's like during the civil rights</v>

1810
01:13:58.011 --> 01:14:01.220
<v Speaker 2>movement and just like people are just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always going to be like black</v>

1811
01:14:01.221 --> 01:14:05.090
<v Speaker 2>guys for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zoe's contrary is always there's going</v>

1812
01:14:05.091 --> 01:14:07.220
<v Speaker 2>to be women that said that the wearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1813
01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:08.330
<v Speaker 2>how do you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His job,</v>

1814
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:10.790
<v Speaker 2>he jogged by three job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

1815
01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:13.360
<v Speaker 2>it's for women to fuck it is you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>wear it.</v>

1816
01:14:13.361 --> 01:14:14.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a religious symbol of</v>

1817
01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:15.370
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could you,</v>

1818
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.290
<v Speaker 1>how could you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand being born into something</v>

1819
01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:19.080
<v Speaker 1>and not knowing any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do understand that.</v>

1820
01:14:19.090 --> 01:14:19.923
<v Speaker 1>Like I get it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1821
01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:22.690
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or born into and being convinced that</v>

1822
01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:27.670
<v Speaker 1>this is the way that it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you see freedom of the world,</v>

1823
01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:30.640
<v Speaker 1>when you see the freedom of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're all born fucking naked and</v>

1824
01:14:30.641 --> 01:14:35.230
<v Speaker 1>free to be these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why there isn't a little</v>

1825
01:14:35.231 --> 01:14:39.310
<v Speaker 1>bit more of a click that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did these women and other places</v>

1826
01:14:39.311 --> 01:14:43.210
<v Speaker 1>have more freedom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because w because the goal of any sort</v>

1827
01:14:43.211 --> 01:14:46.240
<v Speaker 1>of religious fucking constriction is</v>
<v Speaker 1>questioning,</v>

1828
01:14:46.241 --> 01:14:47.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you question it,</v>

1829
01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.160
<v Speaker 1>you're automatically fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you question it enough where you</v>

1830
01:14:51.161 --> 01:14:53.980
<v Speaker 1>research and you look and you find out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you learn,</v>

1831
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:58.180
<v Speaker 1>I would assume you would become</v>
<v Speaker 1>enchanted with the idea of being free,</v>

1832
01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:02.860
<v Speaker 1>of just wanting to not have someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking tell you where you can walk,</v>

1833
01:15:02.861 --> 01:15:03.694
<v Speaker 1>what you can do.</v>

1834
01:15:04.190 --> 01:15:08.060
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you connect an ideology with,</v>

1835
01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:11.820
<v Speaker 2>with God and with the idea of the divine</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1836
01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.180
<v Speaker 2>that's the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the reason to stick around.</v>

1837
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Like the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's clothes.</v>

1838
01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Clothes are made by people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're telling me that God is saying</v>

1839
01:15:19.881 --> 01:15:23.090
<v Speaker 2>that you have to wear some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes and not other kinds of clothes.</v>

1840
01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm calling bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1841
01:15:24.681 --> 01:15:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Who's the people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not talking to God.</v>

1842
01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:28.610
<v Speaker 2>He's never talked to you and told you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>wear that.</v>

1843
01:15:28.611 --> 01:15:31.610
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you have an ideology where</v>

1844
01:15:31.611 --> 01:15:35.330
<v Speaker 2>you're trapped into dressing a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>way or wearing certain clothes or</v>

1845
01:15:35.331 --> 01:15:39.380
<v Speaker 2>wearing a certain emblem or some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>assemble your trapped by the mind of a</v>

1846
01:15:39.381 --> 01:15:41.660
<v Speaker 2>human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the mine of a human being.</v>

1847
01:15:41.661 --> 01:15:45.890
<v Speaker 2>They've created a pattern that they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to not deviate from whatsoever.</v>

1848
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:47.570
<v Speaker 2>I want you to walk around like this.</v>

1849
01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:50.420
<v Speaker 2>We're going to cover this and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna wear these and maybe have one of</v>

1850
01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:53.840
<v Speaker 2>those on your neck and maybe a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of beads that symbolizes your,</v>

1851
01:15:53.841 --> 01:15:55.970
<v Speaker 2>you're single.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not bullshit.</v>

1852
01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.890
<v Speaker 2>This is somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is by a person.</v>

1853
01:15:57.891 --> 01:16:01.440
<v Speaker 2>This is some cult shit to guy and 100%</v>
<v Speaker 2>has nothing to do with God like you.</v>

1854
01:16:01.441 --> 01:16:05.330
<v Speaker 2>You would be serving God more to be free</v>
<v Speaker 2>and naked like that.</v>

1855
01:16:05.331 --> 01:16:07.010
<v Speaker 2>God created you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If God is real,</v>

1856
01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:10.640
<v Speaker 2>he didn't make clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God doesn't have any stock and Levi's.</v>

1857
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:13.400
<v Speaker 2>God's not making burgers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1858
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:15.950
<v Speaker 2>we'd like you to be naked if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's real,</v>

1859
01:16:15.951 --> 01:16:19.790
<v Speaker 2>if God just lets or wear whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you want because it's all there for</v>

1860
01:16:19.791 --> 01:16:22.170
<v Speaker 2>humans to where like if people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>making clothes,</v>

1861
01:16:22.171 --> 01:16:24.410
<v Speaker 2>they're making clothes for people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should be able to wear whatever the</v>

1862
01:16:24.411 --> 01:16:25.550
<v Speaker 2>fuck they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was God,</v>

1863
01:16:25.551 --> 01:16:25.851
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1864
01:16:25.851 --> 01:16:26.330
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

1865
01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Where would we like stay warm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1866
01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.140
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't die I guess.</v>

1867
01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the only reason I'm just going</v>

1868
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:34.910
<v Speaker 2>to cover your hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why this is nonsense.</v>

1869
01:16:34.911 --> 01:16:38.280
<v Speaker 2>This is people talk and someone said</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a person said it.</v>

1870
01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.280
<v Speaker 2>We believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the priest must trust like a</v>

1871
01:16:40.281 --> 01:16:41.114
<v Speaker 2>wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1872
01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Why does he have to dress like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one dresses like the pope anymore.</v>

1873
01:16:44.211 --> 01:16:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Why is the pope dress like the pope?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1874
01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:49.430
<v Speaker 2>The fucking get the suit off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone loved wizardry so much.</v>

1876
01:16:51.121 --> 01:16:54.140

<v Speaker 2>I always think that when I was a kid and</v>

1877
01:16:54.141 --> 01:16:55.160
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to go to church,</v>

01:17:20.841 --> 01:17:24.620
<v Speaker 3>and this is what I was raised in,</v>

1904
01:17:58.671 --> 01:18:01.040
<v Speaker 3>be humble?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a servant of God,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's so preposterous.</v>

1911
01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:21.110
<v Speaker 3>The idea that God would want you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>dress like that.</v>

1912

1918

<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of it has a little shit stain</v>

1919
01:18:40.191 --> 01:18:42.200
<v Speaker 3>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's still the pope,</v>

01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:45.650
<v Speaker 3>so he's bringing it up to the sink and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's trying to wash it in the sink and</v>

1923
01:18:52.570 --> 01:18:55.730
<v Speaker 3>but don't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Respectful to my beliefs.</v>

1924
01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:57.320
<v Speaker 3>Your disrespect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1925

1928
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:06.950
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to be very wary of people.</v>

1929
01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:11.060
<v Speaker 3>They're just people and cults and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the patterns of thinking and</v>

1930
01:19:11.061 --> 01:19:13.280
<v Speaker 3>behaving that they want you to engage</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1931
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:15.550
<v Speaker 3>This is what we're looking at here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They're fighting the devil and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking with him as he walks around with</v>

<v Speaker 3>his giant staff of magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a wizard's wand.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's a Goddamn Gandalf wand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's dressed like a wizard and he's got</v>

<v Speaker 3>from that up until the storm cloud that</v>

1940
01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:46.460

<v Speaker 3>Cape Pitch is real big.</v>

1942
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:52.490
<v Speaker 3>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cape Bitch is a huge position in these</v>

1943
01:19:52.491 --> 01:19:55.410
<v Speaker 3>guys is to Cape pitches the guy and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>left's probably that annoying.</v>

1944
01:19:55.411 --> 01:19:57.440
<v Speaker 3>It's fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet he tells a lot of long stories.</v>

1945
01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:59.730
<v Speaker 3>Probably guessed the pope alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1946
01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:01.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just wanted to tell you about my cousin.</v>

1947
01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:03.050
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1948
01:20:03.051 --> 01:20:05.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a safe in the Lord and you know,</v>

1949
01:20:05.571 --> 01:20:07.770
<v Speaker 3>I think right now he's not getting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guba.</v>

1950
01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Is this the first pope that's okay with</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay marriage?</v>

1951
01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:12.000
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that what he said?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1952
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:15.240
<v Speaker 3>he's got to say this is the first one</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was like whatever he tossed out to</v>

1953
01:20:15.241 --> 01:20:16.740
<v Speaker 3>thrown too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a normal chair.</v>

1954
01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.150
<v Speaker 3>Does he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1955
01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.680
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is kind of cool,</v>

1956
01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:22.320
<v Speaker 3>but I think that was probably a joint</v>
<v Speaker 3>effort.</v>

1957
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:25.190
<v Speaker 3>They like look as a pc move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a politically fucking car.</v>

1958
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Doors behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a thousand kids back there</v>

1959
01:20:27.451 --> 01:20:28.530
<v Speaker 3>waiting to suck your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1960
01:20:28.531 --> 01:20:32.400
<v Speaker 3>we've got to make this right though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got damage.</v>

1961
01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:34.470
<v Speaker 3>We're still gonna do plenty of kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>

1962
01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:37.380
<v Speaker 3>one of you saw the pope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a throughway of chair and got one of</v>

1963
01:20:37.381 --> 01:20:39.030
<v Speaker 3>those like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the medicine balls to sit on.</v>

1964
01:20:39.031 --> 01:20:39.870
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he started,</v>

1965
01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:42.360
<v Speaker 3>he started really getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had standing desks and shit.</v>

1966
01:20:42.361 --> 01:20:43.800
<v Speaker 3>He started getting like corporate</v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

1967
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:45.110
<v Speaker 3>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you show me here,</v>

1968
01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it the pope won't be all the new one.</v>

1969
01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:49.620
<v Speaker 3>The popemobile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new one doesn't have bulletproof</v>

1970
01:20:49.621 --> 01:20:51.750
<v Speaker 3>glass anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last pope was like,</v>

1971
01:20:51.751 --> 01:20:53.770
<v Speaker 3>I know they want to kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hiding liquor.</v>

1972
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:56.430
<v Speaker 3>They don't even need glasses all the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>up because his back arches silver so</v>

1973
01:20:56.431 --> 01:20:57.930
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't sit up straight so they don't</v>

1974
01:20:57.931 --> 01:20:59.850
<v Speaker 3>need high glass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a child window.</v>

1975
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:04.320
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that is different colors of</v>
<v Speaker 3>glass because I would imagine you want</v>

1976
01:21:04.321 --> 01:21:06.660
<v Speaker 3>to keep the head shots from coming down</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the roof.</v>

1977
01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.680
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1978
01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:11.220
<v Speaker 3>if someone's going to shoot that dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this guy doesn't even thinking he</v>

1979
01:21:11.221 --> 01:21:13.470
<v Speaker 3>was going to shoot him and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone wants to shoot me,</v>

1980
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:14.900
<v Speaker 3>they'll fucking shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1981
01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.200
<v Speaker 3>It's done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1982
01:21:16.201 --> 01:21:17.250
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's exposed.</v>

1983
01:21:17.251 --> 01:21:18.590
<v Speaker 3>Is it a Benz?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a Benz.</v>

1984
01:21:18.650 --> 01:21:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Oha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

1985
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said he left Mercedes more baby.</v>

1986
01:21:22.561 --> 01:21:26.140
<v Speaker 3>Jesus loves the G Wagon Kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the other old one's a Benz to</v>

1987
01:21:26.170 --> 01:21:30.240
<v Speaker 3>little light proof one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bequeath my son a Mercedes Benz boy.</v>

1988
01:21:30.241 --> 01:21:33.960
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that says faith like</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving around in a bulletproof fish</v>

1989
01:21:33.961 --> 01:21:35.850
<v Speaker 3>tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1990
01:21:35.851 --> 01:21:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean that just shows you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really have a belief that God has a</v>

1991
01:21:38.731 --> 01:21:40.380
<v Speaker 3>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can run flat,</v>

1992
01:21:40.381 --> 01:21:43.530
<v Speaker 3>half inch thick steel plate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lightweight Kevlar Armor,</v>

1993
01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:46.080
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three inch composite plastic glass that</v>

1994
01:21:46.081 --> 01:21:48.600
<v Speaker 3>was spoke with an explosive Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ.</v>

1995
01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:51.510
<v Speaker 3>It's five tons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 10,000 pound truck.</v>

1996
01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.700
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 miles a gallon.</v>

1997
01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.910
<v Speaker 3>That's very efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is really here to 66 seconds.</v>

1998
01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:58.050
<v Speaker 3>What sets quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1999
01:21:58.110 --> 01:21:59.730

<v Speaker 3>How's that even possible?</v>

2000

<v Speaker 3>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And get that fucking thing on top gear.</v>

2001
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:07.140
<v Speaker 3>Run a stop sign of Stopwatch with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's no way that gets zero to 60 in</v>

2002
01:22:07.141 --> 01:22:08.790
<v Speaker 3>six seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going to rice.</v>

2003
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:13.320
<v Speaker 3>The pope mobile first is the king of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia is mobile.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The Pope Mobile.</v>

2011
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:31.400

<v Speaker 3>I like how self deprecating there when</v>

2014
01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:38.730
<v Speaker 3>they shit on cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's my favorite.</v>

2015
01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Clarkson's the best cause it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious the way he shits on things.</v>

2016
01:22:41.941 --> 01:22:45.750
<v Speaker 3>There's so much fun and I just like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see fucking friends dump on each other.</v>

2017
01:22:45.751 --> 01:22:46.740
<v Speaker 3>On TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:22:46.741 --> 01:22:48.600
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to watch people dump on each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

2019
01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:50.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in this day and age.</v>

2020
01:22:50.171 --> 01:22:53.520

<v Speaker 3>Bullying their friend.</v>

2021
01:22:53.610 --> 01:22:55.320
<v Speaker 3>That's really rude to pick on him like</v>

<v Speaker 4>assumption like that.</v>

01:24:17.831 --> 01:24:22.780
<v Speaker 4>some real track time experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the Guy Chris Harris who's on it,</v>

2056

2058
01:24:30.011 --> 01:24:30.520
<v Speaker 4>about them.</v>

2059
01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:34.200
<v Speaker 4>Like he really understands like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the geometry and the physics behind it.</v>

2060
01:24:34.210 --> 01:24:37.000
<v Speaker 4>Like with the suspension,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can tell you what they've changed,</v>

2061
01:24:37.001 --> 01:24:40.120
<v Speaker 4>what they've improved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would it feels like and what's being</v>

2062
01:24:40.121 --> 01:24:42.730
<v Speaker 4>lost in this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's always impressive to me.</v>

2063
01:24:42.731 --> 01:24:45.130

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2084
01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.970
<v Speaker 4>fictional mechanisms that in our film</v>
<v Speaker 4>world or real like the fucking</v>

<v Speaker 4>Millennium Falcon from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

2089
01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:49.780
<v Speaker 4>They had that for a bunch of cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kit cars are pretty wild to kick arse.</v>

2090
01:25:49.781 --> 01:25:52.510
<v Speaker 4>I was always fascinated with my buddy's</v>
<v Speaker 4>dad used to build mgs all the time and</v>

2091
01:25:52.511 --> 01:25:53.350
<v Speaker 4>let us fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2092
01:25:53.351 --> 01:25:56.460
<v Speaker 4>and I was fascinated with mgs cause he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he loved him.</v>

2093
01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:01.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was just dope English kit car</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was for sale really recently.</v>

2094
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:03.860
<v Speaker 4>And you would do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>buy it</v>

2095
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:07.430
<v Speaker 3>and then once you got it over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you had to put an engine in it.</v>

2096
01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2097
01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.040
<v Speaker 3>sell it to you with no engine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2098
01:26:10.041 --> 01:26:11.780
<v Speaker 3>You've got to bite you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you build a first and they drop it</v>

2099
01:26:11.781 --> 01:26:12.680
<v Speaker 3>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jumped into,</v>

2100
01:26:12.681 --> 01:26:14.390
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was different.</v>

2101
01:26:14.391 --> 01:26:16.070
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a total kit car.</v>

2102
01:26:16.071 --> 01:26:18.860
<v Speaker 3>Like you start from scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you attach the suspension.</v>

2103
01:26:18.861 --> 01:26:20.120
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that.</v>

2104
01:26:20.121 --> 01:26:22.010
<v Speaker 3>It was like they would sell it to you as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2105
01:26:22.190 --> 01:26:25.940
<v Speaker 3>as a car with no engine and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have to put the engine in.</v>

2106
01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:27.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a current,</v>

2107
01:26:27.691 --> 01:26:29.510
<v Speaker 3>the name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's right there,</v>

2108
01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:31.590
<v Speaker 3>but there's so many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many blocks I could,</v>

2109
01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:34.640
<v Speaker 3>there's only so many blocks I could fit</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that framework.</v>

2110
01:26:34.641 --> 01:26:35.001
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2111
01:26:35.001 --> 01:26:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would get like a parameter and you</v>

2112
01:26:36.411 --> 01:26:40.160
<v Speaker 3>know like a v eight ls one or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and try to put it in there.</v>

2113
01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:41.300
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Noble,</v>

2114
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:42.620
<v Speaker 3>Noble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's called.</v>

2115
01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.820
<v Speaker 3>It's called the noble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dope look and Carmen and guys,</v>

2116
01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.470
<v Speaker 3>I think they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2117
01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:50.750
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to have a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of horsepower could take,</v>

2118
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:52.670
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he'd have the drive train</v>

2119
01:26:52.671 --> 01:26:53.870
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he had to have the ad,</v>

2120
01:26:53.871 --> 01:26:56.810
<v Speaker 3>the drive train as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think essentially it was just a frame</v>

2121
01:26:56.811 --> 01:27:01.100
<v Speaker 3>and the doors and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must've just been parts from other</v>

2122
01:27:01.490 --> 01:27:06.460
<v Speaker 3>third party car manufacturers and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got whatever parts they could it</v>

2123
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:09.230
<v Speaker 3>put them together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You built that and then the engine is</v>

2124
01:27:09.231 --> 01:27:12.830
<v Speaker 3>what from anywhere at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd have to just know how to</v>

2125
01:27:12.831 --> 01:27:15.230
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a whole market now or</v>

2126
01:27:15.231 --> 01:27:19.640
<v Speaker 3>they buy engines and then they put him</v>
<v Speaker 3>in older cars so they'll buy like,</v>

2127
01:27:19.641 --> 01:27:21.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the big companies that does it as</v>

2128
01:27:21.921 --> 01:27:23.210
<v Speaker 3>a company called icon.</v>

2129
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:25.490
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2130
01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:28.220
<v Speaker 3>what they do is they take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2131
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.790
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2132
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:33.790
<v Speaker 3>69 bronco and they strip it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put the car back together again</v>

2133
01:27:34.221 --> 01:27:39.180
<v Speaker 3>with a modern suspension and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a 2017 Ford Mustang engine and</v>

2134
01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.570
<v Speaker 3>enshrine the Bronco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2135
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.240
<v Speaker 3>So they put totally modern brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally modern suspension,</v>

2136
01:27:44.241 --> 01:27:46.040
<v Speaker 3>bronco engine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2137
01:27:46.041 --> 01:27:47.290
<v Speaker 3>But the Bronco Engines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2138
01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:48.440
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2139
01:27:48.441 --> 01:27:50.310
<v Speaker 3>a 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2140
01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:52.070
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for tea,</v>

2141
01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:54.740
<v Speaker 3>it's called the coyote motor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really high end,</v>

2142
01:27:54.741 --> 01:27:56.540
<v Speaker 3>high tech motor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really nice motor.</v>

2143
01:27:56.810 --> 01:28:00.110
<v Speaker 3>So you have like this old school costs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have like kits,</v>

2144
01:28:00.111 --> 01:28:02.240

<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

2145
01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:04.970
<v Speaker 3>And maybe you and I talked about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone was saying that they were taking</v>

2146
01:28:04.971 --> 01:28:07.880
<v Speaker 3>classic methe Ford might have been doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>this themselves where they take classic</v>

2147
01:28:07.881 --> 01:28:12.170
<v Speaker 3>mustangs and put New Mustang engines in</v>
<v Speaker 3>old classic Mustang bodies.</v>

2148
01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:13.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about that.</v>

2149
01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:18.050
<v Speaker 3>You and I were talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy who's got a page on</v>

2150
01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:21.290
<v Speaker 3>instagram where he did it and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a,</v>

2151
01:28:21.291 --> 01:28:26.291
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called gt 500 super swap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's got a somewhat,</v>

2152
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:32.110
<v Speaker 3>Ma had a shelby shelby gt 500 yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from 2012 and he put that body of a 1969</v>

2153
01:28:34.911 --> 01:28:38.840
<v Speaker 3>car over the 2012 car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2154
01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:41.330
<v Speaker 3>So it's the best of both worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it right there.</v>

2155
01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:44.420
<v Speaker 3>It is so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so beautiful.</v>

2156
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:46.520

<v Speaker 3>So this guy nailed it and,</v>

2157
01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:48.110
<v Speaker 3>but he's only done one car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does,</v>

2158
01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.540
<v Speaker 3>he was like doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought there was a company that was</v>

2159
01:28:50.541 --> 01:28:52.880
<v Speaker 3>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently it's just this one dude</v>

2160
01:28:52.881 --> 01:28:54.350
<v Speaker 3>who's done this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that run for?</v>

2161
01:28:54.351 --> 01:28:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Did it say what he's selling those for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's selling it.</v>

2162
01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:58.160
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just wants to fucking shit.</v>

2163
01:28:58.210 --> 01:28:59.043
<v Speaker 3>He just did his shit.</v>

2164
01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:03.420
<v Speaker 3>He sell the fuck out of that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should sell the fuck out of that</v>

2165
01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:04.141
<v Speaker 3>look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be what?</v>

2166
01:29:04.141 --> 01:29:08.220
<v Speaker 3>I had a 2012 gt 500 [inaudible] who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great car.</v>

2167
01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:10.410
<v Speaker 3>That's another one though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a different color.</v>

2168

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's different car for helping a</v>

2169
01:29:13.351 --> 01:29:14.240
<v Speaker 3>friend's house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six eight Mustang.</v>

<v Speaker 3>33,000 miles is nothing.</v>

2172
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:22.260
<v Speaker 3>That is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a beautiful card.</v>

2173
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:23.790
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things were classic.</v>

2174
01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:27.720
<v Speaker 3>Those 1960s mustangs are some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most beautiful shapes ever.</v>

2175
01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:33.020

<v Speaker 3>to go by the wayside.</v>

2180
01:29:43.441 --> 01:29:46.530
<v Speaker 3>Like there's only so many cars that will</v>
<v Speaker 3>stick around as classics from the,</v>

<v Speaker 3>we would need,</v>

2396
01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:45.510
<v Speaker 3>it would have to be like someone you</v>
<v Speaker 3>bill,</v>

2397
01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:47.470
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to be the rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not me.</v>

2398
01:38:47.490 --> 01:38:48.570
<v Speaker 3>Like he could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can do it.</v>

2399
01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:49.800
<v Speaker 3>But the why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why doesn't it exist?</v>

2400
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:51.330
<v Speaker 3>Maybe people don't want those movies</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2401
01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>

2402
01:38:52.290 --> 01:38:53.860
<v Speaker 3>You have to have some sort of a metric</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2403
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:56.670
<v Speaker 3>They're judging this from right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when they're making these movies.</v>

2404
01:38:57.210 --> 01:38:58.590
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because they made a couple</v>
<v Speaker 3>of seconds</v>

2405
01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:01.300
<v Speaker 1>near a movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they made it a couple of comic</v>

2406
01:39:01.450 --> 01:39:04.720
<v Speaker 1>comic book films and they did so fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that now we have a bevy of them</v>

2407
01:39:04.721 --> 01:39:06.430
<v Speaker 1>cause they know that there's such a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>market for it.</v>

2408
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:09.310
<v Speaker 1>So I can't imagine you wouldn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see another</v>

2409
01:39:09.570 --> 01:39:10.700
<v Speaker 3>diehard type dudes.</v>

2536
01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:11.390
<v Speaker 4>A big one was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2537
01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:16.190
<v Speaker 4>writers for sitcoms would come same shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they would watch people do sets and</v>

2538
01:44:16.191 --> 01:44:18.670
<v Speaker 4>then they would wind up putting their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their bits and like,</v>

2539
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:22.670
<v Speaker 4>even in fucking Seinfeld kept wanting</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kevin James Signature bits got used on</v>

01:44:22.671 --> 01:44:26.240
<v Speaker 4>Seinfeld after he had a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>meetings and then they came to see him</v>

<v Speaker 4>to see him performing an NBC showcase.</v>

2542

<v Speaker 4>This is like when Kevin was a getting a</v>
<v Speaker 4>development deal and they came down and</v>

<v Speaker 4>I tested for Saturday night live and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>sign a form that says these characters</v>

2548

<v Speaker 4>saying anything.</v>

2551
01:44:55.161 --> 01:44:56.630
<v Speaker 4>But they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a character ended up on the</v>

2552
01:44:56.631 --> 01:44:59.390
<v Speaker 4>show that Vanessa Bayer did fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>hilariously,</v>

2553
01:44:59.391 --> 01:45:00.920
<v Speaker 4>that I did something similar in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>addiction.</v>

01:45:00.921 --> 01:45:01.431
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's winning me.</v>

<v Speaker 4>almost taste it.</v>

2572
01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:34.280
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're making you sign something</v>

2573
01:45:34.281 --> 01:45:35.510
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna steal from you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We're going to steal from you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to pay you anything.</v>

2576
01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:42.680
<v Speaker 4>We're going to use this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be a fucking Mike Meyers movie</v>

2577
01:45:42.681 --> 01:45:43.670
<v Speaker 4>someday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'd have to say,</v>

2578
01:45:43.671 --> 01:45:44.240
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sir.</v>

2579
01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:46.340
<v Speaker 4>May I have another take it and take</v>
<v Speaker 4>acid.</v>

2580
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:49.040
<v Speaker 4>Can I dig it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy.</v>

2581
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.903
<v Speaker 4>I took it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2582
01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:51.710
<v Speaker 4>I took it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a wild process.</v>

2583
01:45:51.850 --> 01:45:55.670
<v Speaker 4>Let the fact that some she usually</v>
<v Speaker 4>successful business wouldn't want to</v>

2584
01:45:55.671 --> 01:45:59.140
<v Speaker 4>compensate people for creating those</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas to fly you out to,</v>

2585
01:45:59.230 --> 01:46:04.070
<v Speaker 4>to show yourself off in a few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean even if you just don't hire them</v>

2586
01:46:04.071 --> 01:46:06.860
<v Speaker 4>but you liked that character,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you there should be like an established</v>

2587
01:46:06.861 --> 01:46:09.070
<v Speaker 4>rate that you have to pay for things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean not,</v>

2588
01:46:09.090 --> 01:46:10.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my whole thing is like,</v>

2589
01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:12.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying what they did was what I</v>
<v Speaker 4>did,</v>

2590
01:46:12.261 --> 01:46:14.160
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was some similarities in,</v>

2591
01:46:14.161 --> 01:46:17.450
<v Speaker 4>in the nuances of the character that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought were either just,</v>

2592
01:46:17.451 --> 01:46:19.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a confluence of great ideas,</v>

2593
01:46:19.881 --> 01:46:21.770
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is hard.</v>

2594
01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:25.550
<v Speaker 4>You think about that stuff you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that close to what I did?</v>

2595
01:46:25.551 --> 01:46:27.080
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we said back in the day,</v>

2596
01:46:27.081 --> 01:46:29.090
<v Speaker 4>like our show shows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were blatantly steep.</v>

2597
01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:31.670
<v Speaker 4>People have been blatantly stealing in</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy for fucking ever.</v>

2598
01:46:31.671 --> 01:46:35.780
<v Speaker 4>It's been like the beginning of time and</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in the 70s which I think is</v>

2599
01:46:35.781 --> 01:46:39.800
<v Speaker 4>what we tried to show was like they</v>
<v Speaker 4>would steal these radio guys and fucking</v>

2600
01:46:39.801 --> 01:46:41.240
<v Speaker 4>show up again and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2601
01:46:41.690 --> 01:46:43.290
<v Speaker 4>like it was like it.</v>

2607
01:46:52.801 --> 01:46:55.680
<v Speaker 3>in a generation where you didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>paid in the sense of like when I</v>

2608
01:46:55.681 --> 01:46:58.260
<v Speaker 3>remember hearing stories of guys that</v>
<v Speaker 3>would go on the road and then get fucked</v>

2623
01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:33.290
<v Speaker 3>I know a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a guy still getting placed on him</v>

2624
01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.190
<v Speaker 3>every time I'm around him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's coked up.</v>

2625
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:39.240
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just limited like the old days.</v>

2626
01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:40.800
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never saw.</v>

2627
01:47:40.801 --> 01:47:42.750
<v Speaker 3>It has been a part of it from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of time,</v>

2628
01:47:43.090 --> 01:47:46.140
<v Speaker 3>like from the beginning of when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>started doing standup,</v>

2629
01:47:46.141 --> 01:47:49.770
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of club owners that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>on coke and they just normal.</v>

2630
01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:52.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they partied Nick's comedy stop in</v>

2631
01:47:52.141 --> 01:47:54.180
<v Speaker 3>Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't never happened to me cause I</v>

2632
01:47:54.181 --> 01:47:57.120
<v Speaker 3>was never a coke guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they would offer you if you wanted</v>

2633
01:47:57.121 --> 01:47:58.980
<v Speaker 3>to get paid in money or coke.</v>

2634
01:48:01.110 --> 01:48:03.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any other industry.</v>

2635
01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:06.840
<v Speaker 3>They would pay the comics and cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Lenny Clarke has told me about it</v>

2636
01:48:06.841 --> 01:48:09.180
<v Speaker 3>in great detail and said I'll just take</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coke.</v>

2637
01:48:09.181 --> 01:48:11.730
<v Speaker 3>I guess some guys took the coke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you do a half a half?</v>

2638
01:48:11.731 --> 01:48:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Can you do like an eight ball?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these guys were selling coke and</v>

2639
01:48:15.271 --> 01:48:17.250
<v Speaker 3>running comedy clubs and it's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>

2640
01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:20.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was total on organized crime shit.</v>

2641
01:48:20.130 --> 01:48:23.760
<v Speaker 3>It was all organized crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just like at a level where it was</v>

2642
01:48:23.761 --> 01:48:25.980
<v Speaker 3>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like they were killing people</v>

2643
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:29.370
<v Speaker 3>but they were selling coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But coke was still okay that it was</v>

2644
01:48:29.371 --> 01:48:29.841
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2645
01:48:29.841 --> 01:48:33.450
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's totally captured the crazy days</v>

2646
01:48:33.451 --> 01:48:36.810
<v Speaker 3>of Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid back then so I got to see it</v>

2647
01:48:36.811 --> 01:48:39.300
<v Speaker 3>really from the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it all started before I even</v>

2648
01:48:39.301 --> 01:48:41.280
<v Speaker 3>started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about four years before I started.</v>

2649
01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:45.780
<v Speaker 3>It was at its peak and like 84 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys were maniacs out of their</v>

2650
01:48:45.781 --> 01:48:48.860
<v Speaker 3>minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maniacs hammered every night on.</v>

2651
01:48:48.861 --> 01:48:51.330
<v Speaker 3>So like Mario joinder was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it last night at the store.</v>

2652
01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:52.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he was hosting the show that we</v>

2653
01:48:52.921 --> 01:48:56.040
<v Speaker 3>were doing and Mario joined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like they would just go up there</v>

2654
01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:59.370
<v Speaker 3>and just get hammered and just be</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing.</v>

2655
01:48:59.550 --> 01:49:00.780
<v Speaker 3>It's crushing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blacked out,</v>

2656
01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:02.250
<v Speaker 3>crushing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blacked out,</v>

2657
01:49:02.251 --> 01:49:03.300
<v Speaker 3>drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hammered.</v>

2658
01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:06.570
<v Speaker 3>It was a different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a whole different groove,</v>

2659
01:49:06.571 --> 01:49:08.460
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you have to be on your p's and q's,</v>

2660
01:49:08.461 --> 01:49:10.650
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now everyone's got to be real tight.</v>

2661
01:49:10.651 --> 01:49:12.450
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the majority of people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>

2662
01:49:12.570 --> 01:49:14.130
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the longer I've stayed in comedy,</v>

2663
01:49:14.131 --> 01:49:17.400
<v Speaker 3>the more I see people sober now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people,</v>

2664
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:19.250
<v Speaker 3>it's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are,</v>

2665
01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:21.870
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot more clean people working</v>

2666
01:49:21.871 --> 01:49:25.260
<v Speaker 3>now than people who party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of people that</v>

2667
01:49:25.261 --> 01:49:29.520
<v Speaker 3>realize the consequences of partying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can only stay on that fucking train</v>

2668
01:49:29.521 --> 01:49:32.910
<v Speaker 3>for so long because you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>great ones that got derailed,</v>

2669
01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:36.450
<v Speaker 3>whether it's cat williams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Kinison,</v>

2670
01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:38.790
<v Speaker 3>the great ones that have been derailed</v>
<v Speaker 3>by cocaine.</v>

2671
01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:40.890
<v Speaker 3>There's Liz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ton of them that we know of.</v>

2672
01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:43.590
<v Speaker 3>The cocaine one gets you ends in a bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2673
01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:46.230
<v Speaker 3>If you go back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your creativity goes away.</v>

2674
01:49:46.231 --> 01:49:48.430
<v Speaker 3>You get paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get tired.</v>

2675
01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Your act diminishes greatly like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennison him and my opinions with a best</v>

2676
01:49:52.751 --> 01:49:55.300
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the best example of a guy who at</v>

2677
01:49:55.301 --> 01:49:59.120
<v Speaker 2>one point in time was just arguably the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best ever for like two years and then</v>

2678
01:49:59.121 --> 01:49:59.830
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2679
01:49:59.830 --> 01:50:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Just a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Ma and a thing like no one had seen</v>

2680
01:50:03.791 --> 01:50:07.690
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there wasn't a Sam Kennison like an</v>

2681
01:50:07.691 --> 01:50:08.524
<v Speaker 2>archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2682
01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:10.270
<v Speaker 2>it didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

2683
01:50:10.271 --> 01:50:15.271
<v Speaker 2>this fat guy been fucked over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been married twice and he just</v>

2684
01:50:15.461 --> 01:50:19.780
<v Speaker 2>would come out this giant fucking big</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

2685
01:50:19.781 --> 01:50:23.260
<v Speaker 2>There's this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got fucking human storm of comedy,</v>

2686
01:50:23.710 --> 01:50:27.460
<v Speaker 2>but then it dropped off so radically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Ari was talking about the other</v>

2687
01:50:27.461 --> 01:50:30.550
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go and watch his stuff after</v>

2688
01:50:30.551 --> 01:50:33.820
<v Speaker 2>the second special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's just to eat.</v>

2689
01:50:33.821 --> 01:50:38.560
<v Speaker 2>The second special is a big dropoff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real shit is his cd or it wasn't</v>

2690
01:50:38.561 --> 01:50:40.180
<v Speaker 2>even a CD.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Warner brothers wouldn't even make it a</v>

2691
01:50:40.181 --> 01:50:43.570
<v Speaker 2>CD cause it was so homophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kept it a cassette for real.</v>

2692
01:50:44.710 --> 01:50:49.000
<v Speaker 2>His cassette louder than hell and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>his hbo special and don't watch anything</v>

2693
01:50:49.001 --> 01:50:49.230
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

2694
01:50:49.230 --> 01:50:52.370
<v Speaker 1>The HBO specials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I remember fucking seeing as like</v>

2695
01:50:52.371 --> 01:50:55.520
<v Speaker 1>one of the things where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is insane.</v>

2696
01:50:55.521 --> 01:50:59.210
<v Speaker 1>This is like a fucking mad man who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting all the marks.</v>

2697
01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:00.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2698
01:51:00.381 --> 01:51:00.951
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2699
01:51:00.951 --> 01:51:02.120
<v Speaker 1>smart madman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2700
01:51:02.121 --> 01:51:03.170
<v Speaker 1>at Gigi a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

2701
01:51:03.171 --> 01:51:04.610
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not,</v>

2702
01:51:04.611 --> 01:51:06.650
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't miss it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2703
01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:08.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like watching something that</v>

2704
01:51:08.091 --> 01:51:09.890
<v Speaker 1>someone do something brilliantly in</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports where you're like,</v>

2705
01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:13.130
<v Speaker 1>everything worked perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like all the stars were aligning</v>

2706
01:51:13.131 --> 01:51:16.550
<v Speaker 1>for him to just chugging on this train</v>
<v Speaker 1>of crushing.</v>

2707
01:51:16.610 --> 01:51:18.140
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy shit to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2708
01:51:18.170 --> 01:51:20.210
<v Speaker 1>And it was like during the Reagan era</v>

2709
01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:22.620
<v Speaker 2>where people started to get a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>buttoned down.</v>

2710
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Like that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went from Carter to Reagan,</v>

2711
01:51:25.381 --> 01:51:27.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we go from this hippie peanut farmer</v>

2712
01:51:27.661 --> 01:51:29.970
<v Speaker 2>from Georgia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The couldn't get the hostages back from,</v>

2713
01:51:29.971 --> 01:51:33.820
<v Speaker 2>I ran to this movie star with a slick</v>
<v Speaker 2>back hair and oh,</v>

2714
01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:36.090
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

2715
01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:39.570
<v Speaker 2>he was a part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was a part of the whole</v>

2716
01:51:39.571 --> 01:51:44.130
<v Speaker 2>country was fucking crazy at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And kinison came along and he sort of</v>

2717
01:51:44.131 --> 01:51:46.740
<v Speaker 2>embodied the frustrations that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people fell.</v>

2718
01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:48.960
<v Speaker 2>The timing was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

2719
01:51:49.170 --> 01:51:52.850
<v Speaker 2>But cocaine got him like he wasn't the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same guy after,</v>

2720
01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:56.430
<v Speaker 2>after that special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the just this giant dropoff in</v>

2721
01:51:56.431 --> 01:51:58.350
<v Speaker 2>the amount of focus he put on his work.</v>

2722
01:51:58.620 --> 01:51:59.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2723
01:51:59.221 --> 01:52:01.080
<v Speaker 1>because you become complacent and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>also like,</v>

2724
01:52:01.081 --> 01:52:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I think the more money and fame you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think unless you have sense,</v>

2725
01:52:05.281 --> 01:52:07.830
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of groundedness and humility</v>

2726
01:52:07.831 --> 01:52:09.240
<v Speaker 1>around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like friends to be like,</v>

2727
01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:11.460
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to fucking change your game.</v>

2728
01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:12.840
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're slipping,</v>

2729
01:52:12.841 --> 01:52:14.670
<v Speaker 1>you're not producing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not producing any more.</v>

2730
01:52:14.671 --> 01:52:16.200
<v Speaker 1>You're not writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not developing.</v>

2731
01:52:16.201 --> 01:52:18.150
<v Speaker 1>You're not changing who you are as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic.</v>

2732
01:52:18.450 --> 01:52:20.610
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't have that around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everyone around you is like more</v>

2733
01:52:20.611 --> 01:52:21.660
<v Speaker 1>fucking coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Dude.</v>

2734
01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:24.610
<v Speaker 2>More bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's overages.</v>

2735
01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.340
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>straight.</v>

2885
01:58:29.950 --> 01:58:32.290
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the most fun I've ever had.</v>

2886
01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:35.350
<v Speaker 4>And then I just stopped doing it for</v>
<v Speaker 4>years and years and years and I tried it</v>

2887
01:58:35.351 --> 01:58:37.060
<v Speaker 4>again one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was it.</v>

2888
01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:39.550
<v Speaker 4>Never again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only did it once,</v>

2889
01:58:39.580 --> 01:58:41.650
<v Speaker 4>but it was spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

2890
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:42.080
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

2891
01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:43.030
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the calm down,</v>

2892
01:58:43.031 --> 01:58:45.520
<v Speaker 3>those who strong the comedown was</v>
<v Speaker 3>devastating.</v>

2893
01:58:45.521 --> 01:58:47.800
<v Speaker 3>I was like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you get hard crashes when you do</v>

2894
01:58:47.860 --> 01:58:49.090
<v Speaker 3>shrimps or no?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2895
01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:50.590
<v Speaker 3>You don't crash at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2896
01:58:51.310 --> 01:58:54.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean I feel weird sometimes I fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always so bill belittled,</v>

2897
01:58:54.970 --> 01:58:57.940
<v Speaker 3>not belittled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so obliterated by the experience.</v>

2898
01:58:58.030 --> 01:58:59.710
<v Speaker 3>It's always like I'm trying to process</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2899
01:58:59.711 --> 01:59:02.140
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm barely aware of my physical state.</v>

2900
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like eating just to like,</v>

2901
01:59:04.031 --> 01:59:06.640
<v Speaker 3>just cause I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I have to get calories excess and</v>

2902
01:59:06.660 --> 01:59:08.130
<v Speaker 3>it should be in my body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2903
01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:10.000
<v Speaker 3>let me just figure out what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>just happened.</v>

2904
01:59:10.330 --> 01:59:11.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always like,</v>

2905
01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:12.220
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew,</v>

2906
01:59:12.221 --> 01:59:13.930
<v Speaker 3>I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did know like I Kinda,</v>

2907
01:59:14.220 --> 01:59:17.740
<v Speaker 3>I needed to see it but my crack at my</v>
<v Speaker 3>crashes were for some reason they used</v>

2908
01:59:17.741 --> 01:59:20.110
<v Speaker 3>to be fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to come down off of mushrooms and</v>

2909
01:59:20.111 --> 01:59:22.510
<v Speaker 3>I would feel fucking miserable.</v>

2910
01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Is it always every time he did it almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2911
01:59:25.330 --> 01:59:28.900
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever think that like maybe the</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing that does happen apparently is</v>

2912
01:59:28.901 --> 01:59:32.380
<v Speaker 3>that sometimes people grow mushrooms and</v>
<v Speaker 3>oddly enough the mushrooms have fungus</v>

2913
01:59:32.381 --> 01:59:35.350
<v Speaker 3>that develops on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get sick from the fungus and</v>

2914
01:59:35.351 --> 01:59:37.480
<v Speaker 3>then sometimes people say they have like</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

2915
01:59:37.930 --> 01:59:40.120
<v Speaker 3>they have these almost like hangover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like feelings.</v>

2916
01:59:40.121 --> 01:59:42.220
<v Speaker 3>Because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have read that I've never had a</v>

2917
01:59:42.221 --> 01:59:42.971
<v Speaker 3>hangover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I just,</v>

2918
01:59:42.971 --> 01:59:45.940
<v Speaker 3>I just remembered a lot of the crashes</v>
<v Speaker 3>being like a fucking bummer.</v>

2919
01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:49.110
<v Speaker 3>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is for some reason acid was the</v>

2920
01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:51.130
<v Speaker 3>first time I ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Acid was had like,</v>

2921
01:59:51.131 --> 01:59:53.740
<v Speaker 3>I felt like even when I was off of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was great.</v>

2922
01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:55.750
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really didn't fuck with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2923
01:59:55.770 --> 01:59:58.600
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did acid for the first time last year.</v>

2924
01:59:58.910 --> 02:00:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Like was it last year?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six months ago?</v>

2925
02:00:00.670 --> 02:00:02.200
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2926
02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:03.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it didn't,</v>

2927
02:00:03.281 --> 02:00:04.114
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't,</v>

2928
02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:06.980
<v Speaker 3>it didn't crash me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that felt weird when it was over.</v>

2929
02:00:07.630 --> 02:00:08.880
<v Speaker 3>I was just didn't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2930
02:00:09.050 --> 02:00:10.330
<v Speaker 3>I did it and I didn't want to do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2931
02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:12.070
<v Speaker 3>I remember doing it and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

2932
02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:15.370
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't want to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say the thing about ecstasy,</v>

2933
02:00:15.371 --> 02:00:18.610
<v Speaker 3>those if you take five htp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to take that shit.</v>

2934
02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:23.380
<v Speaker 3>Like while you're on it cause it helps</v>
<v Speaker 3>rebuild your serotonin so it balances it</v>

2935
02:00:23.381 --> 02:00:23.930
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2936
02:00:23.930 --> 02:00:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's the building blocks for</v>
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin.</v>

2937
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Take that and it'll uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll help you a boost yourself back up</v>

2938
02:00:30.251 --> 02:00:32.040
<v Speaker 3>when you come through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's because once you come through,</v>

2939
02:00:32.050 --> 02:00:34.270
<v Speaker 3>cause it gives you this giant burst of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin.</v>

2940
02:00:34.271 --> 02:00:37.510
<v Speaker 3>You feel so wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then it depletes train while before</v>

2941
02:00:37.511 --> 02:00:40.930
<v Speaker 3>it spools back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The five htp apparently can help</v>

2942
02:00:40.931 --> 02:00:43.120
<v Speaker 3>mitigate that and sounds like printer</v>
<v Speaker 3>ink.</v>

2943
02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

2944
02:00:44.590 --> 02:00:46.120
<v Speaker 3>The five htp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

2945
02:00:46.270 --> 02:00:47.920
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like a science enough staying</v>

2946
02:00:47.921 --> 02:00:51.610

02:09:24.281 --> 02:09:26.860
<v Speaker 3>his career was over and then it all</v>
<v Speaker 3>dried up for him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>not one,</v>

3202
02:11:01.101 --> 02:11:04.970
<v Speaker 4>They could make that sort of like</v>

<v Speaker 4>You'd actually do not know that this was</v>

3206
02:11:11.871 --> 02:11:13.880
<v Speaker 4>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a bit of big fish story.</v>

3207
02:11:13.930 --> 02:11:15.380
<v Speaker 4>And so did he wind up going to jail.</v>

3208
02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:23.520
<v Speaker 4>You know how many people have stuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>bottles up people's pussies and they</v>

3209
02:11:23.521 --> 02:11:26.670
<v Speaker 4>didn't die and they went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they read that story and I did it this</v>

3210
02:11:26.671 --> 02:11:31.410
<v Speaker 4>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you got like one of those Mexican</v>

<v Speaker 4>You'd have to fucking throw her against</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wall or something.</v>

3213
02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:39.480
<v Speaker 4>If she had a pussy that was so strong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could break one of those bottles.</v>

3214
02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:41.700
<v Speaker 4>They could probably endure the cuts to</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's all good.</v>

<v Speaker 4>longer find work.</v>

3219
02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:53.490
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that crazy that he was acquitted</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know that right?</v>

3265
02:13:38.970 --> 02:13:40.740
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3266
02:13:41.250 --> 02:13:43.720
<v Speaker 3>the boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the boom right now we're gonna</v>

3267
02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:45.060
<v Speaker 3>throw it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the bubble going to pop?</v>

3268
02:13:46.050 --> 02:13:48.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so cause there's so much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many funny comedians.</v>

3269
02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:51.840
<v Speaker 3>That's the guys like yourself guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of guys out there that are</v>

3270
02:13:51.841 --> 02:13:54.360
<v Speaker 3>really good and that are coming up that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are really good.</v>

3271
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:55.770
<v Speaker 3>There's real good comedy going on.</v>

3272

<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

3273
02:13:56.531 --> 02:13:58.180
<v Speaker 4>I think it's breeding really good</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy.</v>

3274
02:13:58.240 --> 02:13:59.950
<v Speaker 4>I think because there's so much great</v>
<v Speaker 4>competition,</v>

3275
02:13:59.951 --> 02:14:02.350
<v Speaker 4>there's so many fucking good people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's breeding to people to be</v>

3276
02:14:02.351 --> 02:14:05.110
<v Speaker 4>stronger and stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I see fucking guys and I'm</v>

<v Speaker 3>up and then Chris rock goes on after him</v>

3281
02:14:13.311 --> 02:14:17.180
<v Speaker 3>and like you're seeing this stuff on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>regular basis and they'll like the</v>

3282
02:14:17.181 --> 02:14:20.900
<v Speaker 3>quality of the comedy that you say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very high and that guy's coming up.</v>

3283
02:14:21.770 --> 02:14:24.010
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I first started the store in 94 it</v>

3284
02:14:24.011 --> 02:14:26.720
<v Speaker 3>was a dead zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a terrible time.</v>

3285
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:29.330
<v Speaker 3>It was like right after the Kennison</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

3286
02:14:29.331 --> 02:14:33.650
<v Speaker 3>it ended Kennison left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like 86 and then by the time I</v>

3287
02:14:33.651 --> 02:14:35.180
<v Speaker 3>came around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an eight years later.</v>

3288
02:14:35.181 --> 02:14:37.940
<v Speaker 3>Kinison was dead and the place was</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>

3289
02:14:37.941 --> 02:14:39.560
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wanted to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>

3290
02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:45.350
<v Speaker 3>It was weird there for a long time man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially in terms of like talent</v>

3291
02:14:45.351 --> 02:14:47.780
<v Speaker 3>coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the talent coming up.</v>

3292
02:14:47.781 --> 02:14:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Back then it was just like it was really</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor.</v>

3293
02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:52.130
<v Speaker 3>This is the best you've ever seen it</v>
<v Speaker 3>since you started at percent?</v>

3294
02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:56.240
<v Speaker 3>For me it's not even close for some guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>say was even better early on.</v>

3295
02:14:56.270 --> 02:14:58.100
<v Speaker 3>Dell's does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say it was even better.</v>

3296
02:14:58.101 --> 02:15:02.330
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm in the 80s they say like before</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the kittens and error,</v>

3297
02:15:02.331 --> 02:15:05.690
<v Speaker 3>like um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dommo rare especially he says that like</v>

3298
02:15:05.691 --> 02:15:08.060
<v Speaker 3>there was a time when they were doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>three shows in the main room,</v>

3299
02:15:08.061 --> 02:15:10.730
<v Speaker 3>two shows in the or and they were just</v>
<v Speaker 3>rotating.</v>

3300
02:15:10.731 --> 02:15:11.850
<v Speaker 3>Just fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3301
02:15:12.570 --> 02:15:15.190
<v Speaker 3>But we're pretty close to that and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>just going to say that's where we're</v>

3302
02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:18.770
<v Speaker 3>knocking on that door to close two shows</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the main room all the time.</v>

3303
02:15:18.771 --> 02:15:22.190
<v Speaker 3>On the weekends we do two shows in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>or all the time on the weekends and</v>

3304
02:15:22.191 --> 02:15:26.300
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I've done four sets in a night</v>
<v Speaker 3>there where I did two shows in the main</v>

<v Speaker 3>people coming here from Ireland,</v>

3420
02:19:43.340 --> 02:19:45.230
<v Speaker 4>When I went to school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to school to,</v>

3421
02:19:45.290 --> 02:19:48.230
<v Speaker 4>to write to do journalism and English</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I knew I wanted to write and</v>

3422
02:19:48.231 --> 02:19:50.210
<v Speaker 4>perform,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was a pussy about performing in</v>

3423
02:19:50.211 --> 02:19:50.510
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

3424
02:19:50.510 --> 02:19:52.610
<v Speaker 4>So I did a fall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a few plays cause I really want it to be</v>

3425
02:19:52.611 --> 02:19:54.920
<v Speaker 4>on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't like the idea of place.</v>

3426
02:19:54.921 --> 02:19:59.390
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted to get on stage to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>get my comfort level up and the w and</v>

3427
02:19:59.391 --> 02:20:01.640
<v Speaker 4>the training wheels he had do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the fucking,</v>

3428
02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:05.060
<v Speaker 4>one of the teachers pulled me aside one</v>
<v Speaker 4>day and she was like,</v>

3429
02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:07.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could actually be a good actor if</v>

3430
02:20:07.011 --> 02:20:09.320
<v Speaker 4>you didn't just fuck around when you got</v>
<v Speaker 4>onstage.</v>

3431
02:20:09.770 --> 02:20:10.910
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I,</v>

3432
02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:12.740
<v Speaker 4>I really want to fuck around on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

3433
02:20:12.741 --> 02:20:15.080
<v Speaker 4>well then why don't you go do that for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>living and no shit.</v>

3434
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:16.490
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna try.</v>

3435
02:20:16.970 --> 02:20:18.770
<v Speaker 4>And I knew I wanted to do standup so</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>

3436
02:20:18.771 --> 02:20:19.940
<v Speaker 4>And I moved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I moved to La,</v>

3437
02:20:19.970 --> 02:20:23.730
<v Speaker 4>I started in La and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm either going to sink or swim and I</v>

3438
02:20:23.731 --> 02:20:24.564
<v Speaker 4>just start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what year?</v>

3439
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:28.100
<v Speaker 4>2000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I moved here 2000 at the end of 2006 I</v>

3440
02:20:28.101 --> 02:20:32.390
<v Speaker 4>lived on a guy's fucking lazy boy in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Long Beach and I used to drive up my</v>

3441
02:20:32.391 --> 02:20:33.920
<v Speaker 4>buddy's truck every single fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>

3442
02:20:33.980 --> 02:20:36.170
<v Speaker 4>I drop him off at the casino.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a professional gambler.</v>

3443
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:38.300
<v Speaker 4>I drop him off the casino,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take his truck,</v>

3444
02:20:38.301 --> 02:20:40.640
<v Speaker 4>cause I didn't have car money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do fucking Mike's,</v>

3445
02:20:40.641 --> 02:20:43.880
<v Speaker 4>go to the store and get intimidated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3446
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:45.980
<v Speaker 4>learn some lessons and then fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>drive back home,</v>

3447
02:20:45.981 --> 02:20:47.240
<v Speaker 4>pick him up and we fell asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3448
02:20:47.241 --> 02:20:48.860
<v Speaker 4>could get a burrito and do it all over</v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

3449
02:20:48.890 --> 02:20:51.050
<v Speaker 4>That's wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you started really coming to the</v>

3450
02:20:51.051 --> 02:20:52.910
<v Speaker 4>store when I was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3451
02:20:52.911 --> 02:20:56.240
<v Speaker 4>It was like 2007 as you weren't around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put your legacy was there.</v>

3452
02:20:56.840 --> 02:20:59.990
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was like we all knew those that</v>

3453
02:20:59.991 --> 02:21:01.670
<v Speaker 4>came before us and we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those that we talked about.</v>

3454
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:04.970
<v Speaker 4>But it was like I was right there when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were,</v>

3455
02:21:05.390 --> 02:21:08.750
<v Speaker 4>when you had kind of left that left that</v>
<v Speaker 4>world a little bit,</v>

3456
02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:13.430
<v Speaker 4>but it's wild because it was like I</v>
<v Speaker 4>hated the store when I first started to</v>

3457
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:16.070
<v Speaker 4>two thousand six thousand seven it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking awful.</v>

3458
02:21:16.430 --> 02:21:18.020
<v Speaker 4>The people above us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

3459
02:21:18.050 --> 02:21:22.340
<v Speaker 4>none of the older comics where that</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking nice divide was negative as</v>

3460
02:21:22.341 --> 02:21:25.430
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There wasn't a lot of crowds.</v>

3461
02:21:25.550 --> 02:21:27.170
<v Speaker 4>Delvin Mike's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're fucking brutal.</v>

3462
02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:29.300
<v Speaker 4>They were miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They barely got watched.</v>

3463
02:21:30.290 --> 02:21:32.090
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just so many negative things about</v>

3464
02:21:32.091 --> 02:21:34.550
<v Speaker 4>that place at the time that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were going through it and then it</v>

3465
02:21:34.551 --> 02:21:37.880
<v Speaker 4>slowly kind of turned into this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what we've seen now,</v>

3466
02:21:37.881 --> 02:21:40.640
<v Speaker 4>which is just fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We see now it's crazy.</v>

3467
02:21:40.641 --> 02:21:44.320
<v Speaker 4>You pull into the parking lot is jam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The haulers are jammed with people and</v>

3468
02:21:44.321 --> 02:21:46.040
<v Speaker 4>it makes me smile from fucking year that</v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

3469
02:21:46.050 --> 02:21:47.690
<v Speaker 4>Heared right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it weird?</v>

3470
02:21:48.290 --> 02:21:49.990
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

3471
02:21:50.060 --> 02:21:52.490
<v Speaker 4>I've been there since 94 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never been like this.</v>

3472
02:21:52.491 --> 02:21:54.560
<v Speaker 4>This is a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

3473
02:21:54.620 --> 02:21:56.180
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It still does to me.</v>

3474
02:21:56.390 --> 02:21:59.360
<v Speaker 4>This is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You kind of get desensitized to shit,</v>

3475
02:21:59.630 --> 02:22:03.320
<v Speaker 4>but seeing my name up on the fucking up</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the board when it's a pack night,</v>

3476
02:22:03.620 --> 02:22:06.260
<v Speaker 4>it still gets me like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still get excited.</v>

3477
02:22:06.261 --> 02:22:07.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking cool.</v>

3478
02:22:07.281 --> 02:22:11.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm a part of this moment in time and</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy at that fucking club,</v>

3479
02:22:11.601 --> 02:22:13.070
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the club,</v>

3480
02:22:14.060 --> 02:22:15.290
<v Speaker 4>it's just something else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3481
02:22:15.470 --> 02:22:18.920
<v Speaker 4>There's something powerful as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's sometimes I walk to the club</v>

3482
02:22:18.921 --> 02:22:21.170
<v Speaker 4>because I live in the neighborhood and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I like to walk instead of drive</v>

3483
02:22:21.171 --> 02:22:24.380
<v Speaker 4>because it helps me get out of my brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

3484
02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:26.040
<v Speaker 4>time I fucking walk</v>

3485
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:26.821
<v Speaker 3>up that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3486
02:22:26.821 --> 02:22:29.160
<v Speaker 3>and I see my name up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like a fucking overwhelming</v>

3487
02:22:29.170 --> 02:22:30.900
<v Speaker 3>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The moment I see it,</v>

3488
02:22:30.901 --> 02:22:32.280
<v Speaker 3>it's like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3489
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:35.820
<v Speaker 3>soak it in a little bit cause it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking doesn't last forever.</v>

3490
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:38.550
<v Speaker 3>It's nice to have a place that's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that too.</v>

3491
02:22:38.610 --> 02:22:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Like to just have one place that stands</v>
<v Speaker 3>out as something that means more than</v>

3492
02:22:43.591 --> 02:22:45.150
<v Speaker 3>just a comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3493
02:22:45.151 --> 02:22:46.080
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3494
02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:48.690
<v Speaker 3>it's an iconic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3495
02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:50.490
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something about that place.</v>

3496
02:22:50.491 --> 02:22:52.920
<v Speaker 3>Like we're at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bigger than comedy,</v>

3497
02:22:52.921 --> 02:22:53.780
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3498
02:22:54.040 --> 02:22:54.660
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3499
02:22:54.660 --> 02:22:55.321
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3500

<v Speaker 3>It's something fucking special,</v>

3502
02:22:58.861 --> 02:22:59.250
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3503
02:22:59.250 --> 02:23:02.940
<v Speaker 3>pauline and I were talking about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I told him that your moms,</v>

3504
02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.970
<v Speaker 3>one of the most important people ever in</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy period,</v>

3505
02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:08.790
<v Speaker 3>like ever one of the most influential</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans in the,</v>

3506
02:23:09.250 --> 02:23:11.760
<v Speaker 3>in the comedy world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world of what we know today.</v>

3507
02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:14.220
<v Speaker 3>A standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3508
02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:15.073
<v Speaker 3>Mitzi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3509
02:23:15.260 --> 02:23:18.810
<v Speaker 3>Like without her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like stop and think about what other</v>

3510
02:23:18.811 --> 02:23:23.811
<v Speaker 3>comedy club owner has had the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>influence even remotely similar to what</v>

3511
02:23:24.031 --> 02:23:26.070
<v Speaker 3>she's had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would know none of the above.</v>

3512
02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:26.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3513
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:28.860
<v Speaker 3>I guess the only person that you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring into that namesake,</v>

3514
02:23:28.890 --> 02:23:31.530
<v Speaker 3>maybe budd Friedman from the emperor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe because he did evening at the</v>

3515
02:23:31.531 --> 02:23:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Improv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of the Monaco and everything like</v>

3516
02:23:32.941 --> 02:23:35.100
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think in the hardcore sense</v>

3517
02:23:35.101 --> 02:23:37.470
<v Speaker 3>it's not a clothes won't be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3518
02:23:38.010 --> 02:23:39.390
<v Speaker 3>but but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

3519
02:23:39.690 --> 02:23:43.320
<v Speaker 3>what she did was shape and revolutionize</v>
<v Speaker 3>the business that you know today.</v>

3520
02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:46.050
<v Speaker 3>She knew how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to leave it up to the Comedians,</v>

3521
02:23:46.051 --> 02:23:49.890
<v Speaker 3>leave him alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then also give them hard spots</v>

3522
02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:52.080
<v Speaker 3>making going to come work for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>work for it.</v>

3523
02:23:52.081 --> 02:23:53.730
<v Speaker 3>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the best part about that club.</v>

3524
02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:54.960
<v Speaker 3>You think someone's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

3525
02:23:54.961 --> 02:23:57.370
<v Speaker 3>Put them on after dice or put them on</v>
<v Speaker 3>after you know,</v>

3526
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:59.490
<v Speaker 3>whoever the fuck it was at the time that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was killing.</v>

3527
02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:00.960
<v Speaker 3>See how funny they are after Richard</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pryor.</v>

3528
02:24:00.990 --> 02:24:02.070
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3529
02:24:02.071 --> 02:24:04.620
<v Speaker 3>See how funny they are after someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>just destroys.</v>

3530
02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:08.100
<v Speaker 3>He just got to go up to this wasteland</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the audience.</v>

3531
02:24:08.820 --> 02:24:10.590
<v Speaker 3>That's such a testament about that club</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3532
02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:13.620
<v Speaker 3>It's what they've always done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd I feel it.</v>

3533
02:24:13.710 --> 02:24:18.710
<v Speaker 3>Plates of Shit in that place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just no way around it following</v>

3534
02:24:20.041 --> 02:24:23.100
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>following anybody's I filed prior for</v>

3535
02:24:23.101 --> 02:24:25.140
<v Speaker 3>five weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck when?</v>

3536
02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:28.800
<v Speaker 3>When prior was in a wheelchair so they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have to carry him to the stage.</v>

3537
02:24:29.610 --> 02:24:30.690
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was dark.</v>

3538
02:24:30.970 --> 02:24:32.490
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be really funny for if you had to</v>

3539
02:24:32.491 --> 02:24:34.560
<v Speaker 3>go on and you had to carry him off and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then do your set,</v>

3540
02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:38.740
<v Speaker 3>like just start it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start it from the crowd carried out.</v>

3541
02:24:39.150 --> 02:24:40.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

3542
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:43.050
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that philosophy that she had that make</v>

3543
02:24:43.051 --> 02:24:46.770
<v Speaker 3>you work for it make you sink or swim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So important.</v>

3544
02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Because if people that we know to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>day that are scared to have tough spots</v>

3545
02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:52.590
<v Speaker 3>and we know those people totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will,</v>

3546
02:24:52.591 --> 02:24:54.660
<v Speaker 3>they see somebody like Joey Diaz in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lineup and they're like,</v>

3547
02:24:54.740 --> 02:24:56.250
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go for a drive.</v>

3548
02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:58.890
<v Speaker 3>I'll be back in a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll let somebody else take their</v>

3549
02:24:58.891 --> 02:25:00.820
<v Speaker 3>spot and they come in and they check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3550
02:25:00.990 --> 02:25:02.180
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he up?</v>

3551
02:25:02.370 --> 02:25:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I miss my spot.</v>

3552
02:25:03.450 --> 02:25:05.040
<v Speaker 3>Am I on next?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were just here.</v>

3553
02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:06.030
<v Speaker 3>What'd you go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3554
02:25:06.031 --> 02:25:07.860
<v Speaker 3>You hid from Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Motherfucker.</v>

3555
02:25:09.930 --> 02:25:13.950
<v Speaker 3>The only way to go up after Joey Diaz is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fucking,</v>

3556
02:25:14.250 --> 02:25:16.500
<v Speaker 3>is to just ride that line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to ride the wave.</v>

3557
02:25:16.530 --> 02:25:18.390
<v Speaker 3>You gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to enjoy him.</v>

3558
02:25:18.391 --> 02:25:20.410
<v Speaker 3>You have to have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking love watching him.</v>

3559
02:25:20.411 --> 02:25:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's what I'm saying,</v>

3560
02:25:21.571 --> 02:25:25.270
<v Speaker 3>like the problem with comics when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to those sorts of situations is</v>

3561
02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:29.500
<v Speaker 3>you see someone killing and for some</v>
<v Speaker 3>reason you think that's taking away from</v>

3562
02:25:29.501 --> 02:25:31.330
<v Speaker 3>your ability to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird,</v>

3563
02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:32.500
<v Speaker 3>the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3564
02:25:32.650 --> 02:25:36.610
<v Speaker 3>They want you to win with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let them know that you're there to win</v>

3565
02:25:36.611 --> 02:25:38.940
<v Speaker 3>again instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3566
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:42.310
<v Speaker 3>I can't fucking follow that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not going to talk about what joy is</v>

3567
02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:44.920
<v Speaker 3>going to be disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get your hopes up.</v>

3568
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3569
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:47.590
<v Speaker 3>well good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you set yourself up.</v>

3570
02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:49.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking,</v>

3571
02:25:49.390 --> 02:25:52.960
<v Speaker 3>you also should be going up laughing</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it should be fun that something</v>

3572
02:25:52.961 --> 02:25:56.530
<v Speaker 3>happens to some comedians along the line</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they stopped being fans of comedy.</v>

3573
02:25:57.020 --> 02:25:58.660
<v Speaker 3>Like why did you get into this in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first place?</v>

3574
02:25:58.661 --> 02:26:00.150
<v Speaker 3>Didn't you like watching it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3575
02:26:00.220 --> 02:26:02.590
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't going to stop watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that you're a pro,</v>

3576
02:26:02.591 --> 02:26:05.980
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't because of all the billions of</v>

3577
02:26:05.980 --> 02:26:07.000
<v Speaker 3>dollars that you thought you were going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make.</v>

3578
02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:08.580
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody got in was like,</v>

3579
02:26:08.581 --> 02:26:10.180
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't wait to make so much fucking</v>

3580
02:26:10.181 --> 02:26:12.170
<v Speaker 3>bank on this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3581
02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:14.800
<v Speaker 3>no one's getting into comedy for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although it can be done.</v>

3582
02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:17.050
<v Speaker 3>You Know Kevin Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be done,</v>

3583
02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:20.170
<v Speaker 3>but that's not why you get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's like what we're talking about</v>

3584
02:26:20.171 --> 02:26:23.200
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like people that are trying to get</v>

3585
02:26:23.201 --> 02:26:27.040
<v Speaker 3>the limelight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that weird depressing thing versus</v>

3586
02:26:27.041 --> 02:26:29.890
<v Speaker 3>someone who's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to do my best shit.</v>
