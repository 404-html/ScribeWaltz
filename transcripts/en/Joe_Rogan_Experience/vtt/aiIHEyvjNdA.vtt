<v 0>what the fuck was that?</v>

3
00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:06.460
That's your new one.

4
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.140
Jesus son.

5
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.310
That's a little out of hand.

6
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.980
Is that lobbying for or against gun control?

7
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.503
Neither.

8
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.580
He said he's on his own plane of existence.

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.140
I'm questioning now.

10
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.770

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.790
Hover is a company,

17
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:29.980
it's owned by our friends that own Tang.

18
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.030
And uh,

19
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.430
they,

20
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:31.750
they,

21
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.640
they have the same sort of,

22
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:34.180
uh,

23
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.620
ideas going into this.

24
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:39.340
It would create a non evil company that puts,

25
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.600
puts out a good product,

26
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.580
has a domain name registrations.

27
00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:44.980
They give you a lot of stuff for free that you don't get for free.

28
00:00:44.981 --> 00:00:46.960
And other companies like who is,

29
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.470

30
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.303

31
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.761

32
00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:49.440

33
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.630
you know,

34
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.090
you know,

35
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.020
somebody doesn't have to know where you live just cause you want to register a

36
00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:53.840
domain.

37
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.010
Uh,

38
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.341
so they,

39
00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:54.621

40
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.470

41
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.340
Um,

43
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.491
Uh,

44
00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:02.620
I've wet registered domains myself on it.

45
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.460
It's super clean and intuitive and a,

46
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.480

47
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.610

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.661

00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:17.500
You fucks were also brought to you by Squarespace.

51
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.560
Squarespace is an all in one website platform that gives you hosting analytics

54
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.530
Squarespace has it set up so that you,

55
00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:33.970
the regular person who knows almost nothing about coding or nothing can go and

56
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:34.900
you can make your own website.

57
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:35.531
It's easy,

58
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:36.220
it's intuitive,

59
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.451
it's,

60
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:37.600
it's super cool to,

61
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.370
to try and fuck around with and you don't even have to pay for it to do it.

62
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.720
You try it out,

63
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.500
go there.

64
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.860
You know,

65
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.410
you don't have to enter in any credit card information.

66
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.400
Just try it out.

67
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.150
Um,

68
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.600
try to put together your,

69
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:52.450
your own website and see what it feels like.

70
00:01:52.451 --> 00:01:53.440
And if you like it,

71
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.330
you can sign up for it.

72
00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:57.420
Use the code Joe too.

73
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.181
That's Joe.

74
00:01:58.181 --> 00:01:59.230
And then number two,

75
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.630

76
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.501

00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:03.400
Squarespace.

78
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.830
Squarespace.

79
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.860
Also as I'm writing this down task,

80
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.630
that's how my people responding.

81
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.550
One of the cool things about Squarespace is it's also set up for commerce.

82
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.660
Very easy to do.

83
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:20.590
So you can literally right away get set up and start selling shit,

84
00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:21.191
whatever it is,

85
00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:21.641
t shirts,

86
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:21.971
hats,

87
00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:22.804
whatever you're doing.

88
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.120
It's super easy to set up.

89
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.220
It's exceptionally well designed.

90
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.200
Squarespace has an award winning program design team and user interface experts.

91
00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:32.710
So it's,

92
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.680
it's a fucking Badass site.

93
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.010
If you want to create a website,

94
00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:36.940
look no further,

95
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.140

96
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.880

98
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.770

99
00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:45.610
And again,

100
00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:46.421
no credit card needed.

101
00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:48.280
Just try it out and start building your website.

102
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.810
If you decide to purchase it,

103
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.450
you use the code Joe too.

104
00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:54.370
That's Joe and the number two together,

105
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.110
you get 10% off your first purchase.

106
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.510
<v 1>And,</v>

107
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.311
and by the way,

108
00:02:57.311 --> 00:02:58.900
it's already mobile setup.

109
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.420
So like if you have an iPad or an iPhone,

110
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:01.571
it,

111
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:05.280
it already has the plugins that make it mobile friendly.

112
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.130

Oh yeah.

121
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.430
We don't need any more commercials.

122
00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:19.970
Goddammit.

123
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.920
David Lee Roth was here to the music.

124
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.270
A living commercial.

125
00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:25.700
squarespace.com forward slash Joe,

126
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.510

All right.

128
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.163
Experience

129
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.540
<v 3>Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

130
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.120

131
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.250
Nexia

132
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.050
<v 2>has his voice.</v>

133
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.300
You've got to stop doing that.

134
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.411
Stop doing that.

135
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:48.161
I was going to say,

136
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:51.970
is that a remax or is that a Nicky is electro typo.

137
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.500
Digital cyber something.

138
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.090
You got to stop doing the accent that you're doing.

139
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:55.390
One.

140
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.110
Number two,

141
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.850
you got to bring back the English voice.

142
00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:58.684
I missed that check.

143
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.600
Did you have a chick with a British accent?

144
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.310
It was a robot chick with a British accent.

145
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.810
Oh,

146
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.400
that's of a robot chick with a British accent.

147
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.091
I like that.

148
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:07.571
And about it,

149
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:08.140
Matt.

150
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.530
And it was,

151
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.500
was it another chick pretending to be a British checks,

152
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.660
but sounding like a robot.

153
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.020
Something along those lines.

154
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.411
It's like,

155
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:15.310
I think I know her.

156
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.220
Oh,

157
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.053
that was,

158
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.220
that was David Lee Roth.

159
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:22.120
Ladies and gentlemen.

160
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.280
So we've started off talking about girls with no last names and I have three.

161
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.371
Yeah,

162
00:04:28.371 --> 00:04:29.204
I just pulled that off.

163
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.063
Is that a real name?

164
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.701
David Lee Ross.

165
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:31.181
Your real name?

166
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:33.070
That is my real is the way to rock it,

167
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:33.460
right?

168
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.640
Make it to sh to superstar status on your real name.

169
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.851
Well,

170
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:40.420
I started using the middle name because I thought it sounded more like southern,

171
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.160
which it kind of does.

172
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.760
Yeah,

173
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.510
right.

174
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.201
Why southern?

175
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:45.034
Why would you want to,

176
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.150
do you want to sound more southern?

177
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.373
I Dunno.

178
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.863
Let it scale.

179
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.060
Well yeah,

180
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.390
you see,

181
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.831
there you go.

182
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:51.221
Let it go.

183
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:54.700
Who would ever thought that Leonard skittered would be a name that's like a

184
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.810
Baltic,

185
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.800
uh,

186
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.890
euros.

187
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.100
Who would be Mr. Skinner?

188
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:01.550
That's like the Mr Gabler.

189
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.740
How about Van Halen?

190
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.461
Venn.

191
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:05.440
Helen's a pretty odd name for a band as well.

192
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.760
It was my idea too.

193
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.280
I said on the heels of like Santana,

194
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.413
right?

195
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.190
It sounds kind of dramatic.

196
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:13.450
Maybe it's the name of a,

197
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:13.920
uh,

198
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.350
uh,

199
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.090
a sailing ship or this and name of a sailing captain or the name of the wind.

200
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.160
That's what I always thought Santana was.

201
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.810
Yes.

202
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.040
The name of the guitar player,

203
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:27.850
but you say it the same and much like Linux skin it all it has to do is be

204
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:28.301
awesome.

205
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:30.470
It doesn't really matter what the name you call it is.

206
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.770
It's going to improve that.

207
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:33.160
Right.

208
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.360
Well we maybe they proved that the more colorful it is like Schwartz and Egger,

209
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.940
whoever thought that if you saw that in print,

210
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.500
you know originally an old Hollywood style through you would look and go no way.

211
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.150
But maybe that's part of the reason it's so well known is wonder how many people

212
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:50.950
Arnold Schwarzenegger called up and it's like,

213
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:53.920
see I told you no shit.

214
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.650
You fuck with my life and do the,

215
00:05:55.651 --> 00:05:56.484
and those shit.

216
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.280
I would have been one who would have thought,

217
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.491
<v 4>no,</v>

218
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.910
you can't go with that long last name Ken though.

219
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:02.980
Like even the way Skinner,

220
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.990
it's spelled their name was like l y n a r d s k y and r d you got to get like a

221
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:11.901
name,

222
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:15.260
like a verb like shit or oh sure.

223
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.730
But skittered pulled it off.

224
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.140
You can pull it off.

225
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:19.610
It's not the right way to do it.

226
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:20.360
But you can,

227
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.690
you can just make a fucking goofy spelling of something and it actually can

228
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:24.524
work.

229
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.393
It's always names like,

230
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.383
um,

231
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.880
Engelbert Humperdinck right.

232
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.280
Anybody else in this room?

233
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:32.900
Old enough to remember that name?

234
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:33.291
He was a,

235
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:34.760
but he was like a lounge singer,

236
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.391
kind of,

237
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:35.751
you know,

238
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:36.141
in the,

239
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:36.974
uh,

240
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.300
I did it my way.

241
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.870
I think it's a real name to,

242
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.160
where did you guys start out?

243
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:44.450
What state did you guys start out?

244
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.200
Oh,

245
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.720
we started off in the usual state of confusion,

246
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:49.400
but really mostly down the street.

247
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:50.480
Bicycle distance.

248
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:51.201
Good question.

249
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:52.910
Because it is only bicycle distance.

250
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.560
I'm in Pasadena.

251
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.250
And uh,

252
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.420
coming out of high school,

253
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.141
you know,

254
00:06:57.141 --> 00:06:57.711
it was time,

255
00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:57.980
you know,

256
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.300
you're,

257
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.300
you're playing backyard parties and the occasional wedding and whatnot because

258
00:07:04.071 --> 00:07:06.260
you're not quite old enough to play in the bars.

259
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.290
And when van Halen was playing in the bars around here,

260
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.140
nobody had any money for a sound system.

261
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.831
We don't blink.

262
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.650
Now when you see some big boom speakers,

263
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:17.720
you know in the corners and there's a guy with her,

264
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:18.021
you know,

265
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:18.950
he's got his own,

266
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:19.340
uh,

267
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.590
well now you can take your iPod plugging in,

268
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:22.420
but you know,

269
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.660
a couple of turn tables and some people with some cool head gear.

270
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.140
We don't blink when we see that.

271
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.130
But uh,

272
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.410
coming up all the way up until the late seventies,

273
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.430
nobody had that.

274
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.640
You had to have a live band and we played five 45 minutes sets a night,

275
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.400
usually five and six nights a week at ever.

276
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.120
This could have been a club right here,

277
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.901
this right here.

278
00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:47.450
It could have easily done it as long as a stage meant something that you tripped

279
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.440
your toe over.

280
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.570
Sometimes it was just marked off,

281
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.160
you know?

282
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.050
Well the stage used to be there.

283
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:58.440
So technically it's always there or the stages in your heart.

284
00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.493
So

285
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.540
like basically perform on a dance floor.

286
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.670
Oh Torian many,

287
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:08.270
many times face to face with the rest of the human race.

288
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:10.250
And we've got used to doing that at parties,

289
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.310
backyard parties where we would rent the light,

290
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:13.741
you know,

291
00:08:13.741 --> 00:08:18.200
would get pull up one of the cars and get the little mini trooper at spotlight

292
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.380
for 55 bucks for the weekend and put it up on top of the gardening shack or the

293
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:24.531
room that,

294
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:24.741
you know,

295
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:26.060
when somebody has a swimming pool,

296
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.730
you got to have the little shed that uh,

297
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.390
uh,

298
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.340
all the pool equipment fits in.

299
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.740
Well that's perfect for putting somebody up there.

300
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.880
It's like out of a movie,

301
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:35.161
you know,

302
00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:36.290
a rock and roll movie.

303
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.090
If you put the uh,

304
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.720
you know,

305
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.650
character up there and uh,

306
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.900
give them enough six pack,

307
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.970
you know that he stays up there for the whole show,

308
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:47.720
but he gets progressively drunker or he brings his girlfriends up there and then

309
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:49.140
the roof caves in how you guys write.

310
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.050
You gotta write this down.

311
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.190
We've got a recording

312
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.040
with a translator and

313
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.420
<v 0>it'll take some take notes.</v>

314
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.250
Check it for veracity.

315
00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.790
Yeah.

316
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.060
So,

317
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.230
but around Pasadena,

318
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.370
oh wow.

319
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.130
This is a lot of great bands came from California.

320
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.990
It's funny how like you see states in some states is great bands will blossom

321
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:10.440
out of,

322
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.830
and then you see there's a ton of states where you hardly ever see any bands

323
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:14.590
come from.

324
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:19.590
<v 4>I'm going to wonder if it's because of where Showbiz is located because the</v>

325
00:09:20.891 --> 00:09:22.510
opportunities are always here,

326
00:09:22.511 --> 00:09:26.110
whether you're trying to play television or get into the movies,

327
00:09:26.111 --> 00:09:28.210
singing and dancing in the background,

328
00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:29.350
or you want to be,

329
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.610
uh,

330
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.720
in rock and roll,

331
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:32.360
you know.

332
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:32.620
Well,

333
00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.660
he got to be discovered by the record company,

334
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:36.100
you know,

335
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:36.641
for 20,

336
00:09:36.641 --> 00:09:36.971
30,

337
00:09:36.971 --> 00:09:37.481
40 years.

338
00:09:37.481 --> 00:09:38.470
It was that.

339
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:43.890
Now maybe it's another method may be now you email back and forth and you know,

340
00:09:44.411 --> 00:09:46.030
your intercepted somehow.

341
00:09:46.031 --> 00:09:46.721
Now it probably,

342
00:09:46.721 --> 00:09:49.150
there's a novelty to not being from Hollywood.

343
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.320
It's probably a novelty.

344
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.080
These buys are bad ass and they live in South Dakota.

345
00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:53.590
I,

346
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:54.423
whoa.

347
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.620
They live in a place that fucking sucks.

348
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.970
<v 0>Awesome.</v>

349
00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.200
They,

350
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.520
that might be the band,

351
00:09:59.550 --> 00:09:59.861
you know,

352
00:09:59.861 --> 00:10:02.790
and there might not be Utah from Utah.

353
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:03.750
They love Utah.

354
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.680
Mormons haven't get tailored,

355
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.720
raised Mormon.

356
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:07.590
They technically,

357
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.100
they,

358
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.510
they still wear the underwear,

359
00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:10.410
but they're confused.

360
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:12.771
<v 4>Just underwear.</v>

361
00:10:12.771 --> 00:10:14.480
I think that's her name,

362
00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:15.890
but the pan is bad ass.

363
00:10:15.891 --> 00:10:18.620
All that strife and confusion is in their music.

364
00:10:18.621 --> 00:10:19.454
Man.

365
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.310
You always want something from far away.

366
00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:23.061
The rarity,

367
00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:23.894
right?

368
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.200
If it comes from a out on the Tundra somewhere,

369
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:27.710
you know,

370
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.740
you told us before the show that you've been living in Tokyo for the last 10

371
00:10:30.741 --> 00:10:31.490
months,

372
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.420
maybe a little bit longer actually know.

373
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.490
How did that come about?

374
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.720
Well,

375
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.370
uh,

376
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.590
like all like all the best wandering stories.

377
00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:41.780
It started out a bit on unexpectedly.

378
00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:44.780
We were going to play in the van Halen van and um,

379
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:45.470
uh,

380
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.580
ed took sick and we had to postpone everything.

381
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:50.870
And uh,

382
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.290
I was already going to show up a month or two early,

383
00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:55.580
kind of get my feet wet,

384
00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:59.450
see what it's like being there as opposed to just visiting if he'd go for a week

385
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:00.290
or two or three of them.

386
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:00.771
Okay.

387
00:11:00.771 --> 00:11:01.071
You know,

388
00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:05.930
you can eat pretty much whatever you want and you don't really have a legit

389
00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:08.000
schedule that you're keeping every day.

390
00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.860
You're probably not shopping for yourself.

391
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:11.930
It probably know cooking for yourself and that kind of thing.

392
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:12.951
And,

393
00:11:12.951 --> 00:11:13.760
um,

394
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.690
once you had took sick,

395
00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:14.991
I said,

396
00:11:14.991 --> 00:11:15.231
you know,

397
00:11:15.231 --> 00:11:15.331
I'm,

398
00:11:15.331 --> 00:11:17.540
I'm going to stick with the schedule and a,

399
00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:20.630
I'm going to get there a few months early for the Gig that didn't happen.

400
00:11:20.631 --> 00:11:21.260
And,

401
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:21.860
uh,

402
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.780
how long is it gonna be before,

403
00:11:23.781 --> 00:11:24.620
uh,

404
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:24.981
you know,

405
00:11:24.981 --> 00:11:26.720
he's feeling well and ready to play.

406
00:11:26.721 --> 00:11:27.170
And they said,

407
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.381
oh,

408
00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:28.520
about 10 and a half months.

409
00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:29.240
I said,

410
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:29.930
well,

411
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.480
I'll be busted in a groove in the Hong goal then.

412
00:11:32.481 --> 00:11:32.851
You know,

413
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:33.460
it was,

414
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.070
what is the,

415
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:34.550
what's his,

416
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.340
what's wrong with,

417
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.630
and he had some stomach issues and some stomach ailments,

418
00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:40.190
but he's healed up just fine.

419
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.870
And we're going to be playing in Australia coming up in that a serious thing

420
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:43.980
though.

421
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.980
Something that takes you off for 10 and a half months.

422
00:11:45.981 --> 00:11:46.551
Like wow,

423
00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:47.660
that's a no,

424
00:11:47.661 --> 00:11:48.081
he got,

425
00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:48.591
he got,

426
00:11:48.591 --> 00:11:49.424
well,

427
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:50.690
you're pretty astute.

428
00:11:50.691 --> 00:11:51.200
They're,

429
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.740
he uh,

430
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.470
got well a lot sooner but they couldn't position the gigs and close with to make

431
00:11:56.471 --> 00:11:58.840
room for baseball season and uh,

432
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:04.080
a lot of seasons in Tokyo as so know when you decide to just pack up and go to

433
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:05.141
Tokyo,

434
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.750
do you know people there or are you traveling with people?

435
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:08.131
Like how,

436
00:12:08.131 --> 00:12:08.470
how did,

437
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.250
how'd you rock it?

438
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.190
I didn't know anybody when I went there I said,

439
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:12.641
uh,

440
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:13.474
you know,

441
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.930
classic Old Jack London,

442
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.561
you know,

443
00:12:17.561 --> 00:12:20.260
let's just sign up for something and fuck,

444
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:21.770
I love that you didn't know.

445
00:12:21.771 --> 00:12:26.771
I'm going set up shop and I'll find an apartment and I'll use my smile like a

446
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:28.750
ray gun there.

447
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:29.683
He say

448
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.890
we're friends right away.

449
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.780
I learned right away how to say,

450
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:35.021
you know,

451
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:39.230
15 self effacing make fun of myself things because when you know,

452
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.331
in Japanese,

453
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:42.220
when I was a new Hong Kong I headed days.

454
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.780
I mean what I'm saying right away my,

455
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.160
my Japanese is bad.

456
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:46.090
Please excuse me.

457
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:51.130
And if I make the right funny face instantly anybody in any room exhales and

458
00:12:51.131 --> 00:12:51.964
goes,

459
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.391
okay,

460
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:53.500
he's not that dangerous.

461
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:54.520
Do you,

462
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.520
did you try like to use Rosetta stone and like how'd you,

463
00:12:57.521 --> 00:12:57.760
uh,

464
00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.440
how'd you learn how to speak Japanese?

465
00:12:59.441 --> 00:12:59.650
No,

466
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.180
I go to school a couple hours a day.

467
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:02.590
I go every day over the weekend.

468
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.360
Yep.

469
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.380
You go and take Japanese last I do.

470
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.071
And then,

471
00:13:06.071 --> 00:13:06.760
uh,

472
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.780
I was wanting to,

473
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.471
you know,

474
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:10.390
just being around the martial arts,

475
00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:10.661
you know,

476
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:11.740
you always think someday,

477
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:12.071
wow,

478
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:12.670
if I'm,

479
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.660
if I'm a Kung Fu than some day I'm going to go to the temple and I'm going to

480
00:13:16.661 --> 00:13:17.550
fly through the air.

481
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.080
And he had on his some day,

482
00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:22.960
if I'm in a professional wrestling,

483
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.610
then I'm going to go to Vince,

484
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.640
Vince Mcmahon's place and I want to train and I'm going to be called diamond

485
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.470
somebody and I'll do that.

486
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.450
And if I play all the ball,

487
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:35.590
I wasn't going to go to the NFL.

488
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.300
So your idea was just like,

489
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:37.900
fuck it,

490
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.170
I'm just going to live in Japan for while they've always wanted to go to Japan

491
00:13:41.171 --> 00:13:42.790
and train with that sword,

492
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.211
you know,

493
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:45.400
and learn it from the real guys,

494
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:46.270
the real people.

495
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.250
So that is what you were going to do guys.

496
00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:50.260
We're going to do an extended tour in Japan.

497
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:51.580
Is that what the idea was?

498
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.620
Ended in Japan means two weeks.

499
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.460
They're like,

500
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:55.950
yeah,

501
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.000
we live in an iPod society now.

502
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.990
Everything is kind of condensed kosher,

503
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:03.851
that means,

504
00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:06.040
but he actually meets crushed and uh,

505
00:14:06.041 --> 00:14:07.660
everything's kind of condensed there.

506
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.940
So when you go to Japan,

507
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:10.780
just touring,

508
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.700
you're like race horse and I,

509
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:13.031
you know,

510
00:14:13.031 --> 00:14:13.721
and I admitted,

511
00:14:13.721 --> 00:14:13.901
hey,

512
00:14:13.901 --> 00:14:14.320
when not,

513
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.670
when it's time for touring,

514
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.730
you want the very best show out of me possible.

515
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.620
So that's each sleep raise when eat,

516
00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:21.454
sleep raceway.

517
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.810
And uh,

518
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.020
what you're going to see through the window is come on.

519
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:31.050
I think if you were going to be in the Olympics and you had two weeks to do it,

520
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.980
would you be going out to eat at night?

521
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.090
No.

522
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.590
Would you be going to the movies and out,

523
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.120
dancing and carrying on?

524
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.880
You're there for two weeks for the Olympics.

525
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.100
So,

526
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:41.933
uh,

527
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.650
when we play with the band then you know,

528
00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:45.250
you really,

529
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:49.180
you can kind of get your face stay very focused there.

530
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.080
Um,

531
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.980
but I actually go back and live somewhere.

532
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.720
I actually will return and go and you know,

533
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:57.554
spend,

534
00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.210
we say 18 months,

535
00:14:59.211 --> 00:15:01.940
that's kind of metric for a year and a half,

536
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:06.560
two years if we're really having a decent time of it there.

537
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.180
And I don't require much at all.

538
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:08.571
You know,

539
00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:08.871
my,

540
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:09.500
uh,

541
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.600
the smallest size of,

542
00:15:10.601 --> 00:15:10.880
uh,

543
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.380
my apartment is probably as big as that little coffee room back there and

544
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.040
really?

545
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:16.611
Oh yeah.

546
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:16.971
You know,

547
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:19.250
I grew up around national geographic magazines,

548
00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:19.421
you know,

549
00:15:19.421 --> 00:15:24.170
or there's the guy sitting in the back of the boat,

550
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:24.771
you know,

551
00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:27.590
and he's going around the world and he can reach everything.

552
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:29.000
It's like at the desk right here,

553
00:15:29.001 --> 00:15:33.320
like in the Brian and everybody and everybody just surrounded by gear and stuff.

554
00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:36.080
And you only have to kind of stretch a little bit to reach every,

555
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.480
there's the Coffee Cup and there's the teller.

556
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.680
I don't know what it tiller is,

557
00:15:39.681 --> 00:15:40.514
but you can reach it.

558
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.270
And over here is the electric companies and over,

559
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:45.320
here's the camera.

560
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:47.030
And I always kind of done that.

561
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.800
Tour buses are the same thing.

562
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.740
So you like just living in this small apartment.

563
00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:52.251
It's like you're,

564
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:53.480
you're going back to your roots,

565
00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:54.710
your like roughing it almost.

566
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.573
Oh yeah.

567
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:56.211
You Bet.

568
00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:58.610
And my teachers are very unforgiving,

569
00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.211
you know,

570
00:15:59.211 --> 00:15:59.811
they're very,

571
00:15:59.811 --> 00:16:00.644
uh,

572
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.290
you know,

573
00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:01.700
uh,

574
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.533
what he calls [inaudible].

575
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.830
You have any idea who you are?

576
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.753
Oh sure.

577
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.640
Kiyoshi no,

578
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.400
Tanya,

579
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.233
no hotel.

580
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:09.403
Nice try.

581
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.080
What did you just look up?

582
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.800
Nadi name will God they could Gol Kido not what does that,

583
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.460
it's from gangster movies and he should do you think you're talking,

584
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.490
you still train in martial arts?

585
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.510
Yes.

586
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.690
Well that's part of the reason I'm there is I training can Jitsu.

587
00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:32.080
I do the long sword that cut Donna,

588
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:32.510
you know,

589
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:37.510
the summer night sword and I have a teacher there that I go to three times a

590
00:16:37.551 --> 00:16:40.550
week and I got to do the homework and it's,

591
00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:40.821
you know,

592
00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:42.470
I've worked my way up to that.

593
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.690
At the end of the last van Halen tour.

594
00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:47.070
I was in the shape of my life or as,

595
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.800
as as best to shape is my whole life will now.

596
00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:50.634
Oh Wow.

597
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.351
And,

598
00:16:51.351 --> 00:16:51.621
uh,

599
00:16:51.621 --> 00:16:52.041
I said,

600
00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:52.371
wow,

601
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:55.010
I can keep up with pretty much anybody at this point.

602
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:56.090
Let's not waste it.

603
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:57.410
And I went,

604
00:16:57.411 --> 00:16:58.244
uh,

605
00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:58.850
you know,

606
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.170
ed took ill and,

607
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:00.470
uh,

608
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.230
I just,

609
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.520
yeah,

610
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.350
I'll still come and I'm going to move in.

611
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:04.663
And uh,

612
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:05.803
I got going.

613
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.200
So you'd do you train like sword fighting put that's part of the town and stuff.

614
00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:12.620
Is it similar to Kendo?

615
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:13.483
Like will you,

616
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.080
you'll walk each other with fake swords?

617
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.180
We have that.

618
00:17:17.181 --> 00:17:19.660
We have a use real swords,

619
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:24.990
the steel swords for doing forms and a fast draw,

620
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.970
you know,

621
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:26.803
slow draw.

622
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.340
A lot of times what you see in guide all what's,

623
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:29.930
uh,

624
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:30.711
which is a,

625
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:31.160
uh,

626
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.870
it's kind of a cottage slow.

627
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.450
Think of it like a Tai Chi for the Anita,

628
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.290
for those of you who are listening to this who are unfamiliar with it.

629
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:39.890
Um,

630
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.060
but you do it with swords.

631
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:41.720
Um,

632
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.171
fast,

633
00:17:42.171 --> 00:17:44.270
dry is exactly what it says it is.

634
00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:44.541
It's,

635
00:17:44.541 --> 00:17:45.320
you know,

636
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.153
and uh,

637
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.840
keep the art form alive.

638
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:50.040
It's all the same stuff that would do with a Billy club.

639
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.340
<v 2>It's all the same stuff you would do with one of those preparing for the</v>

640
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:54.150
apocalypse.

641
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.551
I am,

642
00:17:54.551 --> 00:17:54.791
man.

643
00:17:54.791 --> 00:17:57.850
She would run out of bullets and you have to Samurai sword the fuck out of here.

644
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.350
Well I'll be teaching people how to do that.

645
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.320
That's what you do when the apocalypse hits.

646
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.800
I'll be a accredited by then we'll go to the diamond Dave camp diamond Dave camp

647
00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:11.220
for survival and dark days.

648
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.570
Are you concerned with the fight?

649
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.740
I would wear that shirt actually not a bad.

650
00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:22.150
<v 1>Are you concerned that with the food toxins and stuff like that and in Japan</v>

651
00:18:22.151 --> 00:18:22.690
like the,

652
00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.770
you know the nuclear shit that's going on with the earthquake?

653
00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:30.820
<v 2>Of course I am and I'm con I am super consumed with that everywhere I go.</v>

654
00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:38.290
The only rationalization that I can use and I do use the rationalization is that

655
00:18:39.261 --> 00:18:41.810
I gave up a lot of my personal rights,

656
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.301
just me,

657
00:18:42.301 --> 00:18:47.301
Dave Roth personal rights to complain about 1200 thousand Marlboro cigarettes

658
00:18:47.691 --> 00:18:52.691
ago and that about 780,000 gallons of Schlitz malt liquor.

659
00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.850
The bowl that came in the tall can Schlitz is your shit.

660
00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.590
The blue and yellow and blue and white.

661
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:01.583
I can,

662
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.280
oh about 12,000 cans at to go.

663
00:19:04.281 --> 00:19:06.730
I gave up a lot of my rights to whine about what,

664
00:19:06.731 --> 00:19:07.640
what I'm in jazz.

665
00:19:07.641 --> 00:19:08.520
Do you still smoking?

666
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:09.420
Occasionally.

667
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:09.800
Yeah.

668
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.633
Yeah.

669
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.253
Well you get that,

670
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.981
that very,

671
00:19:12.981 --> 00:19:13.970
that baritone.

672
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.460
Well that's,

673
00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.740
that's a justification a lot.

674
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.800
That's why I do,

675
00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:20.690
I do it for the fame.

676
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.531
I do it for the kids.

677
00:19:21.531 --> 00:19:22.700
I smoked for the kids.

678
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.440
Let them know it still hit.

679
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.020
How many do you do a day?

680
00:19:27.021 --> 00:19:29.080
I would say maybe two.

681
00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:29.660
Two a day.

682
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.110
Yeah.

683
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.943
And uh,

684
00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.043
um,

685
00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:36.560
I got to pull the plug on that as I watch this guy.

686
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.060
I watched him struggle.

687
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:38.930
He got what?

688
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.440
He quit once and then went back on it cause it's cat hurt his foot

689
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.220
and you stressed over the cat.

690
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:49.610
He was like,

691
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:49.941
that's,

692
00:19:49.941 --> 00:19:51.560
it doesn't take this shit anymore.

693
00:19:51.561 --> 00:19:52.430
Where's the cigarette?

694
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.320
My Poor Kitty Tracy.

695
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.223
Limping a little.

696
00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.140
And you had a like a moment,

697
00:20:00.141 --> 00:20:00.850
right?

698
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.460
<v 1>Well there was other things around it.</v>

699
00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:02.970
It just was.

700
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.010
The breaking point was when my cat injured itself,

701
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:07.210
my fiance,

702
00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.130
my fiance left me and all this other shit.

703
00:20:09.131 --> 00:20:09.890
At the same time.

704
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:14.890
<v 2>Cathartic like a psychoanalytical clinical moment noise and thing.</v>

705
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.640
You'll triggers that.

706
00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.270
You're associating with the things that are not that big.

707
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:21.143
Right.

708
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.100
He's actually getting to the root of the problem.

709
00:20:25.101 --> 00:20:25.940
Dave preach.

710
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.501
<v 1>Oh,</v>

711
00:20:26.501 --> 00:20:27.520
that's talking to cigarettes.

712
00:20:27.521 --> 00:20:28.320
I didn't know anyone

713
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.160
<v 2>like they used to say to me did that,</v>

714
00:20:30.161 --> 00:20:31.300
I don't know what's wrong with you.

715
00:20:31.301 --> 00:20:31.451
What?

716
00:20:31.451 --> 00:20:32.860
I'm sure it's hard to smell.

717
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.290
Have you ever tried electronic cigarettes?

718
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.970
Electronic cigarettes?

719
00:20:36.971 --> 00:20:37.780
What do they do?

720
00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.680
You never seen it.

721
00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.190
It's necessarily look like a cigarette.

722
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.390
It comes and gives you the tobacco button.

723
00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.380
Miss comes out,

724
00:20:44.381 --> 00:20:46.180
there's no smoke and it's not bad for your lungs.

725
00:20:46.181 --> 00:20:46.781
Check this out,

726
00:20:46.781 --> 00:20:47.614
watch this.

727
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:49.660
Yeah,

728
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:49.991
and it's,

729
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:50.380
yeah,

730
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.800
it's in the nicotine gives you the fixed and he could smoke anywhere.

731
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.220
Yeah.

732
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.960
Haven't you seen this to track Dorf commercial?

733
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.590
I'm familiar with this to some degree,

734
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:01.480
but there's not a lot like lap dancing.

735
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:02.590
Can you tighten this thing?

736
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.590
This is a,

737
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.480
this is moving around like laptops.

738
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:06.791
No,

739
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:07.810
it's definitely different.

740
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:08.281
It's,

741
00:21:08.281 --> 00:21:08.820
um,

742
00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.390
<v 0>the,</v>

743
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:12.220
the idea behind it is it gives you all the nicotine,

744
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:13.150
but it does,

745
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.780
you're not smoking any burning chemical.

746
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:16.870
<v 2>Ah,</v>

747
00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:20.840
like it's like a vaporizer that delivers nicotine as well.

748
00:21:20.841 --> 00:21:22.940
I'm not going to make fun of nicotine because,

749
00:21:22.941 --> 00:21:23.540
um,

750
00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.540
if you look back in all of our favorite authors and all of our favorite jazz

751
00:21:28.971 --> 00:21:33.971
musicians and a whole lot of other folks involved,

752
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.463
um,

753
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:39.350
nicotine plays a huge part in what they did.

754
00:21:39.351 --> 00:21:41.660
Sigmund Freud used to smoke what,

755
00:21:41.661 --> 00:21:43.790
two boxes of cigars a day?

756
00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:44.990
Mark Twain.

757
00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:45.470
Yeah,

758
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.310
same thing.

759
00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.173
Yeah.

760
00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.320
The list is long.

761
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.870
Winston Churchill two boxes a day.

762
00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.411
Yeah.

763
00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:52.244
There was a,

764
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.110
<v 0>well,</v>

765
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.970
I forget what intellectual,

766
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.830
very famous Guy Englishman.

767
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.400
Uh,

768
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.540
he would,

769
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:02.320
he wouldn't fly unless you can get a seat in the back so he could smoke his pipe

770
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:03.430
like back.

771
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.280
That was back in the day when you were allowed to smoke on cigarettes.

772
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:07.620
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

773
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.190
I'm going to,

774
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.800
but I'm going to wonder what the action is.

775
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:16.830
There's a big connection between nicotine and people who are the real cerebral

776
00:22:16.991 --> 00:22:18.520
players of our culture.

777
00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:18.830
Oh,

778
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:19.663
relaxes.

779
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.161
<v 0>Well,</v>

780
00:22:21.161 --> 00:22:21.994
it's a good,

781
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.050
it's not bad.

782
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.320
The real issue with nicotine is the delivery method.

783
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.340
The where where it's really toxic is in all the different chemicals that are

784
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.600
lovely government is allowed cigarette companies to put into these fucking

785
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.430
things to to make them more addictive.

786
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.100
That was the Russell Crowe movie insider.

787
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.000
Did you ever see that movie?

788
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:41.110
Great movie?

789
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.360
Russell Crowe plays a scientist who works for the tobacco companies.

790
00:22:44.361 --> 00:22:48.460
She was formulated it various chemicals that make you addicted to cigarettes.

791
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:48.940
Your,

792
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.260
your addiction to cigarettes is so intense and so extreme because they've

793
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:58.261
allowed the cigarette companies to engineer their cigarettes to have the maximum

794
00:22:58.421 --> 00:22:59.500
amount of addiction.

795
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.650
It plays on several key factors and your,

796
00:23:02.651 --> 00:23:02.891
your,

797
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:03.131
your,

798
00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:03.371
your,

799
00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:06.790
your biological system and it was all detailed in this movie.

800
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:08.710
So it's not the cigarettes,

801
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.380
it's not the tobacco rather it's all the other shit.

802
00:23:11.381 --> 00:23:13.900
It's 590 different chemicals.

803
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.340
It's not just tobacco.

804
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.140
Like if you buy like American spirits,

805
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.100
that's just tobacco,

806
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:18.430
right?

807
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:19.263
Is that the deal?

808
00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.150
Or if you buy your that stuff where you roll your own,

809
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:22.541
those are,

810
00:23:22.541 --> 00:23:23.620
that's actually tobacco.

811
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.390
It's supposedly way better for you.

812
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:26.410
<v 2>Real issues,</v>

813
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.243
all the other shit.

814
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.410
It's never going to be great for you.

815
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.080
You Smoking,

816
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.940
burning plant matter,

817
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.440
but it's definitely way better.

818
00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.190
You know what?

819
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.770
Japanese energy drinks have nicotine in it.

820
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.760
Wow.

821
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.391
Yeah.

822
00:23:39.391 --> 00:23:40.150
I had a,

823
00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:41.670
one of the translators,

824
00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:42.330
uh,

825
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.120
relate that to me because I was,

826
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.100
I had one was like really

827
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.881
<v 4>mean looking in.</v>

828
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:48.230
It made me feel mean.

829
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.333
I was like,

830
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:49.671
you know,

831
00:23:49.671 --> 00:23:54.671
I was yelling at people and I was angry at inanimate objects and stuff and

832
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.780
accusatory,

833
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:57.441
you know,

834
00:23:57.441 --> 00:23:59.000
and this kind of thing.

835
00:23:59.001 --> 00:23:59.571
And uh,

836
00:23:59.571 --> 00:23:59.961
I thought,

837
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:00.201
wow,

838
00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:00.801
this is great.

839
00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:02.440
I wonder if I can get this and this a stage.

840
00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:03.723
<v 5>So</v>

841
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:08.190
yeah.

842
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.600
Why don't mind,

843
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:11.800
<v 4>yeah.</v>

844
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.630
And I had her translate and I wonder,

845
00:24:13.631 --> 00:24:15.550
can you put nicotine in drinks here?

846
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:16.550
<v 2>You must be able,</v>

847
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.160
you can get nicotine gum and just chew that Shit.

848
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.180
I know a lot of writers actually advocate that Pete,

849
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.270
for people who aren't even addicted to nicotine now for trying to kick it just

850
00:24:26.271 --> 00:24:27.200
for a stimulant,

851
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:27.860
for the mind.

852
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:28.390
Yeah.

853
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.720
Yeah.

854
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.530
That's kind of in a circular way.

855
00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:34.190
What we were just starting to talk about cigars too.

856
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:35.800
I love like a cigar bows.

857
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:36.940
Some scar buzzes,

858
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.040
great buzz and there's a connection to world's power there.

859
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:41.660
C probably right?

860
00:24:41.661 --> 00:24:45.620
Although meaning all those guys don't have killing and fucking dropping bombs on

861
00:24:45.621 --> 00:24:46.570
people at a big fats.

862
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.820
I pulled it off and I don't,

863
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:53.930
I don't think any of my favorite jazz music could have been made or composer

864
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.910
plays in in a smoke free environment.

865
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:56.570
Yeah.

866
00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:01.570
Well you came from a time where clubs like the nightclubs where all smoke

867
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:01.941
filled,

868
00:25:01.941 --> 00:25:02.270
right?

869
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:06.380
Completely smoke filled in every movie with smoke filled as well.

870
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.320
He's looking at all the old black and white movies.

871
00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:10.460
It's the Stein fishing,

872
00:25:10.461 --> 00:25:12.550
how much tobacco that's consumed.

873
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.460
James Bond movies are particularly specifically why I smoke.

874
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.570
There's nothing weird though than going back and watching those TV shows where a

875
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:25.430
doctor is talking to a patient while smoking a cigarette that have ever seen

876
00:25:25.431 --> 00:25:27.260
that that is a trip.

877
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.840
That's one of the weirdest things you could ever see in your life,

878
00:25:29.841 --> 00:25:31.220
but those 1950 shows,

879
00:25:31.221 --> 00:25:32.180
that was fairly common.

880
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:33.111
Like the doctors.

881
00:25:33.111 --> 00:25:35.150
You'd be reviewing your chart with a cigarette.

882
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:36.830
People didn't know.

883
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.250
Oh,

884
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.270
they really didn't.

885
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:38.991
That's amazing,

886
00:25:38.991 --> 00:25:39.740
isn't it?

887
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.180
How could you not know it's change.

888
00:25:41.181 --> 00:25:41.871
Bunch smoke.

889
00:25:41.871 --> 00:25:42.380
Now

890
00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:42.620
<v 5>I,</v>

891
00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:42.891
you know,

892
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:43.371
this is so funny.

893
00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:45.080
I watched Skyfall today.

894
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:46.840
I don't remember him having,

895
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.560
<v 2>I don't think he does anymore.</v>

896
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.281
He drinks it.

897
00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:50.071
Fucks still though.

898
00:25:50.071 --> 00:25:51.080
Thank God for that.

899
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.660
Most of defying all of our fucking heroes,

900
00:25:53.661 --> 00:25:54.050
man.

901
00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:58.100
Sean Connery's was smoking Rothmans king size and then gold finger and that's

902
00:25:58.101 --> 00:25:59.030
where I saw it and I,

903
00:25:59.031 --> 00:25:59.630
you know,

904
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.450
that's my went out and I got a pack of Rothman's king size.

905
00:26:02.451 --> 00:26:03.410
You know the blue ones?

906
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:05.510
<v 5>Mine was from watching you.</v>

907
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.550
That's how I started it.

908
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.641
Well,

909
00:26:07.641 --> 00:26:09.350
what brand did you start smoking?

910
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.980
Watching me got it from watching you lucky strike unfiltered.

911
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:14.600
<v 4>No,</v>

912
00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.433
really that's,

913
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:15.831
you know,

914
00:26:15.831 --> 00:26:16.790
that's a telling thing,

915
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:17.580
man.

916
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.710
You know when somebody says there were a Dave Roth fan or a van Halen Fan,

917
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:22.580
more appropriately.

918
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:26.090
It says a lot about your sense of humor and your fighting spirit.

919
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:29.660
<v 5>Hey,</v>

920
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.550
my love for stripper,

921
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:32.890
that's fighting spirit.

922
00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:38.200
That's par.

923
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.580
That's subgroup a.

924
00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.400
What is the name of his son?

925
00:26:42.401 --> 00:26:43.234
Nicotine.

926
00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:43.990
Do

927
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.570
<v 4>you remember this didn't have an American name.</v>

928
00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:48.580
I think it's in a lot of them.

929
00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:52.770
Anything that has an exclamation point or a black label on the front of it.

930
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.660
How do you guys have been to a talk,

931
00:26:55.661 --> 00:26:55.901
Joe?

932
00:26:55.901 --> 00:26:57.010
He had been to Japan.

933
00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.790
What was your experience just shopping for the easy like chewing gum.

934
00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.241
Did you,

935
00:27:01.241 --> 00:27:02.620
what did you try any of that?

936
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.780
<v 1>We were only there for a couple days but we did.</v>

937
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.470
And what was your experience?

938
00:27:07.471 --> 00:27:08.091
It's really easy.

939
00:27:08.091 --> 00:27:08.481
You just go,

940
00:27:08.481 --> 00:27:12.470
cause they all barely knew a little bit enough English that you could just go in

941
00:27:12.471 --> 00:27:12.981
and like hi,

942
00:27:12.981 --> 00:27:13.671
how are you doing?

943
00:27:13.671 --> 00:27:15.400
And then they tell you how much it was.

944
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:16.543
It was easy to do that.

945
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.070
It was hard for me to find certain things like,

946
00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:22.570
like you know like soapies or like hotels and stuff like that.

947
00:27:22.571 --> 00:27:26.900
Like I got lost on foot trying to find my way back to the hotel and you know,

948
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.000
it was impossible for me to do that.

949
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.280
So I had to go to one.

950
00:27:30.281 --> 00:27:33.830
It was a little police stations that are on every corner and he had to draw me a

951
00:27:33.831 --> 00:27:35.450
map and it was weird.

952
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.630
<v 4>Not Unusual.</v>

953
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:37.710
Not Unusual.

954
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:38.970
It's like going to Jupiter.

955
00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:39.330
Yeah.

956
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:39.931
People say,

957
00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:40.291
you know,

958
00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:40.740
okay,

959
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.160
uh,

960
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.020
there is a lot of English spoken,

961
00:27:43.021 --> 00:27:46.380
but you know what it's like learning Spanish in the school system really is like

962
00:27:46.381 --> 00:27:47.340
an alien world.

963
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:48.660
When you go to Tokyo.

964
00:27:48.661 --> 00:27:49.321
It really is,

965
00:27:49.321 --> 00:27:51.300
it's the culture is so different.

966
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.590
It's so different.

967
00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.450
Everything is different.

968
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:55.740
Virtually everything.

969
00:27:55.741 --> 00:28:00.540
Just shopping for dental floss is a whole different experience and the way that

970
00:28:00.541 --> 00:28:02.250
you approach people,

971
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:02.851
you know,

972
00:28:02.851 --> 00:28:04.260
bad back and forth,

973
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:06.240
the respect issue,

974
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.103
you know,

975
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:12.110
even though it may just be sugarcoating are really sharp New York City sense of

976
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.490
business and purpose,

977
00:28:14.491 --> 00:28:14.791
you know,

978
00:28:14.791 --> 00:28:18.630
underneath all of the old fashioned heighten those all,

979
00:28:18.631 --> 00:28:22.260
you know and and so forth is every bit is savvy,

980
00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:22.531
right?

981
00:28:22.531 --> 00:28:26.880
Every modern cop thriller that's on the movie screens today as you know,

982
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:29.360
is right behind that guys sunglasses,

983
00:28:29.361 --> 00:28:29.650
you know,

984
00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.440
there's modern as can possibly be there.

985
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.400
So yeah.

986
00:28:32.401 --> 00:28:36.150
But that sense of tradition still stays ooze very,

987
00:28:36.151 --> 00:28:37.460
very strong and important.

988
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.450
You do take your shoes off when you walk into a person's place or when you walk

989
00:28:42.451 --> 00:28:44.790
into a decent restaurant or whatever you do,

990
00:28:44.791 --> 00:28:47.610
take your shoes off and there are loud a little,

991
00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:48.510
uh,

992
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:49.261
things you have to learn,

993
00:28:49.261 --> 00:28:50.460
a little ps and qs.

994
00:28:50.461 --> 00:28:51.180
You Bet.

995
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:51.600
Now,

996
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.141
do you,

997
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:55.230
are you living with people that you're friends with from back home where you

998
00:28:55.231 --> 00:28:56.290
just go by yourself?

999
00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.720
You just totally Wayne Solo.

1000
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.991
Yeah,

1001
00:28:57.991 --> 00:28:58.824
my dog.

1002
00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:59.491
Wow.

1003
00:28:59.491 --> 00:29:01.440
So you put the dog in like a,

1004
00:29:01.441 --> 00:29:02.400
a ship for like,

1005
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.180
there's a way we ship 'em around and he goes,

1006
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:11.100
he goes through the European way so that he doesn't have to do a 14 hours,

1007
00:29:11.101 --> 00:29:11.670
you know,

1008
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:12.660
in a row there.

1009
00:29:12.661 --> 00:29:13.011
But,

1010
00:29:13.011 --> 00:29:13.350
uh,

1011
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.520
people do it all the time.

1012
00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:15.270
Wow.

1013
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:15.780
And a,

1014
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.120
there's not a lot of guys you English is,

1015
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:18.601
you know,

1016
00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:19.950
for Japanese,

1017
00:29:19.951 --> 00:29:20.760
for foreigner,

1018
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.690
it's not a lot of guys,

1019
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:22.770
young faces there,

1020
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:23.221
which,

1021
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:23.490
uh,

1022
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.091
I enjoy it.

1023
00:29:24.091 --> 00:29:27.660
I ride my bicycle everywhere and I'm up and down.

1024
00:29:27.661 --> 00:29:28.220
Uh,

1025
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:28.510
you know,

1026
00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:28.990
um,

1027
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.200
I like in New York City,

1028
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.060
I'm kinda uptown as well as the downtown and know,

1029
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.740
look at the parking lot for a van Halen Gig.

1030
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.980
You've got a Mercedes Benz parked next to a Harley Davidson

1031
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.850
<v 5>and nobody blinks.</v>

1032
00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:49.780
I think I should know that same audience

1033
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.010
<v 4>is,</v>

1034
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.900
you know,

1035
00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.670
is,

1036
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.570
are the neighborhoods that I'm a forwarded access to.

1037
00:29:57.571 --> 00:29:58.351
Do you follow?

1038
00:29:58.351 --> 00:29:59.340
It was kind of a neighborhood.

1039
00:29:59.341 --> 00:30:00.300
Do you live in and Tokyo?

1040
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.141
Like what do you,

1041
00:30:01.141 --> 00:30:01.530
uh,

1042
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:01.771
oh,

1043
00:30:01.771 --> 00:30:03.630
I live in a pretty classic little place.

1044
00:30:03.631 --> 00:30:04.980
It's a apartment building.

1045
00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:06.060
Everything's vertical,

1046
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:07.650
vertical communities there.

1047
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:08.850
And uh,

1048
00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:12.060
I live up over a shopping mall that has a 24 hour,

1049
00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.050
uh,

1050
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.810
grocery store underneath.

1051
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.650
All right.

1052
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.760
And that's in the basement you follow?

1053
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:20.701
And then,

1054
00:30:20.701 --> 00:30:21.090
uh,

1055
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.010
there's uh,

1056
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.630
restaurants and shopping and then,

1057
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.553
um,

1058
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:26.431
uh,

1059
00:30:26.431 --> 00:30:29.340
all the coffee shops and everything that we have here,

1060
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.650
it's really international where I am.

1061
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:32.873
Um,

1062
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:38.420
just 10 minutes away by bicycle is way downtown and that looks like the Star

1063
00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:39.200
Wars,

1064
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:39.540
you know,

1065
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:43.560
the bar scene where everybody's kind of mixing and matching,

1066
00:30:43.561 --> 00:30:43.921
you know,

1067
00:30:43.921 --> 00:30:45.810
15 different styles of,

1068
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:46.651
you know,

1069
00:30:46.651 --> 00:30:51.651
one person outer space meets Surf 1970s Times a Ninja Warrior Times dreadlock

1070
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.060
holiday meats,

1071
00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:57.990
you know,

1072
00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.210
they go on and not because they don't have neighborhoods,

1073
00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:04.230
they're just picking and choosing from different stores,

1074
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.870
from different websites and you know,

1075
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.390
they don't have neighborhoods like here we have,

1076
00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:14.040
say north Hollywood for the artists have silver lake for if you're an artist or

1077
00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:14.874
whatever.

1078
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:15.330
Um,

1079
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:16.440
if you are,

1080
00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:21.120
I'm up and coming a student in some sense of the word,

1081
00:31:21.121 --> 00:31:23.280
you'll stand down near USC or whatever.

1082
00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:25.231
Well no,

1083
00:31:25.231 --> 00:31:26.940
everybody's kind of mishmash together.

1084
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.580
So you're nuts.

1085
00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.770
You can be even more creative.

1086
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.090
It's not like you're growing up around a whole group of people who were all

1087
00:31:36.091 --> 00:31:37.410
doing the same thing you're doing.

1088
00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:41.040
You kind of create yourself in the mirror differently every single day.

1089
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:46.160
Now did you find it hard to make friends there to like have people to have

1090
00:31:46.981 --> 00:31:48.540
conversations with an English?

1091
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:52.040
I mean at that would think that that would wear on me after awhile.

1092
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:52.530
Well,

1093
00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:52.801
yeah,

1094
00:31:52.801 --> 00:31:54.510
but I don't do a lot of listening anyway.

1095
00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.400
<v 5>Talk to me with a barely speak English</v>

1096
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:04.841
<v 4>past tense.</v>

1097
00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:05.890
You need you really Joe.

1098
00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:08.933
<v 5>That's hilarious.</v>

1099
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:10.770
As I learned,

1100
00:32:10.771 --> 00:32:11.400
you know,

1101
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.640
it's almost kind of a hermit.

1102
00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:13.490
It's

1103
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:14.920
<v 4>a certain sense cause you,</v>

1104
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.520
you can't have it be that very,

1105
00:32:17.521 --> 00:32:18.360
very easily.

1106
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.350
Um,

1107
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.200
I like it because I'm in constant contact with people.

1108
00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:27.410
I do class with a variety of different teachers and out of that comes my friends

1109
00:32:28.201 --> 00:32:31.260
and this is where we're going to go to night and you know,

1110
00:32:31.261 --> 00:32:32.940
why don't you come visit over here,

1111
00:32:32.941 --> 00:32:33.600
et Cetera,

1112
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.433
you know,

1113
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.410
and uh,

1114
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.220
that being said,

1115
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:43.090
a with folks is as fast as you can learn it off of a,

1116
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:44.120
from their language.

1117
00:32:44.121 --> 00:32:44.954
Teacher.

1118
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.030
Japanese is heavy lifting.

1119
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:47.631
I've,

1120
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:48.050
uh,

1121
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:51.260
I've learned a pretty fair in Spanish.

1122
00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:51.471
You know,

1123
00:32:51.471 --> 00:32:54.800
I can get us in trouble and halfway out in Spanish,

1124
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:56.930
under duress,

1125
00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.670
under spotlights,

1126
00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.391
but,

1127
00:32:59.391 --> 00:33:00.350
uh,

1128
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.540
in Japanese,

1129
00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.570
um,

1130
00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.150
well I can get everything done that I need to do.

1131
00:33:05.151 --> 00:33:06.410
I get shopping done.

1132
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.290
I can go down due to the dry cleaning,

1133
00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:10.400
I can do the taxi,

1134
00:33:10.401 --> 00:33:11.234
I can,

1135
00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.103
you know,

1136
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:17.140
get my way through the movies and the restaurants fairly fluent enough that I

1137
00:33:18.141 --> 00:33:19.310
can translate for me.

1138
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:22.250
I'm not quite at the point where I can translate for you,

1139
00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:22.821
you know,

1140
00:33:22.821 --> 00:33:25.610
can you translate for you if you're watching something on television?

1141
00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:26.421
Yeah.

1142
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:27.530
Well I can tell you the story.

1143
00:33:27.531 --> 00:33:29.900
I can tell you the plot line of what's going on,

1144
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.810
who's doing what and you know,

1145
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.740
what each guy is and what it represents.

1146
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.360
<v 0>When you're watching that,</v>

1147
00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:39.770
is it like an instantaneous thing or is it like translating after you hear

1148
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:42.740
something like are you look recognizing what he saying?

1149
00:33:42.741 --> 00:33:44.750
Like are you thinking about it in Japanese?

1150
00:33:44.751 --> 00:33:45.140
If that,

1151
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.040
if that makes sense.

1152
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:46.860
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

1153
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:50.460
It's kind of like listening to somebody who is your own age that you know is a

1154
00:33:50.461 --> 00:33:51.480
compulsive liar.

1155
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.990
So you're trying to pick out exact words that

1156
00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:57.960
may or may not make

1157
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.400
you turn to your friend and go,

1158
00:34:02.401 --> 00:34:02.820
okay,

1159
00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:03.653
Bobby,

1160
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:05.573
what happened?

1161
00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.031
Well,

1162
00:34:06.031 --> 00:34:07.740
there's even didn't go over there as the last night,

1163
00:34:07.741 --> 00:34:08.011
late,

1164
00:34:08.011 --> 00:34:08.520
late,

1165
00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:08.791
okay.

1166
00:34:08.791 --> 00:34:09.920
And your print that one more.

1167
00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.190
How does he give me his teachings and his a two chicks and your print,

1168
00:34:14.191 --> 00:34:15.024
that word

1169
00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:20.520
six pack of beer and you print that word.

1170
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.440
Now you're getting the real story and your,

1171
00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:27.720
your comprising it of all of the other,

1172
00:34:27.721 --> 00:34:28.500
uh,

1173
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:28.861
uh,

1174
00:34:28.861 --> 00:34:32.880
white noise that your friend Bobby May be discerned dispensing.

1175
00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.760
That's where I'm at in Japanese television.

1176
00:34:35.761 --> 00:34:39.090
Now if I'm watching a sitcom or if I'm watching a movie,

1177
00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:43.920
then I can tell you what's going on and who's saying what to who,

1178
00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.180
but I can't get it exactly word for word.

1179
00:34:48.181 --> 00:34:48.960
What's going there?

1180
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.450
Are you doing some sort of a web show from there?

1181
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:55.200
I've been doing the Roth show for the last three,

1182
00:34:55.201 --> 00:34:55.981
four months.

1183
00:34:55.981 --> 00:34:58.020
I think we're on our 10th show.

1184
00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:59.220
And uh,

1185
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.440
we finally just started talking about it.

1186
00:35:01.441 --> 00:35:04.020
That's part of the reason that I'm coming around through the pass here.

1187
00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.520
I love broadcasting.

1188
00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:06.800
I love just,

1189
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.080
you know,

1190
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.010
as we're doing now,

1191
00:35:08.011 --> 00:35:09.450
just shooting the shit on it.

1192
00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.170
Yeah.

1193
00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:11.220
I first that

1194
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.980
<v 0>what you can do now is probably so much frayer then you could do when you were</v>

1195
00:35:15.981 --> 00:35:16.701
trying to,

1196
00:35:16.701 --> 00:35:18.860
when you're doing terrestrial radio,

1197
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:19.641
when you know,

1198
00:35:19.641 --> 00:35:22.160
you did that for a while after Howard Stern,

1199
00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:22.630
right.

1200
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.711
<v 4>Oh,</v>

1201
00:35:22.711 --> 00:35:24.460
while he means four and a half months.

1202
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:25.200
So,

1203
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.033
wow.

1204
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:27.221
Yeah,

1205
00:35:27.221 --> 00:35:27.511
they,

1206
00:35:27.511 --> 00:35:27.670
it,

1207
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.390
that was it.

1208
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:31.780
That was a trial that was heavy lifted.

1209
00:35:31.781 --> 00:35:32.291
It was,

1210
00:35:32.291 --> 00:35:32.950
uh,

1211
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:34.630
I had said to them initially,

1212
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.823
uh,

1213
00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.660
you know,

1214
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.351
folks,

1215
00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:39.750
let's try some new things here.

1216
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:40.441
You know,

1217
00:35:40.441 --> 00:35:45.030
to just go back into the already sat mode of,

1218
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:45.481
okay,

1219
00:35:45.481 --> 00:35:47.220
you're going to need a traffic girl,

1220
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.170
you're going to need a sports blog,

1221
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.160
you're going to need,

1222
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:51.330
uh,

1223
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:52.210
you know,

1224
00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:55.320
the morning team kind of a approach.

1225
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:55.771
I says,

1226
00:35:55.771 --> 00:35:57.750
I'm really not interested in doing that.

1227
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.621
And,

1228
00:35:58.621 --> 00:35:59.454
um,

1229
00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:00.780
uh,

1230
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:03.210
I guess they thought I would get under the wing and then,

1231
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:03.720
you know,

1232
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.000
we would progressively reached that point.

1233
00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:06.781
And,

1234
00:36:06.781 --> 00:36:07.020
uh,

1235
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.000
we never really got under the wing.

1236
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:10.350
I love broadcasting,

1237
00:36:10.351 --> 00:36:11.184
I love talking,

1238
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.791
but,

1239
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:12.091
uh,

1240
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:14.370
when I got fired and,

1241
00:36:14.371 --> 00:36:15.130
uh,

1242
00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:15.850
I,

1243
00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:17.180
I can see the look over here,

1244
00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:17.401
you know,

1245
00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:17.910
my,

1246
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.560
my general a tone.

1247
00:36:19.561 --> 00:36:20.430
When somebody said,

1248
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:22.800
somebody said to me in Japan was a day of Sun,

1249
00:36:22.801 --> 00:36:25.800
so you got fired from big job in radio.

1250
00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:26.371
He said,

1251
00:36:26.371 --> 00:36:26.511
well,

1252
00:36:26.511 --> 00:36:28.350
did you ever get fired from Mcdonald's?

1253
00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.210
<v 2>What was that like a sore spot?</v>

1254
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:33.870
You got fired?

1255
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:34.703
No,

1256
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:35.001
no.

1257
00:36:35.001 --> 00:36:36.400
Are you kidding me?

1258
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:37.250
Get fired from

1259
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:44.030
got to compare notes like in high school,

1260
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:45.340
that's Dothan.

1261
00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.630
<v 4>I got fired from the Burger King and Mcdonald's.</v>

1262
00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:50.860
Um,

1263
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:51.693
no.

1264
00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:55.300
Their reasoning was that my humor was good,

1265
00:36:55.301 --> 00:36:57.040
but it was not early morning humor.

1266
00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.540
What does that even mean?

1267
00:36:58.930 --> 00:36:59.321
Well,

1268
00:36:59.321 --> 00:36:59.651
I just,

1269
00:36:59.651 --> 00:36:59.921
you know,

1270
00:36:59.921 --> 00:37:01.090
I was doodling around with,

1271
00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:01.953
you know,

1272
00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.340
adult concepts.

1273
00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.470
<v 0>Thoughts are to replace stern like that.</v>

1274
00:37:06.471 --> 00:37:09.350
What they should have done is just with no explanation whatsoever,

1275
00:37:09.351 --> 00:37:14.030
put a Mexican show on full Spanish and not say a word.

1276
00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:14.900
Fuck you.

1277
00:37:14.901 --> 00:37:15.651
Who Cares?

1278
00:37:15.651 --> 00:37:16.401
This what we have on.

1279
00:37:16.401 --> 00:37:20.300
Leave it on for a month and let everybody gets all their complaining out of the

1280
00:37:20.301 --> 00:37:20.571
way.

1281
00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:23.270
And then after a month you throw the diamond,

1282
00:37:23.271 --> 00:37:26.930
David Lee Roth Shawan and everybody's so happy to hear someone speak English

1283
00:37:26.931 --> 00:37:27.764
again.

1284
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.840
And we're like,

1285
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.110
listen,

1286
00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.050
we got through this with this dark period.

1287
00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.500
It's turning into a crazy Mexican station in New York City.

1288
00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:37.740
Ah,

1289
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.040
I've made or making clear sense.

1290
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:42.160
It didn't make any sense to try to replace turn.

1291
00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:42.681
My point is,

1292
00:37:42.681 --> 00:37:43.580
no one could have done it.

1293
00:37:43.581 --> 00:37:44.570
It was impossible.

1294
00:37:44.571 --> 00:37:46.190
Even if your show was amazing,

1295
00:37:46.191 --> 00:37:48.050
they would have never allowed you to replace,

1296
00:37:48.051 --> 00:37:48.771
darn you.

1297
00:37:48.771 --> 00:37:49.910
Replacing fit.

1298
00:37:49.911 --> 00:37:53.180
Greatest guy in the history of radio by far.

1299
00:37:53.181 --> 00:37:57.270
So anyone who went out after him was sort of like you were,

1300
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:58.910
you would sacrifice,

1301
00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:02.300
<v 2>I looked at to try and do something completely different.</v>

1302
00:38:02.301 --> 00:38:02.991
I had said to them,

1303
00:38:02.991 --> 00:38:03.824
for example,

1304
00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.680
after a life of a danger and intrigued,

1305
00:38:06.681 --> 00:38:07.520
why would I stop?

1306
00:38:07.521 --> 00:38:11.660
Now we can install a gas lines in a hotel room.

1307
00:38:11.661 --> 00:38:13.010
We can go up on a roof,

1308
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:15.500
we can go from a basement.

1309
00:38:15.501 --> 00:38:20.501
I don't mind waking up at two in the morning and interviewing somebody who just

1310
00:38:20.991 --> 00:38:24.210
finished his show in Las Vegas and you know,

1311
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:24.951
and Cetera.

1312
00:38:24.951 --> 00:38:25.760
Why would we,

1313
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.820
why can't we at least start there and those big hurdle.

1314
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:32.270
So you're going to do things through Skype as well as do things for people that

1315
00:38:32.271 --> 00:38:33.104
are in Tokyo,

1316
00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:33.540
if you,

1317
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:33.950
yes,

1318
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:34.783
exactly.

1319
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:39.070
Broadcast from Berlin and Tokyo as well as and broadcast from all different

1320
00:38:39.071 --> 00:38:42.610
recording studios cause everybody's got super modern.

1321
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:46.120
Everybody wants to be part of what's happening right now.

1322
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.541
You know,

1323
00:38:46.541 --> 00:38:47.890
especially in the economy,

1324
00:38:47.891 --> 00:38:51.580
everybody understands a little more of that promotion,

1325
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:52.743
you know,

1326
00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:53.680
get involved.

1327
00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.420
You might not make a penny right now,

1328
00:38:55.421 --> 00:38:56.980
but you got your face out there,

1329
00:38:56.981 --> 00:38:57.880
you got your name,

1330
00:38:57.881 --> 00:38:58.580
your brand,

1331
00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.590
your studio,

1332
00:38:59.591 --> 00:39:00.424
your whatever.

1333
00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.160
So people are a lot more flexible to that.

1334
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:04.180
And you know what?

1335
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.230
We crashed and burned.

1336
00:39:05.231 --> 00:39:06.220
They just couldn't see it.

1337
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.421
The idea of,

1338
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:07.691
you know,

1339
00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:08.560
that uh,

1340
00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:12.010
I wasn't going to be in the exact same studio every morning.

1341
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.750
That became a real trudge

1342
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:15.911
and you know,

1343
00:39:15.911 --> 00:39:19.540
getting up at a four 30 in the morning,

1344
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:20.583
that's bullshit.

1345
00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.730
That's the roughest job in all of Chopin.

1346
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.390
Especially for a rockstar.

1347
00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:25.960
I mean,

1348
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.310
most of your shows written night,

1349
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.350
he'd probably sleep til noon most days.

1350
00:39:29.351 --> 00:39:33.430
Wake up feeling great to get up at four instead of that to get up eight hours

1351
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:34.091
earlier than that.

1352
00:39:34.091 --> 00:39:35.710
Oh well just stay awake.

1353
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:37.220
You're,

1354
00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.650
you're backing into the truth.

1355
00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:39.730
It's not the getting up.

1356
00:39:39.731 --> 00:39:42.160
It's the having to go to bed at what time?

1357
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.310
Asked her for hours.

1358
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:48.490
That's like some Buddhist stuff I just did right there.

1359
00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.110
If it wasn't,

1360
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:52.780
if it wasn't like that you had to be on for four hours,

1361
00:39:52.781 --> 00:39:57.781
I would say you better off staying up or going to going to broadcast from Hawaii

1362
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.333
guys,

1363
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.460
you get yourself a suite at the Marriott something,

1364
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:08.610
right and I think you started midnight or something like this so you know you

1365
00:40:08.711 --> 00:40:09.280
can kind of,

1366
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.810
you know that's a good move.

1367
00:40:10.811 --> 00:40:15.190
Fallon's out your thing and you can do pre taped stuff for half of it.

1368
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:15.641
Yeah,

1369
00:40:15.641 --> 00:40:17.200
midnight from Hawaii,

1370
00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:17.801
dude,

1371
00:40:17.801 --> 00:40:19.090
I just it all out.

1372
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.400
The new studio will now be on the big island.

1373
00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:27.120
I'm going to buy Terence Mckenna's place Kona and,

1374
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.980
and you go a high speed,

1375
00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:30.970
low drag.

1376
00:40:30.971 --> 00:40:35.971
You go with the low bile and lethal and so that you can put everything in some

1377
00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:38.020
Pelican cases,

1378
00:40:38.021 --> 00:40:38.720
you know?

1379
00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.080
Then you're going to move and you get a,

1380
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.820
we need to buy desk squad west,

1381
00:40:42.821 --> 00:40:43.630
west,

1382
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:43.900
west,

1383
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:44.733
west,

1384
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:45.251
west.

1385
00:40:45.251 --> 00:40:45.371
Well,

1386
00:40:45.371 --> 00:40:46.990
this is death squad West right now,

1387
00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:47.771
but desk squad,

1388
00:40:47.771 --> 00:40:49.030
west West will be,

1389
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.660
get yourself with a balcony with,

1390
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.490
you can tune the room so he can hear things outside.

1391
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.000
Dude,

1392
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:55.631
midnight,

1393
00:40:55.631 --> 00:40:56.051
man,

1394
00:40:56.051 --> 00:40:56.884
come on.

1395
00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.260
Even go western.

1396
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:01.420
That's to west.

1397
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:02.290
That's the,

1398
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:03.910
we'll never get a show on the air that way.

1399
00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:05.890
But traveling though that,

1400
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:07.200
even if you hate,

1401
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.610
especially if you hate where you are going,

1402
00:41:09.611 --> 00:41:11.860
blue is way more fun than going,

1403
00:41:11.861 --> 00:41:12.480
Yay.

1404
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:12.951
You know?

1405
00:41:12.951 --> 00:41:15.190
So if you hate where you are,

1406
00:41:15.191 --> 00:41:17.740
so you had a particularly bad day of somewhere,

1407
00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:19.030
knew was my thinking,

1408
00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:21.600
then it's you,

1409
00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:22.840
it's part travelogue.

1410
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:23.621
There's part,

1411
00:41:23.621 --> 00:41:24.454
uh,

1412
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:26.000
uh,

1413
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.020
get to a little bit of reality.

1414
00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.740
Get to live the life of,

1415
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:30.130
you know,

1416
00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:31.210
when we go on the road,

1417
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:32.290
when we go and travel,

1418
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.190
you know what a great,

1419
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.070
by the way,

1420
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.710
<v 4>what a great like travel channel chip show.</v>

1421
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:39.170
It would be David Lee Roth living in Japan.

1422
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.210
Do you know how I,

1423
00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:42.070
you know how many people would watch that now?

1424
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:42.621
Bad Ass.

1425
00:41:42.621 --> 00:41:43.160
That would be,

1426
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.700
it's a pretty colorful and a fucking great idea for a show.

1427
00:41:46.701 --> 00:41:47.900
Someone should jump on that.

1428
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:48.950
I uh,

1429
00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:50.050
get you do it.

1430
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:53.990
What'd you do a show like showing people what it's like to live in Japan.

1431
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.910
She superstar Rockstar all of a sudden living in Tokyo and apartment taking

1432
00:41:58.911 --> 00:42:00.170

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:03.523
pretty awesome.

1435
00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.073
Yeah.

1436
00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.290
<v 4>It's a lot better than fucking storage.</v>

1437
00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:09.963
<v 5>No</v>

1438
00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.090
<v 4>watching people bid on things.</v>

1439
00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:13.141
Fuck.

1440
00:42:13.141 --> 00:42:13.651
Is that,

1441
00:42:13.651 --> 00:42:14.340
yeah.

1442
00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:14.730
Do you know,

1443
00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:18.510

1444

1445
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.160
Konishi the one of the greatest sumo fighters of all time.

1446
00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:29.123
Wow.

1447
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:29.581
You is.

1448
00:42:29.581 --> 00:42:32.310
If you get on the Google web here,

1449
00:42:32.311 --> 00:42:33.540
you'll find him couldn't he?

1450
00:42:33.541 --> 00:42:34.141
She kinda,

1451
00:42:34.141 --> 00:42:35.430

1452
00:42:35.431 --> 00:42:35.880
uh,

1453
00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:40.880
he was one of the first outside is Hawaiian to come in and start fighting.

1454
00:42:41.221 --> 00:42:44.550
This was about 20 summers ago and uh,

1455
00:42:44.551 --> 00:42:46.410
his fighting weight was 600 pounds.

1456
00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:47.690
Yeah.

1457
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.950
Way.

1458
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:49.260
Do you see some pictures of it?

1459
00:42:49.261 --> 00:42:50.160
He's winning and he's been,

1460
00:42:50.161 --> 00:42:51.240
he's a national hero.

1461
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.180
He does all kinds of ads for everything,

1462
00:42:54.181 --> 00:42:54.541
you know,

1463
00:42:54.541 --> 00:42:56.470
for airplanes and it's,

1464
00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:57.110
you know,

1465
00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:59.680
the seven 11 and you know,

1466
00:42:59.681 --> 00:43:00.810
and kids stuff.

1467
00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:02.830
He has his own show television show.

1468
00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:03.300
I went.

1469
00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:03.601
Yeah,

1470
00:43:03.601 --> 00:43:04.770
I remember hearing about him.

1471
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:05.640
There you go.

1472
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.290
How much does he weigh now that he's retired?

1473
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.330
There's just a lot of ways.

1474
00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:10.410
It looks like he's about 300.

1475
00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:11.970
Wow.

1476
00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:12.301
Yeah,

1477
00:43:12.301 --> 00:43:13.530
it's still a big giant dude.

1478
00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:13.741
Oh,

1479
00:43:13.741 --> 00:43:15.270
he's the winning his guy ever.

1480
00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:19.380
He stayed when he first got on the plane and you know,

1481
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:21.300
these guys are never supposed to win.

1482
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:22.290
And uh,

1483
00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.060
he went 23 times in a row.

1484
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.610
How crazy is it that you could lose 300 pounds?

1485
00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:29.643
<v 5>I mean,</v>

1486
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:31.150
how crazy is it that you,

1487
00:43:31.151 --> 00:43:31.440
she can

1488
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.610
<v 4>eat like that?</v>

1489
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.440
That would be glorious man.

1490
00:43:34.441 --> 00:43:36.180
Can you imagine anything you want?

1491
00:43:36.181 --> 00:43:38.880
Basically while they reco heaviest,

1492
00:43:38.881 --> 00:43:39.161
high,

1493
00:43:39.161 --> 00:43:41.340
most high cower shit they can get in their bodies,

1494
00:43:41.341 --> 00:43:41.670
right.

1495
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:42.040
Well,

1496
00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:46.020
I not only took me or down to the tournament.

1497
00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:46.681
Okay.

1498
00:43:46.681 --> 00:43:47.850
Which is called the boss show,

1499
00:43:47.851 --> 00:43:48.780
the huge tournament,

1500
00:43:48.781 --> 00:43:50.520
which takes place in the sports arena.

1501
00:43:50.521 --> 00:43:52.530
This is where we play the rock and roll bands play.

1502
00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:53.731
But uh,

1503
00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:58.050
we went to the gym where all the beginners are working.

1504
00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:03.330
You follow all of all of these farm kids who are like in their early twenties.

1505
00:44:03.331 --> 00:44:03.511
It's,

1506
00:44:03.511 --> 00:44:08.511
think of it like a special forces live together as a fraternity kind of a thing.

1507
00:44:09.391 --> 00:44:10.320
And that's how these,

1508
00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:11.700
they were called Rick Sheet.

1509
00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:13.770
The wrestlers start off on that.

1510
00:44:13.771 --> 00:44:14.460
Even the,

1511
00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.010
even the referees start when they're 15,

1512
00:44:17.011 --> 00:44:19.490
16 years old and uh,

1513
00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.820
we went and uh,

1514
00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:25.140
had what they eat and you know what the trick is to gaining weight if you really

1515
00:44:25.141 --> 00:44:25.831
want to be three,

1516
00:44:25.831 --> 00:44:26.070
four,

1517
00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:28.680
500 pounds is don't eat breakfast,

1518
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:30.750
don't eat breakfast.

1519
00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:31.540
Yep.

1520
00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:36.130
Cause your body after about three days we'll figure this out and it'll slow at

1521
00:44:36.131 --> 00:44:40.780
this metabolism down so that when you finally do eat lunch,

1522
00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:42.610
you'll get real tired.

1523
00:44:42.611 --> 00:44:46.570
You got to take a nap and your body is working real slow.

1524
00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:49.930
You follow so it doesn't burn the food.

1525
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:51.063
Uh,

1526
00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:55.390
it doesn't burn it off a super quick and you'll gain weight a lot,

1527
00:44:55.391 --> 00:44:56.224
lot faster.

1528
00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.330
That's the ticket to growing up like a sumo plans.

1529
00:44:59.331 --> 00:45:01.030
So they have a strategy to win,

1530
00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:04.030
need strategy to slow your metabolism down.

1531
00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:04.540
Correct.

1532
00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:07.570
They have like an anti athlete strategy that will yes,

1533
00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:10.620
yes.

1534
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:10.840
No,

1535
00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.411
that is their,

1536
00:45:11.411 --> 00:45:12.280
that is their way.

1537
00:45:12.281 --> 00:45:13.390
That is the technique.

1538
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.040
They don't eat until about,

1539
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:15.880
uh,

1540
00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:16.713
12 o'clock.

1541
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.561
And then they,

1542
00:45:17.561 --> 00:45:21.760
and they eat about 10,000 calories in that one meal and then they go to sleep

1543
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:26.200
and then they wake up again and then later on at dinner about another 10,000

1544
00:45:26.201 --> 00:45:27.034
calorie meal.

1545
00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:29.860
How much health repercussions to those guys suffer?

1546
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.753
Huge.

1547
00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:31.630
Huge.

1548
00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:31.871
Yeah.

1549
00:45:31.871 --> 00:45:33.820
You can't escape the cheeseburger man.

1550
00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:35.853
But uh,

1551
00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:36.701
that's a,

1552
00:45:36.701 --> 00:45:39.340
that is the weight gain ticket.

1553
00:45:39.341 --> 00:45:41.200
If you want to start gaining weight quickly,

1554
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.850
skip breakfast,

1555
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.570
wait until about noon and then you can eat all that you want.

1556
00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.240
If you want to be assumed.

1557
00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.350
Yeah.

1558
00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:51.520
You want to get huge.

1559
00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:52.931
And uh,

1560
00:45:52.931 --> 00:45:55.510
and some of those catch are huge.

1561
00:45:55.511 --> 00:45:56.470
Oh my God.

1562
00:45:56.471 --> 00:45:57.251
This is like a wall,

1563
00:45:57.251 --> 00:45:58.120
a piece of wall.

1564
00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.140
You enjoy watching.

1565
00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.130
Is it fun to watch?

1566
00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:00.851
Oh Man.

1567
00:46:00.851 --> 00:46:04.210
Well once you get to know some of the guys cause they're like,

1568
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:06.640
like the wrestlers we would know here,

1569
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:07.330
you know,

1570
00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:08.350
some guys are,

1571
00:46:08.351 --> 00:46:09.010
um,

1572
00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:09.641
for example,

1573
00:46:09.641 --> 00:46:11.800
when they throw the salt you dig.

1574
00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:14.320
That's like to purify the grounds.

1575
00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:15.790
But this show Biz involve,

1576
00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:19.120
one guy takes it and he's throws it,

1577
00:46:19.121 --> 00:46:20.020
but he doesn't look.

1578
00:46:20.021 --> 00:46:21.250
It's kind of like a way of saying,

1579
00:46:21.251 --> 00:46:24.100
screw you to the other wrestler like that,

1580
00:46:24.101 --> 00:46:25.240
which you're not supposed to do.

1581
00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:30.340
There's another guy who takes a whole scoop full of salt in his hand and he

1582
00:46:30.341 --> 00:46:33.070
throws it up in the air and he stares up into it.

1583
00:46:33.071 --> 00:46:36.280
Like Walt Disney staring into the future.

1584
00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:40.330
And it did kind of a thing that he does.

1585
00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:43.300
And then there's another cat who takes two little pinches,

1586
00:46:43.301 --> 00:46:44.134
he throws it,

1587
00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:45.041
walks away,

1588
00:46:45.041 --> 00:46:45.920
then it takes another,

1589
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:49.570
he throws it and then he throws the whole fucking box

1590
00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.720
and it goes a,

1591
00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.180
that's like almost about two pounds of salt

1592
00:46:56.950 --> 00:47:00.850
and the referees act really angry and they get really pissed.

1593
00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:06.070
And the audience is full of ecstatic glee in cause he broke the rules,

1594
00:47:06.071 --> 00:47:06.821
you know?

1595
00:47:06.821 --> 00:47:08.400
And that's a Larry.

1596
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:09.263
Oh yeah.

1597
00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:09.990
And there,

1598
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:12.520
there are some guys who are technicians,

1599
00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:13.091
you know,

1600
00:47:13.091 --> 00:47:13.990
in terms of,

1601
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:16.023
<v 6>um,</v>

1602
00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:18.450
uh,

1603
00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:19.410
<v 4>fighters.</v>

1604
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:19.920
Okay.

1605
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:20.280
You know,

1606
00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.270
think like judo.

1607
00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.370
There are other guys who,

1608
00:47:23.371 --> 00:47:24.150
uh,

1609
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.540
like,

1610
00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:25.170
uh,

1611
00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.060
[inaudible] here was describing,

1612
00:47:27.061 --> 00:47:28.200
he knew it all from football.

1613
00:47:28.201 --> 00:47:33.201
He had been playing for a Hawaiian coaches in Hawaii.

1614
00:47:33.711 --> 00:47:33.801
He,

1615
00:47:33.801 --> 00:47:35.530
since he was in grade school glue,

1616
00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:40.530
clearly a kid built like that was playing defensive tackle,

1617
00:47:40.531 --> 00:47:41.490
defensive guard,

1618
00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:41.971
defensive,

1619
00:47:41.971 --> 00:47:44.880
everything from the time he was a toddler.

1620
00:47:44.881 --> 00:47:46.590
They put him in a football uniform,

1621
00:47:46.591 --> 00:47:46.861
you know,

1622
00:47:46.861 --> 00:47:47.694
in grade school.

1623
00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:48.923
And uh,

1624
00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:50.580
so he learned all of his balance.

1625
00:47:50.581 --> 00:47:52.020
He learned all of his agility,

1626
00:47:52.021 --> 00:47:52.291
you know,

1627
00:47:52.291 --> 00:47:54.180
moving side to side lateral movement,

1628
00:47:54.181 --> 00:47:55.470
responding to a coaches,

1629
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:56.341
you know,

1630
00:47:56.341 --> 00:47:57.360
Q and you know,

1631
00:47:57.361 --> 00:47:58.380
learning plays,

1632
00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:00.300
how to work with a team and Cetera,

1633
00:48:00.301 --> 00:48:01.134
cetera.

1634
00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.093
And um,

1635
00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:03.803
uh,

1636
00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:04.681
so you know,

1637
00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:06.330
when he stepped into the ring,

1638
00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.171
so to speak,

1639
00:48:07.171 --> 00:48:12.090
he was using football on these guys and he didn't even use the basic,

1640
00:48:12.091 --> 00:48:14.430
where you put both hands on the ground,

1641
00:48:14.431 --> 00:48:16.260
you well know that sumo session.

1642
00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:20.690
The idea in that is that you want to get bulldog low so that you come,

1643
00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:25.720
you dip down and come up under like in a scrum like in rugby or a Jujitsu.

1644
00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.910
Do you want to be the one who gets up under right.

1645
00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:30.421
And you know,

1646
00:48:30.421 --> 00:48:32.250
he'd get you get to the knees first,

1647
00:48:32.251 --> 00:48:34.500
what come in as low as you possibly can.

1648
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:35.783
And uh,

1649
00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.140
he never bothered to do that,

1650
00:48:37.141 --> 00:48:38.880
which infuriated everybody

1651
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.620
<v 2>caused a big stir.</v>

1652
00:48:40.621 --> 00:48:44.430
Is it legal to start without both hands in the dirt?

1653
00:48:44.431 --> 00:48:45.001
We don't know.

1654
00:48:45.001 --> 00:48:47.420
Nobody's ever tried it and there were still,

1655
00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:50.580
that's so crazy.

1656
00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:51.241
Oh yeah.

1657
00:48:51.241 --> 00:48:56.241
And there's placards outside and demonstrations where we can't allow outsiders

1658
00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:59.310
into our national sport,

1659
00:48:59.311 --> 00:48:59.851
you know,

1660
00:48:59.851 --> 00:49:04.851
but the national sport is gonna pass away unless we have outsiders and you know,

1661
00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:06.330
it's great show business.

1662
00:49:06.331 --> 00:49:07.740
So what is his stance?

1663
00:49:07.741 --> 00:49:11.310
How does he enter if he doesn't have two hands touching the ground,

1664
00:49:11.311 --> 00:49:12.130
what does he do?

1665
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:12.840
Like a different,

1666
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:17.400
like a defensive tackle or a guard where he just kind of get your,

1667
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:18.390
get down low

1668
00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:23.360
<v 4>and you get your wrist on one knee and then the middle of your forearm on the a,</v>

1669
00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:23.861
they're like,

1670
00:49:23.861 --> 00:49:26.950
you're going to come up under with that shoulder pretty familiar,

1671
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:27.670
you know,

1672
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:29.200
basic football,

1673
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:29.891
you know,

1674
00:49:29.891 --> 00:49:31.360
posture kind of a thing.

1675
00:49:31.361 --> 00:49:32.860
But in the sumo world,

1676
00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.870
well is that legal?

1677
00:49:34.871 --> 00:49:37.510
Aren't you supposed to touch the ground when he did touch the ground,

1678
00:49:37.511 --> 00:49:42.400
but now he's doing the whole wine lean and now you have kids more importantly

1679
00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:46.410
all over the country imitating and outsider.

1680
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.313
Yeah.

1681
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:48.101
They're,

1682
00:49:48.101 --> 00:49:48.431
you know,

1683
00:49:48.431 --> 00:49:49.660
they're doing the Hawaiian,

1684
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:54.950
<v 2>it's sorta like Teebo when he gets down on one knee and then these kids in high</v>

1685
00:49:54.951 --> 00:49:55.381
school,

1686
00:49:55.381 --> 00:49:56.610
they're imitating a virgin.

1687
00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.593
It's really similar.

1688
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.320
It's like you don't want you to like,

1689
00:50:01.321 --> 00:50:01.770
Hey,

1690
00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:02.491
you cut that out.

1691
00:50:02.491 --> 00:50:04.410
You fucked not that guy.

1692
00:50:04.411 --> 00:50:05.310
Exactly.

1693
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.240
Exactly.

1694
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:07.160
That's not your hair out.

1695
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.430
Got,

1696
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:08.263
dammit.

1697
00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:10.440
That's a kneeling virgin.

1698
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:11.783
And uh,

1699
00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.360
he was not slated,

1700
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:13.420
painted

1701
00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.650
<v 4>dwin right away what she started doing.</v>

1702
00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:16.731
Cause you know,

1703
00:50:16.731 --> 00:50:19.100
a lot of these kids who start off in sumo,

1704
00:50:19.101 --> 00:50:21.620
they're farm kids and they don't have any real,

1705
00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.330
it'll sporting skills.

1706
00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:23.871
You know,

1707
00:50:23.871 --> 00:50:25.230
they've seen it on TV.

1708
00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:26.183
Just strong.

1709
00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:26.750
Yeah.

1710
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:27.350
You know,

1711
00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:28.880
strong and a,

1712
00:50:28.881 --> 00:50:32.000
they'll come down and they'll start living at the stables,

1713
00:50:32.001 --> 00:50:33.260
like boxing stables,

1714
00:50:33.261 --> 00:50:33.680
you know,

1715
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.513
it's what it's called.

1716
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.100
Did you ever see a mixed martial arts event in Japan?

1717
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:38.210
No,

1718
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:39.043
I never have.

1719
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.210
I've seen,

1720
00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:41.750
I've seen a thousand of them.

1721
00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:42.830
Uh,

1722
00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:43.071
you know,

1723
00:50:43.071 --> 00:50:46.220
on television there was a huge one last weekend.

1724
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:48.680
Vandelay Silva just fought out of this guy,

1725
00:50:48.681 --> 00:50:50.930
Brian Stann last weekend in Japan.

1726
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.471
You know what?

1727
00:50:51.471 --> 00:50:53.930
I saw it on the cover of Metropole magazine,

1728
00:50:53.931 --> 00:50:55.580
which is one of the magazines that,

1729
00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:55.980
you know,

1730
00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:56.870
there's the uh,

1731
00:50:57.030 --> 00:51:00.660
is the for English spoken whatnot.

1732
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.450
I saw them on the cover and whatnot.

1733
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:03.350
How long were they there?

1734
00:51:03.351 --> 00:51:04.310
Just for one weekend.

1735
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:04.701
Yeah.

1736
00:51:04.701 --> 00:51:05.960
It was just one night of fights.

1737
00:51:05.961 --> 00:51:06.501
But the,

1738
00:51:06.501 --> 00:51:08.360
the audience is so interesting.

1739
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.560
Like what Brian,

1740
00:51:09.561 --> 00:51:09.741
you,

1741
00:51:09.741 --> 00:51:13.300
you've experienced that when you went to the UFC there they'd clap and there is

1742
00:51:13.301 --> 00:51:14.134
so polite.

1743
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.550
They're very quiet while the fights are going on.

1744
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.800
And the anything technical that happens,

1745
00:51:18.801 --> 00:51:20.810
like a reversal escape,

1746
00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:22.550
like anything where a lot of people wouldn't cheer.

1747
00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:23.563
They like,

1748
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.910
they're like anything where you progress.

1749
00:51:25.911 --> 00:51:27.470
Like you passed the half guard.

1750
00:51:27.471 --> 00:51:28.070
He's in the mouth.

1751
00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:28.903
Oh they get,

1752
00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:29.923
they're very polite.

1753
00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.950
<v 1>That's really the only people yelling.</v>

1754
00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:35.010
I would like look back to see who was yelling cause there's like only a couple

1755
00:51:35.011 --> 00:51:35.640
and then you would see,

1756
00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.930
oh it's just US military.

1757
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.983
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1758
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:40.810
Get us anywhere.

1759
00:51:40.811 --> 00:51:42.430
We like kick his fucking ass.

1760
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:45.941
<v 4>Beautiful legs don't,</v>

1761
00:51:45.941 --> 00:51:46.251
we're like,

1762
00:51:46.251 --> 00:51:47.270
what the fuck man.

1763
00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:48.950
Totally not observing.

1764
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.280
No.

1765
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.640
You're describing something that is absolutely accurate.

1766
00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:54.800
Absolutely accurate.

1767
00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:56.173
Um,

1768
00:51:57.230 --> 00:52:00.770
I was just on the phone with Alex Van Halen and talking to you have about,

1769
00:52:00.771 --> 00:52:03.470
we're going to be playing at the Tokyo Dome work,

1770
00:52:03.471 --> 00:52:04.760
playing at the big arenas.

1771
00:52:04.761 --> 00:52:05.780
They're in Japan.

1772
00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:11.110
And I wanted to remind him of exactly what you just described that in the United

1773
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:17.360
States and in Europe you have what's like an idling cheer,

1774
00:52:17.361 --> 00:52:18.230
a scream.

1775
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.140
It's constant like a car idling.

1776
00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:22.070
Yeah.

1777
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:22.903
Idols.

1778
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:24.230
Like a drag racer.

1779
00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:25.660
Pluto to be bad.

1780
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:30.730
Like you depend on it the way you do your Spiel,

1781
00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:31.401
your talk,

1782
00:52:31.401 --> 00:52:32.600
your punctuation,

1783
00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.501
you know,

1784
00:52:33.501 --> 00:52:34.334
the delay.

1785
00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:34.760
Speeding,

1786
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.650
putting you,

1787
00:52:36.651 --> 00:52:37.520
let them go,

1788
00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:37.851
you know,

1789
00:52:37.851 --> 00:52:41.570
when do you sit down now say the next thing that you're going to say,

1790
00:52:41.571 --> 00:52:42.404
you know,

1791
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.980
um,

1792
00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.820
so you're listening with that and uh,

1793
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:47.960
when Americans cheer,

1794
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:48.590
there's,

1795
00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:49.670
it's like a car like,

1796
00:52:49.671 --> 00:52:51.250
well I think it's called blower wine,

1797
00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.333
<v 7>right?</v>

1798
00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:56.053
Right.

1799
00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.290
<v 4>And it goes for a long time.</v>

1800
00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.980
And if you're waiting like to say something next or whatever,

1801
00:53:02.981 --> 00:53:06.820
you're listening for that and you're listening for it to hit a certain point

1802
00:53:06.821 --> 00:53:07.780
volume wise,

1803
00:53:07.781 --> 00:53:09.970
your duration wise that you didn't,

1804
00:53:09.971 --> 00:53:11.950
didn't know interrupt.

1805
00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:15.570
Now it's a little bit like a dance otherwise.

1806
00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:18.010
And if people are making the long noise,

1807
00:53:18.011 --> 00:53:19.050
they enjoy themselves,

1808
00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:19.391
great.

1809
00:53:19.391 --> 00:53:20.770
Let them enjoy themselves.

1810
00:53:20.771 --> 00:53:20.970
You know,

1811
00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:21.160
they're,

1812
00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.930
they love hearing their own power.

1813
00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:25.210
Yes we are strong or a wonderful,

1814
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:26.400
we're young and skinny,

1815
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:31.410
<v 2>whatever is that night in Japan,</v>

1816
00:53:31.411 --> 00:53:33.000
you don't get that correct.

1817
00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.620
<v 4>It's sort of like a cheering for the ball,</v>

1818
00:53:39.621 --> 00:53:41.510
getting spiked in a volleyball tournament.

1819
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:43.160
And it's quick,

1820
00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:44.420
very quick.

1821
00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:45.470
And I had said to Al,

1822
00:53:45.471 --> 00:53:46.550
you got to remember,

1823
00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:51.580
think back how fast the cheer is here that we can't depend on that idling

1824
00:53:52.011 --> 00:53:52.761
stream.

1825
00:53:52.761 --> 00:53:53.551
And you know,

1826
00:53:53.551 --> 00:53:58.551
and the comedy show and be weird where we get it laughing.

1827
00:53:58.851 --> 00:54:00.430
Like you know,

1828
00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.330
I call it rat pack style,

1829
00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:02.631
but it's,

1830
00:54:02.631 --> 00:54:07.631
it's just where made a connection with the audience and pretty much no matter

1831
00:54:08.211 --> 00:54:09.320
what you say,

1832
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:14.170
as long as it's delivered in the right tone with the right mood is you're a

1833
00:54:14.171 --> 00:54:14.780
host,

1834
00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:15.170
right?

1835
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:18.050
The worst that I can be on stage is a host.

1836
00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:23.380
The best is a really funny host or a really smart homes there.

1837
00:54:24.111 --> 00:54:24.944
They'd have fun.

1838
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:26.570
You're there to help them.

1839
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:27.500
Exactly.

1840
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:32.530
So the worst that the least I can do is be a good host in that means keep the

1841
00:54:33.381 --> 00:54:33.980
spirit,

1842
00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:34.690
you know,

1843
00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:34.920
tell,

1844
00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:35.500
you know,

1845
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:35.650
may,

1846
00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:37.010
especially if something goes wrong,

1847
00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:37.641
oh my God,

1848
00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:38.930
the plumbing just exploded.

1849
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:40.023
<v 2>Cry.</v>

1850
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:43.710
<v 4>But dude,</v>

1851
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:44.850
everybody's instantly,

1852
00:54:44.851 --> 00:54:45.271
okay,

1853
00:54:45.271 --> 00:54:45.571
great.

1854
00:54:45.571 --> 00:54:46.500
It's an adventure,

1855
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:47.341
you know,

1856
00:54:47.341 --> 00:54:48.174
as opposed to,

1857
00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:49.290
Oh shit.

1858
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:50.310
Gotta no,

1859
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:50.610
no,

1860
00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:51.180
that's,

1861
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.013
that's horrible.

1862
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:53.070
Oh my God,

1863
00:54:53.071 --> 00:54:54.180
this is now does it.

1864
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:55.050
I don't want to be here.

1865
00:54:55.051 --> 00:54:55.890
This isn't fun.

1866
00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:59.910
This is now turning into something other than that's up to the host,

1867
00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:00.780
right?

1868
00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:01.613
A good night.

1869
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:06.890
If you get everybody kind of humming and bubbling and well fed and watered and

1870
00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.233
you know,

1871
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:09.083
then uh,

1872
00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.030
pretty much anything you say can be a little bit funny.

1873
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.250
And every now and then I hit a moment.

1874
00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:14.610
What?

1875
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:16.770
I'm just Sammy Davis.

1876
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.190
<v 2>Did you ever do work at all?</v>

1877
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.900
You were done just straight stand up.

1878
00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:26.640
Ever tried to do that?

1879
00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.410
Ever have never heard of it at all?

1880
00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:28.621
Yeah,

1881
00:55:28.621 --> 00:55:29.550
I don't think I have.

1882
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:30.630
I don't have a dining.

1883
00:55:30.631 --> 00:55:31.920
I got the guards for it.

1884
00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:33.520
It's crazy because you,

1885
00:55:33.521 --> 00:55:35.940
you kind of do it a little on stage.

1886
00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:36.360
Yes.

1887
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:41.360
I just a tiny bit and enough to sneak up and tap the door and run back,

1888
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:42.343
you know?

1889
00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:43.440
Yeah.

1890
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.970
And immediately hit the music boy.

1891
00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:50.810
I always have those trapdoors built every like fuel.

1892
00:55:50.811 --> 00:55:52.140
It's the freaking cat.

1893
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:57.090
I can draw that door anywhere on thin air and go look a song

1894
00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:02.250
about that fucking sick I just laid out there.

1895
00:56:02.251 --> 00:56:02.610
Yeah,

1896
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.520
you guys don't have that doors.

1897
00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:06.800
<v 4>But all of my,</v>

1898
00:56:06.801 --> 00:56:07.550
uh,

1899
00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:11.000
greatest respects to the job you have chosen.

1900
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:11.750
Uh,

1901
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:13.400
for me there's always,

1902
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:16.640
it doesn't even have to wind up funny for me.

1903
00:56:16.641 --> 00:56:19.880
It doesn't even have to wind up clever or anything.

1904
00:56:19.881 --> 00:56:21.050
Just shut up.

1905
00:56:21.051 --> 00:56:21.471
Dave B,

1906
00:56:21.471 --> 00:56:22.070
the host,

1907
00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:24.270
when I first met at the comedy store

1908
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.133
<v 0>was when,</v>

1909
00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:25.710
um,

1910
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:28.320
you weren't with van Halen anymore.

1911
00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:29.011
You were,

1912
00:56:29.011 --> 00:56:30.450
you were on your own then.

1913
00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.050
And uh,

1914
00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:33.780
being back is,

1915
00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.190
it's gotta be a trip.

1916
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.380
I mean to,

1917
00:56:36.381 --> 00:56:38.880
you guys were separated for so long.

1918
00:56:38.881 --> 00:56:41.100
They tried two different lead singers,

1919
00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:42.001
you know,

1920
00:56:42.001 --> 00:56:44.040
I mean the Sammy Hagar thing,

1921
00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:46.080
a lot of people like that,

1922
00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:48.330
but to me it wasn't van Halen.

1923
00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:48.811
It was like,

1924
00:56:48.811 --> 00:56:52.950
this is just a whole nother band that Eddie van Halen is playing guitar and you

1925
00:56:52.951 --> 00:56:54.190
can't call this van Halen.

1926
00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.053
That's crazy.

1927
00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.600
Because the sound was so different.

1928
00:56:57.810 --> 00:56:59.430
The songs were so different.

1929
00:56:59.431 --> 00:57:00.930
The tone was so different.

1930
00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:01.771
It was like,

1931
00:57:01.771 --> 00:57:06.120
all of a sudden it was like overweight drunk girls music.

1932
00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:07.170
It was like,

1933
00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:07.740
I didn't,

1934
00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:08.521
I didn't like it.

1935
00:57:08.521 --> 00:57:08.851
It was,

1936
00:57:08.851 --> 00:57:09.684
it was,

1937
00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.610
you know what I'm saying?

1938
00:57:10.611 --> 00:57:11.050
It,

1939
00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:16.050
it seemed to me to be like a completely different kind of a band and then they

1940
00:57:17.611 --> 00:57:19.200
tried it with the extreme guy.

1941
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:21.840
What's his name I'm taking,

1942
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:23.460
is that a point you're making?

1943
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:26.790
Is that the guy that was seen from extreme,

1944
00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:28.140
I remember,

1945
00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:29.243
um,

1946
00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:30.031
continue.

1947
00:57:30.031 --> 00:57:31.050
I'll think of it in a second.

1948
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:33.420
And then they go from that then.

1949
00:57:33.421 --> 00:57:35.820
Then somehow or another you guys get back together again.

1950
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:37.951
Well that's,

1951
00:57:37.951 --> 00:57:38.761
you know the,

1952
00:57:38.761 --> 00:57:40.380
it's like a football movie,

1953
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.410
right?

1954
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:42.540
It's kind of crazy.

1955
00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:48.050
But that's kind of be a really weird feeling to see them have this great success

1956
00:57:49.021 --> 00:57:50.040
with Sammy Hagar.

1957
00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:51.510
Go out into the world,

1958
00:57:51.511 --> 00:57:54.450
continued touring and then that doesn't work out.

1959
00:57:54.451 --> 00:57:59.451
Or they stopped that and then this other guy and they stopped that and then all

1960
00:57:59.521 --> 00:58:02.820
of a sudden you're on fucking stage again and your,

1961
00:58:02.821 --> 00:58:03.240
your,

1962
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:03.720
your,

1963
00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:05.220
your van Halen again.

1964
00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:06.660
The real van Halen.

1965
00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:07.680
Not Fan Hagar,

1966
00:58:07.681 --> 00:58:08.910
the real van Halen

1967
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:10.660
<v 4>and the blue and the band is booming.</v>

1968
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:12.040
Everybody is lucid.

1969
00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:13.830
<v 0>Not Sober but lucid.</v>

1970
00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:15.323
That's all you need

1971
00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:18.240
in a court of law.

1972
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:19.200
I'll settle for lucid,

1973
00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:21.180
for van Halen.

1974
00:58:21.181 --> 00:58:25.570
I myself am lucid for real van Halen fans like me.

1975
00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:27.090
When I heard that you were back with them,

1976
00:58:27.091 --> 00:58:30.910
it made me so happy because I enjoy your solo stuff and I,

1977
00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:33.420
I enjoy some of their music.

1978
00:58:33.421 --> 00:58:34.890
Even with Sammy Hagar,

1979
00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:36.930
but it wasn't the same together.

1980
00:58:36.931 --> 00:58:41.931
You guys were like this crazy mixture of all the right ingredients,

1981
00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.360
you know,

1982
00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.360
<v 4>those ingredients are from right around the corner.</v>

1983
00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:46.830
We started talking about,

1984
00:58:46.831 --> 00:58:47.220
you know,

1985
00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:47.880
I was in,

1986
00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:49.170
I was in the busing program,

1987
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:53.790
which was all black and Spanish speaking classes for junior high,

1988
00:58:53.791 --> 00:58:54.624
high school.

1989
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:55.730
And uh,

1990
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:56.790
it more importantly,

1991
00:58:56.791 --> 00:59:01.680
the youth club dance every Friday night or one Friday per month.

1992
00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:02.940
And the,

1993
00:59:02.941 --> 00:59:04.200
all the celebration,

1994
00:59:04.201 --> 00:59:04.471
you know,

1995
00:59:04.471 --> 00:59:06.780
the homecoming class,

1996
00:59:06.781 --> 00:59:07.261
dance,

1997
00:59:07.261 --> 00:59:08.094
et Cetera,

1998
00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:12.300
for me and my sisters was all black and Spanish speaking.

1999
00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:13.291
When,

2000
00:59:13.291 --> 00:59:16.010
when we got graduation it was a,

2001
00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.790
they played Santana on a loop.

2002
00:59:17.791 --> 00:59:19.430
Some of potty over at

2003
00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:21.900
<v 0>Eh,</v>

2004
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:24.163
<v 4>did you do</v>

2005
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:26.563
over and over.

2006
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.340
The van Halen went to,

2007
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:30.080
she go Pasadena High School,

2008
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:32.120
which was walking distance from me,

2009
00:59:32.121 --> 00:59:36.380
but I had to get on that bus and there was go all Ridgemont high.

2010
00:59:36.381 --> 00:59:37.670
That was deep purple,

2011
00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:40.560
black Sabbath led Zeppelin,

2012
00:59:40.561 --> 00:59:41.061
the movie.

2013
00:59:41.061 --> 00:59:42.530
Fast Times at Ridgemont high.

2014
00:59:42.531 --> 00:59:43.430
Exactly.

2015
00:59:43.431 --> 00:59:44.091
Exactly.

2016
00:59:44.091 --> 00:59:44.680
That,

2017
00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.380
uh,

2018
00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:46.700
that neighbor white people.

2019
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:47.510
Exactly.

2020
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:49.070
So when we got together,

2021
00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:49.340
you know,

2022
00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.151
first off they'd say,

2023
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:50.601
look at him.

2024
00:59:50.601 --> 00:59:52.370
He sparkles like a diamond because you know,

2025
00:59:52.371 --> 00:59:54.470
I had suspenders in two toned shoes,

2026
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:57.980
as much brill cream in my hair is I could get to hold,

2027
00:59:57.981 --> 00:59:58.814
you know,

2028
00:59:58.920 --> 00:59:59.870
and uh,

2029
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.580
that's where the diamond Dave came from,

2030
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.420
you know?

2031
01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:03.253
And uh,

2032
01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.820
so when we got together,

2033
01:00:04.821 --> 01:00:05.401
I shed him.

2034
01:00:05.401 --> 01:00:07.400
He's the reason that uh,

2035
01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:09.520
we're having trouble getting club gigs.

2036
01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.140
It's not girl friendly.

2037
01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:12.100
You can't dance to them.

2038
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:13.303
You know,

2039
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.710
you can't play highway star by a deep

2040
01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:17.330
<v 2>[inaudible] did,</v>

2041
01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.300
it did,

2042
01:00:18.301 --> 01:00:18.930
it did.

2043
01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:20.400
<v 4>And that's not dance music.</v>

2044
01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.460
Anything over about 128 beats a minute.

2045
01:00:23.461 --> 01:00:24.450
You start spilling,

2046
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.710
you're out of your drink.

2047
01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:26.623
You're doing.

2048
01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:27.870
And uh,

2049
01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.760
so if you look back now,

2050
01:00:29.761 --> 01:00:32.040
jump ahead to all the van Halen.

2051
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:35.280
Familiars the big 15 or whatever you want to call it,

2052
01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:36.241
jump.

2053
01:00:36.241 --> 01:00:37.620
You're really got me,

2054
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.730
uh,

2055
01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:39.770
running with the devil.

2056
01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:43.980
I was dancing and they're all about a hundred to 128 beats a minute.

2057
01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:46.290
Coincidence perhaps.

2058
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:52.080
<v 0>So you are constrained correctly is what you're saying.</v>

2059
01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:56.100
It was the perfect combination of you getting together with these white people

2060
01:00:56.101 --> 01:00:56.371
and say,

2061
01:00:56.371 --> 01:00:56.851
listen,

2062
01:00:56.851 --> 01:00:58.230
it's a lot of folks like to dance.

2063
01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:58.890
Hello.

2064
01:00:58.890 --> 01:00:59.610
Yes.

2065
01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:03.090
It was a perfect collision course of this wasn't just that.

2066
01:01:03.091 --> 01:01:03.361
It was,

2067
01:01:03.361 --> 01:01:03.781
it was,

2068
01:01:03.781 --> 01:01:04.020
uh,

2069
01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.310
your voice with his me.

2070
01:01:05.311 --> 01:01:06.061
It was perfect.

2071
01:01:06.061 --> 01:01:06.361
You know,

2072
01:01:06.361 --> 01:01:09.570
it's like you guys were an amazing band for a long time.

2073
01:01:09.571 --> 01:01:10.500
When I was in high school,

2074
01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.410
my sister's boyfriend had van Halen as his license plate.

2075
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.990
I forget how we had it to bring it down to the right number.

2076
01:01:15.991 --> 01:01:17.490
Like v and H,

2077
01:01:17.491 --> 01:01:18.121
y,

2078
01:01:18.121 --> 01:01:18.481
l,

2079
01:01:18.481 --> 01:01:18.760
e,

2080
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.100
you know,

2081
01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.340
I don't know how he did it,

2082
01:01:20.341 --> 01:01:22.770
but everybody was a huge van Halen,

2083
01:01:22.771 --> 01:01:23.700
freaking my high school.

2084
01:01:23.701 --> 01:01:24.960
They were always writing those,

2085
01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:26.580
the VH with all the,

2086
01:01:26.581 --> 01:01:27.414
you know,

2087
01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.350
like a political logos everywhere.

2088
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.660
Yeah.

2089
01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.211
It was your,

2090
01:01:30.211 --> 01:01:30.451
yeah,

2091
01:01:30.451 --> 01:01:31.284
that logo was,

2092
01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:33.510
people would draw that on the back of desks.

2093
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:35.010
You would find it on lockers.

2094
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.551
You know,

2095
01:01:35.551 --> 01:01:36.330
you've lived a,

2096
01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:38.040
that's a crazy,

2097
01:01:38.041 --> 01:01:38.910
crazy life,

2098
01:01:38.911 --> 01:01:39.744
man.

2099
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.390
<v 4>Well,</v>

2100
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:41.141
we have a crazy,

2101
01:01:41.141 --> 01:01:46.141
crazy audience and I've used this crazy bands as a passport to go out and visit

2102
01:01:46.211 --> 01:01:48.580
with and to come and,

2103
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:52.600
and be part of my pop spent the last 25 years of his career,

2104
01:01:52.601 --> 01:01:55.720
he was a surgeon and working in the prison system,

2105
01:01:56.410 --> 01:02:01.410
like a San Quentin and Folsom and Pelican Bay and off Ivy League.

2106
01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:02.284
He called it.

2107
01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:03.363
And um,

2108
01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:07.600
he used to joke and he'd say that if you carry a gun to work regularly,

2109
01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:10.210
then you day no van Halen.

2110
01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:13.300
And he meant that on both sides of the bars.

2111
01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:18.460
When record came out,

2112
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:20.940
it was celebrated on both sides of the,

2113
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.370
uh,

2114
01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:22.203
the

2115
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:25.760
well you were,

2116
01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.170
what was it like to be a superstar before the Internet?

2117
01:02:28.171 --> 01:02:29.004
Two.

2118
01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:29.791
Well,

2119
01:02:29.791 --> 01:02:33.810
that's an interesting case because you probably the biggest prayer before you go

2120
01:02:33.811 --> 01:02:36.140
on stage these days would,

2121
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:40.380
would be a god grant us,

2122
01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.273
uh,

2123
01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:45.060
the powers and the drive and the focus that compelled those before us.

2124
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:48.930
Who did all of this before there was a microphone before there was a camera

2125
01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.820
taking a picture of what we do.

2126
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.021
Think about,

2127
01:02:52.021 --> 01:02:52.854
you know,

2128
01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:53.790
broadcasting,

2129
01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:55.740
what wha what would have been broadcasting.

2130
01:02:55.741 --> 01:02:58.560
I would have been on a stage with a guitar but no microphones,

2131
01:02:59.040 --> 01:02:59.873
no lights,

2132
01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:00.480
no.

2133
01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:00.960
Uh,

2134
01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.471
candles.

2135
01:03:01.471 --> 01:03:01.860
Yeah.

2136
01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:04.170
Candles and no PA system.

2137
01:03:04.171 --> 01:03:04.710
Right.

2138
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:07.440
And not so long ago during uncle meanies life,

2139
01:03:07.441 --> 01:03:09.060
he's still with us and I'm sure you know,

2140
01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:12.210
back in the 1920s in 1930s,

2141
01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:12.660
you know,

2142
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:14.490
they didn't have microphones and stuff.

2143
01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:16.440
It didn't have a guitar,

2144
01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:17.274
amps,

2145
01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:17.941
et Cetera,

2146
01:03:17.941 --> 01:03:18.480
et cetera.

2147
01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.250
<v 0>That's a lot of folks don't understand about the,</v>

2148
01:03:20.251 --> 01:03:20.710
the,

2149
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:21.170
the,

2150
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:25.110
the phrase upstage when you say stand up stage of them,

2151
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.920
um,

2152
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.250
that means w in modern stages are flat,

2153
01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.091
but they used to go,

2154
01:03:30.091 --> 01:03:34.230
they used to like ramp up and he used to have to project out into the audience

2155
01:03:34.231 --> 01:03:34.551
cause you,

2156
01:03:34.551 --> 01:03:36.030
you weren't wearing a microphone.

2157
01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:41.060
Everybody had to be super quiet and the actor how to talk like this so the whole

2158
01:03:41.641 --> 01:03:43.320
house could hear them.

2159
01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.680
And that's where that fakes style of acting king from.

2160
01:03:46.681 --> 01:03:49.650
It's like you had to over project and no one can understand.

2161
01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:50.484
Yeah.

2162
01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:53.600
<v 4>The upside of not having PA systems you caused me to.</v>

2163
01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.420
Do you remember some good story and is for you?

2164
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:58.120
You've heard the term barrel house voice?

2165
01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:58.830
Yes.

2166
01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:00.370
Do you never wonder what it's from?

2167
01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:02.700
It's from a beer hall is you know,

2168
01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.520
full of beer,

2169
01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:08.500
beer barrels in everybody and somebody having to stand at the end of that hall

2170
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:11.890
and sing over the top of that without a PA system.

2171
01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.250
You get the big barrel house voices.

2172
01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:16.600
You know like Tina Turner,

2173
01:04:16.601 --> 01:04:18.340
maybe he has a barrel house voice.

2174
01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:21.160
Who Do we know that has a barrel house voice these days?

2175
01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:26.820
Anybody particular that we're not even throwing name after name into the circle

2176
01:04:27.941 --> 01:04:28.310
here.

2177
01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:31.900
Kelly perhaps scattered barrel house stories.

2178
01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:40.180
<v 0>You must be proud of that coming up through these little clubs and making your</v>

2179
01:04:40.181 --> 01:04:41.470
way that way,

2180
01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:41.771
you know,

2181
01:04:41.771 --> 01:04:46.771
and having these stories about back in the day when you had no stage and no PA,

2182
01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:47.501
<v 4>yeah,</v>

2183
01:04:47.501 --> 01:04:48.640
it's the golden years,

2184
01:04:48.641 --> 01:04:49.151
you know,

2185
01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:49.984
it's,

2186
01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:52.600
and you would read about that growing up.

2187
01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:52.990
You know,

2188
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.980
I didn't make it up.

2189
01:04:53.981 --> 01:04:55.270
I read about the Beatles,

2190
01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:55.601
you know,

2191
01:04:55.601 --> 01:05:00.040
move in together and having to live in broom closets in the Reeperbahn and the

2192
01:05:00.041 --> 01:05:01.810
red light district of,

2193
01:05:01.811 --> 01:05:02.020
uh,

2194
01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:02.650
Germany.

2195
01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:02.921
All right.

2196
01:05:02.921 --> 01:05:03.754
Sold.

2197
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.313
Did you expect,

2198
01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.440
<v 0>did you explain this to the,</v>

2199
01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:09.990
did you have to explain this to the rest of the band where they all aware of it

2200
01:05:09.991 --> 01:05:10.580
as well?

2201
01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:13.610
<v 4>I don't recollect if this was one of my sell jobs.</v>

2202
01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:13.850
I,

2203
01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:16.790
there were some things that I had to sell to the band,

2204
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:17.650
but,

2205
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:18.483
uh,

2206
01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:22.450
they were aware that this was part of it.

2207
01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:25.810
Their father was a traveling professional musician as well,

2208
01:05:25.811 --> 01:05:28.900
so they'd grown up seeing photos of him in the,

2209
01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:29.410
uh,

2210
01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:30.010
in a,

2211
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:30.970
on a steam ship,

2212
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:31.241
you know,

2213
01:05:31.241 --> 01:05:32.110
with a port hole,

2214
01:05:32.111 --> 01:05:34.720
the circular par hole in the background.

2215
01:05:34.721 --> 01:05:37.750
And he's having a drink and he's sitting at the piano.

2216
01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:38.853
You know,

2217
01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:40.410
I had grown up seeing,

2218
01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:41.201
for example,

2219
01:05:41.201 --> 01:05:43.210
pictures of my pop in the air force.

2220
01:05:43.211 --> 01:05:43.770
You know,

2221
01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:44.130
what,

2222
01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:44.631
what,

2223
01:05:44.631 --> 01:05:45.760
what is that in the background?

2224
01:05:45.761 --> 01:05:46.750
That's Casa Blanca.

2225
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.040
Good enough for me.

2226
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:52.030
So when you grow up with that kind of a thing,

2227
01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:52.891
then,

2228
01:05:52.891 --> 01:05:53.060
uh,

2229
01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:53.300
you,

2230
01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:54.970
you sort of know the story.

2231
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:57.790
The story is you got to start off in the beer bars.

2232
01:05:57.790 --> 01:05:58.980
You've got to start off in this,

2233
01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:00.520
in the basements or whatever.

2234
01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:05.470
One of the best was a right around the corner from here on Van [inaudible] was

2235
01:06:05.471 --> 01:06:08.560
the Vaneyes crews and throughout the 70s,

2236
01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:10.810
and I'm going to say at least half of the sixties,

2237
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:11.800
um,

2238
01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:12.581
it was,

2239
01:06:12.581 --> 01:06:17.581
the cruise was probably four miles long and it would take you over an hour to

2240
01:06:17.681 --> 01:06:19.630
get from one end of the,

2241
01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:20.860
of it to the other.

2242
01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.753
Okay.

2243
01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:24.880
And all the bike clubs would park,

2244
01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:25.430
uh,

2245
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:26.010
on the,

2246
01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:26.380
uh,

2247
01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.400
where the gas stations were closed.

2248
01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:32.560
It's k and it was the classic cruise.

2249
01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:33.520
Um,

2250
01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.280
it went past a place called the Rock Corporation,

2251
01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:40.000
which looked a lot like where we're inside here with kind of a brick facing

2252
01:06:40.001 --> 01:06:40.541
inside,

2253
01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:42.130
a lot of bikers in et cetera.

2254
01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:42.964
Used it.

2255
01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:45.310
And I'm just fellow Ricky Rashman,

2256
01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:49.150
who was a VJ for many years with headbangers ball.

2257
01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:49.700
I remember that.

2258
01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:50.260
Yeah.

2259
01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:54.850
Well his father was owned the bar at the time.

2260
01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:55.481
Okay.

2261
01:06:55.481 --> 01:06:56.141
And his mother,

2262
01:06:56.141 --> 01:06:56.890
and they were both,

2263
01:06:56.890 --> 01:06:57.161
uh,

2264
01:06:57.161 --> 01:06:59.370
in a bike club and they own,

2265
01:06:59.371 --> 01:07:01.180
and this was a biker's bar.

2266
01:07:01.181 --> 01:07:01.960
Okay.

2267
01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.510
And it was where they had the first wet t shirt contest.

2268
01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:05.441
Um,

2269
01:07:05.441 --> 01:07:09.550
and this was when they were being tried downtown in the La Court systems.

2270
01:07:09.551 --> 01:07:09.851
You know,

2271
01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:14.851
if he got busted for a running wet t shirt contest of whether it was ludicrous

2272
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:17.530
public exposure,

2273
01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:18.250
you know,

2274
01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:19.990
the usual collision course of,

2275
01:07:19.991 --> 01:07:20.824
you know,

2276
01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.660
the mayor versus,

2277
01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:23.020
you know,

2278
01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:23.561
whatever.

2279
01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:27.970
It's probably where the dispensary system is today in terms of the legal

2280
01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.370
collision while it's in a gray zone.

2281
01:07:30.371 --> 01:07:31.240
Well it isn't,

2282
01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:32.800
well we have a card.

2283
01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:34.000
Well it's the wrong card.

2284
01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:35.530
Yeah.

2285
01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:36.341
It's the right card,

2286
01:07:36.341 --> 01:07:38.730
but the wrong jurisdiction and say,

2287
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:39.783
well,

2288
01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:43.510
what episode is this?

2289
01:07:43.511 --> 01:07:44.250
You know,

2290
01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:44.950
um,

2291
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:49.610
it was in that and we played those wet t shirt contest and uh,

2292
01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.070
you want me to describe fuck.

2293
01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:51.310
Yeah.

2294
01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:52.143
Okay.

2295
01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:56.230
Cause it was all bikers and um,

2296
01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:56.890
uh,

2297
01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:57.610
but I mean,

2298
01:07:57.610 --> 01:07:59.080
the place held approximately,

2299
01:07:59.081 --> 01:08:00.460
I'm going to say 400 people.

2300
01:08:00.461 --> 01:08:00.760
It was,

2301
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.140
you know,

2302
01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:04.540
could pack them in there and they served Schlitz malt liquor.

2303
01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.201
Uh,

2304
01:08:05.201 --> 01:08:08.650
the ball by the pole handle,

2305
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:09.371
you follow?

2306
01:08:09.371 --> 01:08:13.450
They had it by the draft style style to style.

2307
01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:13.780
Yup.

2308
01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:17.450
They would have a draft style and it was the only place that served it like

2309
01:08:17.451 --> 01:08:17.870
that.

2310
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:18.620
Okay.

2311
01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:19.370
Um,

2312
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:21.200
and they would say,

2313
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:21.501
okay,

2314
01:08:21.501 --> 01:08:22.221
we're going to have what,

2315
01:08:22.221 --> 01:08:25.580
t shirt night tonight and you get everybody in there and then they would

2316
01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:27.200
illegally lock the doors.

2317
01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:27.591
Okay.

2318
01:08:27.591 --> 01:08:30.560
Throw the bolts on the doors and pulling a kitty pool.

2319
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:32.180
And would the kids pull you?

2320
01:08:32.181 --> 01:08:33.710
Don't like where you inflate it.

2321
01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:35.890
You know the big giant doughnuts like this,

2322
01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.130
put it in front of the band.

2323
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:42.520
The band's stage was about as tall as I'm going to say a little bit taller and

2324
01:08:42.801 --> 01:08:44.870
about four feet waist-high he'll say,

2325
01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:45.920
okay.

2326
01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.753
And um,

2327
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:48.020
I would,

2328
01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:48.591
I would,

2329
01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:48.950
uh,

2330
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:51.530
roll my pants up and stand in the pool,

2331
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:53.390
interview the girls.

2332
01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:54.560
Okay.

2333
01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:58.430
And the girls would get into the pool and everybody was real woozy.

2334
01:08:58.431 --> 01:08:59.810
These were there the days of quail,

2335
01:08:59.811 --> 01:09:00.644
ludes,

2336
01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:06.420
disco biscuits and a whatever else everybody was doing.

2337
01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:07.460
Nobody,

2338
01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:07.770
nobody,

2339
01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:08.450
everyone,

2340
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:10.040
nobody knew what Rehab was.

2341
01:09:10.041 --> 01:09:14.210
Rehab was something that uncle Dwayne got sent to if he was up to a court and a

2342
01:09:14.211 --> 01:09:16.640
half a day somewhere in Ohio Rehab.

2343
01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:19.440
Who Do you heard about Betty Ford?

2344
01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:22.040
Even we're talking 1975

2345
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:24.711
barely.

2346
01:09:24.711 --> 01:09:25.521
If there was,

2347
01:09:25.521 --> 01:09:25.880
I mean,

2348
01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.590
who knew she barely had cubes.

2349
01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:28.453
Yeah,

2350
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.160
this was 1974,

2351
01:09:31.161 --> 01:09:32.990
five and six in these,

2352
01:09:32.991 --> 01:09:33.830
this area here.

2353
01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:35.113
And uh,

2354
01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:36.800
nobody knew that Jesus,

2355
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:41.280
everybody thought that everything done in moderation was,

2356
01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:41.730
you know,

2357
01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:42.830
was not a problem.

2358
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:47.480
And so everybody did everything at twice the amount of moderation and figured

2359
01:09:47.481 --> 01:09:50.960
we'd handle the problem later and it made for really noisy.

2360
01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.190
I'm carrying on.

2361
01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:53.660
We would run the girls through.

2362
01:09:53.661 --> 01:09:54.410
How are you,

2363
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:55.191
my name's Tina.

2364
01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:55.731
Where are you from,

2365
01:09:55.731 --> 01:09:56.001
Tina?

2366
01:09:56.001 --> 01:09:56.834
Up from the valley.

2367
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.411
Wow.

2368
01:09:57.411 --> 01:09:58.960
They like to party in the valley down like,

2369
01:09:59.000 --> 01:09:59.390
hey,

2370
01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:00.171
everybody played with like,

2371
01:10:00.171 --> 01:10:01.220
what song would you like to hear?

2372
01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:01.780
Well,

2373
01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:02.150
um,

2374
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:03.520
I like to hear free ride.

2375
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:04.100
Al,

2376
01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.380
I'm Holly from the valley,

2377
01:10:06.381 --> 01:10:07.400
wants to take her free,

2378
01:10:07.401 --> 01:10:07.731
right?

2379
01:10:07.731 --> 01:10:12.590
Doo Doo Doo Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee in the band would start to play,

2380
01:10:12.591 --> 01:10:12.921
you know,

2381
01:10:12.921 --> 01:10:14.060
the song or whatever.

2382
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:14.850
And,

2383
01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:15.410
uh,

2384
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:16.071
and the,

2385
01:10:16.071 --> 01:10:16.580
uh,

2386
01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:18.350
fellows would step up for me and I didn't,

2387
01:10:18.351 --> 01:10:20.870
they polar tee shirt really tight and then,

2388
01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:21.171
you know,

2389
01:10:21.171 --> 01:10:26.171
dump a big pitchers of ice cold water on her and she'd giggling and dancing,

2390
01:10:27.441 --> 01:10:27.780
you know,

2391
01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:31.970
carry on and slip and fall in the pool and there'd be water everywhere,

2392
01:10:31.971 --> 01:10:32.804
et cetera.

2393
01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:33.733
And uh,

2394
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:37.610
we'd run them through and there would be easily 20 girls.

2395
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:38.061
Okay.

2396
01:10:38.061 --> 01:10:43.061
And it was never less than just a total line of hot babes wanting to go through.

2397
01:10:44.451 --> 01:10:44.871
You would think,

2398
01:10:44.871 --> 01:10:45.890
who would want to do this?

2399
01:10:45.891 --> 01:10:47.120
The answer everybody.

2400
01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.320
It was the cool thing to do.

2401
01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:52.340
And uh,

2402
01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:56.960
all the girls would go through and then there'd be a huddle over at the side of

2403
01:10:56.961 --> 01:11:00.310
the stage and then it'd be some secretive talking and some,

2404
01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:03.620
some gesturing and some looking around and there's some further gesturing.

2405
01:11:03.710 --> 01:11:06.860
And then I would make the obligatory announcement that ladies and gentlemen,

2406
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:09.620
the judges are a little intoxicated.

2407
01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:10.220
Uh,

2408
01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:13.030
some of the voting slips have been misplaced or miss.

2409
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.273
And then his place

2410
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:19.560
<v 2>and Zach as have several of the judges and we are going to have to have them all</v>

2411
01:11:19.561 --> 01:11:20.640
go through what march

2412
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:27.540
and the band would start blowing smoke on the water.

2413
01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:30.960
So we're going to take a break.

2414
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.751
Don't go away.

2415
01:11:33.751 --> 01:11:34.590
We'll chase you.

2416
01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:36.041
That's something,

2417
01:11:36.041 --> 01:11:36.960
a hell of a show.

2418
01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:39.120
And what kind of bars you doing this then?

2419
01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:39.840
Uh,

2420
01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.430
well district was this specific part.

2421
01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:46.140
It was called the Rock Corporation and it was off of Van Nuys Boulevard,

2422
01:11:46.141 --> 01:11:48.280
which is kind of right around the corner from where word.

2423
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.720
Right.

2424
01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.660
<v 8>You've been there lately.</v>

2425
01:11:49.661 --> 01:11:51.490
It's now just car dealerships.

2426
01:11:51.491 --> 01:11:54.130
And they don't have that drive anymore to a little more dangerous.

2427
01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:55.983
I'm sure.

2428
01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:56.820
<v 2>This is a,</v>

2429
01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.520
this is a township where,

2430
01:11:58.521 --> 01:11:58.820
uh,

2431
01:11:58.820 --> 01:11:59.121
you know,

2432
01:11:59.121 --> 01:12:00.300
we tear out all the trees.

2433
01:12:00.301 --> 01:12:01.640
He named the street after them.

2434
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:03.970
So you only did this wet concert one.

2435
01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.930
You only did this wet t shirt thing.

2436
01:12:05.931 --> 01:12:07.160
And this one particular occasion,

2437
01:12:07.670 --> 01:12:08.300
this was the,

2438
01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:09.800
this was the test zone.

2439
01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.320
This is where the cops were.

2440
01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.600
This was the Lenny Bruce Place.

2441
01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:15.830
You follow this?

2442
01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:17.240
Did the cops were showing up?

2443
01:12:17.241 --> 01:12:18.680
They were doing undercover.

2444
01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.040
They were getting the inside view on this and I witnessing and then the whole

2445
01:12:24.981 --> 01:12:29.981
thing was being tested based on what happened here at that one place.

2446
01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:30.710
Wow.

2447
01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:31.543
Fall.

2448
01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.110
I think that'd be a hell of a show.

2449
01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:37.100
Can you imagine if you were there when van Halen first started out doing fucking

2450
01:12:37.101 --> 01:12:38.480
wet t shirt contest?

2451
01:12:38.710 --> 01:12:40.490
Imagine what stories you have.

2452
01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:41.151
Oh,

2453
01:12:41.151 --> 01:12:42.140
it was great stuff.

2454
01:12:42.141 --> 01:12:44.210
And we backstage is when,

2455
01:12:44.211 --> 01:12:44.870
uh,

2456
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:47.540
all of our colorful habits started happening,

2457
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:49.070
man.

2458
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:54.050
How many times I had to hitchhike home wouldn't try and remember who had gotten

2459
01:12:54.051 --> 01:12:54.884
the car.

2460
01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:56.043
You know,

2461
01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:56.630
wait,

2462
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:57.021
when you,

2463
01:12:57.021 --> 01:13:00.290
when you see yourself and you see all these different guys that have,

2464
01:13:00.291 --> 01:13:00.980
uh,

2465
01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:01.430
been,

2466
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:02.263
uh,

2467
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:03.710
contemporaries,

2468
01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:04.011
you know,

2469
01:13:04.011 --> 01:13:04.930
rock stars before.

2470
01:13:04.931 --> 01:13:05.390
Yeah.

2471
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.691
And,

2472
01:13:05.691 --> 01:13:06.350
but you're,

2473
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:10.160
you're still like live in like you're a single man.

2474
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:12.590
You pack up and go to Japan if you want,

2475
01:13:12.591 --> 01:13:12.831
you know,

2476
01:13:12.831 --> 01:13:13.031
you,

2477
01:13:13.031 --> 01:13:13.790
you're not,

2478
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:18.790
you've never sort of reformulated yourself and bring yourself back into

2479
01:13:18.801 --> 01:13:19.820
mainstream society.

2480
01:13:19.821 --> 01:13:22.340
He continued just be and David Lee Roth,

2481
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:25.250
well a,

2482
01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:26.600
I live in my own little world,

2483
01:13:26.601 --> 01:13:27.620
but leave a message,

2484
01:13:30.170 --> 01:13:30.651
you know,

2485
01:13:30.651 --> 01:13:34.310
I mean it's kind of interesting how you've pulled it off.

2486
01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:34.880
You know,

2487
01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.830
like you telling a story about moving to Japan,

2488
01:13:36.831 --> 01:13:41.831
like how many guys get to the point when they're your age that are so unsaddled

2489
01:13:42.321 --> 01:13:46.850
down and so free that they can just pack up and go to Japan for a year.

2490
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.863
I got lucky.

2491
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.560
Yeah,

2492
01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.140
I got lucky in that respect.

2493
01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.240
It's a cause.

2494
01:13:53.241 --> 01:13:54.080
It is a commitment,

2495
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.681
you know,

2496
01:13:54.681 --> 01:13:54.960
it's,

2497
01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.030
it's a lot like,

2498
01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:56.740
uh,

2499
01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:56.950
you know,

2500
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:57.390
I do,

2501
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:58.250
I talk about,

2502
01:13:58.251 --> 01:13:58.461
you know,

2503
01:13:58.461 --> 01:14:00.350
having read early books about,

2504
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:01.663
uh,

2505
01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:06.700
well then I first I joined the merchant marines and I worked my way up to Alaska

2506
01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:08.001
and then,

2507
01:14:08.001 --> 01:14:08.610
uh,

2508
01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:11.150
had the accident and uh,

2509
01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:12.023
so I had to

2510
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:16.750
<v 4>go to work in this bar and I was working in this bar when this guy comes in with</v>

2511
01:14:16.751 --> 01:14:17.584
a treasure map

2512
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:21.400
and says there's anybody speaks Swahili.

2513
01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.770
He didn't know that I was half Swahili.

2514
01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.010
So that's how I wound up in Africa two weeks later.

2515
01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.180
And I'll just thought it would be fun to be one of those guys,

2516
01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:32.443
you know?

2517
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:36.040
But have you always been able to do that?

2518
01:14:36.041 --> 01:14:39.640
You've always been the type of guy that would just pack up and bolt or is this

2519
01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.170
something you've sort of cultivated?

2520
01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.860
I think it's something you have to cultivate again,

2521
01:14:44.861 --> 01:14:45.910
that's pretty astute.

2522
01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:49.510
You got a pretty clear either Joan is that,

2523
01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:50.890
uh,

2524
01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:56.130
you can't just be impulsive because you'll spend your whole time just getting

2525
01:14:57.281 --> 01:14:59.200
drunk and you know,

2526
01:14:59.201 --> 01:15:00.034
waking up.

2527
01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:00.671
Well,

2528
01:15:00.671 --> 01:15:02.260
you have an eye for the romantic though.

2529
01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:05.380
You have exactly that when you want to paint a more colorful picture,

2530
01:15:05.381 --> 01:15:06.310
if you're going to be sorted,

2531
01:15:06.311 --> 01:15:07.360
let's be really sorted.

2532
01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:08.170
Well,

2533
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.670
I wouldn't say a sorted at all.

2534
01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:10.001
I would say.

2535
01:15:10.001 --> 01:15:11.230
I wouldn't say fascinating.

2536
01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:12.011
You know,

2537
01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:12.110
I,

2538
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:16.420
the idea of packing up and abandoning everything behind and going to somewhere,

2539
01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:18.010
that sounds very appealing to me.

2540
01:15:18.011 --> 01:15:19.360
I don't know if I would enjoy it.

2541
01:15:19.361 --> 01:15:20.350
And the way you're enjoying it,

2542
01:15:20.351 --> 01:15:22.450
but the way you're enjoying it sounds really interesting.

2543
01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:23.740
I try to,

2544
01:15:23.741 --> 01:15:24.490
uh,

2545
01:15:24.490 --> 01:15:25.750
not just wander.

2546
01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:31.710
I guess that's what I'm pointing at is that is I try to make it a full

2547
01:15:32.771 --> 01:15:34.570
experience so that it's a good story.

2548
01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:35.351
If nothing else,

2549
01:15:35.351 --> 01:15:36.400
at the end of the day,

2550
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:37.390
you're on an adventure.

2551
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:37.890
Yeah.

2552
01:15:37.890 --> 01:15:40.360
And one of the best things to do is hook up with a team,

2553
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:45.390
get in with a group of people who come from a bunch of different backgrounds and

2554
01:15:45.461 --> 01:15:48.490
see where that leads you because they're going to have to eat dinner sooner or

2555
01:15:48.491 --> 01:15:49.324
later.

2556
01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:50.801
Guaranteed.

2557
01:15:50.801 --> 01:15:52.060
One of them's an alcoholic.

2558
01:15:52.061 --> 01:15:52.900
Don't look,

2559
01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:55.390
I guarantee it.

2560
01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:58.960
And then reintegrate yourself.

2561
01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:01.600
There's a womanizer in there somewhere.

2562
01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:02.910
You'll,

2563
01:16:02.910 --> 01:16:03.551
we'll know.

2564
01:16:03.551 --> 01:16:04.384
We'll know.

2565
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.840
He'll be the one that we ask.

2566
01:16:07.841 --> 01:16:08.890
Where do you go for that?

2567
01:16:08.891 --> 01:16:09.280
Uh,

2568
01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:09.911
and you know,

2569
01:16:09.911 --> 01:16:10.750
and it Cetera,

2570
01:16:10.751 --> 01:16:11.560
et cetera.

2571
01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:11.951
And,

2572
01:16:11.951 --> 01:16:12.370
uh,

2573
01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:13.810
I've had great luck with that.

2574
01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:15.580
Does that help your songwriting too?

2575
01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:15.851
Oh,

2576
01:16:15.851 --> 01:16:16.470
you bet.

2577
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:17.260
Must Right?

2578
01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:17.830
Oh yeah.

2579
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:18.663
You Bet.

2580
01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:19.713
Um,

2581
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:20.110
if,

2582
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.943
uh,

2583
01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:22.923
the old,

2584
01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.650
the old answer told new is,

2585
01:16:26.651 --> 01:16:27.070
uh,

2586
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:30.700
somebody asked me on a show how long he was making fun of me.

2587
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:34.330
How long does it really take to write a song for Van Halen?

2588
01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:36.880
You know he can't take that long.

2589
01:16:36.881 --> 01:16:37.361
Really.

2590
01:16:37.361 --> 01:16:37.600
You know,

2591
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:38.021
Dave,

2592
01:16:38.021 --> 01:16:39.460
how long does it take to write a song?

2593
01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:40.441
And I thought,

2594
01:16:40.441 --> 01:16:40.900
Oh,

2595
01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:42.250
I thought out loud and I said,

2596
01:16:42.251 --> 01:16:43.084
you know what?

2597
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:44.470
You might have a point.

2598
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:47.950
Let's back back into the truth here a little bit.

2599
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:48.880
He said,

2600
01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.230
if you watch,

2601
01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:53.380
I'm going to say 1500 movies,

2602
01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:57.640
real legitimate movies from beginning to end and you discuss them.

2603
01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:00.790
If you have read,

2604
01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:04.480
I'm going to say 3000 magazines.

2605
01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:09.500
Let's say 3000 magazines from cover to cover any kind of amazing good.

2606
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:13.100
If you sat in front of television,

2607
01:17:13.101 --> 01:17:17.740
just generalized television for another 6,000 hours,

2608
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:21.080
it'll take you about 22 minutes.

2609
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:26.323
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2610
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.920
Well you got a pencil.

2611
01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:28.920
Your words a paper.

2612
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:30.120
If you've done all that,

2613
01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:30.621
the clock,

2614
01:17:30.621 --> 01:17:31.191
I can do that.

2615
01:17:31.191 --> 01:17:32.024
I can beat that.

2616
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:38.290
How funny is it saying how funny is it saying how hard could it be to write a

2617
01:17:38.841 --> 01:17:39.920
van Halen Song?

2618
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:40.820
Like what?

2619
01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:41.870
What is silly bitch?

2620
01:17:41.871 --> 01:17:43.650
That guy is because the I,

2621
01:17:43.651 --> 01:17:46.850
the idea that anything just because it has

2622
01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:51.930
<v 0>a small amount of words because it has a easily rememberable beat or whatever.</v>

2623
01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:57.970
<v 2>The idea that it wouldn't be like really hard to fucking create that.</v>

2624
01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.710
And if it wasn't really hard to create that,

2625
01:17:59.711 --> 01:18:00.790
wouldn't it be a lot more?

2626
01:18:00.791 --> 01:18:02.010
Van Halen is out there.

2627
01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:03.500
That's there.

2628
01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.050
There are a number of sub van Halen sound.

2629
01:18:06.490 --> 01:18:10.540
There's a number of a almost van Halen is out there.

2630
01:18:10.570 --> 01:18:12.430
What do you think was influenced by you guys the most?

2631
01:18:12.431 --> 01:18:13.264
Like what band?

2632
01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:13.571
Oh,

2633
01:18:13.571 --> 01:18:15.250
I can't go there again.

2634
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.740
Nothing.

2635
01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.020
It's nothing wrong being influenced,

2636
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:19.783
<v 4>you know,</v>

2637
01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:20.693
I don't know.

2638
01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:21.151
What is,

2639
01:18:21.151 --> 01:18:21.984
uh,

2640
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.760
what does David Mamet say that,

2641
01:18:23.761 --> 01:18:24.570
uh,

2642
01:18:24.570 --> 01:18:25.320
uh,

2643
01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.690
imitation is the sincerest form of stealing.

2644
01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:28.883
<v 2>Is that what he says?</v>

2645
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:30.643
That's

2646
01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.170
what's funny.

2647
01:18:33.330 --> 01:18:33.800
Yeah.

2648
01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.633
It's,

2649
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:37.030
<v 4>I don't know.</v>

2650
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:38.040
I know what fan,

2651
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:43.330
what influenced van Halen the most and that's a whole cross section of different

2652
01:18:43.701 --> 01:18:48.350
kinds of music and different kinds of theater and different kinds of show

2653
01:18:48.351 --> 01:18:49.040
business.

2654
01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:49.371
You know,

2655
01:18:49.371 --> 01:18:50.360
starting long,

2656
01:18:50.361 --> 01:18:50.721
long,

2657
01:18:50.721 --> 01:18:51.554
long ago,

2658
01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:53.720
you can't just imitate one kind of band.

2659
01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.210
You can't just imitate one kind of music,

2660
01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:57.300
you know,

2661
01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:57.710
or,

2662
01:18:57.710 --> 01:18:58.730
or it becomes,

2663
01:18:58.731 --> 01:18:59.564
uh,

2664
01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:00.560
uh,

2665
01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.780
not even professional wrestlers do that.

2666
01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:03.614
They update.

2667
01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.210
Look at the way Batman looks,

2668
01:19:05.211 --> 01:19:05.811
for example,

2669
01:19:05.811 --> 01:19:07.130
compared to 10 years ago.

2670
01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:07.980
He's,

2671
01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:08.780
it looks different.

2672
01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:09.710
He's out dated,

2673
01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:10.101
you know,

2674
01:19:10.101 --> 01:19:11.840
it's Batman from across the room,

2675
01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.610
but there's gotta be,

2676
01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:14.571
there's,

2677
01:19:14.571 --> 01:19:14.841
you know,

2678
01:19:14.841 --> 01:19:16.040
some updating,

2679
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.790
we'll call it,

2680
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:18.200
I don't even call it improvement.

2681
01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:21.560
You're not going to really improve Batman and you're just going to kind of,

2682
01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:23.073
you know,

2683
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:24.740
change the silhouette.

2684
01:19:24.741 --> 01:19:25.070
A little

2685
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:26.090
<v 0>sort of like,</v>

2686
01:19:26.091 --> 01:19:28.310
a lot of people feel like led Zepplin Day,

2687
01:19:28.311 --> 01:19:30.890
but like a lot of older blues music and,

2688
01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:31.460
you know,

2689
01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:32.360
add it to

2690
01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:33.293
<v 4>they're shit.</v>

2691
01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:37.050
I don't know what they did to their blues music.

2692
01:19:37.051 --> 01:19:40.380
I think that see there's the great battle is that,

2693
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:42.060
does that plagiarism well,

2694
01:19:42.061 --> 01:19:43.860
people are saying is it played your resume,

2695
01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:45.390
but it sounds so different.

2696
01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.370
Most of what they did.

2697
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:48.300
Some of it does.

2698
01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:50.190
Some of it sounds like plagiarism.

2699
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.450
<v 2>Birth.</v>

2700
01:19:51.450 --> 01:19:51.880
No.

2701
01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.713
First

2702
01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:57.960
my friend,

2703
01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:58.320
uh,

2704
01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:58.910
uh,

2705
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:59.120
bill

2706
01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.770
<v 0>burst sent me a clip.</v>

2707
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:01.161
He goes,

2708
01:20:01.161 --> 01:20:01.350
this,

2709
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:02.330
this broke my heart.

2710
01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:05.990
He sends me this clip showing the lead lead's up on songs and then all these

2711
01:20:05.991 --> 01:20:10.991
other people that led Zepplin band apparently got the original music from sorta

2712
01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:13.163
just ganged it,

2713
01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:14.970
like took chunks of it.

2714
01:20:14.971 --> 01:20:15.420
And

2715
01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:19.530
<v 4>well it's interesting when you listen to it back to back because you'll hear,</v>

2716
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:20.290
um,

2717
01:20:20.290 --> 01:20:21.123
uh,

2718
01:20:21.170 --> 01:20:23.130
I'm going to try and think of some lyrics,

2719
01:20:23.131 --> 01:20:23.621
you know,

2720
01:20:23.621 --> 01:20:24.330
uh,

2721
01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:26.810
you'll see it says a blues song and then the,

2722
01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:30.930
all they really got from the Blue Song was a couple of lyrics.

2723
01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.560
I am a little red rooster and uh,

2724
01:20:34.561 --> 01:20:37.440
I laid the golden egg and a,

2725
01:20:37.441 --> 01:20:39.030
that's what the little red rooster set.

2726
01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.730
And then they'll repeat that a couple of times and they'll say,

2727
01:20:41.731 --> 01:20:41.881
well,

2728
01:20:41.881 --> 01:20:43.550
that's the little red rooster blue song.

2729
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:48.960
If you changed all the music went and created something else that was very

2730
01:20:48.961 --> 01:20:49.950
different musically.

2731
01:20:49.951 --> 01:20:53.220
So now you have that question of is that the whole Blue Csat?

2732
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:55.450
I've had an attribute is that a,

2733
01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:57.900
and I think he owes some money if you use that,

2734
01:20:57.930 --> 01:20:59.010
you use the lyrics.

2735
01:20:59.011 --> 01:21:00.330
If he used the words,

2736
01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:01.441
great Pam,

2737
01:21:01.441 --> 01:21:02.280
some words money.

2738
01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:06.270
If we change the music and he changed the music,

2739
01:21:06.271 --> 01:21:07.560
it changed left behind the music.

2740
01:21:07.561 --> 01:21:07.681
Well,

2741
01:21:07.681 --> 01:21:09.540
you were there from the beginning of that debate.

2742
01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:13.530
You were there in music and for the beginning of the sampling to be when it all

2743
01:21:13.531 --> 01:21:14.490
started happening,

2744
01:21:14.491 --> 01:21:17.370
when rap artists started like Mc Hammer.

2745
01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:17.971
Oh sure.

2746
01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:18.804
And you know,

2747
01:21:18.810 --> 01:21:22.500
vanilla ice used that whole beginning part for under pressure.

2748
01:21:22.501 --> 01:21:22.771
I mean,

2749
01:21:22.771 --> 01:21:23.730
there's so many,

2750
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:26.640
so many different bands were getting sampled.

2751
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:29.340
Like what was your thought on that when that was all going on?

2752
01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.780
I think if you're gonna,

2753
01:21:30.781 --> 01:21:33.120
if you're gonna use it,

2754
01:21:34.150 --> 01:21:34.940
uh,

2755
01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:38.310
I don't even think you have to acknowledge to acknowledge him behind the scenes.

2756
01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:39.390
You can pay me for it.

2757
01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:39.721
You know,

2758
01:21:39.721 --> 01:21:40.740
it doesn't have to happen,

2759
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.420
Warren,

2760
01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:46.420
right up on the sleeve that you used my material because it's a lot like cooking

2761
01:21:46.441 --> 01:21:49.920
in the kitchen and there are only so many ingredients.

2762
01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:51.330
If you're going to mix,

2763
01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.240
uh,

2764
01:21:52.730 --> 01:21:53.563
uh,

2765
01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:56.280
you want to try and create something that's unfamiliar,

2766
01:21:56.690 --> 01:21:58.140
I know you understand.

2767
01:21:58.141 --> 01:22:01.860
So if you're going to take a sample of my voice and mix it with a sample of some

2768
01:22:01.861 --> 01:22:03.030
other people's voices,

2769
01:22:03.031 --> 01:22:03.391
great.

2770
01:22:03.391 --> 01:22:04.680
Then you're going to pay us for that.

2771
01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:07.770
But I don't think there's anything musically wrong with that,

2772
01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.500
but you just think that it's a financial issue.

2773
01:22:10.501 --> 01:22:11.910
They owe you a little bit of money from it,

2774
01:22:11.911 --> 01:22:12.870
but it doesn't bother you.

2775
01:22:13.890 --> 01:22:16.380
It bothers me from the sense that,

2776
01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:17.543
uh,

2777
01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.290
well the songs songwriters,

2778
01:22:19.330 --> 01:22:20.240
<v 0>when you live that singer,</v>

2779
01:22:20.241 --> 01:22:25.230
this motherfucker was waiting with his lighter by his cancer stick waiting.

2780
01:22:25.231 --> 01:22:25.481
Like,

2781
01:22:25.481 --> 01:22:25.871
yes,

2782
01:22:25.871 --> 01:22:27.700
the green light from Diamond Dave

2783
01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:30.433
cancer.

2784
01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.290
I am the son of Satan.

2785
01:22:32.291 --> 01:22:32.740
Don't my,

2786
01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.780
my duties now are largely ceremonial.

2787
01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:40.000
Um,

2788
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:40.570
so yeah,

2789
01:22:40.570 --> 01:22:41.250
back to that.

2790
01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:41.680
Um,

2791
01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:41.920
yeah,

2792
01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:42.671
I agree with you.

2793
01:22:42.671 --> 01:22:42.821
It's,

2794
01:22:42.821 --> 01:22:43.090
it's,

2795
01:22:43.090 --> 01:22:43.291
I,

2796
01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:44.950
I find like Mick Mashups,

2797
01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:45.281
you know,

2798
01:22:45.281 --> 01:22:46.150
when they take songs,

2799
01:22:46.151 --> 01:22:48.150
like there's a 99,

2800
01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:48.730
uh,

2801
01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:49.750
Voodoo child,

2802
01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:51.880
99 problems and Jimi Hendrix,

2803
01:22:51.881 --> 01:22:52.571
Voodoo child.

2804
01:22:52.571 --> 01:22:52.900
Sure.

2805
01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:54.420
It's a great mashup.

2806
01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:54.640
It's,

2807
01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:55.960
it sounds really awesome.

2808
01:22:56.530 --> 01:23:00.910
<v 4>I think it's great if you're using a older familiar music and I hear it and hip</v>

2809
01:23:00.911 --> 01:23:01.990
hop a lot in,

2810
01:23:01.991 --> 01:23:02.824
it's cool.

2811
01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:04.240
I'm hearing good stuff.

2812
01:23:04.241 --> 01:23:04.721
They're picking,

2813
01:23:04.721 --> 01:23:04.940
you know,

2814
01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:06.500
good little pieces of music,

2815
01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:07.160
great.

2816
01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:10.100
I'm all for it because otherwise you're going to just have to learn it on an

2817
01:23:10.101 --> 01:23:12.050
instrument and serve it backup some way.

2818
01:23:12.051 --> 01:23:12.580
Anyway.

2819
01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:13.820
When you have a song like

2820
01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:17.350
<v 0>Mc Hammer with the the,</v>

2821
01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:18.011
what was it?

2822
01:23:18.011 --> 01:23:18.610
Super Freak,

2823
01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:19.710
super freak from Mcshane.

2824
01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:20.553
So he took that.

2825
01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.240
How much does that guy have to give up?

2826
01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:23.381
How much does he give up?

2827
01:23:23.381 --> 01:23:24.460
Does he give up a flat fee?

2828
01:23:24.461 --> 01:23:26.380
Does he ever give a percentage of the sales?

2829
01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:28.160
<v 4>How many ways to skin the cat?</v>

2830
01:23:28.161 --> 01:23:28.881
It depends.

2831
01:23:28.881 --> 01:23:31.580
It's some people make it a flat fee and say,

2832
01:23:31.581 --> 01:23:31.881
okay,

2833
01:23:31.881 --> 01:23:33.410
I'll give it to you for whatever,

2834
01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:38.740
$10 other people say I want a piece of the action and you're taking a chance

2835
01:23:39.321 --> 01:23:42.290
because who's in charge of monitoring the action?

2836
01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:43.081
You know,

2837
01:23:43.081 --> 01:23:44.360
the record company is,

2838
01:23:44.361 --> 01:23:44.711
you know,

2839
01:23:44.711 --> 01:23:45.650
is going to remain and you go,

2840
01:23:45.651 --> 01:23:45.861
oh,

2841
01:23:45.861 --> 01:23:49.070
I want a little piece of that because that's going to be a popular song.

2842
01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:51.350
But somewhere in between,

2843
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:53.960
you know there's going to be a licensing fee.

2844
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:55.670
It usually comes in terms of just,

2845
01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:56.421
you know,

2846
01:23:56.421 --> 01:23:57.120
you got a,

2847
01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:57.950
uh,

2848
01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.020
one check for doing the thing.

2849
01:24:00.021 --> 01:24:00.854
So

2850
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:06.690
it's a great way for you having older music reinterpreted.

2851
01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:10.970
I'm all for that Van Halen music has been reinterpreted 35 different ways,

2852
01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:11.660
you know,

2853
01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:12.680
and I'm all for that.

2854
01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:13.461
Um,

2855
01:24:13.461 --> 01:24:13.950
I,

2856
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:15.590
I do all the floor mixes to,

2857
01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:19.070
I've heard all kinds of dance remixes and stuff as well.

2858
01:24:19.071 --> 01:24:19.460
So,

2859
01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:19.880
you know,

2860
01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:20.990
new audiences,

2861
01:24:20.991 --> 01:24:22.160
new shoes,

2862
01:24:22.161 --> 01:24:24.410
new cowboy hats and nothing wrong with that,

2863
01:24:24.411 --> 01:24:24.680
right?

2864
01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:25.513
Oh No,

2865
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:26.200
it's,

2866
01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:31.200
well van Halen is kind of the spiritual guidance to van Halen goes beyond just

2867
01:24:31.611 --> 01:24:35.630
the musical were the patron saints of everything that allegedly happens after

2868
01:24:35.631 --> 01:24:36.141
midnight.

2869
01:24:36.141 --> 01:24:37.820
And you know that allegedly

2870
01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:42.260
that's the whole projection.

2871
01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:49.580
<v 0>You were also around to see the music business radically changed because of the</v>

2872
01:24:50.431 --> 01:24:51.030
Internet.

2873
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:54.570
That had to be quite a bit of a mind fuck because when you guys started they

2874
01:24:54.571 --> 01:24:55.740
were selling cassettes,

2875
01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:56.701
you know,

2876
01:24:56.701 --> 01:25:00.810
I mean you guys were albums where vinyl albums and cassettes and the vinyl

2877
01:25:00.811 --> 01:25:04.860
albums were bad ass cause you had the all the artwork and then that that shrunk

2878
01:25:04.861 --> 01:25:08.700
to cds and then the cds went away and can we say how awesome.

2879
01:25:08.701 --> 01:25:12.930
1984 was on CD and Stereo blasting as loud that,

2880
01:25:12.931 --> 01:25:16.050
that beginning sound and that was amazing.

2881
01:25:16.051 --> 01:25:16.750
I was one of my,

2882
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:18.330
when I was one of my first cds,

2883
01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:19.820
what was it like to,

2884
01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:21.570
to see like this,

2885
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:25.020
this music business like really fucking change like,

2886
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:27.900
like radically where you can't really sell records anymore.

2887
01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:30.840
I mean you sell a few off iTunes but the numbers,

2888
01:25:30.841 --> 01:25:33.750
the percentage drop is just staggering

2889
01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.670
<v 4>I think which we're also seeing more than,</v>

2890
01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:37.533
uh,

2891
01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.030
just in terms of numbers Joe,

2892
01:25:40.031 --> 01:25:42.130
is that we're seeing uh,

2893
01:25:42.131 --> 01:25:47.080
how high people are reaching for quality because if its result oriented and we

2894
01:25:47.081 --> 01:25:49.630
always just say well we're just here for the music.

2895
01:25:49.631 --> 01:25:51.400
We're just here for the labor of love,

2896
01:25:51.401 --> 01:25:52.234
et Cetera.

2897
01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:57.360
But there is a reality behind the scenes that if there's that multimillion

2898
01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.720
dollar ability to sell 20 million records like Saturday night fever or uh,

2899
01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:08.690
one of those Fleetwood Mac records or one of those eagles records,

2900
01:26:08.691 --> 01:26:09.470
you know,

2901
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:12.230
one of those huge multibillion selling Jesus.

2902
01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:13.010
I just,

2903
01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:14.750
I just wrote dark side of the moon.

2904
01:26:17.690 --> 01:26:22.690
I think I'm going to buy cola with some of the profits and really go on vacation

2905
01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:25.850
forever are

2906
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:29.630
one of those kinds of fortunes,

2907
01:26:29.631 --> 01:26:30.110
you know.

2908
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:30.711
Hey guys,

2909
01:26:30.711 --> 01:26:35.711
I just wrote a song called Stairway to heaven and I think not anymore,

2910
01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:36.741
you know,

2911
01:26:36.741 --> 01:26:37.580
and uh,

2912
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.941
you know,

2913
01:26:37.941 --> 01:26:39.620
we're going to have to put in a year and a half,

2914
01:26:39.621 --> 01:26:42.050
two years of our time doing this.

2915
01:26:42.051 --> 01:26:42.680
You know,

2916
01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:43.011
that's,

2917
01:26:43.011 --> 01:26:43.850
that's what happens.

2918
01:26:43.851 --> 01:26:45.470
You want to do the wall,

2919
01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:46.910
you want to do Tommy,

2920
01:26:47.150 --> 01:26:48.320
you want to do,

2921
01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:48.610
you know,

2922
01:26:48.610 --> 01:26:50.270
one of those kinds of records.

2923
01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:50.921
Then you got to,

2924
01:26:50.921 --> 01:26:53.630
that's like a three year commitment from the time you go,

2925
01:26:53.631 --> 01:26:53.871
hey,

2926
01:26:53.871 --> 01:26:57.170
you want to write some songs to the time you're standing around,

2927
01:26:57.171 --> 01:27:00.620
uncomfortable in a suit and tie collecting?

2928
01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:01.221
Well,

2929
01:27:01.221 --> 01:27:03.950
I wouldn't be up here for the ninth time tonight with one of these little

2930
01:27:03.951 --> 01:27:06.170
statues if it wasn't for a lot of other people.

2931
01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:07.640
That space of time,

2932
01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:10.430
it's about three years.

2933
01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:15.760
And it means commit yourself like a blue uniform type of commitment,

2934
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:17.990
like the ruin your family life more,

2935
01:27:17.991 --> 01:27:19.400
not more often than not.

2936
01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:21.920
Like you're a soldier for that song completely.

2937
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:24.380
You become most equals soldier in that band.

2938
01:27:24.381 --> 01:27:27.830
I'm sure Springsteen's acolytes would tell you that,

2939
01:27:27.831 --> 01:27:28.131
you know,

2940
01:27:28.131 --> 01:27:29.210
and all those early,

2941
01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:29.451
you know,

2942
01:27:29.451 --> 01:27:33.860
born to run and jungle land and all those epic things do not,

2943
01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:35.270
are not born of,

2944
01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:35.970
you know,

2945
01:27:35.970 --> 01:27:36.381
well yeah,

2946
01:27:36.381 --> 01:27:38.840
we marched up to the gate and we started the gate one.

2947
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:44.000
We had to slog our way for months,

2948
01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.700
then we camped for months,

2949
01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.600
then we decided wrong month.

2950
01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:53.540
So that kind of a thing.

2951
01:27:53.541 --> 01:27:54.230
It's like an,

2952
01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:57.440
and families take a beating and you know,

2953
01:27:58.010 --> 01:27:59.450
so why would you do it?

2954
01:27:59.870 --> 01:28:00.201
Well,

2955
01:28:00.201 --> 01:28:00.741
first of year,

2956
01:28:00.741 --> 01:28:01.191
of course,

2957
01:28:01.191 --> 01:28:03.380
the nobility of song and second,

2958
01:28:03.381 --> 01:28:03.831
of course,

2959
01:28:03.831 --> 01:28:08.210
because you have an opportunity to win the Super Try Zach,

2960
01:28:08.230 --> 01:28:12.980
the Trifecta or whatever it is raised times.

2961
01:28:12.981 --> 01:28:13.814
Uh,

2962
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:14.570
you know,

2963
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:19.570
$400 million lotto that will generate forever if you create a bridge over

2964
01:28:21.021 --> 01:28:21.920
troubled water.

2965
01:28:22.190 --> 01:28:24.200
But if you're going to be in that studio,

2966
01:28:24.201 --> 01:28:26.330
so like going in when it was to a summary,

2967
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:31.390
he may well be there really in mind if not body for three full years and that's

2968
01:28:32.181 --> 01:28:33.014
before the tour

2969
01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:37.240
<v 0>and when that all sorta stopped.</v>

2970
01:28:37.570 --> 01:28:41.230
What was the feeling like in the music business when it's like all of a sudden

2971
01:28:41.770 --> 01:28:44.680
electronic downloads are completely taking over you,

2972
01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:45.110
your,

2973
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:48.490
your companies are getting stripped by illegal downloads,

2974
01:28:48.491 --> 01:28:52.570
just stripped albums are out instantaneously on bit torrent.

2975
01:28:52.630 --> 01:28:57.630
The moment they're released and more downloads by in terms of how many people

2976
01:28:58.121 --> 01:28:59.950
are downloading it to how many people are buying it.

2977
01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:02.280
It far more

2978
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:03.300
<v 4>far more downloads.</v>

2979
01:29:03.301 --> 01:29:04.134
Right.

2980
01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:05.203
While you,

2981
01:29:05.290 --> 01:29:09.810
you're bringing up interesting thoughts in your causing me to have interesting

2982
01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:10.501
feelings,

2983
01:29:10.501 --> 01:29:15.501
ambivalent feelings about all of this because I feel like you've come break,

2984
01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:21.030
you've now broken into the bottom of the boat where either keeping me

2985
01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:26.530
and you've torn opened the door and you have a sword in your hand.

2986
01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:30.053
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

2987
01:29:31.410 --> 01:29:32.243
come rough.

2988
01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:33.283
That's fine.

2989
01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:40.490
<v 4>Because they discovered I was a trader a sometime ago.</v>

2990
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:42.383
Um,

2991
01:29:42.450 --> 01:29:43.283
you know,

2992
01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.120
I'm coming also from a time,

2993
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:45.991
it's a little,

2994
01:29:45.991 --> 01:29:49.680
it's a little bit of a prisoner of Zenda,

2995
01:29:49.681 --> 01:29:50.011
but,

2996
01:29:50.011 --> 01:29:50.610
uh,

2997
01:29:50.610 --> 01:29:53.520
whatever that that would other one is where he's on the island.

2998
01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:54.753
Um,

2999
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:55.470
uh,

3000
01:29:55.470 --> 01:30:00.470
I coming from a time when a count of Monte Cristo coming from a time when a

3001
01:30:02.101 --> 01:30:07.020
musicians were either loved or not soul of Van Halen was not so loved.

3002
01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:08.440
So today who?

3003
01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:09.840
By the record companies.

3004
01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:10.720
Okay.

3005
01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:11.460
Yep.

3006
01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:14.910
And a today if you buy a $10 van Halen record,

3007
01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.220
I'll make 6 cents royalty.

3008
01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:18.510
Oh my God,

3009
01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:18.900
yes.

3010
01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:21.810
The producer makes you more of those first two records than I do.

3011
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:24.420
And I'm actually,

3012
01:30:24.421 --> 01:30:25.171
let me be fair.

3013
01:30:25.171 --> 01:30:27.090
The subsequent four van Halen records,

3014
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.030
I do make 8 cents royalty.

3015
01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:31.080
Wow.

3016
01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.660
Out of a $10 record album there.

3017
01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:36.690
So when you telling me the boat is sinking,

3018
01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.370
<v 5>go fuck yourself.</v>

3019
01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:41.980
<v 4>You've killed most of my</v>

3020
01:30:42.150 --> 01:30:42.983
<v 5>staff.</v>

3021
01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.233
<v 4>Really?</v>

3022
01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:46.073
You like

3023
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:48.890
including the big guy with the wrist watch.

3024
01:30:53.050 --> 01:30:53.883
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

3025
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.721
<v 4>You killed him,</v>

3026
01:30:54.721 --> 01:30:55.080
right?

3027
01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:55.351
Yeah.

3028
01:30:55.351 --> 01:30:55.830
Okay.

3029
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:56.460
Okay.

3030
01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:56.750
What?

3031
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:57.720
I'm prepared to talk.

3032
01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:58.613
Was it a dark?

3033
01:30:59.310 --> 01:31:00.330
Was it a dark business?

3034
01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.890
Of course it was dark business.

3035
01:31:01.891 --> 01:31:02.521
Are you kidding?

3036
01:31:02.521 --> 01:31:02.861
It was,

3037
01:31:02.861 --> 01:31:05.430
is noisy and corrupt as you would ever want it to be.

3038
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:10.110
But walking into negotiations for anybody,

3039
01:31:10.111 --> 01:31:14.880
I don't know that it's any easier today than it ever would be for somebody new.

3040
01:31:14.881 --> 01:31:15.420
Come on.

3041
01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:18.720
I write poems for a living and I sing and dance the poems.

3042
01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:19.860
It's that simple.

3043
01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:23.970
But you will spend your whole time trying to perfect that craft if you're going

3044
01:31:23.971 --> 01:31:24.900
to live off of it.

3045
01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:25.710
Um,

3046
01:31:25.710 --> 01:31:27.720
to try and speak the language of,

3047
01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:28.261
okay,

3048
01:31:28.261 --> 01:31:32.430
now I speak a market bearing,

3049
01:31:32.431 --> 01:31:33.264
uh,

3050
01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:33.780
uh,

3051
01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:38.780
bonds that a equal to a prime lending rate of no,

3052
01:31:40.171 --> 01:31:40.381
no.

3053
01:31:40.381 --> 01:31:43.050
It's all carefully hidden away from you anyways.

3054
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:45.450
Just the idea that you get a lot of sign your own,

3055
01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.290
um,

3056
01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:50.070
your own checks is alien to most people in this business.

3057
01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:50.850
You know?

3058
01:31:50.850 --> 01:31:53.310
So we had to learn the hard way.

3059
01:31:53.610 --> 01:31:56.550
And when we talk about how the record business has changed,

3060
01:31:56.551 --> 01:31:58.380
I do miss the epic efforts.

3061
01:31:58.990 --> 01:32:03.990
People used to make a Herculean effort when you go into the studio to really

3062
01:32:04.031 --> 01:32:05.230
make a contribution,

3063
01:32:05.231 --> 01:32:09.850
to really take the music pass where you found it and to really make 1 million

3064
01:32:09.850 --> 01:32:10.060
bucks.

3065
01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.370
That's a powerful,

3066
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:12.223
uh,

3067
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.420
that's a powerful,

3068
01:32:13.421 --> 01:32:14.290
uh,

3069
01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.011
energy drink,

3070
01:32:15.011 --> 01:32:15.844
man.

3071
01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:21.420
Nicotine fueled ambition and greed times a musical,

3072
01:32:21.450 --> 01:32:22.283
uh,

3073
01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:23.471
whatever.

3074
01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:24.070
Wow.

3075
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.920
Do you think that it'll be

3076
01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:29.980
<v 0>balance out eventually where the bands will now be able to get free promotion on</v>

3077
01:32:30.531 --> 01:32:35.210
the Internet and then they'll reap most of the profits that come from touring?

3078
01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:39.440
And do you think that eventually that kind of balances out and that what gets

3079
01:32:39.441 --> 01:32:40.670
distributed on the Internet,

3080
01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:42.800
even though you're not getting profit from it?

3081
01:32:42.801 --> 01:32:45.110
Like cds with new bands,

3082
01:32:45.230 --> 01:32:45.920
there'll be able,

3083
01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.330
it will be able to change the sort of,

3084
01:32:47.331 --> 01:32:50.990
the atmosphere and they'll be able to get promotion where they would never be

3085
01:32:50.991 --> 01:32:52.100
able to get to promotion before.

3086
01:32:52.101 --> 01:32:53.540
Just through viral marketing,

3087
01:32:53.541 --> 01:32:54.530
just through viral,

3088
01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.940
just friends spreading things that they enjoy.

3089
01:32:57.090 --> 01:32:58.200
<v 4>Perfect example of it.</v>

3090
01:32:58.560 --> 01:32:59.220
I'm,

3091
01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:04.220
I couldn't get a job today in regular terrestrial radio if my life depended on

3092
01:33:05.521 --> 01:33:05.910
it.

3093
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:07.530
I'm difficult to work with.

3094
01:33:08.610 --> 01:33:10.230
I can't imagine that you'd be

3095
01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.650
back to work with

3096
01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.310
you when you're self describing herself as difficult,

3097
01:33:20.311 --> 01:33:21.600
how would you be disciplined to work?

3098
01:33:21.601 --> 01:33:22.980
This is how I've been labeled.

3099
01:33:23.010 --> 01:33:23.670
Okay.

3100
01:33:23.670 --> 01:33:28.620
And getting in and out of regular radio is because I don't fit in because I had

3101
01:33:28.621 --> 01:33:31.800
a black sidekick because I play ethnic music loops.

3102
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:34.350
I played the opening from superfly.

3103
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:36.300
[inaudible] has had Robin,

3104
01:33:36.330 --> 01:33:38.070
Robin quivers forever.

3105
01:33:38.130 --> 01:33:39.990
Like it's different.

3106
01:33:40.110 --> 01:33:42.480
It's you having a black side kick was like criticized.

3107
01:33:42.510 --> 01:33:43.051
Oh yeah,

3108
01:33:43.051 --> 01:33:43.950
there was a big issue.

3109
01:33:44.050 --> 01:33:44.850
What's,

3110
01:33:44.850 --> 01:33:46.680
who's your sidekick name was animal.

3111
01:33:46.681 --> 01:33:47.530
He was one of the leg.

3112
01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:50.730
He'd done security for a,

3113
01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:51.180
you know,

3114
01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:55.680
dre and snoop and all kinds of good characters just from Montgomery,

3115
01:33:55.681 --> 01:33:56.514
Alabama.

3116
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:58.500
And now we discussed all kinds of,

3117
01:33:58.501 --> 01:33:59.190
you know,

3118
01:33:59.190 --> 01:34:00.210
pertinent data would,

3119
01:34:00.270 --> 01:34:01.740
there was no stone unturned.

3120
01:34:01.770 --> 01:34:05.490
We discussed every subject in the news today and you love talking so much,

3121
01:34:05.491 --> 01:34:06.930
that seems like a perfect thing for you.

3122
01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:08.431
Well,

3123
01:34:08.431 --> 01:34:09.480
what they wanted was,

3124
01:34:09.481 --> 01:34:09.951
hey buddy,

3125
01:34:09.951 --> 01:34:11.160
your neighbor at the top of the hour,

3126
01:34:11.161 --> 01:34:13.970
I'm here because I have to do with 18 and what's going on under while they get

3127
01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:14.910
sucked out of the car.

3128
01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:20.010
I was a smart executive and I know that's an oxymoron.

3129
01:34:20.011 --> 01:34:20.844
It's like

3130
01:34:21.150 --> 01:34:22.230
<v 0>military intelligence.</v>

3131
01:34:22.530 --> 01:34:24.000
What I would do is I would say,

3132
01:34:24.001 --> 01:34:24.301
Dave,

3133
01:34:24.301 --> 01:34:25.230
what do you want to do?

3134
01:34:25.630 --> 01:34:27.690
Let me get you a microphone and ready.

3135
01:34:27.691 --> 01:34:27.931
Go.

3136
01:34:27.931 --> 01:34:29.940
We're going to have to throw some commercials in every now and then.

3137
01:34:29.941 --> 01:34:30.774
Is that okay?

3138
01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:31.490
Okay.

3139
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:32.323
Other than that,

3140
01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:35.430
it's on you just completely leave it up to you.

3141
01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:40.640
But if someone tries to change your personality and try to twist around your,

3142
01:34:42.481 --> 01:34:42.751
you know,

3143
01:34:42.751 --> 01:34:45.960
your energy and get you to do something you don't want to do,

3144
01:34:46.290 --> 01:34:47.580
it's going to be a disaster.

3145
01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:51.600
Like how they could not see that that would be a disaster like right away is uh,

3146
01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:52.100
that's,

3147
01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:52.933
that's puzzling.

3148
01:34:53.370 --> 01:34:53.820
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3149
01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:54.653
I think they,

3150
01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:54.960
uh,

3151
01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:56.850
they were feeling imperious.

3152
01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:57.280
We,

3153
01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.120
Tony Soprano,

3154
01:34:58.121 --> 01:34:58.940
what's,

3155
01:34:58.940 --> 01:34:59.773
who

3156
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:01.491
is that what it was?

3157
01:35:01.491 --> 01:35:02.590
They just wanted to get you to listen.

3158
01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:03.410
Yeah.

3159
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:06.740
They had in the Corolla was part of this as well.

3160
01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:11.240
He was one of the other phases that have been hired and we were all put under

3161
01:35:11.241 --> 01:35:12.350
the thumb pretty readily.

3162
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:14.030
It happened quick.

3163
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:15.283
And um,

3164
01:35:15.650 --> 01:35:17.250
I don't think anybody survived,

3165
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:21.950
which is telling out of some 14 different phases and personalities across the

3166
01:35:21.951 --> 01:35:22.550
country.

3167
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:23.300
It was so over it

3168
01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:24.050
<v 0>managed,</v>

3169
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:24.441
you know,

3170
01:35:24.441 --> 01:35:28.440
I mean Corola obviously a shown that all he has to do is just be himself and I

3171
01:35:28.441 --> 01:35:29.120
just put,

3172
01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:29.900
you know,

3173
01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:31.370
now that he's running his own show,

3174
01:35:31.371 --> 01:35:34.130
it's much more successful than his radio show ever was.

3175
01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:34.690
Hello?

3176
01:35:34.690 --> 01:35:34.941
It's,

3177
01:35:34.941 --> 01:35:35.211
yeah,

3178
01:35:35.211 --> 01:35:35.781
it's boom.

3179
01:35:35.781 --> 01:35:36.141
It's like,

3180
01:35:36.141 --> 01:35:36.974
let him be him.

3181
01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:38.780
So now you're doing exactly the same thing.

3182
01:35:38.781 --> 01:35:39.614
Let you be you,

3183
01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:41.950
<v 4>I'm doing the Roth show view.</v>

3184
01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:43.190
It's all the same stuff.

3185
01:35:43.191 --> 01:35:43.401
It's,

3186
01:35:43.401 --> 01:35:43.671
you know,

3187
01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:48.650
ethnic music I've counted would turn left of center humor and um,

3188
01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:50.030
I don't know.

3189
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:52.340
I don't know a whole lot of guests.

3190
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:53.840
So it's kind of a,

3191
01:35:53.850 --> 01:35:54.710
a monologue,

3192
01:35:54.711 --> 01:35:56.660
kind of a mark twain thing.

3193
01:35:56.661 --> 01:35:56.991
You know,

3194
01:35:56.991 --> 01:35:58.100
it's in Bill Burr.

3195
01:35:58.140 --> 01:35:58.551
Again,

3196
01:35:58.551 --> 01:35:59.384
my friend bill,

3197
01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:00.260
he has money,

3198
01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.270
he calls it the Monday morning podcast.

3199
01:36:02.271 --> 01:36:03.140
He's a standup comedian.

3200
01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:04.820
He just basically rants about shit.

3201
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:07.010
He just like pick up the newspaper and just tie.

3202
01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.090
It's fucking great.

3203
01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:08.720
It's great.

3204
01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.730
It's an hour of just him talking shit.

3205
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:12.050
Almost no guests.

3206
01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:13.700
Well you could do that easily.

3207
01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:14.660
Well it also,

3208
01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:19.900
we're getting to a level now where talking becomes an art form and art is

3209
01:36:20.361 --> 01:36:23.390
something as simple as it wasn't created before,

3210
01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:24.530
but now that it exists,

3211
01:36:24.531 --> 01:36:25.850
it forces you to think,

3212
01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:26.990
forces you to argue,

3213
01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:32.320
forces you to have some kind of action and reaction kind of thinking.

3214
01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:38.600
And a lot of folks when they get to talking on the radio are afraid of being

3215
01:36:38.601 --> 01:36:39.500
criticized.

3216
01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:42.110
You're afraid of losing a constituency.

3217
01:36:42.111 --> 01:36:42.351
You know,

3218
01:36:42.351 --> 01:36:44.000
especially when you have morning team radio,

3219
01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.470
you're doing traditional radio.

3220
01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:46.873
Um,

3221
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.241
you know,

3222
01:36:47.241 --> 01:36:50.270
you don't want to say anything that's going to cause people to argue.

3223
01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:54.140
And I think that's the first thing that you want to reach for if you're going to

3224
01:36:54.141 --> 01:36:55.640
make any kind of contribution.

3225
01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:56.151
If you say,

3226
01:36:56.151 --> 01:36:56.984
what is art?

3227
01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:59.480
Something that forces them to think like,

3228
01:36:59.481 --> 01:37:00.260
what do you mean?

3229
01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:01.490
Like that soup can

3230
01:37:04.450 --> 01:37:07.460
like that Andy Warhol soup can from a bazillion years.

3231
01:37:07.461 --> 01:37:09.770
He goes at art or is that bs?

3232
01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:12.460
Is that a sales job or is that right?

3233
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.670
We're going to be here a while,

3234
01:37:14.210 --> 01:37:15.800
get some more clients and more of that coffee

3235
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:21.220
and that's when it becomes art and,

3236
01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.850
and what we're doing here,

3237
01:37:22.851 --> 01:37:27.851
every now and then we hit a moment where the people are listening and people get

3238
01:37:28.041 --> 01:37:28.491
hooked.

3239
01:37:28.491 --> 01:37:30.470
And can I even hear that?

3240
01:37:30.471 --> 01:37:31.970
Am I supposed to hear that?

3241
01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:34.130
Am I encouraged to think about that?

3242
01:37:34.670 --> 01:37:35.503
And uh,

3243
01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:39.170
I think that that's a whole new art form happening out there now.

3244
01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:39.611
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

3245
01:37:39.611 --> 01:37:43.590
I think one of the interesting things about letting a person be themselves on a

3246
01:37:43.630 --> 01:37:45.400
television show or on a,

3247
01:37:45.670 --> 01:37:46.900
you're going spike up again.

3248
01:37:46.901 --> 01:37:47.620
You fuck look at them.

3249
01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:48.670
You give them the green light.

3250
01:37:50.290 --> 01:37:50.921
It's a,

3251
01:37:50.921 --> 01:37:52.240
it seeing someone,

3252
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.980
you know,

3253
01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:54.940
be able to be themselves for the first time.

3254
01:37:54.970 --> 01:37:57.250
It'd be able to express themselves,

3255
01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:58.030
uh,

3256
01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:58.421
with,

3257
01:37:58.421 --> 01:38:00.310
with no one's direction,

3258
01:38:00.610 --> 01:38:01.031
you know,

3259
01:38:01.031 --> 01:38:02.830
with no one telling you what to say,

3260
01:38:02.831 --> 01:38:03.664
what to do.

3261
01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:04.810
That's a rare moment.

3262
01:38:04.811 --> 01:38:06.400
You don't get that on the tonight show.

3263
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:08.380
You know when you talked to David Letterman,

3264
01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:12.970
I get to see David Lee Roth in these five to seven minute bursts where this,

3265
01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:14.710
it's so hard to get to know you.

3266
01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:15.820
Like for real,

3267
01:38:15.821 --> 01:38:16.540
legit.

3268
01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:17.620
They're going to get to know you though.

3269
01:38:17.621 --> 01:38:18.910
If you listened to your radio show,

3270
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:22.300
if they listened to the Roth show and they really listened to that over and over

3271
01:38:22.301 --> 01:38:23.650
again for several months,

3272
01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:25.060
they'll know the real you,

3273
01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:27.780
<v 4>which it's pretty sprawling so far.</v>

3274
01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:29.820
We've covered a variety of subjects.

3275
01:38:29.821 --> 01:38:31.170
I like campfire telling,

3276
01:38:31.710 --> 01:38:32.130
you know,

3277
01:38:32.130 --> 01:38:36.450
just enough like I can share some things probably you didn't know.

3278
01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:38.120
Like why does jockeys

3279
01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:41.810
<v 5>an FM radio speak like heroin addicts?</v>

3280
01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:43.250
They don't do that anymore.

3281
01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:43.851
They gave up.

3282
01:38:43.851 --> 01:38:45.230
That guy doesn't exist anymore.

3283
01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:46.880
Maybe those guys.

3284
01:38:46.890 --> 01:38:47.723
Yes.

3285
01:38:47.770 --> 01:38:48.270
<v 4>You know,</v>

3286
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:48.610
it was,

3287
01:38:48.610 --> 01:38:52.600
that was the alternative to a hopping and Bobbin and Bobbin with the best bet

3288
01:38:52.601 --> 01:38:53.051
for the boss.

3289
01:38:53.051 --> 01:38:54.040
Beat at the top of the pops.

3290
01:38:54.041 --> 01:38:55.000
Smash Gold,

3291
01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:55.853
you know,

3292
01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:56.720
timeliness.

3293
01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:59.830
The top 40 a boss jacket bound.

3294
01:39:00.190 --> 01:39:00.581
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

3295
01:39:00.581 --> 01:39:01.810
and then there was the Strip club,

3296
01:39:01.811 --> 01:39:03.040
Dj type character.

3297
01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:04.330
All right,

3298
01:39:04.330 --> 01:39:09.330
we got Nickelback coming up [inaudible] Guinea Cozzie

3299
01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:18.660
and he tried to try to get as many syllables out of Texas to the main stage.

3300
01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:20.891
Yeah,

3301
01:39:20.891 --> 01:39:21.724
there's a,

3302
01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:27.120
there's a bunch of those voices that they just use like the sports casters.

3303
01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.090
<v 0>It's your voice or the,</v>

3304
01:39:29.091 --> 01:39:29.411
uh,

3305
01:39:29.411 --> 01:39:31.490
the small town news guy voice.

3306
01:39:31.570 --> 01:39:32.231
<v 4>Can you do that?</v>

3307
01:39:32.231 --> 01:39:34.090
Can you do the cast caster voice?

3308
01:39:34.130 --> 01:39:37.430
<v 0>The sports caster voice would be like,</v>

3309
01:39:37.431 --> 01:39:38.070
I like that.

3310
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.310
Like,

3311
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:39.710
like something from the Simpsons.

3312
01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:44.930
Mike Tyson enters the ring 16 and owed 206 pounds,

3313
01:39:44.931 --> 01:39:45.764
six foot three.

3314
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.430
<v 4>I've always wondered what it'd be like to announce a fight.</v>

3315
01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:51.830
Does that come by easily for you?

3316
01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:52.491
<v 0>It's,</v>

3317
01:39:52.491 --> 01:39:53.660
I'm an easy now.

3318
01:39:53.661 --> 01:39:53.901
Yeah.

3319
01:39:53.901 --> 01:39:55.040
Because I've been doing it for so long.

3320
01:39:55.041 --> 01:39:55.880
It's second nature.

3321
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.960
But uh,

3322
01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.220
in the beginning was a little odd.

3323
01:39:58.221 --> 01:40:00.050
It was a strange insights that you,

3324
01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.310
you have to know when to talk,

3325
01:40:01.311 --> 01:40:03.320
when not to talk when you're talking too much,

3326
01:40:03.650 --> 01:40:03.891
you know,

3327
01:40:03.891 --> 01:40:04.280
it could,

3328
01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:04.881
you know,

3329
01:40:04.881 --> 01:40:05.181
he got,

3330
01:40:05.181 --> 01:40:07.670
he got and he got to be really focused on what's happened.

3331
01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:07.950
<v 4>Dang.</v>

3332
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:09.480
How did you learn those things?

3333
01:40:09.481 --> 01:40:14.190
Did you go back and look at tapes of your call in and listen and get critiqued

3334
01:40:14.191 --> 01:40:14.520
or,

3335
01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:14.821
yeah,

3336
01:40:14.821 --> 01:40:15.360
I tried to

3337
01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.370
<v 0>be observant while I'm doing it,</v>

3338
01:40:17.371 --> 01:40:20.580
but definitely had to go back and listen in the early days and I listen to

3339
01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:20.881
myself.

3340
01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:21.091
I go,

3341
01:40:21.091 --> 01:40:22.440
I need to shut the fuck up.

3342
01:40:22.441 --> 01:40:23.640
Like I'm talking too much,

3343
01:40:23.641 --> 01:40:24.110
you know,

3344
01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:27.570
I or I was talking too much about one fighter and not enough about another.

3345
01:40:27.571 --> 01:40:28.980
I was missing something.

3346
01:40:28.981 --> 01:40:29.814
Or you know,

3347
01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:30.870
he can get on tangents.

3348
01:40:30.930 --> 01:40:32.250
Sometimes you can get stuck.

3349
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:34.890
It really is like a sort of a skill.

3350
01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:36.750
You learn how to do it as time goes on

3351
01:40:37.090 --> 01:40:37.691
<v 4>bad it is.</v>

3352
01:40:37.691 --> 01:40:39.490
And Are you watching on the TV screen?

3353
01:40:39.491 --> 01:40:40.324
Mostly?

3354
01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.460
<v 0>Depends on what the angle is.</v>

3355
01:40:43.461 --> 01:40:46.400
Like sometimes I prefer to see it live like right in front of me.

3356
01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:47.480
But sometimes like,

3357
01:40:47.481 --> 01:40:48.890
especially in ground battles,

3358
01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:50.360
like when they're there fighting on the ground,

3359
01:40:50.361 --> 01:40:51.740
I have to see an overhead.

3360
01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:54.070
I don't know where the guy's arm is.

3361
01:40:54.071 --> 01:40:57.250
I don't know if he's in jeopardy or if he's defending correctly,

3362
01:40:57.251 --> 01:40:57.521
you know,

3363
01:40:57.521 --> 01:40:58.000
arc.

3364
01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:58.650
I could say what he,

3365
01:40:58.650 --> 01:41:00.430
what he's doing wrong or what he's doing right.

3366
01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:02.410
I need to see it on the camera sometimes.

3367
01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.240
Or if the guy's backs are to us,

3368
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:05.380
some of their backs are to us.

3369
01:41:05.381 --> 01:41:07.030
I can't see what's happening in front of them.

3370
01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:08.170
I can't see where he's hitting them,

3371
01:41:08.171 --> 01:41:10.480
so I'll look down at the monitor sometimes.

3372
01:41:10.481 --> 01:41:11.314
It all depends.

3373
01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:13.940
How many fights have you called dao?

3374
01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:16.050
Over more of the housing.

3375
01:41:16.410 --> 01:41:16.870
Really?

3376
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:17.681
Any more than a thousand?

3377
01:41:17.681 --> 01:41:17.861
Yeah,

3378
01:41:17.861 --> 01:41:19.870
I've been calling the,

3379
01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:24.100
I started doing post fight interviews in 1997 for the UFC,

3380
01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:29.280
but I started doing the commentary in 2002 so from 2002 11 years so far.

3381
01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:33.101
That's amazing.

3382
01:41:33.101 --> 01:41:38.101
And what one fight really sticks out in your mind one night really sticks out in

3383
01:41:38.411 --> 01:41:38.890
your mind.

3384
01:41:38.890 --> 01:41:42.370
There's no one that really sticks out because there's so many of them have been

3385
01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:43.360
insane.

3386
01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:45.850
The UFC is so fucking exciting.

3387
01:41:45.851 --> 01:41:47.500
There's so many exciting fights.

3388
01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:49.990
This is not one that really sticks out.

3389
01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:50.913
There's a,

3390
01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.270
there's so many of them.

3391
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.650
It's,

3392
01:41:52.650 --> 01:41:53.321
it's so many.

3393
01:41:53.321 --> 01:41:54.190
It's so many high,

3394
01:41:54.191 --> 01:41:57.820
so many tens you know like what makes a 10 what makes it 10 evening?

3395
01:41:57.850 --> 01:42:00.250
Like when you walk out at the end of the night and you go,

3396
01:42:00.251 --> 01:42:01.000
wow,

3397
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.190
that just all jelled.

3398
01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:02.411
What,

3399
01:42:02.411 --> 01:42:02.681
what,

3400
01:42:02.681 --> 01:42:04.420
what are the three main ingredients?

3401
01:42:04.421 --> 01:42:05.170
For example,

3402
01:42:05.170 --> 01:42:07.060
the whole holy shit moments.

3403
01:42:07.450 --> 01:42:11.080
The Holy Shit moments like when Anderson Silva Front kick Vito Belfort in the

3404
01:42:11.081 --> 01:42:12.550
face and knocked him unconscious,

3405
01:42:12.850 --> 01:42:13.421
he would just like,

3406
01:42:13.421 --> 01:42:14.111
Holy Shit.

3407
01:42:14.111 --> 01:42:18.640
No one had never landed a front kick to the face ever mixed martial arts fight.

3408
01:42:18.670 --> 01:42:19.870
Like you never saw that.

3409
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:20.301
It wasn't a,

3410
01:42:20.301 --> 01:42:23.240
to spend a lot of my childhood trying to,

3411
01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:24.730
you know,

3412
01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:29.730
a staple technique of karate or taekwondo have a lot of martial arts incorporate

3413
01:42:30.551 --> 01:42:31.151
the front kick.

3414
01:42:31.151 --> 01:42:33.490
It's a very like basic kick.

3415
01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:38.700
But before then we never saw anybody knock a guy out in the UFC with a front

3416
01:42:39.971 --> 01:42:40.631
kick to the face.

3417
01:42:40.631 --> 01:42:41.464
It never happened.

3418
01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:45.460
There's only been one wheel kick knock out before the ultimate fighter.

3419
01:42:45.461 --> 01:42:46.260
Now there's two,

3420
01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:46.471
but the,

3421
01:42:46.471 --> 01:42:48.580
but before then they would have only been one.

3422
01:42:48.581 --> 01:42:52.270
Edson Barboza knocked out Terry Adam with a wheel kick to the face that it never

3423
01:42:52.271 --> 01:42:53.410
happened in the UFC before,

3424
01:42:53.530 --> 01:42:56.110
but the one that landed was unbelievable.

3425
01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:57.430
Knocked him unconscious,

3426
01:42:57.431 --> 01:42:58.130
he fell down,

3427
01:42:58.130 --> 01:42:59.890
he got shot with a sniper rifle.

3428
01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:01.270
It was craziness.

3429
01:43:01.450 --> 01:43:04.230
It was so devastating that now people were throwing,

3430
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:05.680
we'll kicks left and right,

3431
01:43:05.681 --> 01:43:08.590
like everybody's trying to land them because they realize how deadly they are

3432
01:43:08.591 --> 01:43:09.340
once they land.

3433
01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:10.300
So now everybody,

3434
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:13.120
people pick up the ball and they're going to start to imitate.

3435
01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:13.690
Exactly.

3436
01:43:13.690 --> 01:43:15.270
And you'll start to see that,

3437
01:43:15.370 --> 01:43:15.610
uh,

3438
01:43:15.610 --> 01:43:17.360
the copycat killers in the rank.

3439
01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:17.810
Yeah.

3440
01:43:17.810 --> 01:43:17.951
Well,

3441
01:43:17.951 --> 01:43:22.930
you start to see success with these unorthodox techniques that are really not

3442
01:43:22.931 --> 01:43:24.070
unorthodox techniques.

3443
01:43:24.071 --> 01:43:28.660
They're just traditional mixed martial arts techniques that people hadn't

3444
01:43:28.661 --> 01:43:33.370
incorporated into the octagon yet with what most of the stuff that got by in

3445
01:43:33.371 --> 01:43:33.641
the,

3446
01:43:33.641 --> 01:43:38.641
the early morphing of mixed martial arts was wrestling and,

3447
01:43:38.890 --> 01:43:39.160
uh,

3448
01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:40.600
the ability to punch on the feet.

3449
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:44.830
But then Maury Smith came around and started showing people high level

3450
01:43:44.831 --> 01:43:48.100
kickboxing and he started late kicking guys and knocking guys out.

3451
01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:49.660
So then they started incorporating kicks.

3452
01:43:49.661 --> 01:43:51.380
But Maurice was a Moitai guy.

3453
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:54.710
So everybody was throwing out these roundhouse kicks and that's basically yet

3454
01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:59.300
then Anderson sort of evolve things even further and a lot of other fighters did

3455
01:43:59.301 --> 01:43:59.960
as well.

3456
01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.410
And now you're starting to see like with Leo Machida and a lot of these other

3457
01:44:03.411 --> 01:44:04.250
karate stylist,

3458
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:07.520
you're starting to see all sorts of different karate techniques inside the

3459
01:44:07.521 --> 01:44:12.440
octagon as well because these guys know all the other stuff like wrestling.

3460
01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:15.650
They know how to stand up with wrestling and them to get back up to their feet

3461
01:44:15.651 --> 01:44:17.000
and they know how to avoid take downs.

3462
01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:21.080
So now you're seeing all these other traditional mixed martial arts techniques

3463
01:44:21.081 --> 01:44:23.090
or traditional martial arts techniques rather,

3464
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:25.670
that we didn't see for 10 plus years.

3465
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:29.780
And are these familiar techniques that uh,

3466
01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:31.610
are we going to continue seeing?

3467
01:44:31.630 --> 01:44:31.950
Oh yeah,

3468
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:33.410
that particular to one guy.

3469
01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:33.681
Well,

3470
01:44:33.681 --> 01:44:36.890
there's a few that we haven't seen yet and one of them is the ax kick guys have

3471
01:44:36.891 --> 01:44:37.401
tried it,

3472
01:44:37.401 --> 01:44:41.630
but no one's ever knocked anybody out in kickboxing and in taekwondo tournament,

3473
01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:43.430
there's a lot of knockouts with ax kicks.

3474
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:47.060
I've never seen one in the UFC and kick with a guy with a your kind of

3475
01:44:47.061 --> 01:44:50.750
flexibility when used to throw those wild kicks when you would basically do a

3476
01:44:50.751 --> 01:44:52.820
split standing up and throw a kick,

3477
01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:53.693
grow it over your head.

3478
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:56.900
You know the ax cause you throw the leg up like that and then you come down with

3479
01:44:56.901 --> 01:44:57.680
the heel.

3480
01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:59.180
It's a devastating technique.

3481
01:44:59.181 --> 01:45:01.040
If you're flexible enough and you're fast enough,

3482
01:45:01.041 --> 01:45:04.490
it's like getting hit in the head with a a giant bone hammer,

3483
01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:05.090
you know?

3484
01:45:05.090 --> 01:45:08.570
I mean it's really a brutal technique but we haven't seen it in the octagon.

3485
01:45:08.571 --> 01:45:12.170
How come we haven't seen it in the act to gun for the same reason why Anderson

3486
01:45:12.170 --> 01:45:15.230
Silva's front kick to Vito Belfort face was the first time we ever saw it.

3487
01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:16.970
We just need to see someone pull it off.

3488
01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:18.710
If one person pulled it off,

3489
01:45:18.711 --> 01:45:21.200
one guy who really knows how to do it and that's confidence in it,

3490
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:22.580
we'll see it left and right.

3491
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:24.380
It's sort of like the four minute mile.

3492
01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:25.310
Once it's broken,

3493
01:45:25.311 --> 01:45:26.510
then other people will break it.

3494
01:45:28.610 --> 01:45:29.600
What about the biggest,

3495
01:45:29.601 --> 01:45:31.270
biggest guys who are,

3496
01:45:31.271 --> 01:45:34.040
who are the two biggest guys now that are fighting in there?

3497
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.510
Well,

3498
01:45:34.510 --> 01:45:36.350
that's a funny thing about heavyweights.

3499
01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:40.730
It doesn't seem that the biggest guys in the most effective in heavyweights,

3500
01:45:40.731 --> 01:45:42.470
once you get up to 265 pounds,

3501
01:45:42.471 --> 01:45:43.520
that's the heavyweight limit.

3502
01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:48.350
The most effective guy seemed to be about two 40 like Cain Velasquez,

3503
01:45:48.351 --> 01:45:48.681
junior,

3504
01:45:48.681 --> 01:45:48.891
dos,

3505
01:45:48.891 --> 01:45:49.431
Santos.

3506
01:45:49.431 --> 01:45:52.370
Those guys are around two 40 when you get bigger than that,

3507
01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:57.580
you just move a little too slow and you don't make up in horsepower what you,

3508
01:45:57.891 --> 01:45:58.850
what you get,

3509
01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.290
what you lose.

3510
01:46:00.291 --> 01:46:01.580
Rather with your,

3511
01:46:01.581 --> 01:46:03.350
you're having too much muscle mass.

3512
01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:07.880
Having your body have to pump blood through too much body mass,

3513
01:46:07.881 --> 01:46:10.010
too many cells to feed with oxygen,

3514
01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:13.430
it seems like there's a point of diminishing returns and they move slower.

3515
01:46:13.431 --> 01:46:14.990
It's not as much fun to watch the fight.

3516
01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:15.471
Well,

3517
01:46:15.471 --> 01:46:16.310
they move slower.

3518
01:46:16.311 --> 01:46:17.720
The easier to hit as well.

3519
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:22.430
They're easier to hit and they can't keep up the pace like 155 pound fighter.

3520
01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:24.080
Like you see a light weight in the UFC,

3521
01:46:24.230 --> 01:46:24.890
they can,

3522
01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:27.050
they can blitz for five,

3523
01:46:27.051 --> 01:46:29.090
five minute rounds like Benson Henderson,

3524
01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:29.924
the lightweight champ.

3525
01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:32.840
That dude can go full clip for five five minute rounds.

3526
01:46:32.841 --> 01:46:33.800
He's got that cardio.

3527
01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.150
No heavyweight does.

3528
01:46:35.210 --> 01:46:35.870
They just don't.

3529
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:36.590
They just don't have it.

3530
01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:39.320
Even Cain Velasquez who's the most conditioned heavy way,

3531
01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.570
he'll get more tired in a five round fight.

3532
01:46:41.571 --> 01:46:44.090
Like when he just won the title back against Junior dos Santos.

3533
01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:45.470
He's known for his cardio,

3534
01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:47.640
but he got noticed would be tired in,

3535
01:46:47.670 --> 01:46:47.901
in,

3536
01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:48.471
in that fight.

3537
01:46:48.471 --> 01:46:51.090
Even though he and won his title back,

3538
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:55.260
he got way more tired than you would ever see like Benson Henderson get,

3539
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:56.700
and it's just a matter of physics.

3540
01:46:56.940 --> 01:47:01.590
It's just a matter of you have to pump oxygen and blood through your dealing

3541
01:47:01.591 --> 01:47:04.740
with 90 more pounds of tissue than Benson has to deal with.

3542
01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:05.661
<v 2>Tuck it.</v>

3543
01:47:05.661 --> 01:47:09.320
Endurance is probably how much percentage of the winning team mission.

3544
01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:13.310
It's enormous for every five to 80% for every fight

3545
01:47:13.450 --> 01:47:14.670
<v 0>gets out of the first round,</v>

3546
01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:16.590
it becomes a bigger and bigger,

3547
01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:22.080
bigger and bigger part of the equation that you don't see any fighters that are

3548
01:47:22.081 --> 01:47:26.190
successful in the top 10 under 265 pounds that have stamina issues.

3549
01:47:26.370 --> 01:47:27.510
They never make it.

3550
01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:28.620
You just can't make it.

3551
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:31.200
You can't make it at one 70 with stamina issues.

3552
01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:34.050
You know George Saint Pierre is a cardio machine,

3553
01:47:34.170 --> 01:47:36.990
one 55 Benson Henderson has a cardio machine,

3554
01:47:37.170 --> 01:47:39.750
one 85 Anderson Silva never gets tired.

3555
01:47:39.751 --> 01:47:43.830
Anderson Silva got throttled by Chell son and for four and a half rounds and

3556
01:47:43.831 --> 01:47:47.250
still pulled off a triangle off of his back in the fifth round.

3557
01:47:47.251 --> 01:47:47.401
I mean,

3558
01:47:47.401 --> 01:47:51.180
you're talking to my guy with supreme conditioning and those are the only guys

3559
01:47:51.181 --> 01:47:52.710
that survive in this day.

3560
01:47:52.770 --> 01:47:53.730
There's the,

3561
01:47:53.731 --> 01:47:56.580
the field is far too competitive.

3562
01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:00.210
There's no way to make it unless you have all the basis covered.

3563
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:03.870
You'll get a certain distance with just power.

3564
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:08.220
If you're like a really explosive guy who could just blitz guys and run after

3565
01:48:08.221 --> 01:48:09.060
them and crack them,

3566
01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:10.590
you'll get a certain distance,

3567
01:48:10.770 --> 01:48:14.340
but you'll never beat the very best guys because the very best guys will know

3568
01:48:14.341 --> 01:48:14.521
they will,

3569
01:48:14.521 --> 01:48:15.630
they have to do is run you.

3570
01:48:15.810 --> 01:48:20.490
There's sprint view for the first 45 minutes or 45 seconds rather than if you

3571
01:48:20.491 --> 01:48:20.790
don't,

3572
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:22.230
if you don't catch them with a shot,

3573
01:48:22.410 --> 01:48:22.970
then your,

3574
01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:25.000
your gas tanks or any empty your attack.

3575
01:48:25.110 --> 01:48:29.040
<v 2>I remember when this was all just starting off and it was all very iffy as to</v>

3576
01:48:29.041 --> 01:48:32.820
where it could be shown and what cities would allow it to happen.

3577
01:48:32.821 --> 01:48:33.391
And now what?

3578
01:48:33.391 --> 01:48:35.160
We've got two women who are fighting.

3579
01:48:35.161 --> 01:48:35.970
Yeah.

3580
01:48:35.970 --> 01:48:38.490
And how did this just go out as great,

3581
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:39.460
great fight.

3582
01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:40.151
<v 0>Two wasn't,</v>

3583
01:48:40.151 --> 01:48:42.340
it wasn't like she went in there and kick the girl's ass.

3584
01:48:42.341 --> 01:48:43.450
Like the girl almost got it.

3585
01:48:43.451 --> 01:48:44.680
Liz Carmouche was the,

3586
01:48:44.681 --> 01:48:48.250
the opponent and Liz Carmouche took her back and you know,

3587
01:48:48.251 --> 01:48:49.860
she's a marine and a lesbian.

3588
01:48:50.250 --> 01:48:50.551
<v 2>Well,</v>

3589
01:48:50.551 --> 01:48:53.970
he's talking about bad ass bitch and she wasn't there to lose.

3590
01:48:53.971 --> 01:48:56.190
She was there to win and she took Rhonda Rousey's

3591
01:48:56.210 --> 01:48:58.110
<v 0>back and had her in a standing room.</v>

3592
01:48:58.111 --> 01:48:58.701
Nick it choke.

3593
01:48:58.701 --> 01:49:00.500
It was bad or face was twisted.

3594
01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:01.573
Ronda is famous,

3595
01:49:01.630 --> 01:49:01.901
<v 2>right?</v>

3596
01:49:01.901 --> 01:49:06.901
Female Marine Lesbian standing rear naked choke and have that video.

3597
01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:12.390
Can't travel with that one.

3598
01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:13.390
You go overseas.

3599
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:15.470
That restaurant it was,

3600
01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:16.910
it sounds great,

3601
01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:17.590
right?

3602
01:49:17.590 --> 01:49:18.370
It was a wildfire.

3603
01:49:18.370 --> 01:49:20.210
And how long did the fight go on first round.

3604
01:49:20.211 --> 01:49:20.350
Yeah.

3605
01:49:20.350 --> 01:49:22.600
<v 0>And Rhonda got out of the rear naked choke,</v>

3606
01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:24.190
got her to the ground and got her in an arm bar.

3607
01:49:24.250 --> 01:49:25.690
So she's one seven fights,

3608
01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:26.620
seven first round.

3609
01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:28.690
Armbars she's a bad ass bitch too.

3610
01:49:28.691 --> 01:49:29.710
It was a great fight.

3611
01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:30.760
It was incredible.

3612
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:31.623
It was beautiful.

3613
01:49:32.130 --> 01:49:32.371
<v 2>Where,</v>

3614
01:49:32.371 --> 01:49:34.200
where did they have this Anaheim?

3615
01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:37.050
This was in Anaheim and was a pretty well attended.

3616
01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:37.461
Oh yeah.

3617
01:49:37.461 --> 01:49:37.621
Yeah.

3618
01:49:37.621 --> 01:49:38.281
It was shut out.

3619
01:49:38.281 --> 01:49:39.120
It was craziness.

3620
01:49:39.150 --> 01:49:39.983
Yeah.

3621
01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:40.861
Excellent.

3622
01:49:40.861 --> 01:49:41.110
What's,

3623
01:49:41.110 --> 01:49:42.420
what's this say about,

3624
01:49:42.421 --> 01:49:43.254
uh,

3625
01:49:43.290 --> 01:49:46.490
the economy that the economy is falling apart?

3626
01:49:46.970 --> 01:49:48.130
This is thriving?

3627
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:48.401
<v 0>Well,</v>

3628
01:49:48.401 --> 01:49:48.611
there's,

3629
01:49:48.611 --> 01:49:48.911
this is,

3630
01:49:48.911 --> 01:49:52.240
this is an element of sports and Showbiz that is just thriving.

3631
01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:53.920
Even if the economy is in the toilet,

3632
01:49:53.921 --> 01:49:54.940
which it most certainly is.

3633
01:49:54.941 --> 01:49:56.350
There's so many people.

3634
01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:58.540
I mean we were dealing with 20 million people.

3635
01:49:58.541 --> 01:50:00.970
Only 15,000 can go to this thing.

3636
01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:01.451
You know,

3637
01:50:01.451 --> 01:50:02.800
even in a down economy,

3638
01:50:02.801 --> 01:50:07.150
you're going to find 15,000 people can scrape together the cash for such an epic

3639
01:50:07.151 --> 01:50:07.720
event,

3640
01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:12.670
especially women who are like really into the UFC and now all of a sudden they

3641
01:50:12.671 --> 01:50:14.860
have someone who is like a role model for them.

3642
01:50:14.861 --> 01:50:17.890
Like you know how many girls are going to start doing martial arts now because

3643
01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.740
[inaudible] and Liz Carmouche I'm sure of it.

3644
01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:21.791
I'm sure of it.

3645
01:50:21.791 --> 01:50:22.511
It's going to be amazed.

3646
01:50:22.511 --> 01:50:24.700
They'll start seeing the placards in the storefront.

3647
01:50:24.701 --> 01:50:25.534
Windows.

3648
01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:26.210
Yeah.

3649
01:50:26.210 --> 01:50:27.160
Starting now.

3650
01:50:27.161 --> 01:50:28.480
Women's classes.

3651
01:50:28.481 --> 01:50:30.100
Women's only classes.

3652
01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:30.470
Yeah.

3653
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.680
Yeah.

3654
01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.210
No,

3655
01:50:31.210 --> 01:50:32.050
no doubt about it.

3656
01:50:32.050 --> 01:50:35.260
There's going to be a lot more of that and now that they realize also you can

3657
01:50:35.261 --> 01:50:40.030
make a legit living like Rhonda Rousey if she's not rich already from that

3658
01:50:40.031 --> 01:50:40.301
fight,

3659
01:50:40.301 --> 01:50:41.650
which I'm pretty sure she is.

3660
01:50:41.890 --> 01:50:44.770
I don't know how much she makes off of paper view and all that jazz,

3661
01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:48.280
but I'm sure she's probably has more money than her wildest dreams right now.

3662
01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:49.630
And that's the beginning.

3663
01:50:49.631 --> 01:50:54.631
That girl is a superstar in athletics now and she's doing every possible talk

3664
01:50:55.361 --> 01:50:56.050
show.

3665
01:50:56.050 --> 01:50:58.900
She's doing every possible magazine interview.

3666
01:50:59.170 --> 01:51:03.550
Five years from now she'll be able to retire and buy herself a fucking country

3667
01:51:03.551 --> 01:51:05.920
somewhere and have a bunch of little brown dude's wash her feet.

3668
01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:09.670
We do whatever she wants.

3669
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.901
She can't,

3670
01:51:10.901 --> 01:51:12.250
she can't do any wrong.

3671
01:51:12.251 --> 01:51:12.641
And you know,

3672
01:51:12.641 --> 01:51:13.474
she's a beast.

3673
01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:17.900
I these gals tested for steroids and what not.

3674
01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:22.960
How far is that come reaching in a lance Armstrong a world that's a very good

3675
01:51:22.961 --> 01:51:23.720
point.

3676
01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:28.720
Her main threat out there as a chick that calls herself Cyborg and she got

3677
01:51:28.721 --> 01:51:31.480
popped for steroids and she looks like a man.

3678
01:51:31.630 --> 01:51:35.290
She's built like pull up a picture Cyborg so you could see a picture of her cris

3679
01:51:35.291 --> 01:51:36.124
Cyborg.

3680
01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:37.060
She's uh,

3681
01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:40.090
she also says that she can't drop down to 135 pounds,

3682
01:51:40.091 --> 01:51:41.350
which is where Rhonda is the champ.

3683
01:51:41.530 --> 01:51:45.760
She wants rotted to come up and fight her at one 45 because she weighs even more

3684
01:51:45.761 --> 01:51:46.121
than that.

3685
01:51:46.121 --> 01:51:47.620
She cuts weight to get down there.

3686
01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:51.460
And a lot of people speculate that she just wants to stay on the juice and stay

3687
01:51:51.461 --> 01:51:51.930
as,

3688
01:51:51.930 --> 01:51:53.610
as thick and media as possible.

3689
01:51:53.710 --> 01:51:54.880
Look at the size of this beast

3690
01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:59.230
and she's a sear that side at Cyborg.

3691
01:51:59.510 --> 01:52:01.720
There's a picture of her in the inside the cage.

3692
01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:02.740
It's even scarier.

3693
01:52:03.190 --> 01:52:03.550
Um,

3694
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:08.550
there's a picture of her beaten up a chick and she's just wall like a dude and

3695
01:52:08.561 --> 01:52:10.450
she's very skilled as well.

3696
01:52:10.570 --> 01:52:11.980
It's not just that she's,

3697
01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:12.701
you know,

3698
01:52:12.701 --> 01:52:14.350
a really physically strong,

3699
01:52:14.351 --> 01:52:15.184
she's also,

3700
01:52:15.550 --> 01:52:18.880
I think she won the world championships as a brown belt in Jujitsu.

3701
01:52:19.090 --> 01:52:22.510
She's a devastating a stand up fighter,

3702
01:52:22.690 --> 01:52:24.550
really good kickboxing skill,

3703
01:52:25.090 --> 01:52:25.610
but are,

3704
01:52:25.610 --> 01:52:28.060
are the athletes tested for steroids?

3705
01:52:28.061 --> 01:52:28.660
And she didn't,

3706
01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:29.500
she didn't pass.

3707
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:30.583
She got an f,

3708
01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:34.360
she looks like a dude and she got an f,

3709
01:52:35.850 --> 01:52:36.260
you know,

3710
01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:37.093
and I'm,

3711
01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:41.710
I don't know how a politically incorrect or correct I can be here,

3712
01:52:41.711 --> 01:52:43.150
but that's kind of how I like it.

3713
01:52:44.890 --> 01:52:45.060
They're,

3714
01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:50.060
you're like a little chaos in the mix it under the fingernails happening there.

3715
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:54.290
That is some masculine characteristics.

3716
01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:56.600
That's somebody who's been doing heavy lifting.

3717
01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:57.210
Yeah.

3718
01:52:57.210 --> 01:52:58.130
With uh,

3719
01:52:58.131 --> 01:53:00.170
Dick growing in their panties.

3720
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.651
I,

3721
01:53:00.651 --> 01:53:00.970
uh,

3722
01:53:00.970 --> 01:53:03.190
have a penis.

3723
01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:04.680
I have a good friend who's a,

3724
01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:06.740
also a doctor and he's a,

3725
01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:10.470
he specializes in hormones and hormone therapy and,

3726
01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:13.550
and the reactions that people have to a certain hormones.

3727
01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:14.450
And he,

3728
01:53:14.450 --> 01:53:18.950
he got on our show and said there is not a way in the world that a woman gets

3729
01:53:18.951 --> 01:53:21.740
built like that and last she's taking male hormones.

3730
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:22.910
It just doesn't happen.

3731
01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:23.913
It's got be,

3732
01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:24.410
yeah.

3733
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:29.000
It would have to be you talking about like ridiculously thick musculature and

3734
01:53:29.001 --> 01:53:33.350
strange places like the traps and the neck and the shoulders and the arms.

3735
01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:36.920
Like you're talking about literally man sized athlete.

3736
01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:40.160
I'm a good strong male athletes body.

3737
01:53:40.190 --> 01:53:42.020
Well this brings up another question then,

3738
01:53:42.021 --> 01:53:43.760
and this goes into normal boxing.

3739
01:53:43.761 --> 01:53:45.950
Do they test for steroids,

3740
01:53:45.951 --> 01:53:46.640
etc.

3741
01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:48.350
And traditional boxing?

3742
01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:49.011
Oh yes they do.

3743
01:53:49.011 --> 01:53:49.191
Yeah.

3744
01:53:49.191 --> 01:53:49.970
People had been caught.

3745
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:50.803
Absolutely.

3746
01:53:51.230 --> 01:53:56.230
Cause somebody was just talking about it on the air recently that if a athletes

3747
01:53:57.381 --> 01:54:02.381
or buffing up all the more and still throwing punches at each other's heads that

3748
01:54:02.641 --> 01:54:06.770
the injuries and the damage is going to be considerably more just because

3749
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:08.120
everybody's shrugger.

3750
01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:09.760
Everybody's got more wallop.

3751
01:54:09.770 --> 01:54:10.190
Yeah.

3752
01:54:10.190 --> 01:54:10.551
Yeah.

3753
01:54:10.551 --> 01:54:11.630
That is the big,

3754
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:12.920
that's the big debate.

3755
01:54:12.921 --> 01:54:15.860
Also the ability to keep punching and not get tired.

3756
01:54:15.861 --> 01:54:18.320
There's other things that are just as dangerous as steroids.

3757
01:54:18.321 --> 01:54:19.430
Like Epo.

3758
01:54:19.670 --> 01:54:21.710
Epo is what Lance Armstrong was using,

3759
01:54:21.711 --> 01:54:24.410
what all those cyclists use and what it does is it gives your body an

3760
01:54:24.411 --> 01:54:26.300
extraordinary amount of red blood cells,

3761
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:29.570
allows you to carry oxygen and a really unnatural manner.

3762
01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:34.580
And what these guys are doing is they with their taking EPO and they're fighting

3763
01:54:34.581 --> 01:54:37.820
someone that put a pace on a guy like they can go,

3764
01:54:37.850 --> 01:54:41.780
they have way more endurance than it's like normally physically possible and

3765
01:54:41.781 --> 01:54:45.440
they'll put a pace on a guy and then wound up beating the shit out of the guy

3766
01:54:45.441 --> 01:54:47.090
because the guy can't keep up with their pace.

3767
01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:51.010
Well is it because they've trained harder or is it because they're on EPL?

3768
01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:51.200
Well,

3769
01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:52.033
it could be both,

3770
01:54:52.130 --> 01:54:55.970
but the EPO most certainly is a dangerous aspect of fighting.

3771
01:54:56.070 --> 01:54:57.680
What does B o exactly?

3772
01:54:57.770 --> 01:54:58.360
I don't know.

3773
01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:01.730
Let me pull up with the m w what it stands for.

3774
01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:03.170
But what it is is,

3775
01:55:03.171 --> 01:55:07.130
and I have a friend who has used this stuff because he was a former,

3776
01:55:07.131 --> 01:55:07.650
um,

3777
01:55:07.650 --> 01:55:08.120
uh,

3778
01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:10.100
professional cycler and uh,

3779
01:55:10.101 --> 01:55:11.660
he said that when he was on,

3780
01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:12.560
he was on a,

3781
01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:13.070
uh,

3782
01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:14.420
like a big cycling team.

3783
01:55:14.690 --> 01:55:15.770
He said they were on the bus,

3784
01:55:15.771 --> 01:55:16.401
they were on tour.

3785
01:55:16.401 --> 01:55:19.730
You would see here guys get up in the middle of the night and grabbed their bike

3786
01:55:19.731 --> 01:55:22.160
and hear them pull their bike off the bus and go for a ride.

3787
01:55:22.190 --> 01:55:23.750
They had to because the,

3788
01:55:23.751 --> 01:55:26.090
the blood was pooling up in their body.

3789
01:55:26.091 --> 01:55:28.100
Their body is producing so much red blood cells.

3790
01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:30.650
You literally have to go out and burn some of it off.

3791
01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:33.110
He said it was pretty crazy and dangerous stuff.

3792
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:35.890
It's called Earth throw.

3793
01:55:35.891 --> 01:55:36.724
Pull,

3794
01:55:37.070 --> 01:55:38.990
pull point a 10 here,

3795
01:55:39.130 --> 01:55:40.400
throw pointin.

3796
01:55:40.890 --> 01:55:43.500
I'll spell it for Y,

3797
01:55:43.501 --> 01:55:44.370
T.

3798
01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:44.941
H R o p.

3799
01:55:44.941 --> 01:55:46.050
O.

3800
01:55:46.050 --> 01:55:46.050
I.

3801
01:55:46.050 --> 01:55:46.621
N e T.

3802
01:55:46.621 --> 01:55:49.440
I n earth row prior to Roe.

3803
01:55:49.770 --> 01:55:52.020
What pointing here regardless.

3804
01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:55.560
So what did they do is just pretend this is something you just take as an

3805
01:55:55.561 --> 01:55:58.880
injectable and then it creates red blood cells live.

3806
01:55:58.890 --> 01:55:58.990
You,

3807
01:55:58.990 --> 01:55:59.880
it's okay.

3808
01:55:59.881 --> 01:56:04.620
It's a glyco protein hormone that controls earth though.

3809
01:56:04.621 --> 01:56:08.010
Poisonous or red blood cell production.

3810
01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:11.970
It's a cytokine protein signaling monocle,

3811
01:56:12.010 --> 01:56:13.050
a molecule,

3812
01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:14.320
um,

3813
01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:18.480
and the precursors in the bone marrow and human EPO is a molecular weight of

3814
01:56:18.481 --> 01:56:19.470
34,000.

3815
01:56:19.471 --> 01:56:19.790
But it's,

3816
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:21.290
is this legal for,

3817
01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:22.590
for any sport at all?

3818
01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:22.861
No,

3819
01:56:22.861 --> 01:56:23.341
it is not,

3820
01:56:23.341 --> 01:56:24.450
but it's not,

3821
01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:29.740
it wasn't as far as really recently tested for and fighting in the UFC at what?

3822
01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.850
They weren't testing it for the Nevada state athletic commission.

3823
01:56:32.851 --> 01:56:34.230
They weren't testing it for boxers.

3824
01:56:34.530 --> 01:56:35.580
But then,

3825
01:56:35.630 --> 01:56:36.160
um,

3826
01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:37.350
some Bob boxer,

3827
01:56:37.351 --> 01:56:39.840
I believe it was sugar Shane Mosley got caught for it.

3828
01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:44.190
You got caught for something else to stellar crew.

3829
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.331
Well,

3830
01:56:45.331 --> 01:56:45.780
you know,

3831
01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:46.021
look,

3832
01:56:46.021 --> 01:56:46.854
these guys are,

3833
01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:47.241
they're,

3834
01:56:47.241 --> 01:56:49.680
they're health is on the line when they're fighting,

3835
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:50.131
you know,

3836
01:56:50.131 --> 01:56:50.490
I mean,

3837
01:56:50.490 --> 01:56:52.740
you gotta think if you have a little more endurance,

3838
01:56:52.741 --> 01:56:53.850
if you have a little more strength,

3839
01:56:53.851 --> 01:56:55.410
it could keep you from getting knocked out.

3840
01:56:55.411 --> 01:56:57.000
It can keep you from getting beaten,

3841
01:56:57.001 --> 01:57:01.080
they could sure certainly make your odds of success much higher.

3842
01:57:01.470 --> 01:57:02.430
And so a lot of guys,

3843
01:57:02.431 --> 01:57:03.980
I think even though it is cheating,

3844
01:57:04.030 --> 01:57:06.600
they look at it pragmatically and then they look at the fact that,

3845
01:57:06.601 --> 01:57:06.960
look,

3846
01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:11.010
most of these guys are taking things including Floyd Mayweather who always is

3847
01:57:11.011 --> 01:57:13.190
going off about people being um,

3848
01:57:13.230 --> 01:57:13.561
you know,

3849
01:57:13.561 --> 01:57:15.420
on drugs and all these different things flipped.

3850
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:19.110
It turns out he had accidentally ingested some performance enhancing stuff.

3851
01:57:19.670 --> 01:57:22.890
Maybe some sort of a deal to keep all that quiet.

3852
01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:24.300
Yeah.

3853
01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:26.160
Accidentally ingested that.

3854
01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:29.820
I'll tell you exactly if you want to know it's in a cold medicine,

3855
01:57:30.330 --> 01:57:30.811
clearly.

3856
01:57:30.811 --> 01:57:31.320
Yeah.

3857
01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:31.771
Well there's,

3858
01:57:31.771 --> 01:57:33.240
there's accidental,

3859
01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:33.900
um,

3860
01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:34.733
uh,

3861
01:57:34.890 --> 01:57:39.890
there's accidental consumption through supplements that you buy like Gnc.

3862
01:57:40.050 --> 01:57:40.440
Sure.

3863
01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:42.690
A lot of times they actually have supplements.

3864
01:57:42.691 --> 01:57:44.970
What you're buying that actually have steroids in them.

3865
01:57:45.390 --> 01:57:46.290
Like Brian was,

3866
01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:47.310
we on the show,

3867
01:57:47.311 --> 01:57:49.200
he's reviewed all these Dick Pills.

3868
01:57:49.201 --> 01:57:51.120
You know those Dick Pills that you get at a gas station,

3869
01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:52.253
see them?

3870
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:53.311
A lot of them,

3871
01:57:53.311 --> 01:57:56.880
a good percentage of them are actually like either Cialis or Viagra.

3872
01:57:56.881 --> 01:58:01.290
They buy it in bulk form and it's actually cheap to sell and you mix it up with

3873
01:58:01.291 --> 01:58:04.050
some fucking wacky herbs and he sell it over the counter.

3874
01:58:04.051 --> 01:58:07.890
And these gas stations that do not give a fuck these 24 gas stations in the

3875
01:58:07.891 --> 01:58:08.724
middle of nowhere,

3876
01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:13.650
they'll sell these things and it's profitable and really effective because they

3877
01:58:13.651 --> 01:58:15.300
actually do work well.

3878
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:17.550
They do do that with steroids.

3879
01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:20.760
Like there have been many supplement companies that have been caught and it

3880
01:58:20.761 --> 01:58:24.180
turns out that like athletes took their stuff and then tested positive for

3881
01:58:24.181 --> 01:58:27.960
steroids and then they'll take that stuff and they'll bring it to a lab and they

3882
01:58:27.961 --> 01:58:28.051
go,

3883
01:58:28.051 --> 01:58:28.321
yeah,

3884
01:58:28.321 --> 01:58:29.340
there's steroids in there.

3885
01:58:29.490 --> 01:58:30.051
Like they're,

3886
01:58:30.051 --> 01:58:33.870
they have illegally porch steroids and other supplements to make them effective.

3887
01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:35.430
So Floyd Mayweather,

3888
01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:37.470
a performance enhancing drug test.

3889
01:58:38.050 --> 01:58:41.230
Well that used to happen all the time with sudafed and the shorter thing.

3890
01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:42.093
Yeah.

3891
01:58:42.670 --> 01:58:43.150
Yeah.

3892
01:58:43.150 --> 01:58:44.680
It used to happen with sudafed.

3893
01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:45.100
Yeah.

3894
01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:46.090
We may really got caught.

3895
01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:49.080
What did he gets it positive three times for PE days.

3896
01:58:49.190 --> 01:58:49.410
They,

3897
01:58:49.410 --> 01:58:51.520
they don't have listed what he,

3898
01:58:51.521 --> 01:58:51.761
uh,

3899
01:58:51.761 --> 01:58:52.594
what he took,

3900
01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:53.890
but it's hilarious.

3901
01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:56.800
A lot of those guys are on things.

3902
01:58:57.480 --> 01:58:59.950
Good high percentage and if they're not on that,

3903
01:58:59.951 --> 01:59:01.000
you know what they are on.

3904
01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:03.610
Almost everyone is taking supplements,

3905
01:59:03.611 --> 01:59:08.611
whether it's a creatine or protein or vitamins or you know,

3906
01:59:09.191 --> 01:59:10.030
whatever Beta,

3907
01:59:10.031 --> 01:59:10.781
Alanine,

3908
01:59:10.781 --> 01:59:11.171
whatever,

3909
01:59:11.171 --> 01:59:15.850
like legal stuff that making a big difference in the ring for example.

3910
01:59:16.070 --> 01:59:18.040
Maybe not a big difference but a difference.

3911
01:59:18.070 --> 01:59:20.440
It certainly there's stuff that you can take.

3912
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:24.250
Cordyceps mushrooms has a a very profound effect on endurance.

3913
01:59:24.610 --> 01:59:25.181
That's real.

3914
01:59:25.181 --> 01:59:25.691
That's legit.

3915
01:59:25.691 --> 01:59:26.471
I've taken that stuff.

3916
01:59:26.471 --> 01:59:28.210
There's a product called shroom tech sport.

3917
01:59:28.211 --> 01:59:32.260
Then my company actually sells that is it's based on the quarter steps of

3918
01:59:32.261 --> 01:59:32.590
mushroom.

3919
01:59:32.590 --> 01:59:35.380
There's stuff that you can take that does work and how much,

3920
01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:36.513
how much,

3921
01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:38.020
how does it register for you?

3922
01:59:38.021 --> 01:59:38.321
How do you,

3923
01:59:38.321 --> 01:59:40.960
can you tell that you get a little burst of energy or,

3924
01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:41.171
yeah,

3925
01:59:41.171 --> 01:59:46.171
just tell like I'd normally we'll be at a certain level of exhaustion to work

3926
01:59:46.221 --> 01:59:46.421
out,

3927
01:59:46.421 --> 01:59:48.820
but I'll feel like I have extra energy because of taking this stuff.

3928
01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:50.050
There's also beat 12 in it,

3929
01:59:50.051 --> 01:59:51.700
which has definitely been shown to be effective.

3930
01:59:51.850 --> 01:59:52.870
So the factor,

3931
01:59:52.871 --> 01:59:53.800
all that stuff in like beach,

3932
01:59:53.801 --> 01:59:57.730
well which a lot of athletes will take an injectable form before performance

3933
01:59:57.731 --> 01:59:58.001
cause it,

3934
01:59:58.001 --> 01:59:59.020
it enhances your,

3935
01:59:59.021 --> 01:59:59.291
your,

3936
01:59:59.291 --> 02:00:01.390
your energy and your ability to sustain energy.

3937
02:00:01.570 --> 02:00:01.871
But B,

3938
02:00:01.871 --> 02:00:02.680
12 is legal.

3939
02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:03.513
So all these things,

3940
02:00:03.640 --> 02:00:08.640
it becomes a matter of like if you throw in a cocktail of all these legal things

3941
02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:12.100
that can enhance performance that you're allowed to do,

3942
02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:13.840
how much of a bump does it give you?

3943
02:00:14.050 --> 02:00:15.490
Does it give you a 5% bump?

3944
02:00:15.550 --> 02:00:16.900
It might be a 10% bump.

3945
02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:22.140
It might mean at what point is it performance enhancing and well when you take a

3946
02:00:22.241 --> 02:00:25.300
steroid and it gets to 50% is that where everybody draws the line?

3947
02:00:25.810 --> 02:00:26.430
I don't know.

3948
02:00:26.430 --> 02:00:26.630
It's,

3949
02:00:26.630 --> 02:00:26.960
it's,

3950
02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:31.960
it's to be a strange day when a regular person is more fit and,

3951
02:00:32.921 --> 02:00:33.760
and more,

3952
02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:38.110
more capable than professional athletes who are natural because a regular person

3953
02:00:38.290 --> 02:00:41.710
is going to have gone in for gene therapy the way a girl goes in for a nose job

3954
02:00:41.711 --> 02:00:43.090
today cause that's,

3955
02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:44.200
that's going to happen.

3956
02:00:44.230 --> 02:00:45.400
It's just going to,

3957
02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:45.890
if,

3958
02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:48.010
if the human race stays alive,

3959
02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:49.930
if we don't get hit in the head by a media,

3960
02:00:50.110 --> 02:00:51.580
if we don't blow ourselves up,

3961
02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:54.640
there's gonna come a point in time within the next couple of decades where

3962
02:00:54.641 --> 02:00:58.690
you're going to be able to change the molecular structure of your body.

3963
02:00:58.810 --> 02:01:02.620
You're going to be able to reformulate how your body is shaped.

3964
02:01:02.850 --> 02:01:04.450
You're going to change your genetics,

3965
02:01:04.570 --> 02:01:09.520
you're going to change all sorts of aspects of the way your body performs and

3966
02:01:09.521 --> 02:01:13.240
regular people are going to be able to get it just like a regular person now has

3967
02:01:13.390 --> 02:01:14.380
in their pocket,

3968
02:01:14.381 --> 02:01:15.370
in the cell phone,

3969
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:19.930
a computer processor that's greater than the computer processes that they used

3970
02:01:20.050 --> 02:01:22.480
and the Apollo 11 moon Lanch launch.

3971
02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:23.311
It's we,

3972
02:01:23.311 --> 02:01:23.551
we,

3973
02:01:23.551 --> 02:01:24.251
we have now,

3974
02:01:24.251 --> 02:01:27.970
it's like we have nuttiness and our pocket and we use it for what,

3975
02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:29.140
whatever the fuck you want.

3976
02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:32.080
But it's like in that 50 years,

3977
02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:33.033
you know,

3978
02:01:33.070 --> 02:01:33.520
from,

3979
02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:33.960
from,

3980
02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:34.510
you know,

3981
02:01:34.510 --> 02:01:39.510
1960 whenever it was to now imagine that amount of time going by from now into

3982
02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:42.674
the future.

3983
02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:47.540
I can't imagine a time where we're not doing some sort of crazy genetic

3984
02:01:47.570 --> 02:01:50.030
experiments were literally from this moment on.

3985
02:01:50.031 --> 02:01:50.500
Yeah.

3986
02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:50.750
Yeah.

3987
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:51.680
I can't imagine it.

3988
02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:52.370
It's gotta.

3989
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:54.500
It's gotta be happening in secret to,

3990
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:55.100
yeah,

3991
02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:56.420
behind closed doors.

3992
02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:57.530
There's a conspiracy.

3993
02:01:57.540 --> 02:01:58.940
So planet of the apes type Shit.

3994
02:01:58.970 --> 02:02:02.330
That's what we got to look out for that make some hybrid human chimpanzee

3995
02:02:02.331 --> 02:02:04.820
murderers like some soylent green shit.

3996
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:06.500
He just dropped them off in Russia.

3997
02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:08.293
You know?

3998
02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:09.620
That's possible.

3999
02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:10.843
Crazy fucks.

4000
02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:11.330
I mean,

4001
02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:13.440
when you think about what what we do,

4002
02:02:13.441 --> 02:02:15.240
if we send troops to another country,

4003
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:15.631
you know,

4004
02:02:15.631 --> 02:02:18.360
and what you're doing is you're guaranteeing that someone over there is going to

4005
02:02:18.361 --> 02:02:18.780
die.

4006
02:02:18.780 --> 02:02:19.140
Right.

4007
02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:19.321
You're,

4008
02:02:19.321 --> 02:02:19.561
you're,

4009
02:02:19.561 --> 02:02:20.640
you're definitely doing that.

4010
02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:22.290
If you could train a,

4011
02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:26.970
some sort of a chimpanzee that you've created in a laboratory and teach them how

4012
02:02:26.971 --> 02:02:30.450
to shoot a gun and send them over there and tell him to eat babies and shoot

4013
02:02:30.451 --> 02:02:31.284
people,

4014
02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:32.780
you don't think they would do it.

4015
02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:33.050
Joe,

4016
02:02:33.050 --> 02:02:36.560
what do you think about that trainee that's kind of fight in the MMA?

4017
02:02:36.650 --> 02:02:37.483
I was going to bring it up

4018
02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:43.250
from a baby eating cannibal monkeys.

4019
02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:46.210
Maybe there was a,

4020
02:02:46.770 --> 02:02:47.540
well,

4021
02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:48.980
she calls herself a woman,

4022
02:02:49.210 --> 02:02:51.220
but I tend to disagree.

4023
02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:52.360
And uh,

4024
02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:52.960
she,

4025
02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:53.440
um,

4026
02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:54.760
she used to be a man,

4027
02:02:54.940 --> 02:02:56.410
but now she has had,

4028
02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:57.910
she's a transgender,

4029
02:02:57.970 --> 02:03:01.210
which is a official term that means you've gone through it,

4030
02:03:01.211 --> 02:03:01.780
right.

4031
02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:02.171
And,

4032
02:03:02.171 --> 02:03:02.350
uh,

4033
02:03:02.350 --> 02:03:05.140
she wants to be able to fight women and a,

4034
02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:05.980
in MMA,

4035
02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:07.510
I say no fucking way.

4036
02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:11.380
I say if you had a dick at one point in time,

4037
02:03:11.530 --> 02:03:15.040
you also have all the bone structure that comes with having a Dick.

4038
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:16.840
You have bigger hands,

4039
02:03:16.841 --> 02:03:18.820
you have bigger shoulder joints.

4040
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:20.500
You're a fucking man and there,

4041
02:03:20.501 --> 02:03:21.400
that's her right there.

4042
02:03:21.401 --> 02:03:22.270
That's a man.

4043
02:03:22.630 --> 02:03:23.463
Okay.

4044
02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:24.910
You can't have that.

4045
02:03:24.970 --> 02:03:26.170
I don't care if you don't have a degree.

4046
02:03:26.230 --> 02:03:26.610
Yeah.

4047
02:03:26.610 --> 02:03:27.421
That looks like,

4048
02:03:27.421 --> 02:03:29.790
that looks like a guy's carriage there,

4049
02:03:29.791 --> 02:03:30.624
right?

4050
02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:31.241
Yeah.

4051
02:03:31.241 --> 02:03:32.680
You can't fight women.

4052
02:03:32.710 --> 02:03:34.180
That's fucking crazy.

4053
02:03:34.181 --> 02:03:36.700
I don't know why she thinks that she's going to be able to do that.

4054
02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:42.100
If you want to be a woman in the bedroom and you know you want to play house and

4055
02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:43.811
all that other shit,

4056
02:03:43.811 --> 02:03:44.471
and you know,

4057
02:03:44.471 --> 02:03:45.281
you feel like you have,

4058
02:03:45.281 --> 02:03:45.670
uh,

4059
02:03:45.670 --> 02:03:45.940
your,

4060
02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:47.570
your body is really Oh,

4061
02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:50.290
a woman's body trapped inside a man's frame.

4062
02:03:50.291 --> 02:03:52.720
And so you've got an operation that's all good in the hood.

4063
02:03:52.930 --> 02:03:53.530
But what,

4064
02:03:53.530 --> 02:03:56.350
you can't fight chicks get the fuck outta here.

4065
02:03:56.351 --> 02:03:57.460
You're out of your mind.

4066
02:03:57.700 --> 02:03:58.900
You need to fight men,

4067
02:03:59.170 --> 02:03:59.471
you know,

4068
02:03:59.471 --> 02:04:00.304
period.

4069
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:02.770
You need to fight man your size because you're a man.

4070
02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:04.030
You're a man without a dick.

4071
02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:06.670
And I don't know what that dude next to you on the left.

4072
02:04:06.970 --> 02:04:10.600
I Dunno what the fuck he's trying to convince himself of.

4073
02:04:10.990 --> 02:04:12.400
I don't know what he's saying right now.

4074
02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:13.240
I don't need to hear it.

4075
02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:14.770
I'm looking at a man with a dress.

4076
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:15.341
Okay.

4077
02:04:15.341 --> 02:04:16.210
And you don't,

4078
02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:18.490
you could act as a woman.

4079
02:04:18.491 --> 02:04:19.780
I will call you a her.

4080
02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:20.501
I will.

4081
02:04:20.501 --> 02:04:20.860
Uh,

4082
02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:21.371
but treat,

4083
02:04:21.371 --> 02:04:22.630
I will call you ma'am.

4084
02:04:22.810 --> 02:04:23.890
I'll be respectful.

4085
02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:28.980
But you can't fight women when you have a man's frame period.

4086
02:04:29.021 --> 02:04:29.260
Yeah.

4087
02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:30.670
Women aren't that wide.

4088
02:04:30.730 --> 02:04:33.430
That generates to increased punching power.

4089
02:04:33.610 --> 02:04:36.520
Women don't have that sort of muscle structure.

4090
02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:38.280
I don't what you're doing.

4091
02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:39.090
I don't know.

4092
02:04:39.090 --> 02:04:41.550
You mean obviously if you're trans operational,

4093
02:04:41.551 --> 02:04:43.050
it means you remove your testicles.

4094
02:04:43.051 --> 02:04:45.450
So your body's not producing testosterone anymore.

4095
02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:47.550
I Dunno if you're supplementing testosterone,

4096
02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:48.030
why?

4097
02:04:48.030 --> 02:04:48.721
If you haven't,

4098
02:04:48.721 --> 02:04:51.150
if your body's not producing testosterone while your arms so big,

4099
02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:52.110
what's going on here?

4100
02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:52.881
You know there's a,

4101
02:04:52.881 --> 02:04:54.610
there's a lot of shit going on there and you,

4102
02:04:54.611 --> 02:04:57.270
you can't fight women no fucking way.

4103
02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:58.633
I agree with that.

4104
02:04:59.490 --> 02:05:02.460
Finding women that looks like a guy,

4105
02:05:02.490 --> 02:05:04.110
that's a guy's carriage there.

4106
02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:05.341
Well not only that,

4107
02:05:05.341 --> 02:05:08.070
she's won two fights by brutal knockout.

4108
02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:10.740
So she's fighting women whose,

4109
02:05:10.741 --> 02:05:11.820
whose divisions?

4110
02:05:11.821 --> 02:05:12.211
Who's,

4111
02:05:12.211 --> 02:05:13.044
uh,

4112
02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:14.161
who's fight game?

4113
02:05:14.161 --> 02:05:15.610
Is she participating in the,

4114
02:05:15.690 --> 02:05:16.350
exactly.

4115
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:17.280
There's variety.

4116
02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:20.640
There's a variety of small companies that,

4117
02:05:20.670 --> 02:05:21.503
um,

4118
02:05:21.570 --> 02:05:22.021
that are,

4119
02:05:22.021 --> 02:05:22.251
uh,

4120
02:05:22.251 --> 02:05:22.490
uh,

4121
02:05:22.490 --> 02:05:23.221
willing to,

4122
02:05:23.221 --> 02:05:23.431
uh,

4123
02:05:23.431 --> 02:05:25.200
allow a person like this to fight.

4124
02:05:25.230 --> 02:05:26.790
I say it's fucked up.

4125
02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:26.981
You,

4126
02:05:26.981 --> 02:05:28.920
you can't fight women.

4127
02:05:29.070 --> 02:05:29.903
You can't.

4128
02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:31.800
And there just to look at her record,

4129
02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:34.890
she's crushed two women inside the first round.

4130
02:05:35.070 --> 02:05:35.431
I mean,

4131
02:05:35.431 --> 02:05:35.700
she,

4132
02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:36.240
she,

4133
02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:37.880
she's crushing these letters there.

4134
02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:38.753
What is your weight?

4135
02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:39.870
One 45.

4136
02:05:39.930 --> 02:05:44.010
She knocked out this chicken 39 seconds with a vicious knee to the head.

4137
02:05:44.230 --> 02:05:44.731
Man.

4138
02:05:44.731 --> 02:05:46.830
She looks like she's really in shape.

4139
02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:47.250
Them.

4140
02:05:47.250 --> 02:05:47.471
Look,

4141
02:05:47.471 --> 02:05:48.450
she's huge.

4142
02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:49.880
She's not just huge.

4143
02:05:49.881 --> 02:05:51.270
He's got a fucking man's face.

4144
02:05:51.590 --> 02:05:51.871
I mean,

4145
02:05:51.871 --> 02:05:53.310
you can wear all the lipstick you want.

4146
02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:57.030
You want to be a woman and you want to take female hormones.

4147
02:05:57.031 --> 02:05:58.080
You want to get a boob job.

4148
02:05:58.260 --> 02:05:59.160
That's all fine.

4149
02:05:59.161 --> 02:05:59.291
I,

4150
02:05:59.291 --> 02:06:01.410
I support your life to live.

4151
02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:03.000
You're right to live as a woman.

4152
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:05.610
What about her fighting guys in five guys?

4153
02:06:05.670 --> 02:06:06.360
Yes.

4154
02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:07.110
She has to fight guy.

4155
02:06:07.110 --> 02:06:07.561
It's not,

4156
02:06:07.561 --> 02:06:07.921
first of all,

4157
02:06:07.921 --> 02:06:08.880
she's not really a shape.

4158
02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:10.620
She's transgender.

4159
02:06:10.710 --> 02:06:12.840
A postdoc person.

4160
02:06:12.990 --> 02:06:15.690
So she supposedly after the operation.

4161
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:16.230
Yeah,

4162
02:06:16.230 --> 02:06:18.690
the operation doesn't shave down your bone density.

4163
02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:19.740
It doesn't change.

4164
02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:22.800
You look at a man's hands and you look at a woman's hands and they're,

4165
02:06:22.830 --> 02:06:23.880
they're built different,

4166
02:06:23.881 --> 02:06:24.840
they're just thicker.

4167
02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:25.860
They're stronger.

4168
02:06:25.950 --> 02:06:27.060
Your risks are thicker,

4169
02:06:27.061 --> 02:06:28.290
your elbows are thicker,

4170
02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:30.080
your joints are thicker.

4171
02:06:30.081 --> 02:06:30.400
The,

4172
02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:35.400
the just the mechanical function of punching the a man can do it much harder

4173
02:06:35.521 --> 02:06:36.241
than a woman can.

4174
02:06:36.241 --> 02:06:36.870
Period.

4175
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:37.481
He looks slow.

4176
02:06:37.481 --> 02:06:41.940
So like he's been doing a athletics since he was nothing years old.

4177
02:06:42.150 --> 02:06:46.200
You don't just start boxing and then that's what you look like.

4178
02:06:46.530 --> 02:06:47.221
And uh,

4179
02:06:47.221 --> 02:06:51.930
I got to imagine there's a lot of female fighters out there who are relatively

4180
02:06:51.931 --> 02:06:54.750
new to the game within the last five suburbs.

4181
02:06:54.780 --> 02:06:55.440
And I am,

4182
02:06:55.440 --> 02:07:00.060
I support 100% anyone's right to be transgender.

4183
02:07:00.090 --> 02:07:01.650
This is not where it lies with me.

4184
02:07:01.651 --> 02:07:03.360
Like I'm not a prejudice person.

4185
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:05.280
I don't know what you feel in your body.

4186
02:07:05.281 --> 02:07:08.070
I don't know if you really are a woman trapped in a man's body.

4187
02:07:08.071 --> 02:07:10.500
I'm support your right to do whatever you want to do.

4188
02:07:10.770 --> 02:07:11.370
Go for it.

4189
02:07:11.370 --> 02:07:12.870
If that's what makes you happy,

4190
02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:15.420
I would not try to stop that at all.

4191
02:07:15.421 --> 02:07:17.100
And I support it 100%.

4192
02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:22.400
The real issue comes with violent competition with women and the reality of the

4193
02:07:23.851 --> 02:07:25.650
physical structure of your body.

4194
02:07:25.890 --> 02:07:28.620
The reality of the physical physical structure is not fair.

4195
02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:33.000
You can't say that 145 pound woman and 145 pound man art.

4196
02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:34.440
Even that's like saying,

4197
02:07:34.710 --> 02:07:35.440
uh,

4198
02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:35.831
you know,

4199
02:07:35.831 --> 02:07:40.831
a 30 pound poodle and a 30 pound pit bull or just two dogs cause they're not,

4200
02:07:41.711 --> 02:07:43.330
one of them is distributed.

4201
02:07:43.331 --> 02:07:45.310
It's mass in a quite a different way.

4202
02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:49.750
It's built for quite a different purpose and men are built for smashing shit.

4203
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.411
Women,

4204
02:07:50.411 --> 02:07:55.411
women are built for getting held down and by the stronger a male monkey and you

4205
02:07:55.781 --> 02:07:56.051
know,

4206
02:07:56.051 --> 02:08:01.051
and women are built for carrying babies and doing work and whatever other non

4207
02:08:01.570 --> 02:08:05.230
hyper explosive physical things you would want to do with your body.

4208
02:08:05.230 --> 02:08:09.160
But they're not built for hyper explosive physical violence.

4209
02:08:09.161 --> 02:08:09.994
They're just not.

4210
02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:10.780
That's,

4211
02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:12.730
they have more dainty frames.

4212
02:08:12.731 --> 02:08:15.160
The hands are smaller and even if they are big,

4213
02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:15.941
they're not big.

4214
02:08:15.941 --> 02:08:16.960
Like a big man is.

4215
02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:18.040
It's not fair.

4216
02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:18.880
And it's not,

4217
02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:21.010
I'm not trying to discriminate against women in any way,

4218
02:08:21.011 --> 02:08:21.790
shape or form.

4219
02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:23.830
And I'm a big supporter of women's fighting.

4220
02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:25.960
I'd loved watching that and lump Ronda Rousey,

4221
02:08:25.961 --> 02:08:27.430
Liz Carmouche Carmouche fight.

4222
02:08:27.610 --> 02:08:28.840
But those are actual women.

4223
02:08:29.230 --> 02:08:30.310
There's an actual women.

4224
02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:32.440
And as strong as Ronda Rousey looks,

4225
02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:34.080
she still looks to me like a,

4226
02:08:34.081 --> 02:08:35.140
a pretty girl.

4227
02:08:35.290 --> 02:08:37.570
She's a beautiful girl who happens to be strong.

4228
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.961
There's,

4229
02:08:37.961 --> 02:08:38.800
she's a girl.

4230
02:08:39.010 --> 02:08:40.090
This is not a girl.

4231
02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:40.811
Okay.

4232
02:08:40.811 --> 02:08:42.640
This is a transgender woman.

4233
02:08:42.700 --> 02:08:46.030
It's a totally different right away.

4234
02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:49.240
Some of the usual stuff that haunts this kind of thing.

4235
02:08:49.241 --> 02:08:52.300
Like women's bodybuilding or women's boxing.

4236
02:08:52.550 --> 02:08:53.081
It's fighting.

4237
02:08:53.081 --> 02:08:56.800
Or how about some crazy dude who wants to beat the fuck out of chick so he gets

4238
02:08:56.801 --> 02:08:57.850
his dick chopped off.

4239
02:08:58.210 --> 02:09:00.670
I mean that's not outside the realm of possibility.

4240
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:02.740
There's a lot of suicidal fucks out there.

4241
02:09:02.741 --> 02:09:04.630
There's a lot of people that are like on the edge anyway,

4242
02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:06.110
like getting your Dick chopped off,

4243
02:09:06.130 --> 02:09:06.401
you know,

4244
02:09:06.401 --> 02:09:07.660
you're going to pay attention to me.

4245
02:09:07.690 --> 02:09:07.931
Okay,

4246
02:09:07.931 --> 02:09:08.800
I'll chop my dick off.

4247
02:09:08.801 --> 02:09:09.970
I'll be a girl for a while.

4248
02:09:10.050 --> 02:09:10.600
Like there,

4249
02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:14.620
there's people out there that are fucking crazy and you can't let him fight

4250
02:09:14.621 --> 02:09:16.140
girls grant.

4251
02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:16.871
I agree.

4252
02:09:16.871 --> 02:09:19.780
And is she trying to get into the real uh,

4253
02:09:19.810 --> 02:09:21.130
the real fight game?

4254
02:09:21.131 --> 02:09:21.430
Well,

4255
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.941
yes,

4256
02:09:21.941 --> 02:09:22.331
she wants,

4257
02:09:22.331 --> 02:09:22.960
she's doing what?

4258
02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:23.741
She's in the,

4259
02:09:23.741 --> 02:09:24.760
the CFA,

4260
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:25.490
which is a,

4261
02:09:25.490 --> 02:09:28.240
a smaller but legit organization.

4262
02:09:28.241 --> 02:09:28.341
I've,

4263
02:09:28.341 --> 02:09:33.341
I've heard of this organization and I think they actually broadcast on sometimes

4264
02:09:35.201 --> 02:09:36.250
they broadcast on a,

4265
02:09:36.251 --> 02:09:38.890
on cable television so you can watch this fight.

4266
02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:39.730
Um,

4267
02:09:39.730 --> 02:09:41.250
the CFA is uh,

4268
02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:41.770
you know,

4269
02:09:41.770 --> 02:09:42.091
there,

4270
02:09:42.091 --> 02:09:46.990
there are legit like farm organization I would say our IB organization that has

4271
02:09:46.991 --> 02:09:47.771
talented fighters,

4272
02:09:47.771 --> 02:09:49.930
guys that are coming up and you know,

4273
02:09:49.931 --> 02:09:50.201
it's,

4274
02:09:50.201 --> 02:09:50.651
it's a,

4275
02:09:50.651 --> 02:09:51.880
it's a good organization.

4276
02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:53.073
I just don't,

4277
02:09:53.110 --> 02:09:56.410
I don't agree with the athletic commission letting this happen.

4278
02:09:56.620 --> 02:09:58.990
Is the athletic commission letting something happen?

4279
02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:03.940
I don't know if either is that or they're doing these things on Indian grounds.

4280
02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.400
If they do them in Indian reservations,

4281
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:10.450
which we used to do all the old a MMA fights like the king of the cage.

4282
02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:13.240
We used to have to go to watch those at Indian reservation.

4283
02:10:13.241 --> 02:10:15.010
We used to go way out in the middle of nowhere.

4284
02:10:15.070 --> 02:10:19.440
A lot of them even took place outdoors and those days are,

4285
02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:23.830
you still can see in places that don't have sanctioning,

4286
02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:25.090
you still can see.

4287
02:10:25.091 --> 02:10:28.480
And then they fights at Indian reservations that go by like really wacky rules.

4288
02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:30.190
Like you wear shoes and you know,

4289
02:10:30.191 --> 02:10:34.250
this guy hasn't trained at all and this guy is at 45 and you know the those

4290
02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:35.390
mismatches and stuff,

4291
02:10:35.391 --> 02:10:38.630
those can still take place because they don't have athletic commissions.

4292
02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:39.530
Gotcha.

4293
02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:43.160
They might have athletic commissions and they also might have a bunch of people

4294
02:10:43.161 --> 02:10:46.130
that are on steroids and nobody testing like you don't really know what you're

4295
02:10:46.131 --> 02:10:49.490
going to get because they're their own sort of sovereign nation.

4296
02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:51.950
You know when you're on Indian land,

4297
02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:53.690
if you are on native American land,

4298
02:10:53.810 --> 02:10:56.660
when you were in a reservation that they essentially can make their own athletic

4299
02:10:56.661 --> 02:10:58.550
commission eve if it's illegal.

4300
02:10:58.551 --> 02:10:59.384
In California,

4301
02:10:59.570 --> 02:11:03.170
they were still holding fights and King of the cage all throughout that illegal

4302
02:11:03.171 --> 02:11:03.830
time.

4303
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:05.960
All of it was being done on Indian reservations.

4304
02:11:06.650 --> 02:11:07.130
Why?

4305
02:11:07.130 --> 02:11:08.480
Why on Indian reservations?

4306
02:11:08.481 --> 02:11:10.020
Just because it's a sovereign state,

4307
02:11:10.710 --> 02:11:12.170
they can do whatever the fuck they want.

4308
02:11:12.171 --> 02:11:13.520
That's how they have casinos,

4309
02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:13.971
you know?

4310
02:11:13.971 --> 02:11:16.400
It's like when prostitution legal then on that,

4311
02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:17.600
I don't think they want that.

4312
02:11:17.630 --> 02:11:20.580
I don't think they want that crazy Indian out there that has a bonus.

4313
02:11:20.580 --> 02:11:23.390
He's got his own hookers and he's got his own stable.

4314
02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:24.890
Those guys have so much money too.

4315
02:11:25.150 --> 02:11:25.341
I mean,

4316
02:11:25.341 --> 02:11:26.570
but basically happened was,

4317
02:11:26.571 --> 02:11:26.781
you know,

4318
02:11:26.781 --> 02:11:28.440
the United States or you know,

4319
02:11:28.490 --> 02:11:33.490
the founding humans that traveled across the United States when they like

4320
02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:38.300
essentially caused genocide on the North American or native American Indian

4321
02:11:38.301 --> 02:11:39.134
population.

4322
02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:40.273
They,

4323
02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:43.070
what they did was they granted them some patches of land.

4324
02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:43.341
You know,

4325
02:11:43.341 --> 02:11:44.360
these reservations,

4326
02:11:44.361 --> 02:11:45.350
they fucked them over.

4327
02:11:45.351 --> 02:11:47.210
They got smaller and smaller over the years,

4328
02:11:47.211 --> 02:11:50.420
but some of them still remained into the 20th century.

4329
02:11:50.421 --> 02:11:51.620
And that's when these guys said,

4330
02:11:51.650 --> 02:11:51.771
well,

4331
02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:52.521
this is our land.

4332
02:11:52.521 --> 02:11:52.641
Right?

4333
02:11:52.641 --> 02:11:53.960
Then we have our own little nation.

4334
02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:56.750
What about a casino and a,

4335
02:11:56.751 --> 02:11:57.111
yeah,

4336
02:11:57.111 --> 02:11:58.400
I guess you could do whatever you want.

4337
02:11:58.401 --> 02:11:58.941
So boom,

4338
02:11:58.941 --> 02:11:59.660
Foxwoods,

4339
02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:03.890
all these different places where it was illegal to have casinos got tremendous

4340
02:12:03.891 --> 02:12:04.461
success.

4341
02:12:04.461 --> 02:12:07.130
Just putting casinos on these Indian lands.

4342
02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:07.730
I remember.

4343
02:12:07.730 --> 02:12:08.031
Yeah.

4344
02:12:08.031 --> 02:12:10.310
So if this chick fights on Indian land,

4345
02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:11.480
I guess she can do,

4346
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:12.710
they could do whatever you want.

4347
02:12:12.710 --> 02:12:16.310
I don't see the Nevada state athletic commission allowing a woman to fight a man

4348
02:12:16.311 --> 02:12:16.910
though.

4349
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:17.930
Even the transgender,

4350
02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:19.970
a transgender woman still.

4351
02:12:20.810 --> 02:12:22.890
It's so well known that no,

4352
02:12:22.930 --> 02:12:23.220
she,

4353
02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:24.200
she's not going to,

4354
02:12:24.410 --> 02:12:26.970
there's a 50 year old guy that is um,

4355
02:12:27.110 --> 02:12:32.110
in high school or in college rather playing women's basketball.

4356
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:33.620
He's 50,

4357
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:37.430
he's like six foot fucking something or another.

4358
02:12:37.670 --> 02:12:38.720
This guy's a,

4359
02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:40.400
he's six foot six.

4360
02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:41.293
Okay.

4361
02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:43.670
And he's 230 pounds.

4362
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:48.910
He's a giant motherfucker and he's playing competitive basketball and these 18

4363
02:12:50.421 --> 02:12:51.560
to 20 year old women.

4364
02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:54.230
So he's in college,

4365
02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:55.400
he's 50.

4366
02:12:55.401 --> 02:12:57.020
He's got a Dick hacked off.

4367
02:12:57.230 --> 02:12:58.710
So he's a woman now.

4368
02:12:58.720 --> 02:12:59.301
Oh really?

4369
02:12:59.301 --> 02:12:59.810
Yes.

4370
02:12:59.810 --> 02:13:04.810
So He's a transgender woman competing against 18 to 20 year old college growth.

4371
02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:07.870
Actual normal college girls.

4372
02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:09.261
Of course he is.

4373
02:13:09.261 --> 02:13:10.670
He's fucking enormous.

4374
02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:13.280
These chicks are like five foot one and shit.

4375
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:14.110
He's six,

4376
02:13:14.110 --> 02:13:14.541
six,

4377
02:13:14.541 --> 02:13:17.450
230 is nothing that anybody can say.

4378
02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:19.490
I don't know.

4379
02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:20.690
I don't understand it.

4380
02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:23.090
I don't know why anybody would ever allow that.

4381
02:13:23.091 --> 02:13:24.890
When it comes to competitive athletics,

4382
02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:26.300
that's where you've got to draw the line.

4383
02:13:26.450 --> 02:13:27.740
You're allowed to wear makeup,

4384
02:13:27.741 --> 02:13:29.210
you're allowed to say your name is Shirley,

4385
02:13:29.211 --> 02:13:30.710
you allowed to do whatever this is the guy.

4386
02:13:30.990 --> 02:13:31.321
Look at it.

4387
02:13:31.321 --> 02:13:32.850
See what I mean?

4388
02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:33.661
What the fuck,

4389
02:13:33.661 --> 02:13:34.110
man.

4390
02:13:34.110 --> 02:13:36.210
Look at the giant hands on this woman.

4391
02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:36.900
You would net.

4392
02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:37.651
That's not a woman.

4393
02:13:37.651 --> 02:13:38.520
That's a nightmare.

4394
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:39.210
That's,

4395
02:13:39.210 --> 02:13:39.911
that's you.

4396
02:13:39.911 --> 02:13:43.720
You sort of sober up and you realize this guy's in your kitchen going,

4397
02:13:43.750 --> 02:13:44.011
come on,

4398
02:13:44.011 --> 02:13:44.844
let's go in the bedroom.

4399
02:13:45.060 --> 02:13:45.391
And you're like,

4400
02:13:45.391 --> 02:13:45.841
wait a minute.

4401
02:13:45.841 --> 02:13:46.674
What?

4402
02:13:47.310 --> 02:13:49.170
Put your penis inside of my penis.

4403
02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:49.621
You're like,

4404
02:13:49.621 --> 02:13:50.610
what's going on?

4405
02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:51.980
What is that's,

4406
02:13:51.980 --> 02:13:52.920
that's a nightmare.

4407
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:55.590
And there's another photo of her actually playing basketball,

4408
02:13:55.591 --> 02:13:56.760
like with the women.

4409
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:59.970
And it's so scary because she's so much bigger than the women.

4410
02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:03.870
That's where there's a reason why women play basketball.

4411
02:14:03.871 --> 02:14:04.530
Yeah.

4412
02:14:04.530 --> 02:14:05.520
Look at that man.

4413
02:14:05.550 --> 02:14:06.420
That's ridiculous.

4414
02:14:06.630 --> 02:14:07.980
Beyond ridiculous.

4415
02:14:08.070 --> 02:14:11.040
There's a reason why women play with women.

4416
02:14:11.041 --> 02:14:14.760
It's because it's a fucking sport and they're the same size

4417
02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:17.630
<v 9>and no woman would ever get this tattoo.</v>

4418
02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:18.140
Uh,

4419
02:14:18.140 --> 02:14:19.850
Barb fence without,

4420
02:14:19.851 --> 02:14:20.750
what is that a wolf?

4421
02:14:20.810 --> 02:14:21.980
It's like a lightning bolt

4422
02:14:22.670 --> 02:14:23.000
<v 0>head.</v>

4423
02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:23.520
What is that?

4424
02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:24.950
It's a shrunken head.

4425
02:14:25.070 --> 02:14:26.630
That Barb wire thing?

4426
02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:27.081
Yeah.

4427
02:14:27.081 --> 02:14:28.430
What does that monster face?

4428
02:14:28.670 --> 02:14:29.500
<v 9>It looks like a wolf.</v>

4429
02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:30.270
Wolf.

4430
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:32.740
Wolf Wolf and Barb wire.

4431
02:14:33.650 --> 02:14:34.483
Crazy.

4432
02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:35.540
Both arms it looks like.

4433
02:14:35.570 --> 02:14:35.811
Yeah.

4434
02:14:35.811 --> 02:14:36.860
Well two wolves.

4435
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:38.170
<v 0>One's on her tits.</v>

4436
02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:39.731
Yeah.

4437
02:14:39.731 --> 02:14:40.900
Does she have to take tests?

4438
02:14:42.490 --> 02:14:43.690
Why would they allow that?

4439
02:14:43.691 --> 02:14:45.340
Someone in the mission college,

4440
02:14:45.490 --> 02:14:46.000
you know,

4441
02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:46.351
it's the,

4442
02:14:46.351 --> 02:14:46.531
the,

4443
02:14:46.531 --> 02:14:48.460
the mission college was in Fremont,

4444
02:14:48.461 --> 02:14:49.294
California.

4445
02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:49.810
Um,

4446
02:14:49.810 --> 02:14:51.340
I don't know how this is allowed.

4447
02:14:51.341 --> 02:14:52.510
I don't know how it happened.

4448
02:14:52.750 --> 02:14:54.010
They call her Gabby.

4449
02:14:55.330 --> 02:14:56.163
I Dunno.

4450
02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:57.280
Gavi winning.

4451
02:14:57.281 --> 02:14:59.350
Cause if Gabbie's winning then you got an issue.

4452
02:14:59.390 --> 02:15:02.650
If it's easier if there before she was Gabby,

4453
02:15:02.651 --> 02:15:03.550
her name was Robert.

4454
02:15:03.551 --> 02:15:04.660
John Ludwig.

4455
02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:06.860
Jesus Christ.

4456
02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:08.350
What the fuck.

4457
02:15:08.350 --> 02:15:09.190
And not only that,

4458
02:15:09.370 --> 02:15:10.630
he's fucking 50.

4459
02:15:10.930 --> 02:15:11.350
Wow.

4460
02:15:11.350 --> 02:15:14.170
I mean what a crazy old fuck.

4461
02:15:14.590 --> 02:15:14.831
Yeah.

4462
02:15:14.831 --> 02:15:16.030
What's he doing in college?

4463
02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:18.630
While he probably always wanted to be a girl and a,

4464
02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:21.250
always wanted to relive his life as a girl.

4465
02:15:21.340 --> 02:15:24.850
So He's going back to college and I don't know if there's like age restrictions

4466
02:15:24.851 --> 02:15:27.190
for competitive sports in all colleges.

4467
02:15:27.580 --> 02:15:28.041
I mean I,

4468
02:15:28.041 --> 02:15:29.150
I think it's certainly there isn't,

4469
02:15:29.650 --> 02:15:30.483
I guess

4470
02:15:32.770 --> 02:15:35.290
however this school 50 come on.

4471
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:35.950
Yeah,

4472
02:15:35.950 --> 02:15:38.200
they don't care if he can keep up with the team.

4473
02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:41.750
You used to train at a Benny the jet center in California?

4474
02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:42.930
Yeah,

4475
02:15:42.930 --> 02:15:44.230
number of years ago.

4476
02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:45.280
How do you know that?

4477
02:15:45.310 --> 02:15:47.530
I just started out there when I first came to California,

4478
02:15:47.890 --> 02:15:50.220
but they closed the place down because of the A,

4479
02:15:50.230 --> 02:15:52.360
I came right after the earthquakes,

4480
02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:54.520
but when the earthquakes,

4481
02:15:54.550 --> 02:15:55.690
after everything settled down,

4482
02:15:55.691 --> 02:15:59.800
there was so much roof damage that that place when it rained in the winter just

4483
02:15:59.801 --> 02:16:00.670
got fucked.

4484
02:16:00.730 --> 02:16:01.960
And so they had to get out of there.

4485
02:16:01.961 --> 02:16:06.100
So I was only there for as many months as it took before it started raining

4486
02:16:06.101 --> 02:16:09.340
around here again and they realize how bad the damage really was and the roof.

4487
02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:12.580
And then they moved to North Hollywood and I trained there for a little while,

4488
02:16:12.581 --> 02:16:14.860
but it's just outside of my,

4489
02:16:14.861 --> 02:16:15.250
uh,

4490
02:16:15.250 --> 02:16:16.120
my distance.

4491
02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:18.490
Where do you train now or you're still training?

4492
02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:18.910
Yeah,

4493
02:16:18.910 --> 02:16:21.250
accident or have a disc issue in my back.

4494
02:16:21.251 --> 02:16:23.530
So I haven't been doing any Jujitsu for a few months.

4495
02:16:24.010 --> 02:16:25.180
Doing kickboxing.

4496
02:16:25.181 --> 02:16:26.500
I have a bulging disc.

4497
02:16:26.590 --> 02:16:27.520
Sure enough.

4498
02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:28.990
What does that bother?

4499
02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:29.740
Most Times,

4500
02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:30.910
more times than not.

4501
02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:32.560
More in Jujitsu than anything else.

4502
02:16:32.561 --> 02:16:34.660
I'm a able to kick and punch and lift weights,

4503
02:16:34.670 --> 02:16:35.381
do a lot of things,

4504
02:16:35.381 --> 02:16:37.300
but getting my neck yanked on,

4505
02:16:37.450 --> 02:16:38.770
that's when it becomes a problem.

4506
02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:42.460
Like when someone is trying to submit me or pulled down on my neck.

4507
02:16:42.730 --> 02:16:45.310
It prices a lot of pressure and it can pinch the nerves.

4508
02:16:45.430 --> 02:16:45.881
Sure.

4509
02:16:45.881 --> 02:16:46.870
No painful.

4510
02:16:46.990 --> 02:16:47.201
Yeah.

4511
02:16:47.201 --> 02:16:50.390
That disc is always the Jujitsu key outta there.

4512
02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:50.710
Huh?

4513
02:16:50.710 --> 02:16:51.310
That's the,

4514
02:16:51.310 --> 02:16:55.930
that's what always a catches up from that art form their discs.

4515
02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:56.591
Definitely.

4516
02:16:56.591 --> 02:16:56.801
Yeah.

4517
02:16:56.801 --> 02:16:58.330
A lot of guys have disc issues.

4518
02:16:58.540 --> 02:17:00.400
Ricardo Laborio scare the shit out of me.

4519
02:17:00.401 --> 02:17:01.480
He's a famous Jujitsu guy.

4520
02:17:01.481 --> 02:17:05.680
He told me he has seven herniated discs and I was like seven.

4521
02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:06.980
How many of them are there?

4522
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:10.960
Seven of them that are bulging out and 13 against nerves.

4523
02:17:10.961 --> 02:17:11.141
Yeah.

4524
02:17:11.141 --> 02:17:12.730
There are pinching and he's walking.

4525
02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:13.230
Yup.

4526
02:17:13.230 --> 02:17:14.450
She is in pain.

4527
02:17:14.451 --> 02:17:15.460
Is he always in pain?

4528
02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:16.333
Always in pain.

4529
02:17:16.430 --> 02:17:16.630
Yeah.

4530
02:17:16.630 --> 02:17:19.000
He's always in pain and he doesn't compete anymore either.

4531
02:17:19.001 --> 02:17:19.660
He's a trainer,

4532
02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:20.980
he's still rolls with guys,

4533
02:17:20.981 --> 02:17:22.270
but he's not a,

4534
02:17:22.271 --> 02:17:23.620
he's not competing anymore.

4535
02:17:23.621 --> 02:17:28.330
He was a very high level Brazilian Jiu Jitsu competitor at one point in time and

4536
02:17:28.331 --> 02:17:29.380
then became the coach,

4537
02:17:29.650 --> 02:17:31.960
one of the head coaches at American top team,

4538
02:17:32.170 --> 02:17:34.030
but like his back is fucked.

4539
02:17:34.270 --> 02:17:34.960
It's guys.

4540
02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:35.291
Yeah.

4541
02:17:35.291 --> 02:17:37.420
How do you even get that fixed that,

4542
02:17:37.421 --> 02:17:39.640
that many desks I don't have again,

4543
02:17:39.670 --> 02:17:40.930
slowly but surely there's,

4544
02:17:40.931 --> 02:17:42.010
there's ways to do it.

4545
02:17:42.011 --> 02:17:44.710
And one of the things that they're doing now is they're actually replacing the

4546
02:17:44.711 --> 02:17:47.640
discs with an artificial disc and a,

4547
02:17:47.650 --> 02:17:48.850
they screw it in place.

4548
02:17:48.850 --> 02:17:50.380
It's like a plastic spacer.

4549
02:17:50.381 --> 02:17:52.730
I've seen them in person cause uh,

4550
02:17:53.050 --> 02:17:55.590
one of the first guys to ever get it done to start competing again.

4551
02:17:55.591 --> 02:17:57.670
And it was a guy named Nate quarry and uh,

4552
02:17:57.690 --> 02:18:02.690
Nate has these spacers where they take out your disc and they screw this thing

4553
02:18:03.431 --> 02:18:07.420
into the bone and it's like rigid in place where you disk used to be and it kind

4554
02:18:07.421 --> 02:18:08.111
of gives a little,

4555
02:18:08.111 --> 02:18:10.630
it's made out of like this plastic substance he able to roles.

4556
02:18:10.631 --> 02:18:13.810
He's still able to fight on four times with an artificial disc.

4557
02:18:14.530 --> 02:18:14.831
Yeah,

4558
02:18:14.831 --> 02:18:18.250
he's had one artificial disc and I think he has to have his disc in his next

4559
02:18:18.251 --> 02:18:19.084
fused

4560
02:18:21.250 --> 02:18:21.941
craziness.

4561
02:18:21.941 --> 02:18:22.420
Man,

4562
02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:25.120
that's a high price to phase and not one guy either.

4563
02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:28.360
What's scaring the shit out of me is that before I was having back problems,

4564
02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:30.340
I heard about guys getting injured.

4565
02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:33.610
I heard about guys getting surgery and know Tito Ortiz had two surgeries like

4566
02:18:33.611 --> 02:18:33.821
that.

4567
02:18:33.821 --> 02:18:36.790
He has a space around his back as well as a fuse disc in his neck.

4568
02:18:37.090 --> 02:18:41.440
But I didn't think about it in terms of like the overall sport until I got my

4569
02:18:41.441 --> 02:18:42.190
own injury.

4570
02:18:42.190 --> 02:18:45.180
And then I started asking all sorts of people like trainers and the honey,

4571
02:18:45.260 --> 02:18:46.570
do you ever have any problems with your back?

4572
02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:47.840
And I got three herniated discs.

4573
02:18:47.890 --> 02:18:48.723
Like what?

4574
02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:50.470
Like everybody has them,

4575
02:18:50.890 --> 02:18:51.161
you know,

4576
02:18:51.161 --> 02:18:51.790
the disc,

4577
02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:53.500
the disc issue is a real issue.

4578
02:18:53.730 --> 02:18:53.920
Yeah.

4579
02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:54.660
Scary stuff.

4580
02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:55.250
It is.

4581
02:18:55.250 --> 02:18:56.920
And arms and stuff.

4582
02:18:56.950 --> 02:18:57.783
Sure.

4583
02:18:58.330 --> 02:19:02.290
It's the one ticket that a very few people do talk about,

4584
02:19:02.291 --> 02:19:02.560
Huh?

4585
02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:02.861
Yeah.

4586
02:19:02.861 --> 02:19:03.640
It's a problem.

4587
02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:06.210
I think it's a career changer is if,

4588
02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:08.050
you know when your back gets involved,

4589
02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:08.440
you know,

4590
02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:11.200
I have lower back issues for many years.

4591
02:19:11.201 --> 02:19:11.531
Yeah.

4592
02:19:11.531 --> 02:19:12.070
You Bet.

4593
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:12.903
Do you do yoga?

4594
02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:13.750
Um,

4595
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:14.020
yeah.

4596
02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:16.210
But usually that's not the ticket to,

4597
02:19:16.211 --> 02:19:16.840
uh,

4598
02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:17.380
you know,

4599
02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:17.891
just helping,

4600
02:19:17.891 --> 02:19:18.490
you know.

4601
02:19:18.490 --> 02:19:19.150
Nah,

4602
02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:23.940
it's usually a matter of strengthening that whole area can have full wraparound

4603
02:19:23.980 --> 02:19:26.050
where your hips are getting good,

4604
02:19:26.051 --> 02:19:27.520
strong muscle in all day,

4605
02:19:27.530 --> 02:19:27.801
you know,

4606
02:19:27.801 --> 02:19:32.000
sit ups and backups and all in that area there because it's stretching.

4607
02:19:32.001 --> 02:19:33.650
It is kind of what pops them out.

4608
02:19:34.430 --> 02:19:35.230
Well,

4609
02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:36.040
yes and no.

4610
02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:36.320
Um,

4611
02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:36.661
the,

4612
02:19:36.661 --> 02:19:38.120
that strengthening is very important.

4613
02:19:38.121 --> 02:19:39.320
You're absolutely right about that.

4614
02:19:39.321 --> 02:19:44.321
But one thing you can do by stretching and by a lot of yoga exercise is you,

4615
02:19:44.721 --> 02:19:46.760
you're sort of elongating your spine.

4616
02:19:46.940 --> 02:19:50.690
You can actually help relieve some of the compression that just comes from

4617
02:19:50.691 --> 02:19:54.950
gravity and poor posture and you can actually strengthen good posture with a lot

4618
02:19:54.951 --> 02:19:55.910
of the yoga poses.

4619
02:19:56.270 --> 02:20:00.380
Yoga has been very helpful for me while I've been going through this and a good

4620
02:20:00.381 --> 02:20:04.400
strong like yoga session or alleviates a lot of stress in my back.

4621
02:20:04.401 --> 02:20:05.720
I feel like a lot of tension.

4622
02:20:05.721 --> 02:20:06.410
Relaxed.

4623
02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:07.011
It feels much,

4624
02:20:07.011 --> 02:20:07.640
much better.

4625
02:20:07.640 --> 02:20:09.020
What kind of Yoga are you doing?

4626
02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:10.700
Do a little bit hot yoga,

4627
02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:12.171
a little beak rooms.

4628
02:20:12.171 --> 02:20:15.620
I do a bunch of different kinds in the room and where they turn the heat up a

4629
02:20:15.621 --> 02:20:15.951
lot.

4630
02:20:15.951 --> 02:20:16.550
I like that.

4631
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:17.900
I do it at home by myself too.

4632
02:20:17.901 --> 02:20:19.340
I have some DVDs that I follow.

4633
02:20:19.820 --> 02:20:20.150
Yeah.

4634
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.983
Very cool.

4635
02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:21.500
Yeah,

4636
02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:22.520
stretching is very,

4637
02:20:22.521 --> 02:20:23.354
very important.

4638
02:20:23.570 --> 02:20:24.050
You know,

4639
02:20:24.050 --> 02:20:25.610
you probably have the most flexible rock star,

4640
02:20:25.611 --> 02:20:26.444
the history of the world.

4641
02:20:26.450 --> 02:20:26.890
Would you say?

4642
02:20:26.890 --> 02:20:27.723
<v 4>Well I do.</v>

4643
02:20:28.090 --> 02:20:28.970
I do a lot of,

4644
02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:30.250
before it was yoga,

4645
02:20:30.251 --> 02:20:31.330
we used to call it stretch it.

4646
02:20:31.331 --> 02:20:31.570
Yeah.

4647
02:20:31.570 --> 02:20:33.730
Who else throw those crazy kicks?

4648
02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:36.520
I mean as a way of life,

4649
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:37.383
you know,

4650
02:20:37.410 --> 02:20:40.510
staring at a little piece of floor and holding the physician.

4651
02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:41.673
Well when I was at a time

4652
02:20:41.730 --> 02:20:45.870
<v 0>one doe competitor in my high school years and I was a huge van Halen Fan,</v>

4653
02:20:45.871 --> 02:20:49.200
I always took pride in the fact that David Lee Roth can throw some fucking

4654
02:20:49.201 --> 02:20:49.800
kicks.

4655
02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:50.430
There you go.

4656
02:20:50.430 --> 02:20:52.290
You can throw some legit shit.

4657
02:20:52.291 --> 02:20:52.740
And then I was like,

4658
02:20:52.740 --> 02:20:53.131
oh shit.

4659
02:20:53.131 --> 02:20:54.360
He trains at the jet center.

4660
02:20:54.420 --> 02:20:54.750
Yup.

4661
02:20:54.750 --> 02:20:56.640
Like the Jet Center for kickboxers.

4662
02:20:56.641 --> 02:20:58.440
It was like back in the day it was Mecca.

4663
02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:03.270
Benny or keyed is at one point in time was the man when it came to kickboxing in

4664
02:21:03.271 --> 02:21:03.810
America.

4665
02:21:03.810 --> 02:21:05.600
<v 4>I got really lucky in that a,</v>

4666
02:21:05.610 --> 02:21:06.443
I always used my,

4667
02:21:06.450 --> 02:21:07.283
uh,

4668
02:21:07.350 --> 02:21:12.270
my celebrity is a passport to meet people to get involved in school and learn

4669
02:21:12.271 --> 02:21:14.570
from those folks and uh,

4670
02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:15.330
all the stuff,

4671
02:21:15.330 --> 02:21:15.541
you know,

4672
02:21:15.541 --> 02:21:16.920
that people that you're mentioning,

4673
02:21:16.921 --> 02:21:18.810
I still use their warmup tips.

4674
02:21:18.811 --> 02:21:23.811
I still use those training ideas and how I eat and everything is really,

4675
02:21:23.941 --> 02:21:25.230
it's been the balance for me.

4676
02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:25.511
Uh,

4677
02:21:25.511 --> 02:21:27.450
you what really careful with your diet?

4678
02:21:28.050 --> 02:21:29.160
I obviously fit,

4679
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.501
I call,

4680
02:21:29.501 --> 02:21:32.310
I call it a crack a diet like a crocodile.

4681
02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:37.380
It's mostly birds and a whatever kind of greenery comes with it.

4682
02:21:40.350 --> 02:21:42.240
Occasionally a fish gets in there,

4683
02:21:44.190 --> 02:21:48.540
but mostly his chickens and alerting an antelope that fucks up and gets too

4684
02:21:48.541 --> 02:21:49.440
close to the water hole.

4685
02:21:49.470 --> 02:21:54.470
Chickens and turkeys and a greenery and whatever falls in with it.

4686
02:21:56.310 --> 02:21:56.911
I love it.

4687
02:21:56.911 --> 02:21:57.211
But,

4688
02:21:57.211 --> 02:21:57.630
uh,

4689
02:21:57.630 --> 02:21:58.670
not so much anymore.

4690
02:21:58.700 --> 02:21:59.190
Got a really good

4691
02:21:59.190 --> 02:21:59.730
<v 0>watch out.</v>

4692
02:21:59.730 --> 02:22:02.460
Do you find health wise there's repercussions to eating meat?

4693
02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:03.120
Like,

4694
02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:03.953
Oh yeah,

4695
02:22:04.060 --> 02:22:04.680
Batman.

4696
02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:06.420
You can't outrun that cheeseburger.

4697
02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:07.880
Cheeseburger,

4698
02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:08.120
right?

4699
02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:09.780
What about like grass fed beef or anything?

4700
02:22:09.781 --> 02:22:10.614
Like

4701
02:22:10.660 --> 02:22:13.810
<v 4>you have to be so careful because uh,</v>

4702
02:22:13.870 --> 02:22:14.201
you know,

4703
02:22:14.201 --> 02:22:16.230
the mistake that most of us make is all,

4704
02:22:16.231 --> 02:22:18.820
well my pants size hasn't changed since junior college,

4705
02:22:18.821 --> 02:22:21.790
so I'll just continue with the Diet.

4706
02:22:21.820 --> 02:22:25.600
But then your metabolism slows down and you know,

4707
02:22:25.601 --> 02:22:26.250
he got to watch

4708
02:22:26.250 --> 02:22:30.720
<v 2>out because you'll be eating a lot of red meat or things that are like,</v>

4709
02:22:30.721 --> 02:22:30.901
you know,

4710
02:22:30.901 --> 02:22:32.070
whatever French fries,

4711
02:22:32.071 --> 02:22:32.904
et Cetera,

4712
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:36.510
and thinking that because your pants size hasn't changed that you're in front of

4713
02:22:36.511 --> 02:22:38.100
it in that ain't the case,

4714
02:22:38.130 --> 02:22:39.120
can't outrun it.

4715
02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:43.380
You got to balance out what you eat with how much you actually train.

4716
02:22:43.470 --> 02:22:45.570
Do you ever talk to her nutritionist?

4717
02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:47.050
Do you like read books on any of that?

4718
02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:49.890
I've been through many from nutritionist.

4719
02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:52.110
My sister wasn't nutritionist for many years.

4720
02:22:52.380 --> 02:22:53.213
You don't really have

4721
02:22:53.230 --> 02:22:55.000
<v 0>to worry too much about red meat,</v>

4722
02:22:55.120 --> 02:22:55.570
you know,

4723
02:22:55.570 --> 02:22:56.470
W with red meat.

4724
02:22:56.471 --> 02:23:01.240
The real issue with red meat is people that are fat and people that are not

4725
02:23:01.241 --> 02:23:03.070
exercising and people that are,

4726
02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:05.560
especially if you're eating a lot of corn fed meat,

4727
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:07.480
there's a lot of fat in corn fed meat,

4728
02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:08.890
but meat itself,

4729
02:23:08.891 --> 02:23:10.390
as long as it's in moderation,

4730
02:23:10.420 --> 02:23:13.210
especially grass fed meat is actually pretty good for you.

4731
02:23:13.420 --> 02:23:14.860
I love red meat game,

4732
02:23:14.890 --> 02:23:16.180
especially wild game.

4733
02:23:16.360 --> 02:23:18.040
The issue with grass fed meat like people,

4734
02:23:18.041 --> 02:23:18.191
well,

4735
02:23:18.191 --> 02:23:19.300
what's the big deal with grass fed?

4736
02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:20.130
It tastes different.

4737
02:23:20.130 --> 02:23:20.220
No.

4738
02:23:20.220 --> 02:23:20.410
Well,

4739
02:23:20.410 --> 02:23:21.330
it doesn't just taste different.

4740
02:23:21.331 --> 02:23:22.420
It's a healthier animal.

4741
02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:23.441
The first of all,

4742
02:23:23.441 --> 02:23:27.280
animals are not supposed to beat and corn cows are not naturally designed to

4743
02:23:27.281 --> 02:23:28.240
Acorn as fact.

4744
02:23:28.450 --> 02:23:30.530
Watch the movie food inc if you're curious about,

4745
02:23:30.531 --> 02:23:30.630
well,

4746
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:31.490
I think I've seen that.

4747
02:23:31.491 --> 02:23:31.961
It's terrible.

4748
02:23:31.961 --> 02:23:34.690
It's terrible for their bodies and that's what makes him so fucking fat and

4749
02:23:34.691 --> 02:23:35.321
delicious.

4750
02:23:35.321 --> 02:23:35.930
When you slept,

4751
02:23:35.930 --> 02:23:37.670
<v 2>no benches down on a grill,</v>

4752
02:23:38.390 --> 02:23:40.180
ribeye steak and all that,

4753
02:23:40.260 --> 02:23:40.990
<v 0>it's juice,</v>

4754
02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:44.920
but it's not nearly as healthy for you as a grass fed meat.

4755
02:23:44.921 --> 02:23:46.450
Grass Fed beef is actually,

4756
02:23:46.451 --> 02:23:50.140
it actually aids your body and burning fat at Brown grass had beat for athletic

4757
02:23:50.141 --> 02:23:52.870
performance is far superior to corn fed beat.

4758
02:23:53.090 --> 02:23:56.420
You're eating a healthy animal as opposed to a sick animal and it's just going

4759
02:23:56.421 --> 02:23:57.640
to be just more nutritious.

4760
02:23:57.641 --> 02:23:58.120
There's,

4761
02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:00.190
there's more vitamins in it and there's more nutrients.

4762
02:24:00.191 --> 02:24:00.431
It's,

4763
02:24:00.431 --> 02:24:02.860
it's far better for you and it tastes different.

4764
02:24:02.990 --> 02:24:03.430
Um,

4765
02:24:03.430 --> 02:24:05.710
it's less fatty so it's not quite as tender.

4766
02:24:05.711 --> 02:24:06.460
But I like it.

4767
02:24:06.460 --> 02:24:07.211
I like it more.

4768
02:24:07.211 --> 02:24:12.070
I prefer like the taste of grass fed meat and the taste of wild game too.

4769
02:24:12.250 --> 02:24:15.610
Fatty co like corn fed beef because I know what's going on.

4770
02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.010
That said every now and then,

4771
02:24:18.030 --> 02:24:19.030
little in and out,

4772
02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:20.170
three by three

4773
02:24:20.650 --> 02:24:21.700
<v 2>with some fries.</v>

4774
02:24:28.110 --> 02:24:29.490
<v 0>I figure if I'm going to eat in a burger,</v>

4775
02:24:29.491 --> 02:24:30.630
I'm going to have three patties.

4776
02:24:30.790 --> 02:24:31.390
<v 2>Fuck.</v>

4777
02:24:31.390 --> 02:24:32.081
What about though?

4778
02:24:32.081 --> 02:24:33.160
Like like cholesterol,

4779
02:24:33.161 --> 02:24:35.140
low cholesterol is only an issue.

4780
02:24:35.141 --> 02:24:35.840
Again,

4781
02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:37.580
<v 0>if you're not monitoring it,</v>

4782
02:24:37.581 --> 02:24:38.780
if you're not watching your diet,

4783
02:24:38.781 --> 02:24:40.280
if you have some hereditary issues,

4784
02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:42.920
and if you're not exercising on a regular basis,

4785
02:24:42.921 --> 02:24:43.610
you've got to,

4786
02:24:43.610 --> 02:24:47.840
you've got to create a nuclear blast furnace that everything gets tossed into

4787
02:24:47.841 --> 02:24:51.050
and the only way to do that is to put your body in this constant state of

4788
02:24:51.051 --> 02:24:51.830
recovery.

4789
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:55.070
You're constantly breaking it down and constantly recovering it so your body is

4790
02:24:55.071 --> 02:24:58.370
constantly in this state where it knows it has to perform athletically,

4791
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:59.870
it has to burn off flash.

4792
02:24:59.871 --> 02:25:01.250
It's not going to waste any effort.

4793
02:25:01.430 --> 02:25:03.200
It's not going to waste any energy.

4794
02:25:03.201 --> 02:25:03.831
Rather it's going to,

4795
02:25:03.831 --> 02:25:05.990
you're going to make sure that when you're taking in nutrients,

4796
02:25:05.991 --> 02:25:09.830
they get absorbed as soon as you get sedentary and then you're eating like

4797
02:25:09.890 --> 02:25:14.000
massive amounts of animal protein and then your body just pooling up with fats.

4798
02:25:14.270 --> 02:25:14.670
You know,

4799
02:25:14.670 --> 02:25:15.040
it's,

4800
02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:16.820
and what's even worse for you?

4801
02:25:16.821 --> 02:25:17.480
Honestly,

4802
02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:18.920
it's fucking carbohydrates.

4803
02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:21.920
Carbohydrates in in massive quantities like most people eat them,

4804
02:25:21.921 --> 02:25:23.300
especially like sugars,

4805
02:25:23.550 --> 02:25:26.970
like you talking about like ice cream and cake and so that stuff is just

4806
02:25:26.971 --> 02:25:28.350
clogging you.

4807
02:25:28.620 --> 02:25:30.000
It's terrible for you.

4808
02:25:30.001 --> 02:25:30.211
It's,

4809
02:25:30.211 --> 02:25:34.230
it's in fact sugar is like really like a mild toxin.

4810
02:25:34.380 --> 02:25:36.030
It's not good for you in any way,

4811
02:25:36.031 --> 02:25:36.870
shape or form.

4812
02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:38.840
<v 2>It's not so just not so mild.</v>

4813
02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:40.040
Yeah.

4814
02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:40.311
Yeah.

4815
02:25:40.311 --> 02:25:40.620
Good.

4816
02:25:40.620 --> 02:25:42.200
A good wallop of sugar.

4817
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.951
Like are you kidding?

4818
02:25:42.951 --> 02:25:46.550
And some caffeine and a you can get a lot done

4819
02:25:46.670 --> 02:25:47.750
<v 0>but it tastes yummy.</v>

4820
02:25:48.180 --> 02:25:48.720
Yeah.

4821
02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:48.991
Yeah.

4822
02:25:48.991 --> 02:25:49.311
I mean it's,

4823
02:25:49.311 --> 02:25:51.320
it's hard to get past that.

4824
02:25:51.350 --> 02:25:53.930
How do we turn it to our nutrition conversation with David Lee Roth?

4825
02:25:54.740 --> 02:25:55.790
Because I wanted to know cause you're,

4826
02:25:55.791 --> 02:25:58.490
you're fit and you're energetic and wanting to know if you like,

4827
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:59.361
but you're still smoking.

4828
02:25:59.361 --> 02:26:00.240
Marlboro's yeah,

4829
02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:02.600
I think on occasion a contradiction.

4830
02:26:03.650 --> 02:26:04.131
What to do,

4831
02:26:04.131 --> 02:26:04.964
what to do.

4832
02:26:05.180 --> 02:26:09.480
Do you find that in Japan it's easier to maintain a healthy diet because they

4833
02:26:09.490 --> 02:26:12.440
are of a much less fatty diet over there then we do in America.

4834
02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:12.730
<v 2>God,</v>

4835
02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:13.980
it's so easy to,

4836
02:26:13.981 --> 02:26:15.000
Stevie wonder it.

4837
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:16.620
You don't have to look around at all.

4838
02:26:17.730 --> 02:26:19.260
It's insensitive.

4839
02:26:19.261 --> 02:26:23.810
I know you put your hand over your eyes and just point we will be pointing is

4840
02:26:23.811 --> 02:26:26.580
somewhere that a is reasonable to eat.

4841
02:26:26.670 --> 02:26:27.240
You know?

4842
02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:28.290
Like I said,

4843
02:26:28.980 --> 02:26:31.440
my diet is basically a,

4844
02:26:31.441 --> 02:26:32.160
you know,

4845
02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:37.160
birds and fish and rice and beans and the clean stuff.

4846
02:26:37.430 --> 02:26:37.870
And a,

4847
02:26:37.870 --> 02:26:42.870
in Japan there's 3000 variations of that 3000 variations of noodle soup.

4848
02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:45.600
There's 3000 variations of chicks

4849
02:26:45.650 --> 02:26:46.483
<v 0>cannot Aztec.</v>

4850
02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:49.520
I remember something you said to me at the comedy store.

4851
02:26:49.521 --> 02:26:50.310
I've never forgotten.

4852
02:26:50.310 --> 02:26:51.230
I thought it was so funny.

4853
02:26:51.470 --> 02:26:52.340
You were talking about,

4854
02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:53.203
uh,

4855
02:26:53.210 --> 02:26:55.490
checks about groupies,

4856
02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:56.091
like really,

4857
02:26:56.091 --> 02:27:00.320
really hot chicks that were fans and about how like you were living in the

4858
02:27:00.321 --> 02:27:01.430
stairmaster era.

4859
02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:04.810
You like these gals are in their forties and they look sensational.

4860
02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:07.170
<v 2>Like nobody or saw this before.</v>

4861
02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:07.891
You were like,

4862
02:27:07.891 --> 02:27:08.160
he's,

4863
02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:09.780
this ain't your mom's 40.

4864
02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:11.731
True,

4865
02:27:11.731 --> 02:27:12.091
right?

4866
02:27:12.091 --> 02:27:12.361
Yes,

4867
02:27:12.361 --> 02:27:13.194
it is true.

4868
02:27:13.230 --> 02:27:14.040
It's a different,

4869
02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:15.090
a different era.

4870
02:27:15.270 --> 02:27:15.451
Oh,

4871
02:27:15.451 --> 02:27:17.970
it's a hugely different era in dingy Japan.

4872
02:27:18.210 --> 02:27:18.511
You know,

4873
02:27:18.511 --> 02:27:23.460
we were talking about Yoga and women think nothing of going to a Bikram from

4874
02:27:23.461 --> 02:27:28.461
yoga session in the hotbox with complete face makeup and complete hairdo,

4875
02:27:28.980 --> 02:27:29.641
et cetera.

4876
02:27:29.641 --> 02:27:30.091
In Japan,

4877
02:27:30.091 --> 02:27:30.450
again,

4878
02:27:30.450 --> 02:27:32.360
totally the gyms are full.

4879
02:27:32.380 --> 02:27:37.380
The women get dressed up like they're going to a fashion place 100% of the time

4880
02:27:38.710 --> 02:27:39.660
is they're trying to hook up.

4881
02:27:39.661 --> 02:27:40.494
Is that what it is?

4882
02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:41.793
Put a signal,

4883
02:27:41.970 --> 02:27:42.481
I think,

4884
02:27:42.481 --> 02:27:43.314
uh,

4885
02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:46.770
first off in a country where virtually everybody has the same color hair,

4886
02:27:47.250 --> 02:27:49.110
it's probably a little more difficult,

4887
02:27:49.111 --> 02:27:49.830
you know,

4888
02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:50.820
to stand out,

4889
02:27:51.250 --> 02:27:51.870
right?

4890
02:27:51.870 --> 02:27:52.441
Oh yeah,

4891
02:27:52.441 --> 02:27:52.831
that's right.

4892
02:27:52.831 --> 02:27:53.551
And think about it.

4893
02:27:53.551 --> 02:27:55.710
Virtually everybody's got a black hair cut in there.

4894
02:27:55.770 --> 02:27:59.460
So you know right away you got your work cut out for you a little bit.

4895
02:27:59.461 --> 02:28:01.050
Their face paint goes a long way.

4896
02:28:01.080 --> 02:28:01.890
Oh hell yeah.

4897
02:28:01.890 --> 02:28:04.290
What have you found out that that's not common practice?

4898
02:28:04.291 --> 02:28:06.860
They're only doing it because they found out David Lee Roth was taking notes

4899
02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:08.600
while he's mentioned it.

4900
02:28:08.700 --> 02:28:10.220
This is the hookup.

4901
02:28:10.260 --> 02:28:10.771
This is,

4902
02:28:10.771 --> 02:28:11.700
this haunts me

4903
02:28:13.530 --> 02:28:17.310
at the first that I've had to examine this,

4904
02:28:17.850 --> 02:28:18.683
this idea.

4905
02:28:19.310 --> 02:28:20.071
Is it a weird,

4906
02:28:20.071 --> 02:28:21.980
I mean that famous so long.

4907
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:22.813
<v 0>I mean,</v>

4908
02:28:22.990 --> 02:28:24.500
you're such an easy going guy.

4909
02:28:24.501 --> 02:28:26.690
I mean it's one of the things that impressed me the most when I met you at the

4910
02:28:26.691 --> 02:28:27.524
comedy store.

4911
02:28:27.530 --> 02:28:29.360
You are the most normal,

4912
02:28:29.361 --> 02:28:31.610
like regular down to Earth Guy.

4913
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:32.930
If someone didn't know you,

4914
02:28:32.931 --> 02:28:36.380
they would never know that you like one of the biggest rock stars in the history

4915
02:28:36.381 --> 02:28:37.214
of music.

4916
02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:38.540
You're a regular guy.

4917
02:28:38.541 --> 02:28:39.560
Like the way you're here.

4918
02:28:39.561 --> 02:28:41.000
You didn't come with an entourage.

4919
02:28:41.210 --> 02:28:42.770
He showed up by herself like,

4920
02:28:42.771 --> 02:28:43.011
Hey,

4921
02:28:43.011 --> 02:28:43.401
what's up?

4922
02:28:43.401 --> 02:28:45.080
You like your normal,

4923
02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:46.153
you know,

4924
02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:48.470
that's how the fuck did you maintain that?

4925
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:50.450
<v 4>I get the balance.</v>

4926
02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:52.170
The balance is a,

4927
02:28:52.460 --> 02:28:52.701
you know,

4928
02:28:52.701 --> 02:28:55.940
a lot of what we're talking about like in the martial arts and travel and

4929
02:28:55.941 --> 02:28:57.680
whatnot is I'm a beginner.

4930
02:28:58.130 --> 02:28:59.150
I'm not the boss.

4931
02:28:59.151 --> 02:29:03.950
I'm not the Alpha male you follow when I go to train in a class,

4932
02:29:03.951 --> 02:29:06.230
I'm not the shot caller at all.

4933
02:29:06.740 --> 02:29:07.340
Um,

4934
02:29:07.340 --> 02:29:08.660
and I've always had that,

4935
02:29:08.661 --> 02:29:09.020
oh,

4936
02:29:09.020 --> 02:29:12.560
I like people in a general sense.

4937
02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:14.720
Can being conversant,

4938
02:29:14.780 --> 02:29:18.890
being able to have conversation to tell stories and carry on.

4939
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:20.810
I was a big part of,

4940
02:29:20.811 --> 02:29:21.170
um,

4941
02:29:21.170 --> 02:29:22.370
what I do for a living.

4942
02:29:22.430 --> 02:29:26.530
You gotta be a people watcher and if the world is constantly watching you,

4943
02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:28.220
then everybody alters their behavior.

4944
02:29:28.780 --> 02:29:33.780
You got to be able to kind of fit in the way a good a report or money,

4945
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:34.521
you know,

4946
02:29:34.521 --> 02:29:37.310
thinking like if you were a wartime reporter,

4947
02:29:37.610 --> 02:29:38.900
you don't want to wear bright colors,

4948
02:29:38.930 --> 02:29:40.450
you want to just sort of fit in,

4949
02:29:40.490 --> 02:29:44.810
blend right in and always be there just a couple inches behind going.

4950
02:29:44.811 --> 02:29:45.071
You know,

4951
02:29:45.071 --> 02:29:46.250
I've got a couple of questions.

4952
02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:47.750
If you've got a second here,

4953
02:29:47.751 --> 02:29:48.010
can I,

4954
02:29:48.010 --> 02:29:49.790
can I ask you about that tank over there?

4955
02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:51.910
<v 0>That's a remarkable balance that you,</v>

4956
02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:52.141
you,

4957
02:29:52.141 --> 02:29:56.100
you've been able to pull that off because it's most rock stars when you meet

4958
02:29:56.101 --> 02:29:56.221
them,

4959
02:29:56.221 --> 02:29:58.950
they're just so removed from the general public.

4960
02:29:58.951 --> 02:30:00.540
It makes the conversations a little

4961
02:30:00.590 --> 02:30:01.423
<v 4>awkward.</v>

4962
02:30:01.430 --> 02:30:03.990
It would make it really awkward I would think in,

4963
02:30:04.010 --> 02:30:04.311
you know,

4964
02:30:04.311 --> 02:30:05.600
in terms of what do,

4965
02:30:05.640 --> 02:30:07.100
what do you have debts mutual,

4966
02:30:07.130 --> 02:30:07.610
what do you,

4967
02:30:07.610 --> 02:30:10.340
what do you know in your life that's mutual?

4968
02:30:10.341 --> 02:30:11.870
What are the fascinations,

4969
02:30:11.871 --> 02:30:12.291
you know,

4970
02:30:12.291 --> 02:30:12.580
what are,

4971
02:30:12.580 --> 02:30:13.413
what,

4972
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:15.230
what are your interests?

4973
02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:16.010
You know,

4974
02:30:16.010 --> 02:30:17.240
because that can be a pretty,

4975
02:30:17.241 --> 02:30:18.530
a pretty diverse,

4976
02:30:19.050 --> 02:30:21.320
got to have a pretty diverse taste in things.

4977
02:30:21.321 --> 02:30:21.431
Yeah.

4978
02:30:21.431 --> 02:30:21.810
But your,

4979
02:30:21.810 --> 02:30:22.820
your hope personalities,

4980
02:30:22.821 --> 02:30:25.460
it's a different sort of take on things like,

4981
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:28.340
I don't know a lot of people that would just go to Japan for 10 months like

4982
02:30:28.341 --> 02:30:29.174
that.

4983
02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:30.620
And how old are you?

4984
02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:31.933
58

4985
02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:32.840
<v 0>58 years old.</v>

4986
02:30:32.841 --> 02:30:33.470
Boom.

4987
02:30:33.470 --> 02:30:35.180
He just fought in Japan for a fucking year.

4988
02:30:35.690 --> 02:30:38.060
That's not a lot of deep learning at to sword fight.

4989
02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:38.611
<v 4>I mean,</v>

4990
02:30:38.611 --> 02:30:39.840
it's fucking crazy.

4991
02:30:39.841 --> 02:30:40.410
Yeah,

4992
02:30:40.410 --> 02:30:41.140
it's a,

4993
02:30:41.140 --> 02:30:41.973
it's a,

4994
02:30:42.210 --> 02:30:43.800
it's eccentric to a degree.

4995
02:30:44.110 --> 02:30:44.920
<v 0>Single,</v>

4996
02:30:44.920 --> 02:30:47.650
not tied down at all and don't do whatever the fuck you want to do.

4997
02:30:47.690 --> 02:30:48.010
Yup.

4998
02:30:48.010 --> 02:30:49.530
You like a Goddamn Leonard's candidate song.

4999
02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:53.320
Give a fuck he does out there.

5000
02:30:54.120 --> 02:30:55.340
<v 4>It's free.</v>

5001
02:30:57.280 --> 02:30:59.320
<v 0>I mean like legitimately man.</v>

5002
02:30:59.530 --> 02:31:01.720
That's admirable and you're loving it.

5003
02:31:01.721 --> 02:31:02.171
Look at you.

5004
02:31:02.171 --> 02:31:03.030
You can't be happier.

5005
02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:04.450
It's not possible to be happier than you.

5006
02:31:05.340 --> 02:31:09.170
<v 4>I Heidel somewhere between not too pissed and somewhat pissed.</v>

5007
02:31:10.130 --> 02:31:11.780
<v 0>That's how you idle now.</v>

5008
02:31:11.781 --> 02:31:12.470
You Bullshit.

5009
02:31:12.470 --> 02:31:13.221
You said that earlier.

5010
02:31:13.221 --> 02:31:14.840
It's like you saying that you're hard to work with.

5011
02:31:14.841 --> 02:31:15.380
You know,

5012
02:31:15.380 --> 02:31:20.380
I don't think I've hard to work that hard to work hard change.

5013
02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:24.090
<v 4>I bet you fight against someone trying to manipulate or,</v>

5014
02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:26.430
or direct you not remember.

5015
02:31:26.431 --> 02:31:31.431
I remember when we were picking for a jury recently about,

5016
02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:32.170
Eh,

5017
02:31:32.170 --> 02:31:33.003
well,

5018
02:31:33.180 --> 02:31:34.013
a year ago,

5019
02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:34.770
um,

5020
02:31:34.770 --> 02:31:38.910
and they were picking for a murder trial over in the Pasadena courthouse.

5021
02:31:39.390 --> 02:31:40.860
And the fellow says,

5022
02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:45.810
is there anybody here who isn't going to get themselves disqualifies there?

5023
02:31:45.811 --> 02:31:47.760
Anybody here who's qualified to,

5024
02:31:48.150 --> 02:31:48.930
uh,

5025
02:31:48.930 --> 02:31:49.800
try this case?

5026
02:31:49.801 --> 02:31:51.420
And I was the only one who raised his hand.

5027
02:31:52.650 --> 02:31:53.483
Really?

5028
02:31:54.930 --> 02:31:55.531
So,

5029
02:31:55.531 --> 02:31:55.980
uh,

5030
02:31:55.980 --> 02:31:56.670
you know,

5031
02:31:56.670 --> 02:31:57.503
um,

5032
02:31:57.710 --> 02:31:58.530
you know,

5033
02:31:58.530 --> 02:31:59.490
I'm willing to listen.

5034
02:32:00.300 --> 02:32:01.260
And the guy says,

5035
02:32:01.261 --> 02:32:01.680
uh,

5036
02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:02.513
okay sir.

5037
02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:03.350
He says,

5038
02:32:03.350 --> 02:32:03.690
uh,

5039
02:32:03.690 --> 02:32:05.070
I think I know who you are.

5040
02:32:05.430 --> 02:32:06.240
He says,

5041
02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:07.073
um,

5042
02:32:07.140 --> 02:32:07.380
oh,

5043
02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:11.670
would you listen to everybody else's idea behind while you're deliberating on

5044
02:32:11.671 --> 02:32:13.080
this trial instead of certainly,

5045
02:32:13.530 --> 02:32:14.280
he said,

5046
02:32:14.280 --> 02:32:18.810
but you would try to convince them they were wrong if you had another idea,

5047
02:32:18.811 --> 02:32:19.141
right?

5048
02:32:19.141 --> 02:32:19.974
And I said,

5049
02:32:20.190 --> 02:32:20.491
yes,

5050
02:32:20.491 --> 02:32:21.324
that's accurate.

5051
02:32:21.720 --> 02:32:23.040
And you dismissed me because

5052
02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:25.980
charismatic,

5053
02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:27.570
you can do charismatic,

5054
02:32:27.571 --> 02:32:29.070
you'd manipulate it in your favor.

5055
02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:30.090
Well,

5056
02:32:30.090 --> 02:32:32.040
you're the lever on the bench.

5057
02:32:32.041 --> 02:32:33.230
Certainly not my one.

5058
02:32:33.250 --> 02:32:36.600
My first time in the Pasadena courthouse,

5059
02:32:36.750 --> 02:32:36.961
you know,

5060
02:32:36.961 --> 02:32:39.420
when our first time was Alex van Halen.

5061
02:32:39.421 --> 02:32:44.421
And I had to sue the Mayfield School of the holy child of Jesus Incorporated for

5062
02:32:44.671 --> 02:32:45.990
$125.

5063
02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:49.950
This was in 1975,

5064
02:32:49.951 --> 02:32:50.341
I think.

5065
02:32:50.341 --> 02:32:52.250
1970 625.

5066
02:32:52.270 --> 02:32:53.010
What was that about?

5067
02:32:53.010 --> 02:32:53.401
Well,

5068
02:32:53.401 --> 02:32:54.570
it was in a contract.

5069
02:32:54.571 --> 02:32:55.650
We had played a,

5070
02:32:55.651 --> 02:33:00.651
a a dance and in the one page contract it said there will be no smoking,

5071
02:33:01.470 --> 02:33:02.130
uh,

5072
02:33:02.130 --> 02:33:03.030
backstage.

5073
02:33:03.031 --> 02:33:05.280
There will be no marijuana consumed.

5074
02:33:05.281 --> 02:33:06.600
There will be no drinking,

5075
02:33:06.601 --> 02:33:07.081
et Cetera,

5076
02:33:07.081 --> 02:33:07.914
cetera.

5077
02:33:07.950 --> 02:33:08.701
And uh,

5078
02:33:08.701 --> 02:33:11.850
one of the sisters was nuns at the time,

5079
02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:17.150
claimed that she smelled pot smoke backstage and a refuse to pass our hundred

5080
02:33:17.911 --> 02:33:19.470
and $25 for the band.

5081
02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:21.060
So hungry bitch,

5082
02:33:21.061 --> 02:33:21.930
was he she right?

5083
02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:22.740
Well,

5084
02:33:22.740 --> 02:33:23.130
no,

5085
02:33:23.130 --> 02:33:25.740
there was no pot smoke and she just made it up.

5086
02:33:26.430 --> 02:33:30.480
She may have smelled Marlboro's actually those were Campbell Campbell filters.

5087
02:33:30.930 --> 02:33:31.321
But,

5088
02:33:31.321 --> 02:33:32.050
um,

5089
02:33:32.050 --> 02:33:32.400
uh,

5090
02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:37.020
Alex and I went and we bought a clip on ties so we could fool the judge and we

5091
02:33:37.021 --> 02:33:40.400
tied our hair back and we went to small claims court and filed.

5092
02:33:40.490 --> 02:33:41.130
Did you win?

5093
02:33:41.130 --> 02:33:41.963
Um,

5094
02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.200
well what happened was,

5095
02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:44.310
uh,

5096
02:33:44.370 --> 02:33:45.420
sat in front of the judge.

5097
02:33:45.421 --> 02:33:47.310
We sat on one side and on the other side,

5098
02:33:47.700 --> 02:33:48.570
uh,

5099
02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:49.531
two sisters,

5100
02:33:49.531 --> 02:33:51.240
two nuns came in and a family,

5101
02:33:51.270 --> 02:33:51.901
a father,

5102
02:33:51.901 --> 02:33:52.734
a mother,

5103
02:33:52.890 --> 02:33:55.590
and three of the daughters in school uniforms,

5104
02:33:55.591 --> 02:33:55.771
you know,

5105
02:33:55.771 --> 02:33:56.790
they played it up hard.

5106
02:33:57.270 --> 02:33:57.961
And uh,

5107
02:33:57.961 --> 02:33:59.220
the judge says,

5108
02:33:59.221 --> 02:34:00.570
why or who filed here?

5109
02:34:00.571 --> 02:34:00.871
I said,

5110
02:34:00.871 --> 02:34:01.111
sir,

5111
02:34:01.111 --> 02:34:01.530
I did.

5112
02:34:01.530 --> 02:34:02.050
He said,

5113
02:34:02.050 --> 02:34:03.510
it's $125.

5114
02:34:04.020 --> 02:34:05.060
And uh,

5115
02:34:05.130 --> 02:34:06.300
there was no smoke,

5116
02:34:07.010 --> 02:34:09.630
there was no smoking of anything illegal backstage,

5117
02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:10.473
whatever.

5118
02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:11.513
And um,

5119
02:34:12.300 --> 02:34:12.901
he had the,

5120
02:34:12.901 --> 02:34:14.520
one of the nuns stand up and she said,

5121
02:34:14.521 --> 02:34:17.160
I refused to pay him because I smelled marijuana smoke.

5122
02:34:17.710 --> 02:34:18.161
And,

5123
02:34:18.161 --> 02:34:18.580
uh,

5124
02:34:18.580 --> 02:34:19.301
the judge says,

5125
02:34:19.301 --> 02:34:20.380
what is your answer to that?

5126
02:34:20.381 --> 02:34:20.541
Sure.

5127
02:34:20.541 --> 02:34:21.850
And I stood up and I said,

5128
02:34:21.980 --> 02:34:22.813
sister,

5129
02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:25.900
how do you know what marijuana smoke smells like?

5130
02:34:28.260 --> 02:34:29.340
<v 2>$25 later</v>

5131
02:34:31.470 --> 02:34:32.430
paid for the t shirt.

5132
02:34:32.490 --> 02:34:32.611
Yeah.

5133
02:34:32.611 --> 02:34:33.444
How would she know?

5134
02:34:35.940 --> 02:34:39.960
Did you know that that's what they used to having those incense things when the

5135
02:34:40.330 --> 02:34:41.850
<v 0>walks down the aisle?</v>

5136
02:34:42.530 --> 02:34:42.850
Yes.

5137
02:34:42.850 --> 02:34:43.391
Absolutely.

5138
02:34:43.391 --> 02:34:43.720
Yeah.

5139
02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:44.650
They burn cannabis.

5140
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.520
Yeah.

5141
02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:45.691
The,

5142
02:34:45.691 --> 02:34:45.891
yes.

5143
02:34:45.891 --> 02:34:47.440
He used to use cannabis oil.

5144
02:34:47.650 --> 02:34:50.230
They used to use cannabis oil underneath their,

5145
02:34:50.231 --> 02:34:50.471
their,

5146
02:34:50.471 --> 02:34:51.730
their religious hats.

5147
02:34:51.970 --> 02:34:52.151
Yeah.

5148
02:34:52.151 --> 02:34:53.230
It's common practice.

5149
02:34:53.580 --> 02:34:57.790
Kenneth was used as a sacrament for a lot of different religions.

5150
02:34:57.850 --> 02:34:58.690
I did not know that.

5151
02:34:58.691 --> 02:35:00.340
I thought it was like incense or something.

5152
02:35:00.370 --> 02:35:00.611
Yeah,

5153
02:35:00.611 --> 02:35:01.420
it is now,

5154
02:35:01.420 --> 02:35:01.840
you know.

5155
02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:02.111
Yeah.

5156
02:35:02.111 --> 02:35:05.530
But there's a lot of evidence that cannabis was used in that way

5157
02:35:06.580 --> 02:35:09.830
<v 1>and has ever contacted you about,</v>

5158
02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:14.210
there was a rumor going back a couple months ago that if they ever put together

5159
02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:17.300
nirvana that they would want you as the lead singer.

5160
02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:21.530
Did you even hear about this or did they ever even contacted you about that?

5161
02:35:21.690 --> 02:35:22.523
<v 4>Well,</v>

5162
02:35:22.610 --> 02:35:24.310
there's a whole lot of noise,

5163
02:35:24.311 --> 02:35:26.840
a backstage going on at a,

5164
02:35:26.841 --> 02:35:28.850
at these affairs.

5165
02:35:28.851 --> 02:35:29.684
Okay.

5166
02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:30.201
And,

5167
02:35:30.201 --> 02:35:30.351
uh,

5168
02:35:30.351 --> 02:35:35.351
what started it was there was a picture of me with the Jonas brothers at a

5169
02:35:35.451 --> 02:35:36.410
Christmas party.

5170
02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:37.340
And uh,

5171
02:35:37.340 --> 02:35:40.070
the rumor got started that I was actually going to be in the Jonas brothers.

5172
02:35:44.940 --> 02:35:45.520
<v 2>So,</v>

5173
02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:45.940
uh,

5174
02:35:45.940 --> 02:35:47.400
I helped to fuel that room.

5175
02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:48.130
<v 1>Did you?</v>

5176
02:35:48.130 --> 02:35:48.461
Yes,

5177
02:35:48.461 --> 02:35:49.150
I did.

5178
02:35:49.150 --> 02:35:51.430
Did you ever meet Kurt or were you a fan of Nirvana?

5179
02:35:51.580 --> 02:35:52.600
<v 4>Uh,</v>

5180
02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:53.740
let's stick with the Jones

5181
02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:54.673
<v 2>brothers.</v>

5182
02:35:56.260 --> 02:35:56.501
Oh,

5183
02:35:56.501 --> 02:35:57.280
snap.

5184
02:35:57.280 --> 02:35:57.581
No,

5185
02:35:57.581 --> 02:35:58.414
I didn't.

5186
02:35:58.520 --> 02:35:59.690
<v 4>I did not know the,</v>

5187
02:35:59.691 --> 02:36:00.560
uh,

5188
02:36:01.010 --> 02:36:02.570
the fellows at the time.

5189
02:36:02.571 --> 02:36:02.820
I'm,

5190
02:36:02.820 --> 02:36:04.080
I'm since met day,

5191
02:36:04.081 --> 02:36:04.521
but,

5192
02:36:04.521 --> 02:36:04.850
um,

5193
02:36:04.850 --> 02:36:05.541
I don't know,

5194
02:36:05.541 --> 02:36:06.350
uh,

5195
02:36:06.350 --> 02:36:08.390
the grunge movement so well,

5196
02:36:08.780 --> 02:36:09.051
but,

5197
02:36:09.051 --> 02:36:09.410
um,

5198
02:36:09.410 --> 02:36:11.750
the rumors started backstage at the,

5199
02:36:11.751 --> 02:36:12.140
uh,

5200
02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:16.520
Henson recording studio at a Christmas party and then a number of people started

5201
02:36:16.521 --> 02:36:17.510
getting involved in it.

5202
02:36:17.540 --> 02:36:17.900
You know,

5203
02:36:17.900 --> 02:36:19.310
did you spread that rumor and all as well?

5204
02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:20.473
I did.

5205
02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:22.570
<v 2>I put that on the,</v>

5206
02:36:22.571 --> 02:36:22.781
uh,

5207
02:36:22.781 --> 02:36:23.680
on the Internet,

5208
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:25.180
you know,

5209
02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:26.890
who am I to get in the way of a good rumor?

5210
02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:27.940
Now if someone wants,

5211
02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:28.751
<v 0>watch your show.</v>

5212
02:36:28.751 --> 02:36:31.000
What is the best way to,

5213
02:36:31.001 --> 02:36:31.840
is it on iTunes?

5214
02:36:31.930 --> 02:36:32.351
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

5215
02:36:32.351 --> 02:36:34.570
itunes.com the Roth show.

5216
02:36:34.571 --> 02:36:36.280
You can get David Lee roth.com,

5217
02:36:36.281 --> 02:36:37.114
the website.

5218
02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:39.100
You can find this pretty easily here.

5219
02:36:39.101 --> 02:36:39.530
So

5220
02:36:39.530 --> 02:36:40.190
<v 0>yeah,</v>

5221
02:36:40.190 --> 02:36:42.020
so I'm on David Lee roth.com.

5222
02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:42.890
Who's,

5223
02:36:42.890 --> 02:36:43.723
what is this,

5224
02:36:44.260 --> 02:36:44.570
this,

5225
02:36:44.570 --> 02:36:45.440
this photograph?

5226
02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:46.333
What does that have?

5227
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:48.300
<v 4>I just the latest photo.</v>

5228
02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:50.430
That's a something from New York City.

5229
02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:51.711
What is that?

5230
02:36:51.711 --> 02:36:53.100
That thing you're standing in?

5231
02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:54.570
It's actually a table.

5232
02:36:54.780 --> 02:36:56.670
Somebody built a table by the water.

5233
02:36:57.030 --> 02:36:58.920
It's kind of odd looking at the dope picture.

5234
02:36:59.590 --> 02:36:59.921
<v 0>Um,</v>

5235
02:36:59.921 --> 02:37:02.050
and you show is also on youtube as well.

5236
02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:02.470
Yep.

5237
02:37:02.470 --> 02:37:03.191
So you can,

5238
02:37:03.191 --> 02:37:04.090
how many episodes have you done?

5239
02:37:04.091 --> 02:37:04.320
So,

5240
02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:05.153
<v 4>Ooh,</v>

5241
02:37:05.190 --> 02:37:07.080
we're up to I think number 11,

5242
02:37:07.081 --> 02:37:09.990
and we just passed a two and a half million downloads.

5243
02:37:10.290 --> 02:37:11.760
So it's time to talk about it.

5244
02:37:11.810 --> 02:37:11.931
Wow.

5245
02:37:11.931 --> 02:37:12.250
Powerful.

5246
02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:13.083
<v 0>Beautiful.</v>

5247
02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:14.033
Often running.

5248
02:37:14.110 --> 02:37:14.870
Yup.

5249
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:15.310
Well,

5250
02:37:15.310 --> 02:37:15.590
uh,

5251
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:16.760
we'll get some people on it,

5252
02:37:16.761 --> 02:37:17.420
man.

5253
02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:18.350
Go Now,

5254
02:37:18.351 --> 02:37:19.131

learn.

5265
02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:28.670
Take it all in bitches.

5266
02:37:28.730 --> 02:37:29.720
You have been blessed.

5267
02:37:29.780 --> 02:37:31.100
We need to go to Japan and visit.

5268
02:37:31.220 --> 02:37:31.730
Okay,

5269
02:37:31.730 --> 02:37:32.690
well you know what,

5270
02:37:32.691 --> 02:37:32.990
I'm,

5271
02:37:32.990 --> 02:37:34.460
I'll probably go um,

5272
02:37:34.490 --> 02:37:35.300
uh,

5273
02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:36.111
if they have a,

5274
02:37:36.111 --> 02:37:38.060
a UFC pay per view there again,

5275
02:37:38.350 --> 02:37:40.100
the UFC is doing very well in Japan,

5276
02:37:40.340 --> 02:37:40.941
so if we do,

5277
02:37:40.941 --> 02:37:41.421
we'll party.

5278
02:37:41.421 --> 02:37:41.631
Man,

5279
02:37:41.631 --> 02:37:42.530
I'll bring you down there.

5280
02:37:42.830 --> 02:37:44.210
We'll get some Sushi together.

5281
02:37:44.211 --> 02:37:45.800
We'll have a fucking vegetable shindig.

5282
02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:46.910
We'll have a great time.

5283
02:37:46.940 --> 02:37:48.020
Eat like crocodiles.

5284
02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:49.220
Some dude's kick some ass.

5285
02:37:49.310 --> 02:37:53.630
Hopefully no dudes with no dicks with beat up chicks and I'll have to eat my

5286
02:37:53.631 --> 02:37:54.250
words.

5287
02:37:54.250 --> 02:37:54.580
I just,

5288
02:37:54.580 --> 02:37:58.040
if I have to call a transgender versus a woman just meeting these people are,

5289
02:37:58.041 --> 02:37:58.880
they're going to be pissed.

5290
02:37:59.090 --> 02:38:00.110
Well listen man,

5291
02:38:00.111 --> 02:38:02.630
I told him I support your right to be that person.

5292
02:38:02.631 --> 02:38:04.820
I don't have no problem with you and your choices,

5293
02:38:04.821 --> 02:38:07.850
but you can't be knocking out checks 20 seconds.

5294
02:38:07.970 --> 02:38:08.510
That's like,

5295
02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:10.900
that sounds like what it would be if a guy was fighting to check.

5296
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.320
Yeah.

5297
02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:13.040
You hear about a 22nd knockout.

5298
02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:13.311
