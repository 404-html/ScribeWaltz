1
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.290
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.760
<v Speaker 1>He got appreciate a person who shows up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with not just food but booze.</v>

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.140
<v Speaker 1>You showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He brought whiskey and fish.</v>

5
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.760
<v Speaker 1>That's very impressive.</v>

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.730
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's exactly what my mom</v>
<v Speaker 2>taught me.</v>

7
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Your mother taught you to bring food and</v>
<v Speaker 1>booze everywhere.</v>

8
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.750
<v Speaker 1>you got a good mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

10
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.850
<v Speaker 1>So your name is you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would introduce yourself as</v>

11
00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Valentine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your mom calls you Valentyn.</v>

12
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 2>It's what I wanted to choose myself to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>English speaking.</v>

13
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 2>People say I'm Valentine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 2>But then when I speak to somebody that</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaks French,</v>

15
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I say violence in</v>

16
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.170
<v Speaker 1>volunteer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

17
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're from Montreal.</v>

18
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

19
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I found out about you online and I've</v>

20
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>read your story and it's a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting story because you.</v>

21
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 1>You were a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be low and I did my law degree</v>

23
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:08.691
<v Speaker 2>in Montreal and then I did my master in</v>
<v Speaker 2>law to before moving to London.</v>

24
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.100
<v Speaker 1>And now you are a spear Fisher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

25
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Full time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy.</v>

26
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting transition.</v>

27
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by spear phishing.</v>

28
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.960
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems very exciting and dangerous and</v>

29
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:27.680
<v Speaker 1>risky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how did you go from being a lawyer?</v>

30
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

31
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:31.760
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you gotta pay for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

32
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:32.960
<v Speaker 1>You had to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well in Canada.</v>

33
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to pay for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>

34
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.171
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

35
00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda cheap compared to the US</v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

36
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 2>It's about something maybe like three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$4,000 a year.</v>

37
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 2>So competent us is almost free I guess.</v>

38
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not bad.</v>

39
00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>4,000 a year,</v>

40
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.651
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's three,</v>

41
00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:50.980
<v Speaker 1>4,000 a year for many years that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided.</v>

42
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just rather.</v>

43
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.690
<v Speaker 2>My mom definitely didn't get a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>return on investment.</v>

44
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they feel about you doing this?</v>

45
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she still sends me university</v>

46
00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:04.670
<v Speaker 2>applications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time to time,</v>

47
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:06.260
<v Speaker 2>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

48
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.780
<v Speaker 2>when I used to do something different or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

49
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:09.650
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

50
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm not having a midlife crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like what it was doing.</v>

51
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.800
<v Speaker 2>So I just picked something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

52
00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:17.180
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to apologize for my</v>

53
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:19.850
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems perfect for Montreal.</v>

54
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:21.260
<v Speaker 2>So French is my first language.</v>

55
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're way better than George St Pierre</v>

56
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>who was here a couple of weeks ago and</v>
<v Speaker 1>George is more hard to understand and he</v>

57
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:28.570
<v Speaker 1>was fine.</v>

58
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I'm not going to speak like this</v>

59
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 2>and make enough wealth to.</v>

60
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm impressing anybody.</v>

61
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>You can speak more than one language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just in Thailand.</v>

62
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing that they speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>English so perfectly,</v>

63
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then their languages.</v>

64
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.110
<v Speaker 1>So oddly different than ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

65
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>you decided when to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how,</v>

66
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.140
<v Speaker 1>how deep into your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your law career were you?</v>

67
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.750
<v Speaker 2>It was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually made a career switch when I</v>

68
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 2>moved to London in 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I started working in finance.</v>

69
00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 2>So I work for hedge funds and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically decided on a quitting law.</v>

70
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like the part of law at where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was stuck in one place.</v>

71
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

72
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 2>when you study law see in Canada than</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

73
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Even in Canada it's even worse because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was studying in Quebec,</v>

74
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 2>which is civil law and then I was stuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Quebec for rest of my life and I just</v>

75
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.614
<v Speaker 2>got like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

76
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.873
<v Speaker 2>that's not gonna happen.</v>

77
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.720
<v Speaker 1>So meaning that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

78
00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:23.000
<v Speaker 1>So like if you pass the bar in</v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

79
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.270
<v Speaker 1>you would also have to pass the bar in</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York if you wanted to work in New</v>

80
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.810
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

81
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's different than.</v>

82
00:03:29.931 --> 00:03:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Is that the same with like if you were a</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor,</v>

83
00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:32.684
<v Speaker 1>would that be the case?</v>

84
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>countrywise I would say statewide</v>

85
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.080
<v Speaker 1>couldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But state wise it is for law.</v>

86
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for you,</v>

87
00:03:40.881 --> 00:03:45.020
<v Speaker 1>you would have got stuck in Quebec in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec is a very interesting place</v>

88
00:03:45.021 --> 00:03:47.120
<v Speaker 1>because it kind of doesn't want to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of Canada.</v>

89
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.400
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're very different in Canada,</v>

90
00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:52.580
<v Speaker 2>but my biggest problem with Quebec is</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely not a culture.</v>

91
00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Anything like that is to fight that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an eight month long winter.</v>

92
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.230
<v Speaker 2>It's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Mom,</v>

93
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing what the people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

94
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.070
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very European city actually in</v>

95
00:04:04.071 --> 00:04:05.450
<v Speaker 2>Canada it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's people.</v>

96
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.930
<v Speaker 2>People are very about food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about sitting outside.</v>

97
00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

98
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>to my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David and Fred from Joe beef in</v>

99
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the best restaurants in the</v>

100
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:14.930
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every there.</v>

101
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

102
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>

103
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a German place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sorry.</v>

104
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 1>So you decided you didn't want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck?</v>

105
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much.</v>

106
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I kind of got like cluster phobic of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being like,</v>

107
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be the next 40 years of</v>

108
00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:32.990
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you get into spearfishing?</v>

109
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm very weird story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

110
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.800
<v Speaker 2>I got into spearfishing when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in London,</v>

111
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.600
<v Speaker 2>which still doesn't make much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>

112
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met this guy and he was like,</v>

113
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.410
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to try spearfishing will be so</v>

114
00:04:48.411 --> 00:04:51.590
<v Speaker 2>good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he asked me to go do a course in</v>

115
00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:53.120
<v Speaker 2>Egypt the freediving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>

116
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.240
<v Speaker 2>ah right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to Egypt.</v>

117
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.070
<v Speaker 2>It's very big for food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've eaten.</v>

118
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.260
<v Speaker 2>The sea is like very clear and deep and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is beautiful and it's calm very</v>

119
00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:06.150
<v Speaker 2>often you can swim from shore and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have very great depth.</v>

120
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:08.150
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really nice with that.</v>

121
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.580
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did my course.</v>

122
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I when they're literally kicking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming,</v>

123
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:16.340
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was 14 years old,</v>

124
00:05:16.341 --> 00:05:19.910
<v Speaker 2>I almost drowned and a sat of France</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my parents refused to swim in the</v>

125
00:05:19.911 --> 00:05:24.530
<v Speaker 2>ocean for about 10 years after that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>break if I couldn't see the bottom and</v>

126
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.260
<v Speaker 2>who was not even interested in going</v>
<v Speaker 2>near the water.</v>

127
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.610
<v Speaker 2>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

128
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try this thing and I go</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and I'm like,</v>

129
00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:33.321
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

130
00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:34.590
<v Speaker 2>It's not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

131
00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:36.740
<v Speaker 2>it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually really cool.</v>

132
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.900
<v Speaker 2>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

133
00:05:38.901 --> 00:05:41.630
<v Speaker 2>well now you know how to freedive in</v>
<v Speaker 2>three months.</v>

134
00:05:41.631 --> 00:05:44.870
<v Speaker 2>We're going to this very big spear</v>
<v Speaker 2>fishing trip on ascension island.</v>

135
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Ascension island is literally one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest,</v>

136
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.630
<v Speaker 2>most elite spearfishing destination in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

137
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.470
<v Speaker 2>You go hunt for big fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's running all over the Atlantic.</v>

138
00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 2>It's right between Brazil and Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a island divided between the US and</v>

139
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 2>the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

140
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To people live on it.</v>

141
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have locals that.</v>

142
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.600
<v Speaker 2>What language do they speak English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

143
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

144
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very odd place,</v>

145
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:11.384
<v Speaker 2>but it's very pretty</v>

146
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.350
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is Jamie nailed it.</v>

147
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Governor up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the Google maps tells?</v>

148
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.930
<v Speaker 1>How long does it take to get there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finishing up in the middle of nowhere.</v>

149
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.060
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the middle of nowhere,</v>

150
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.970
<v Speaker 1>but wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's between Africa and Brazil.</v>

151
00:06:24.971 --> 00:06:25.480
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking.</v>

152
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to go to the military base and</v>

153
00:06:29.371 --> 00:06:31.840
<v Speaker 2>the and the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about an hour and a half away</v>

154
00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:36.220
<v Speaker 2>from London and we have to take care of</v>
<v Speaker 2>burl air force flight there.</v>

155
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I was the only way to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no commercial place real as a</v>

156
00:06:39.491 --> 00:06:43.330
<v Speaker 2>stopover on the way from the military</v>
<v Speaker 2>base in the UK to the Falklands.</v>

157
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.070
<v Speaker 1>So how does civilian get a rod on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>military flight?</v>

158
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 2>They allow about five civilians per</v>
<v Speaker 2>flight.</v>

159
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you book it?</v>

160
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 2>A travel agent or something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

161
00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do the king myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's like through to the</v>

162
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 2>airline or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

163
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 2>It was a weird experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was imagining like what I was like</v>

164
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 2>being strapped down and then facing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other side is actually a commercial</v>

165
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:15.311
<v Speaker 2>flight just because it's bigger guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the movie Predator now I was</v>

166
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:19.780
<v Speaker 2>really expecting that and then I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>doors opening the bag and there was like</v>

167
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:20.620
<v Speaker 2>run out</v>

168
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 1>because I have some friends that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>done some gigs overseas and they have</v>

169
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:29.420
<v Speaker 1>had to fly in those kind of plans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds pretty cool I guess until</v>

170
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:30.440
<v Speaker 1>someone shoots at you.</v>

171
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would make it a bad day.</v>

172
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.130
<v Speaker 1>That would change things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you were free diving before you</v>

173
00:07:38.131 --> 00:07:40.440
<v Speaker 1>went to this elite spear fishing</v>
<v Speaker 1>destination,</v>

174
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.640
<v Speaker 1>how long could you hold your breath?</v>

175
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.620
<v Speaker 2>When I started?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

176
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Siro probably like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 seconds.</v>

177
00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 2>And so you're going there with 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 seconds where the breath.</v>

178
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just did my deepest dive on my way.</v>

179
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:57.680
<v Speaker 2>There was something like 15 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

180
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

181
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's close enough to yard.</v>

182
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 2>We understand what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five meters 45 feet.</v>

183
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 2>So it was something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that great.</v>

184
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.240
<v Speaker 2>And I actually remember my first time I</v>
<v Speaker 2>went spearfishing,</v>

185
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 2>I was on a boat and the word was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

186
00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 2>It was rocky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

187
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:17.210
<v Speaker 2>when it sees like black black because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's raining and I was in the back of</v>

188
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:18.260
<v Speaker 2>the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was shaking,</v>

189
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:20.390
<v Speaker 2>I was holding my little gun and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

190
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:25.020
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck am I doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like one that watching tv right now,</v>

191
00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 2>like I don't want to be here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be here,</v>

192
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:28.580
<v Speaker 2>don't want to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then my friend was like,</v>

193
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.450
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop being a fucking pussy,</v>

194
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 2>just Japanese boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just jump in the water and come.</v>

195
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.193
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>

196
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.063
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

197
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 2>I take a deep breath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I jump in.</v>

198
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.220
<v Speaker 2>And then the water was so dark and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible and sharp just became super</v>

199
00:08:43.221 --> 00:08:45.650
<v Speaker 2>claim and there was fish everywhere and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

200
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually pretty freaking cool.</v>

201
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.260
<v Speaker 1>And you're doing this again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free diving.</v>

202
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Worried having no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no tanks.</v>

203
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Well I take my first job so I'm a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit clumsy because I have my gun and I'm</v>

204
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:54.481
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

205
00:08:54.481 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know how to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How to</v>

206
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 3>five a debt and then I took a shot down</v>
<v Speaker 3>my first fish and they stoned it and my</v>

207
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:02.514
<v Speaker 3>friend was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

208
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 3>I could live in a first shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's haunting terms too.</v>

209
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.590
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I,</v>

210
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.840
<v Speaker 3>my friend was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you're not done,</v>

211
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to grab the fish,</v>

212
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 3>have to drag it all the way to the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

213
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.580
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

214
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 3>Have they finished?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have always in my face.</v>

215
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:21.270
<v Speaker 3>And then like I get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was quite a big fish.</v>

216
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 3>It was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was good.</v>

217
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 3>It was a black Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not that great to eat black</v>

218
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.123
<v Speaker 3>Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

219
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.510
<v Speaker 3>probably something that many people will</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat.</v>

220
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't they eat it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

221
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.950
<v Speaker 3>it's edible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not bad.</v>

222
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 3>It's just not one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a very flaky fish.</v>

223
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little tough.</v>

224
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 3>A little tough.</v>

225
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's just too dense or something?</v>

226
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>

227
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 3>It's their very strong fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

228
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.440
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>

229
00:09:50.441 --> 00:09:52.840
<v Speaker 3>It converge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like.</v>

230
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.560
<v Speaker 3>A fish to dale was about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 25 pounds.</v>

231
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

00:10:12.851 --> 00:10:15.400
<v Speaker 4>with all these cool fucking fish and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these.</v>

237
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look like you're living a life of</v>

238
00:10:18.011 --> 00:10:19.930
<v Speaker 4>adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the reasons why I wanted</v>

239
00:10:19.931 --> 00:10:22.030
<v Speaker 4>to talk to you about is that a lion fish</v>
<v Speaker 4>are killed.</v>

240
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.060
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lion fish.</v>

241
00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:24.610
<v Speaker 3>And you eat those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They taste.</v>

242
00:10:24.611 --> 00:10:27.610
<v Speaker 3>They probably one of the best dating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tasting fish ever.</v>

243
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.890
<v Speaker 3>Then he realized they're fantastic.</v>

244
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:32.560
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever get them on them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they commercially available?</v>

245
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.270
<v Speaker 4>Do they or is it</v>

246
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.950
<v Speaker 3>something you can find them at Publix in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida.</v>

247
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is what I was very surprised</v>

248
00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:40.870
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have to be really careful when</v>

249
00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:42.130
<v Speaker 3>you harvest them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

250
00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:44.560
<v Speaker 3>because if you touch a spine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's poisonous,</v>

251
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.680
<v Speaker 3>very poisonous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just painful.</v>

252
00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:51.400
<v Speaker 3>It's not deadly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you can get into a bloodstream</v>

253
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.760
<v Speaker 3>epileptic shock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

254
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.690
<v Speaker 3>well good was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't happen,</v>

255
00:10:55.691 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 3>but normally you just have like if</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody was Tommy Tommy's like,</v>

256
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.960
<v Speaker 3>you had a hammer in your head</v>
<v Speaker 3>repeatedly.</v>

257
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a throbbing pain for about a</v>

258
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.570
<v Speaker 3>day and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

259
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.690
<v Speaker 3>So I got bullied in almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a paint.</v>

260
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.591
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

261
00:11:08.591 --> 00:11:10.630
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really try to avoid it.</v>

262
00:11:10.631 --> 00:11:14.360
<v Speaker 3>All costs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what would you compare the meat to</v>

263
00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.570
<v Speaker 3>hogfish</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

264
00:11:19.571 --> 00:11:24.571
<v Speaker 3>or maybe a very tiny Chilean sea bass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that type of oily flaky.</v>

265
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.560
<v Speaker 4>Did you know what to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We talk about this on the podcast.</v>

266
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.140
<v Speaker 4>Chilean sea bass is not really a basket</v>
<v Speaker 4>to cod</v>

267
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.770
<v Speaker 3>torch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds also endangered.</v>

268
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.940
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it endangered?</v>

269
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.470
<v Speaker 3>How's it on every menu?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's endangered assholes.</v>

270
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.600
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you,</v>

271
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.610
<v Speaker 4>you go to this one destination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

272
00:11:49.611 --> 00:11:51.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you shoot this black Jack.</v>

273
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.800
<v Speaker 4>Were you hooked immediately?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

274
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:54.270
<v Speaker 4>Real.</v>

275
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.800
<v Speaker 2>It was not about a spearfishing part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

276
00:11:56.801 --> 00:12:01.240
<v Speaker 2>I was still traumatized in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still had panics attacks when I was in</v>

277
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:06.241
<v Speaker 2>the water and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I fell in love the second I arrived</v>

278
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:10.810
<v Speaker 2>to shore and we barbecued a fish on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>beach and I was like,</v>

279
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.290
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is this.</v>

280
00:12:12.291 --> 00:12:13.124
<v Speaker 2>Just for me,</v>

281
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.340
<v Speaker 1>the same exact thing that happened to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I went deer hunting when we,</v>

282
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:22.490
<v Speaker 1>me and my friend Brian Cowen and Steve</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rinella and Dan dody were cooking this</v>

283
00:12:22.561 --> 00:12:25.920
<v Speaker 1>deer meat by a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

284
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.310
<v Speaker 1>this is the greatest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the meat was so fresh because it</v>

285
00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:31.070
<v Speaker 1>was like from an animal that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.480
<v Speaker 1>literally killed hours ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we're eating it by,</v>

287
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.590
<v Speaker 1>by the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

288
00:12:34.591 --> 00:12:36.030
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this forever.</v>

289
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.230
<v Speaker 1>This is the greatest thing ever,</v>

290
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

291
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.860
<v Speaker 2>it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel,</v>

292
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.860
<v Speaker 2>you feel what I was taught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People list that,</v>

293
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you live in a big city,</v>

294
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.030
<v Speaker 2>like when I've never experienced that</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

295
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.730
<v Speaker 2>I've never felt that I was part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ecosystem whatsoever.</v>

296
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.870
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting myself into water when I'm</v>

297
00:12:57.871 --> 00:13:01.260
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by sharks are big fish or</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things and I'm like,</v>

298
00:13:01.261 --> 00:13:03.480
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're actually not in top of the food</v>

299
00:13:03.481 --> 00:13:06.840
<v Speaker 2>chain at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of stuff on buffalo's I</v>

300
00:13:06.841 --> 00:13:08.220
<v Speaker 2>can kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

301
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.880
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

302
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.660
<v Speaker 2>it's carrying is humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think as a person you have to</v>

303
00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:14.070
<v Speaker 2>experience that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

304
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.140
<v Speaker 2>you have to put yourself out of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>conference old to understand that you</v>

305
00:13:19.141 --> 00:13:23.380
<v Speaker 2>need to respect what's around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell me 10 years ago,</v>

306
00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have g debt fish because it's bad</v>

307
00:13:25.111 --> 00:13:26.070
<v Speaker 2>for drm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd be like,</v>

308
00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:26.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

309
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.650
<v Speaker 2>sure buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

310
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.950
<v Speaker 2>And then you see an implant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

311
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.671
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that looks good.</v>

312
00:13:29.671 --> 00:13:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Then it's fine and this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when you under water and you</v>

313
00:13:32.371 --> 00:13:34.760
<v Speaker 2>see what's going on and you see that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spot,</v>

314
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.080
<v Speaker 2>you've been diving for five years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>southern is empty.</v>

315
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Then it makes you understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

316
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.860
<v Speaker 2>we actually have a very strong impact</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

317
00:13:41.861 --> 00:13:43.880
<v Speaker 2>it's our job to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

318
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.810
<v Speaker 2>to understand and respect it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're where we're at,</v>

319
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.180
<v Speaker 2>where did ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the one that we're the smartest</v>

320
00:13:51.181 --> 00:13:52.980
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes</v>

321
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.340
<v Speaker 1>we're the only ones that are consciously</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of our actions and the</v>

322
00:13:56.341 --> 00:13:57.760
<v Speaker 1>repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

323
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.790
<v Speaker 1>of our actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

324
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:03.180
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're first experiencing this,</v>

325
00:14:03.181 --> 00:14:08.181
<v Speaker 1>your first time eat and this feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 1>connectedness and freedom and just being</v>

326
00:14:10.711 --> 00:14:15.270
<v Speaker 1>a part of the ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you imagine that somehow know that</v>

327
00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.130
<v Speaker 1>this could be your life and your job?</v>

328
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

329
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:19.390
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

330
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.580
<v Speaker 2>I've never been hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big fan of.</v>

331
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.800
<v Speaker 2>I've never used to be a big fan of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>outdoors.</v>

332
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

333
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:26.770
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't go to the gym,</v>

334
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.390
<v Speaker 2>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the gym,</v>

335
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.970
<v Speaker 2>basically does everything and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden I was living in London and the</v>

336
00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:37.280
<v Speaker 2>Nice apartment with two dogs and a nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>car and all of a sudden I wasn't</v>

337
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.640
<v Speaker 2>freaking Africa camping at a Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catching,</v>

338
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.570
<v Speaker 2>catching my own food and sharing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>villages that had nothing to eat.</v>

339
00:14:43.571 --> 00:14:44.381
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

340
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 2>well this is,</v>

341
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.040
<v Speaker 1>that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how did you go from this one trip?</v>

342
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got invited to film a documentary,</v>

343
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.090
<v Speaker 2>food sourcing and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

344
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I fell in love with it and the</v>

345
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:59.630
<v Speaker 2>second I went back to London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember sitting in my desk and be</v>

346
00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:02.480
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I can do that.</v>

347
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.030
<v Speaker 2>There's no way I can keep doing that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of my life.</v>

348
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 2>And everybody thought I was completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

349
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I sold everything I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I and I just left.</v>

350
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:17.210
<v Speaker 2>I moved away and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have like maybe two suitcases of stuff</v>

351
00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:18.570
<v Speaker 2>for the past three years and</v>

352
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I was reading somewhere where they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do an interview on you and they</v>

353
00:15:24.871 --> 00:15:27.060
<v Speaker 1>decided not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are going to feature you in</v>

354
00:15:27.061 --> 00:15:32.061
<v Speaker 1>something with a decided not to because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of concerns for the depletion of fish in</v>

355
00:15:32.701 --> 00:15:34.380
<v Speaker 1>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

356
00:15:34.381 --> 00:15:38.550
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the dumbest fucking thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever heard because the impact of</v>

357
00:15:38.551 --> 00:15:41.760
<v Speaker 1>someone like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing for your own personal</v>

358
00:15:41.761 --> 00:15:44.580
<v Speaker 1>consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a fish a day or whatever you're</v>

359
00:15:44.581 --> 00:15:48.930
<v Speaker 1>getting for your own personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption is negligible in comparison</v>

360
00:15:48.931 --> 00:15:51.210
<v Speaker 1>to all these people that are probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing these articles that are going to</v>

361
00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:54.590
<v Speaker 1>buy Sushi from commercial fishermen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

362
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.870
<v Speaker 1>They're buying fish from the store</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrapped in Saran wrap.</v>

363
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.240
<v Speaker 1>They're completely out of touch with</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean your intouch.</v>

364
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:07.230
<v Speaker 1>You're as in touch as you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to think that somehow or another</v>

365
00:16:07.231 --> 00:16:11.550
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something evil because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>take photos of it and put it on your</v>

366
00:16:11.551 --> 00:16:13.170
<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was that one?</v>

367
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.620
<v Speaker 1>You had this amazing photo from a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>days ago with you.</v>

368
00:16:16.621 --> 00:16:20.270
<v Speaker 1>This is big fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so fresh and you,</v>

369
00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:23.820
<v Speaker 1>you guys were eating pieces of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had cut a chunk of out of out of its</v>

370
00:16:23.821 --> 00:16:24.654
<v Speaker 1>tail?</v>

371
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was in Thailand?</v>

372
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paquette.</v>

373
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.393
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

374
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.640
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

375
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.060
<v Speaker 2>We just went with this friend of ours</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his family and we just went off for</v>

376
00:16:33.061 --> 00:16:35.150
<v Speaker 2>the day and we went spearfishing with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend.</v>

377
00:16:35.151 --> 00:16:37.070
<v Speaker 2>We caught a fish and and the guy was</v>
<v Speaker 2>super happy.</v>

378
00:16:37.071 --> 00:16:40.250
<v Speaker 2>He cut a right on the spot and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids were just speaking on it and it</v>

379
00:16:40.251 --> 00:16:42.380
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were so excited.</v>

380
00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:45.770
<v Speaker 2>The second year he came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second day came that the boat</v>

381
00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:48.350
<v Speaker 2>arrived back to the island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just went and grabbed the fish and</v>

382
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:50.240
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to take pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was super cute.</v>

383
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.010
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the argument for not.</v>

384
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.560
<v Speaker 1>What was the piece that they were trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put you in where they pulled you out</v>

385
00:16:55.561 --> 00:16:56.400
<v Speaker 1>of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that about?</v>

386
00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.410
<v Speaker 2>That story is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still so getting me pretty angry.</v>

387
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.970
<v Speaker 2>So basically where I was speaking at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman empowerment conference in New York</v>

388
00:17:05.971 --> 00:17:10.920
<v Speaker 2>last May and then when I was actually in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thailand that the woman that is</v>

389
00:17:10.921 --> 00:17:13.650
<v Speaker 2>organizing it calls me and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

390
00:17:13.651 --> 00:17:15.630
<v Speaker 2>look Valentine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I need to talk to you about</v>

391
00:17:15.631 --> 00:17:16.570
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

392
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little touchy.</v>

393
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.013
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

394
00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:19.980
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

395
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:24.650
<v Speaker 2>one of her sponsor said that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak at a conference being on a which</v>

396
00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:27.540
<v Speaker 2>will do participation and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conference,</v>

397
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:30.090
<v Speaker 2>what was the sponsor and the Wall Street</v>
<v Speaker 2>Journal,</v>

398
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.520
<v Speaker 2>The Wall Street Journal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

399
00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.250
<v Speaker 2>and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

400
00:17:35.251 --> 00:17:40.251
<v Speaker 2>do you feel like that's your lifestyle</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't aligned with ocean preservation</v>

401
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.640
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said some.</v>

402
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.370
<v Speaker 2>She didn't say it directly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she said,</v>

403
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>and you know me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't mind that you</v>

404
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 3>have pictures in a bathing suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

405
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.480
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean patient in my basics</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

406
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Burkini was not clean.</v>

407
00:17:57.001 --> 00:17:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you want from me at a beach?</v>

408
00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:01.320
<v Speaker 3>When am I supposed to wear your also</v>
<v Speaker 3>swimming?</v>

409
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not wearing a bathing suit.</v>

410
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.120
<v Speaker 3>You mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you're in your house</v>

411
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.220
<v Speaker 1>heels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

412
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.910
<v Speaker 1>being an Insta model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wearing a bathing suit.</v>

413
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.820
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're wearing a bathing suit</v>

414
00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.560
<v Speaker 1>because you're actually in the water.</v>

415
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in Mykonos next year.</v>

416
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.020
<v Speaker 3>Fricking pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in,</v>

417
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in Africa on a beach when it's like</v>

418
00:18:19.971 --> 00:18:23.660
<v Speaker 3>110 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I supposed to went with Dan</v>

419
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.550
<v Speaker 3>Bilzerian</v>
<v Speaker 3>respect.</v>

420
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:28.550
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

421
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.190
<v Speaker 1>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you say to them?</v>

422
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's Wall Street Journal that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so crazy,</v>

423
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get it from their perspective.</v>

424
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a bullshit argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from their perspective it's just</v>

425
00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:43.010
<v Speaker 1>about optics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about how it looks.</v>

426
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.520
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they go there and people love to</v>

427
00:18:46.521 --> 00:18:49.760
<v Speaker 1>get outraged about something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they go there and then they go to</v>

428
00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:52.100
<v Speaker 1>your instagram and they find pictures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you with fish,</v>

429
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.990
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this girl is cleaning out the</v>

430
00:18:53.991 --> 00:18:56.200
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All buyers killing home.</v>

431
00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very good.</v>

432
00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.640
<v Speaker 1>You have to be really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

433
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.270
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen a commercial fishing</v>
<v Speaker 1>boat?</v>

434
00:19:02.271 --> 00:19:03.520
<v Speaker 1>What they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

435
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Most people have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie CV could pull off the horrific</v>

436
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:13.540
<v Speaker 1>effects of commercial net fishing</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you find a video,</v>

437
00:19:14.151 --> 00:19:19.151
<v Speaker 1>we can watch a clip of the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy when you see the sheer volume</v>

438
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:25.330
<v Speaker 1>of fish that they pull out of the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you realize there's countless</v>

439
00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:30.731
<v Speaker 1>numbers of these boats and essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much unregulated and no one's</v>

440
00:19:32.211 --> 00:19:34.070
<v Speaker 1>watching them and they're doing it all</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the world.</v>

441
00:19:34.071 --> 00:19:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's areas where you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to fish,</v>

442
00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:41.140
<v Speaker 1>but overall it's nothing like the way we</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat wild mammals or wild birds.</v>

443
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.170
<v Speaker 1>The way we treat wild mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in North America,</v>

444
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.830
<v Speaker 1>is they're very closely monitored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their numbers,</v>

445
00:19:48.831 --> 00:19:52.730
<v Speaker 1>their populations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We we make sure that unless it's an</v>

446
00:19:52.731 --> 00:19:55.610
<v Speaker 1>invasive species like wild pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like here we go,</v>

447
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.400
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is awful.</v>

448
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.620
<v Speaker 1>They take this gigantic net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they circle all these fish and then when</v>

449
00:20:03.621 --> 00:20:07.060
<v Speaker 1>they're pulling them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to see the sheer volume so you</v>

450
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.210
<v Speaker 1>as they get close,</v>

451
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.070
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

452
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the smoother way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>commercial fish.</v>

453
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Francis ready big and it's two</v>
<v Speaker 3>kilometers wide net.</v>

454
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.700
<v Speaker 3>That is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

455
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.640
<v Speaker 3>It's scraping the bottom completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroying evidence during the coral</v>

456
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:26.730
<v Speaker 3>stocks on each side.</v>

457
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.050
<v Speaker 1>This is actually a fairly mild one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like they're getting these</v>

458
00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:33.510
<v Speaker 1>little tiny fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but me,</v>

459
00:20:33.511 --> 00:20:36.120
<v Speaker 1>you could find it folks if you wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go and google it online,</v>

460
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:38.310
<v Speaker 1>but that is the issue too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

461
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:41.130
<v Speaker 1>That these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these nets go all the way to the bottom</v>

462
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.530
<v Speaker 1>and they destroy anything that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch.</v>

463
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Like the whole bottom of the ocean just</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets dragged</v>

464
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.230
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the coral gets destroyed.</v>

465
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.640
<v Speaker 2>It's this extremely destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's what?</v>

466
00:20:52.641 --> 00:20:54.160
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you get Sushi.</v>

467
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 2>There's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fish industry,</v>

468
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not even necessarily how you get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sushi.</v>

469
00:20:59.221 --> 00:21:03.100
<v Speaker 2>It's how you get Sushi so damn cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

470
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.830
<v Speaker 2>It's by DOJ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we keep doing that is literally going</v>

471
00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.390
<v Speaker 2>to be no fish very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

472
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 2>very soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then how do you explain to us and</v>

473
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how to spearfish what and you</v>

474
00:21:13.691 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 2>have to release most of the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You run rail.</v>

475
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.820
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the fishing rod,</v>

476
00:21:18.821 --> 00:21:23.821
<v Speaker 2>unreal reel in Kendall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stryper is try pass and how many?</v>

477
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.490
<v Speaker 2>How many can you get a day striped bass</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one a day or something?</v>

478
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 2>One day spearfishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One a day and and the US site Canada,</v>

479
00:21:31.841 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Speaker 2>you not even touch anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't use spear phishing Canada</v>

480
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.430
<v Speaker 2>because the Anglers Association in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

481
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.600
<v Speaker 2>things that were the evil basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're evil.</v>

482
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you can actually see what you're</v>

483
00:21:45.431 --> 00:21:46.264
<v Speaker 2>catching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

484
00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:50.020
<v Speaker 2>so basically what cheaters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we can see the fish and I'm</v>

485
00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:53.200
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you be in your camping chairs on</v>

486
00:21:53.201 --> 00:21:55.480
<v Speaker 2>your boat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drinking Beers all day.</v>

487
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Telling me that I'm the cheater when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>working my ass off.</v>

488
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Diving it like 60 feet to catch my fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bring it back.</v>

489
00:22:03.251 --> 00:22:05.770
<v Speaker 2>And I wrecked my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I risked my life drowning and was my</v>

490
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:08.170
<v Speaker 2>left would sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I risked my life with all sorts of</v>

491
00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:11.860
<v Speaker 2>things that can happen and you telling</v>
<v Speaker 2>me drinking you,</v>

492
00:22:11.861 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Speaker 2>but wiser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fricking camping chair that I'm the</v>

493
00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:15.460
<v Speaker 2>cheater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

494
00:22:15.461 --> 00:22:16.294
<v Speaker 2>but no.</v>

495
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.210
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people always want to think that</v>

496
00:22:18.211 --> 00:22:20.600
<v Speaker 4>everybody else is doing it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>

497
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vegans,</v>

498
00:22:21.931 --> 00:22:23.820
<v Speaker 4>one of the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that eat meat or doing it wrong,</v>

499
00:22:23.821 --> 00:22:25.130
<v Speaker 4>people did eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things,</v>

500
00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.840
<v Speaker 4>vegans are doing it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People fish off a boat.</v>

501
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.630
<v Speaker 4>Want to think that people's spearfish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it wrong,</v>

502
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.670
<v Speaker 4>you think they're probably doing it</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong?</v>

503
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have nothing.</v>

504
00:22:35.061 --> 00:22:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catching you on food as long as you</v>

505
00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.870
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>respectful what would do where you do</v>

506
00:22:38.871 --> 00:22:41.540
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was a big scandal in Florida</v>

507
00:22:41.541 --> 00:22:44.330
<v Speaker 2>for the past years with the Brett snap</v>
<v Speaker 2>or by example,</v>

508
00:22:44.331 --> 00:22:47.060
<v Speaker 2>and it was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

509
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.480
<v Speaker 2>like recreational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recreational fishing.</v>

510
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:54.410
<v Speaker 2>You allowed a certain amount of red</v>
<v Speaker 2>snapper and the new season closes and</v>

511
00:22:54.411 --> 00:22:57.680
<v Speaker 2>then when the season closes as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

512
00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.700
<v Speaker 2>my license to fish is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he gave it away to the</v>

513
00:23:01.701 --> 00:23:05.090
<v Speaker 2>commercial fishermen</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

514
00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.450
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically you telling me that I'm not</v>

515
00:23:08.451 --> 00:23:11.510
<v Speaker 2>allowed to catch that fish for a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>months because the population is too</v>

516
00:23:11.511 --> 00:23:14.990
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you given my quota to the</v>

517
00:23:14.991 --> 00:23:17.390
<v Speaker 2>commercial boats that are catching</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds a day.</v>

518
00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.140
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

519
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

520
00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:25.640
<v Speaker 2>No it doesn't.</v>

521
00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.040
<v Speaker 4>But most people are not going to spear</v>
<v Speaker 4>fish.</v>

522
00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.320
<v Speaker 4>Most people are going to fish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they don't.</v>

523
00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.240
<v Speaker 4>You guys don't have a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

524
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:37.270
<v Speaker 4>In terms of like representative voice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some comes to creating these laws and</v>

525
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.490
<v Speaker 4>establishing these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these rules.</v>

526
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.380
<v Speaker 4>There's not that many of you.</v>

527
00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're ready.</v>

528
00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.350
<v Speaker 2>And the food chain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're the.</v>

529
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.680
<v Speaker 2>We're the plankton is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

530
00:23:45.681 --> 00:23:49.290
<v Speaker 2>you had a commercial fishing would very</v>
<v Speaker 2>big lobbyists.</v>

531
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of money and then you have the</v>

532
00:23:51.441 --> 00:23:55.070
<v Speaker 2>anglers uses a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still not super bad because they</v>

533
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:57.490
<v Speaker 2>still have big boats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Company and equipment is so like if the</v>

534
00:23:57.491 --> 00:23:58.970
<v Speaker 2>market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is good enough.</v>

535
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.500
<v Speaker 2>And anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spivey,</v>

536
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.100
<v Speaker 2>spivey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shamans were not a lot in the world's</v>

537
00:24:05.101 --> 00:24:06.680
<v Speaker 2>eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even tell you how many,</v>

538
00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:09.200
<v Speaker 2>but we're not 100 million us for</v>
<v Speaker 2>fricking sure.</v>

539
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.670
<v Speaker 1>It's probably less spear fisherman than</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are bow hunters.</v>

540
00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:14.990
<v Speaker 2>That's highly</v>

541
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:19.990
<v Speaker 1>possible I would imagine because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems more dangerous and difficult than</v>

542
00:24:21.321 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 1>bowhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like the next level.</v>

543
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.210
<v Speaker 1>It seems like one of the most difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you could do if you want to get</v>

544
00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:29.690
<v Speaker 1>your food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're going into an alien</v>

545
00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:31.280
<v Speaker 1>environment and you're holding your</v>
<v Speaker 1>breath.</v>

546
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.510
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But actually the human body,</v>

547
00:24:34.511 --> 00:24:36.430
<v Speaker 2>that's the main argument I get from</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

548
00:24:36.431 --> 00:24:37.264
<v Speaker 2>They tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

549
00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I could never do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every year the human body is</v>

550
00:24:41.261 --> 00:24:45.550
<v Speaker 2>actually made to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a thing called the Mammalian</v>

551
00:24:45.551 --> 00:24:50.551
<v Speaker 2>dive reflex and this is very present and</v>
<v Speaker 2>aquatic mammals such as dolphins or</v>

552
00:24:51.851 --> 00:24:55.970
<v Speaker 2>sales and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the human habit in a very way we</v>

553
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.740
<v Speaker 2>create way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we still have it and so when you</v>

554
00:24:59.741 --> 00:25:03.990
<v Speaker 2>immerse your face on the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your heartbeat is automatically going to</v>

555
00:25:03.991 --> 00:25:07.690
<v Speaker 2>slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if the water is colder,</v>

556
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.720
<v Speaker 2>so your body's actually getting prepared</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hold his breath to catch food and</v>

557
00:25:13.801 --> 00:25:15.000
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a new DNA.</v>

558
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Is it preparing to catch food or is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just preparing to survive</v>

559
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.110
<v Speaker 2>to hold your breath underwater?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What reason?</v>

560
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I guess that was a very success</v>

561
00:25:24.941 --> 00:25:27.660
<v Speaker 2>of thing to say because it's I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing catch food,</v>

562
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:31.420
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't see why a human being</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetically would have to go.</v>

563
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:36.820
<v Speaker 1>You're aware of the aquatic ape theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a very controversial theory,</v>

564
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:42.140
<v Speaker 1>but the theory is that we evolved</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another.</v>

565
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins,</v>

566
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 1>apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where at one point in time a land animal</v>

567
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.700
<v Speaker 1>is that crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

568
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Were Dolphins Atlanta animal at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time?</v>

569
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have made that up,</v>

570
00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.920
<v Speaker 1>but the idea was that humans were the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only ape that grew up in close proximity</v>

571
00:26:05.721 --> 00:26:10.430
<v Speaker 1>to water to the point where we evolved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the water dolphins may have remains</v>

572
00:26:10.431 --> 00:26:11.270
<v Speaker 1>of legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

573
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:12.890
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fossil remains shows.</v>

574
00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:17.891
<v Speaker 1>Dolphins and whales were four footed</v>
<v Speaker 1>land animals about 50 million years ago</v>

575
00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.600
<v Speaker 1>and share the same common ancestors is</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippos.</v>

576
00:26:20.601 --> 00:26:22.190
<v Speaker 1>And Dear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

577
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.110
<v Speaker 1>scientists believed that they later</v>
<v Speaker 1>transitioned to an aquatic lifestyle and</v>

578
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.920
<v Speaker 1>that their hind limbs disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

579
00:26:27.921 --> 00:26:31.460
<v Speaker 1>so this is fairly recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about evolutionary terms</v>

580
00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.160
<v Speaker 1>that the dinosaurs were killed 65</v>
<v Speaker 1>million years ago.</v>

581
00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:37.100
<v Speaker 1>So inside of that 15 million years</v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

582
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.100
<v Speaker 1>they were walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking nuts.</v>

583
00:26:40.101 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 1>They were like hippos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think so google doc,</v>

584
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.510
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at what they used to look like.</v>

585
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:46.710
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

586
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.890
<v Speaker 1>A Google aquatic ape theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

587
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about this to really</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak on it,</v>

588
00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:55.260
<v Speaker 1>but that has never stopped me in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

589
00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.370
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

590
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.200
<v Speaker 1>this theory is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why they think humans</v>

591
00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:05.700
<v Speaker 1>have so much fat on us when we're babies</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we float easier and that if you</v>

592
00:27:05.701 --> 00:27:07.620
<v Speaker 1>take a human baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you chuck them in the water.</v>

593
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:08.993
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

594
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 1>how about an actual article and how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture this cartoon.</v>

595
00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:14.691
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually,</v>

596
00:27:14.691 --> 00:27:17.120
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even just about you hobbies</v>

597
00:27:17.121 --> 00:27:19.390
<v Speaker 2>slowing down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of things that happened</v>

598
00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.560
<v Speaker 2>and you like crazy thing.</v>

599
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Babies know how to hold their breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They instantly hold their breath when</v>

600
00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:26.980
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like Nirvana album cover a</v>

601
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.900
<v Speaker 1>million directions.</v>

602
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.461
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

603
00:27:28.461 --> 00:27:29.880
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm talking about.</v>

604
00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Reports</v>

605
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.730
<v Speaker 1>that some humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notably children under five may also use</v>

606
00:27:32.731 --> 00:27:34.710
<v Speaker 1>this reflex to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prolong submersion.</v>

607
00:27:34.711 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 1>The mammalian dive reflex was developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 19 theory was developed in 19</v>

608
00:27:39.361 --> 00:27:41.130
<v Speaker 1>sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That explanation for well publicized</v>

609
00:27:41.131 --> 00:27:45.480
<v Speaker 1>survival of exceptional submersion times</v>
<v Speaker 1>have some near drowning victims.</v>

610
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:46.200
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

611
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.310
<v Speaker 1>see if there's anything like are an</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual article that makes sense on the</v>

612
00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:53.200
<v Speaker 1>aquatic ape theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a new aquatic ape theory from</v>

613
00:27:53.201 --> 00:27:54.300
<v Speaker 1>the Smithsonian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

614
00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:55.940
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

615
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

616
00:27:57.691 --> 00:28:00.090
<v Speaker 1>The aquatic ape theory now largely</v>
<v Speaker 1>dismissed,</v>

617
00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.480
<v Speaker 1>tries to explain the origins of many</v>
<v Speaker 1>humankind,</v>

618
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.690
<v Speaker 1>a unique traits popular as the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>

619
00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:09.630
<v Speaker 1>19 eighties by writer Elaine Morgan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theory suggests that early hominids</v>

620
00:28:09.631 --> 00:28:11.310
<v Speaker 1>lived in water at least part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

621
00:28:11.311 --> 00:28:15.810
<v Speaker 1>the aquatic life aquatic lifestyle</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly accounts for hairless bodies,</v>

622
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:18.810
<v Speaker 1>which made us more streamlined for</v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming and diving are upright,</v>

623
00:28:18.811 --> 00:28:22.530
<v Speaker 1>two legged walking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which made waiting easier and our layers</v>

624
00:28:22.531 --> 00:28:25.740
<v Speaker 1>of subcutaneous fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which made us better insulated in water.</v>

625
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Think Whale blubber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theory even links and aquatic</v>

626
00:28:29.461 --> 00:28:33.510
<v Speaker 1>existence to the extinction of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution rather of human speech.</v>

627
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:38.870
<v Speaker 1>The hypothesis was met with much</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism Blahblahblahblah blom 2009.</v>

628
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Rang Ham of Harvard University</v>

629
00:28:43.411 --> 00:28:47.460
<v Speaker 1>and colleagues suggested in American</v>
<v Speaker 1>Journal of physical anthropology that</v>

630
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.200
<v Speaker 1>shallow aquatic habitats allowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>hominids to thrive in Savannah's</v>

631
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.270
<v Speaker 1>enabling our ancestors to move from</v>
<v Speaker 1>tropical forest to open grasslands.</v>

632
00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:01.500
<v Speaker 1>So from two point $5 million to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point 4 million years ago,</v>

633
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Africa became drier during certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>seasons already dry.</v>

634
00:29:05.981 --> 00:29:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Savannah's became even more arid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it difficult for hominids to find</v>

635
00:29:09.511 --> 00:29:13.230
<v Speaker 1>adequate food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But randoms team suggests that even in</v>

636
00:29:13.231 --> 00:29:17.040
<v Speaker 1>this inhospitable environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were oasises wetlands in lake</v>

637
00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:20.050
<v Speaker 1>shores and these aquatic habitats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water lilies,</v>

638
00:29:20.051 --> 00:29:20.571
<v Speaker 1>cattails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

639
00:29:20.571 --> 00:29:20.931
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

640
00:29:20.931 --> 00:29:21.741
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

641
00:29:21.741 --> 00:29:22.380
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

642
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.550
<v Speaker 1>So that's the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theory is that we like,</v>

643
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's a bunch of different</v>

644
00:29:26.851 --> 00:29:30.120
<v Speaker 1>kinds of primates and some of them are</v>
<v Speaker 1>still in trees today.</v>

645
00:29:30.121 --> 00:29:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Those fucking losers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We left them behind.</v>

646
00:29:32.311 --> 00:29:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Ha Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the ones that really dumb</v>

647
00:29:34.141 --> 00:29:36.110
<v Speaker 1>people point to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people came from monkeys wearing</v>

648
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.720
<v Speaker 1>monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Tom,</v>

649
00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:41.740
<v Speaker 1>they were the dumb monkeys fro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

650
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:47.550
<v Speaker 4>get it together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're the ones that made cars but that,</v>

651
00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:48.940
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

652
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.960
<v Speaker 4>some of these apes spent a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the water.</v>

653
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.570
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you ever see a baby chimp,</v>

654
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.780
<v Speaker 4>they're hard as rock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like they're jacked baby chimps.</v>

655
00:29:58.781 --> 00:30:02.860
<v Speaker 4>Like they come out like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sinewy no body fat.</v>

656
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.600
<v Speaker 4>And you throw them in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they drown.</v>

657
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.070
<v Speaker 4>They don't hold their breath,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just,</v>

658
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:07.840
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't know what to do.</v>

659
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.080
<v Speaker 4>They just gag on water and drown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that I know,</v>

660
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.550
<v Speaker 4>not that I'm throwing chips in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>water,</v>

661
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:16.660
<v Speaker 4>but that's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you throw a either a baby person</v>

662
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.130
<v Speaker 4>in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they hold their breath.</v>

663
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.650
<v Speaker 4>So this is the quadrant</v>

664
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:21.800
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what.</v>

665
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 2>That's what scientists are basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying about free diving in this is.</v>

666
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.050
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the first lap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

667
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.020
<v Speaker 2>When I first learned about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it completely blew my mind.</v>

668
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.750
<v Speaker 2>How long can you hold your breath now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five and a half.</v>

669
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like facing down on the water and</v>

670
00:30:36.631 --> 00:30:39.600
<v Speaker 2>not moving and doing a preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Swimming,</v>

671
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.400
<v Speaker 2>not swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just facebook.</v>

672
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.190
<v Speaker 4>If you have a dive into the water and</v>
<v Speaker 4>give you what,</v>

673
00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.510
<v Speaker 4>how much time do you give yourself?</v>

674
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.920
<v Speaker 2>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends.</v>

675
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.170
<v Speaker 2>The fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johann to depends on the conditions.</v>

676
00:30:50.171 --> 00:30:51.004
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the lot.</v>

677
00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.670
<v Speaker 4>So like if you're fighting the water</v>
<v Speaker 4>occurrence,</v>

678
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:54.930
<v Speaker 4>it's more difficult.</v>

679
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because basically what you want to do</v>

680
00:30:57.161 --> 00:31:00.130
<v Speaker 2>when you free dive is you want to be as</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm as possible.</v>

681
00:31:00.131 --> 00:31:04.180
<v Speaker 2>You want to be as relaxed as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why yoga and meditation are</v>

682
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:09.181
<v Speaker 2>often very close to free diving because</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your heartbeat is is is high,</v>

683
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.790
<v Speaker 2>then your body's going to need more</v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen.</v>

684
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:17.350
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and but then again,</v>

685
00:31:17.351 --> 00:31:19.060
<v Speaker 2>the second year emerge your face in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

686
00:31:19.061 --> 00:31:22.660
<v Speaker 2>You do like your first dive and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel the pressure you body understands</v>

687
00:31:22.661 --> 00:31:27.410
<v Speaker 2>that you're trying to to hold your</v>
<v Speaker 2>breath and you need to do that so the</v>

688
00:31:27.411 --> 00:31:29.920
<v Speaker 2>blood is going to start coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from your fingers.</v>

689
00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:31.180
<v Speaker 2>We extremities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your toes,</v>

690
00:31:31.181 --> 00:31:33.820
<v Speaker 2>and then you hand you feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all the,</v>

691
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.860
<v Speaker 2>all the vessels I was going to start to</v>
<v Speaker 2>construct so all the blood flow was</v>

692
00:31:38.861 --> 00:31:42.870
<v Speaker 2>going to go towards your vitals organs</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you actually,</v>

693
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.960
<v Speaker 2>you body is getting ready for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they want to make sure that the</v>

694
00:31:45.961 --> 00:31:50.380
<v Speaker 2>oxygen's goes exactly what needs to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sure that you need as as less</v>

695
00:31:50.381 --> 00:31:53.220
<v Speaker 2>effort to do anything is possible when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually underwater.</v>

696
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.440
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you first tried holding your</v>

697
00:31:56.441 --> 00:31:58.290
<v Speaker 4>breath,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long did you have for</v>

698
00:31:58.860 --> 00:31:59.850
<v Speaker 2>your first time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

699
00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my first time trying it,</v>

700
00:32:02.851 --> 00:32:03.870
<v Speaker 2>it was about a minute,</v>

701
00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:07.690
<v Speaker 4>so that was like the best he could do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No techniques just ready to</v>

702
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:08.960
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no technique like,</v>

703
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.840
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

704
00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:13.250
<v Speaker 2>you breed a little bit before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even with techniques.</v>

705
00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll techniques.</v>

706
00:32:14.421 --> 00:32:18.170
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's when you hold your brand,</v>

707
00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.920
<v Speaker 2>you have the ability of two in your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not excelling any.</v>

708
00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.820
<v Speaker 2>And then when you body realizes that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a buildup,</v>

709
00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:30.320
<v Speaker 2>it gives you an urge to breathe and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives you construct contractions like</v>

710
00:32:30.321 --> 00:32:33.200
<v Speaker 2>diaphragm contractions and this is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes somebody panicked.</v>

711
00:32:33.201 --> 00:32:34.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my buddy,</v>

712
00:32:34.281 --> 00:32:36.800
<v Speaker 2>you need to hear when you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to hear and then the more you</v>

713
00:32:36.801 --> 00:32:41.480
<v Speaker 2>train then you realized that you learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to control it and it's not because</v>

714
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:45.320
<v Speaker 2>you body tell you to breathe that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily out of oxygen.</v>

715
00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:47.430
<v Speaker 5>Hm.</v>

716
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:48.260
<v Speaker 4>So how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

717
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.030
<v Speaker 4>what techniques do you do to relax that</v>

718
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.770
<v Speaker 2>breeding?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do mostly,</v>

719
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.250
<v Speaker 2>especially when I'm in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do a very short inhale,</v>

720
00:32:57.251 --> 00:33:00.340
<v Speaker 2>so about five seconds and then I do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long inhale,</v>

721
00:33:00.341 --> 00:33:03.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe 10 to 15 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you,</v>

722
00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:06.610
<v Speaker 2>when you exhale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're focusing on like everything</v>

723
00:33:06.611 --> 00:33:09.850
<v Speaker 2>getting relaxed and then you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that again because you said inhale</v>

724
00:33:09.851 --> 00:33:10.331
<v Speaker 2>twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

725
00:33:10.331 --> 00:33:11.680
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean to know.</v>

726
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:16.480
<v Speaker 2>So you inhale for five seconds and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you exhale for 10 to 15 seconds.</v>

727
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:17.710
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

728
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:18.940
<v Speaker 4>So you exhale slowly.</v>

729
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.230
<v Speaker 2>You Excel super slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Use your tongue to control the air</v>

730
00:33:22.231 --> 00:33:24.960
<v Speaker 2>coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you do that you get as</v>

731
00:33:24.961 --> 00:33:27.660
<v Speaker 2>relaxed as possible and then the more</v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxed you are,</v>

732
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.930
<v Speaker 2>that along with your mom will diving</v>
<v Speaker 2>reflex,</v>

733
00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.650
<v Speaker 2>which is your heart beating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow down.</v>

734
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Naturally you blood shifting from</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremities to your vital organs.</v>

735
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:41.670
<v Speaker 2>And then you also have about a few years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

736
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.970
<v Speaker 2>maybe only 50 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they taught that when you reach 30</v>

737
00:33:44.971 --> 00:33:46.830
<v Speaker 2>meters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you body would be completely crushed</v>

738
00:33:46.831 --> 00:33:50.030
<v Speaker 2>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a scientist would think 30</v>

739
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:50.841
<v Speaker 2>meters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

740
00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:53.390
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it was like that the pressure would</v>

741
00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:56.210
<v Speaker 2>be so great there that you body will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely crushed.</v>

742
00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.990
<v Speaker 2>But then again would that would that</v>
<v Speaker 2>dive reflex.</v>

743
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:04.580
<v Speaker 2>What it does is that that overflow of</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood is going around you lvl leads in</v>

744
00:34:04.581 --> 00:34:07.490
<v Speaker 2>your lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which prevent ends from crushing you.</v>

745
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Buddies is actually a design machine to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go underwater,</v>

746
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.470
<v Speaker 2>which is completely crazy considering</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

747
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:19.130
<v Speaker 2>I've never knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially going up in downtown</v>

748
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

749
00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.050
<v Speaker 2>And then you put somebody in a water and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

750
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:25.250
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually may for that.</v>

751
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:26.550
<v Speaker 2>So when people tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

752
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.010
<v Speaker 2>I could never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too hard.</v>

753
00:34:28.011 --> 00:34:28.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

754
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.100
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually born like that.</v>

755
00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.010
<v Speaker 4>So was it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was it a revelation for you?</v>

756
00:34:33.011 --> 00:34:35.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you really feel like this is more of</v>

757
00:34:35.051 --> 00:34:38.560
<v Speaker 4>who I am than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>than the life that I was living before?</v>

758
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.850
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent is I had this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living in London too,</v>

759
00:34:42.851 --> 00:34:46.080
<v Speaker 2>so it was all about all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

760
00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:49.630
<v Speaker 2>earning money to buy as many things as</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible to try and impress as many</v>

761
00:34:49.631 --> 00:34:52.030
<v Speaker 2>people as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at some point it was like,</v>

762
00:34:52.031 --> 00:34:52.410
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

763
00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:54.190
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot do that.</v>

764
00:34:54.191 --> 00:34:59.191
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not spending my entire life</v>
<v Speaker 2>just seeking to buy things and press</v>

765
00:35:00.221 --> 00:35:04.180
<v Speaker 2>people that don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I started spearfishing and</v>

766
00:35:04.181 --> 00:35:07.930
<v Speaker 2>really gave me a different perspective</v>
<v Speaker 2>on life,</v>

767
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:13.150
<v Speaker 2>it gave me them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it humbled me in a way that was so,</v>

768
00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.970
<v Speaker 2>so intense that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it changed my,</v>

769
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.650
<v Speaker 2>it changed my way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely,</v>

770
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:21.650
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as I was.</v>

771
00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.790
<v Speaker 4>How did it humble you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in what way?</v>

772
00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Because I realized that</v>

773
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.630
<v Speaker 2>when we were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see,</v>

774
00:35:30.631 --> 00:35:31.200
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm,</v>

775
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.410
<v Speaker 2>when I film a documentary and I'm soften</v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

776
00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.140
<v Speaker 2>I film a documentary called Echo and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they grow in,</v>

777
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:41.360
<v Speaker 2>in Cape Verde Day two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back when Negro.</v>

778
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

779
00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:46.800
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black water events in Portuguese.</v>

780
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.540
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

781
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.760
<v Speaker 2>we were there for about five weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five or six weeks.</v>

782
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.800
<v Speaker 2>And then the living conditions were</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bad</v>

783
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.060
<v Speaker 2>and there was no grocery stores around</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we had to catch their own food.</v>

784
00:35:58.061 --> 00:36:00.630
<v Speaker 2>And then it was really a self sufficient</v>
<v Speaker 2>type of chip.</v>

785
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:05.250
<v Speaker 2>In the first week I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing I could focus on was,</v>

786
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.660
<v Speaker 2>oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

787
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:10.770
<v Speaker 2>this is terrible that we don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>shower.</v>

788
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:15.970
<v Speaker 2>No hot water or bathroom or disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starving is nothing around.</v>

789
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.730
<v Speaker 2>And then all you can think is like how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you comfort is gone and after a week</v>

790
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.280
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

791
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:29.630
<v Speaker 2>the focus change on the good things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing around us and why having</v>

792
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.400
<v Speaker 2>nothing all of a sudden then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

793
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:37.480
<v Speaker 2>I actually now for the first time in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life can take the time to realize what's</v>

794
00:36:37.951 --> 00:36:42.810
<v Speaker 2>good around me and then how we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>having fires with the neighbors and then</v>

795
00:36:42.811 --> 00:36:44.340
<v Speaker 2>how we were offering and fish.</v>

796
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:45.240
<v Speaker 2>And we were thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

797
00:36:45.241 --> 00:36:47.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I give this guy to fish is going to</v>

798
00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:50.190
<v Speaker 2>eat one today and one tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

799
00:36:50.191 --> 00:36:53.110
<v Speaker 2>the inviting neighbors to share when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make sure that it was like a whole,</v>

800
00:36:53.111 --> 00:36:56.040
<v Speaker 2>like community sends to all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

801
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:57.570
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been living in London for six</v>

802
00:36:57.571 --> 00:36:58.770
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know the name of the</v>

803
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.130
<v Speaker 2>neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

804
00:37:01.131 --> 00:37:01.551
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

805
00:37:01.551 --> 00:37:03.780
<v Speaker 2>it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not a way of living that I</v>

806
00:37:03.781 --> 00:37:05.640
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not focusing in a right things.</v>

807
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:08.440
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was that,</v>

808
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.480
<v Speaker 2>that's in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

809
00:37:09.481 --> 00:37:14.481
<v Speaker 2>it's realized how much of how much of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole we actually became.</v>

810
00:37:14.911 --> 00:37:16.050
<v Speaker 2>And I just didn't want to do that.</v>

811
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very recent way that people have</v>

812
00:37:18.351 --> 00:37:21.770
<v Speaker 4>been living this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this way of living in apartment</v>

813
00:37:21.771 --> 00:37:24.830
<v Speaker 4>buildings and the way of living in</v>
<v Speaker 4>houses where we don't know our neighbors</v>

814
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:29.000
<v Speaker 4>in terms of human history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very recent and I don't think we're</v>

815
00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:29.990
<v Speaker 4>designed for it.</v>

816
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

817
00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.690
<v Speaker 2>the human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that a human being to be</v>

818
00:37:36.691 --> 00:37:39.240
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to have the sense of community,</v>

819
00:37:39.241 --> 00:37:40.750
<v Speaker 2>which is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

820
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.400
<v Speaker 2>when you go into subway and you see like</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody seeing everybody's laughing and</v>

821
00:37:44.401 --> 00:37:46.680
<v Speaker 2>you see those videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube and it makes you all warm and</v>

822
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:50.220
<v Speaker 2>happy inside is because that's what we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were meant to be,</v>

823
00:37:50.221 --> 00:37:51.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's women to live with other</v>

824
00:37:51.961 --> 00:37:53.520
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We meant to socialize.</v>

825
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:56.330
<v Speaker 2>We meant to have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

826
00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.470
<v Speaker 2>this strong feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

827
00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.910
<v Speaker 2>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to say that in English.</v>

828
00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be part of something to be part of a</v>

829
00:38:03.601 --> 00:38:06.010
<v Speaker 2>group and people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

830
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:10.200
<v Speaker 2>I do think it's a necessity for human</v>
<v Speaker 2>being to be actually happy.</v>

831
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:12.770
<v Speaker 4>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's probably one of the</v>

832
00:38:12.771 --> 00:38:17.240
<v Speaker 4>reasons why so many people are so</v>
<v Speaker 4>grossly unhappy and so depressed and so</v>

833
00:38:17.241 --> 00:38:21.170
<v Speaker 4>disconnected and they feel alienated</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though they live in these giant</v>

834
00:38:21.171 --> 00:38:24.110
<v Speaker 4>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People feel extremely lonely even though</v>

835
00:38:24.111 --> 00:38:29.030
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people around me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of the weirder things about New</v>

836
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.863
<v Speaker 4>York City,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

837
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.520
<v Speaker 4>our friends live in New York City and</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things they say they love is</v>

838
00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:34.100
<v Speaker 4>how many people were there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

839
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.800
<v Speaker 4>there's all this energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this energy.</v>

840
00:38:35.801 --> 00:38:36.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

841
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:37.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not even talking to those people.</v>

842
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:41.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're alienated in this</v>

843
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:44.530
<v Speaker 1>little 1200 foot little cubicle that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in.</v>

844
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little,</v>

845
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I guess 1200 foot on that small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

846
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:52.210
<v Speaker 1>some of them like Ari's places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have to ask them,</v>

847
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it's tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like half.</v>

848
00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:58.590
<v Speaker 1>That's like 600 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was probably like $5 million promise.</v>

849
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Stupid expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

850
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:03.970
<v Speaker 1>But the idea is that you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody around you,</v>

851
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.420
<v Speaker 1>but you're stacked around all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and then you go out,</v>

852
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.180
<v Speaker 1>you're walking around these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not really talking to them</v>

853
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.330
<v Speaker 1>and you have a few people that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends with maybe that you work with</v>

854
00:39:13.331 --> 00:39:16.030
<v Speaker 1>and you interact with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you're constantly surrounded by</v>

855
00:39:16.031 --> 00:39:17.470
<v Speaker 1>all these other people that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even know.</v>

856
00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a very weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird way to live.</v>

857
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the way you were living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you were describing this with</v>

858
00:39:25.121 --> 00:39:27.820
<v Speaker 1>these people and they're all sharing</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish and they're,</v>

859
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

860
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's taken care of everybody and</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving some to their neighbors and</v>

861
00:39:32.441 --> 00:39:35.170
<v Speaker 1>sharing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how people have been living</v>

862
00:39:35.171 --> 00:39:38.980
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's certain human reward</v>

863
00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:43.150
<v Speaker 1>systems that are built into who we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a being,</v>

864
00:39:43.151 --> 00:39:48.070
<v Speaker 1>as a species that just aren't being met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I'm so fascinated by your</v>

865
00:39:48.071 --> 00:39:51.910
<v Speaker 1>choice to go from being a lawyer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>living this.</v>

866
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:55.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very a very interesting life of spear</v>

867
00:39:55.651 --> 00:39:56.484
<v Speaker 1>fishing.</v>

868
00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:57.840
<v Speaker 2>But it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

869
00:39:57.841 --> 00:40:01.490
<v Speaker 2>it's not always easy in the sense that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

870
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:04.040
<v Speaker 2>I still haven't found a place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I want to live,</v>

871
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:09.260
<v Speaker 2>because it's the society isn't designed</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this.</v>

872
00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:13.640
<v Speaker 2>My lifestyle is very hard to adapt with</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern society.</v>

873
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.180
<v Speaker 2>I struggle with a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

874
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because this has a</v>

875
00:40:20.181 --> 00:40:22.280
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have it in small villages.</v>

876
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.400
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of why I've been living</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

877
00:40:25.401 --> 00:40:27.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that anymore.</v>

878
00:40:27.081 --> 00:40:30.110
<v Speaker 2>But letting them to Bahamas for a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got to experience.</v>

879
00:40:30.111 --> 00:40:33.530
<v Speaker 2>That's when everybody knows each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody talked to each other to stay</v>

880
00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:35.390
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

881
00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.930
<v Speaker 2>because for now I guess what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>

882
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.200
<v Speaker 2>I woke up and my ex boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't live there anymore,</v>

883
00:40:42.201 --> 00:40:43.970
<v Speaker 2>so I was his house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

884
00:40:43.971 --> 00:40:45.170
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out.</v>

885
00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.210
<v Speaker 2>So that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

886
00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.910
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

887
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:51.680
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still need,</v>

888
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:52.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to survive,</v>

889
00:40:52.881 --> 00:40:53.720
<v Speaker 2>I suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

890
00:40:53.721 --> 00:40:58.600
<v Speaker 2>I catch a lot of my own food and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>freezer's literally full to.</v>

891
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:00.860
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

892
00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you still need money to live.</v>

893
00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do you make money?</v>

894
00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a few things.</v>

895
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:10.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm working right now on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a cookbook and a TV show with a</v>

896
00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Canadian company.</v>

897
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Do you make any money off your instagram</v>
<v Speaker 1>page?</v>

898
00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes some people do.</v>

899
00:41:16.391 --> 00:41:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

900
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.180
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you make money off your</v>

901
00:41:19.181 --> 00:41:19.630
<v Speaker 1>instagram?</v>

902
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Like sponsors and different things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

903
00:41:21.521 --> 00:41:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

904
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.430
<v Speaker 2>drink my detox tea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skinny tea.</v>

905
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:29.380
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

906
00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem also is like,</v>

907
00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.230
<v Speaker 2>was it two years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a super big contract with a crew</v>

908
00:41:38.231 --> 00:41:40.010
<v Speaker 2>sheet company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They needed a girl to like,</v>

909
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:44.270
<v Speaker 2>they need to free freediving goal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not that many of us.</v>

910
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.120
<v Speaker 2>So when they hired me at about a week</v>
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>

911
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:48.140
<v Speaker 2>she calls me back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

912

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry we can't hire you anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of a lawsuit because they had to show</v>

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

934
00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:39.780
<v Speaker 1>So wwf owned it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe so.</v>

935
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.380
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really thought that it was just</v>

936
00:42:43.381 --> 00:42:48.381
<v Speaker 1>because of regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>WWF was so,</v>

937
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.090
<v Speaker 2>so basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

938
00:42:50.091 --> 00:42:50.960
<v Speaker 2>They said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

939
00:42:50.961 --> 00:42:53.900
<v Speaker 2>because we really want to keep or eco</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendly.</v>

940
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile they're fucking boats filled</v>
<v Speaker 1>with rows,</v>

941
00:42:56.401 --> 00:42:58.640
<v Speaker 1>beef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken and all sorts of other shifts.</v>

942
00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day crossed they're allowed.</v>

943
00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I think it's about when you two miles</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the coast,</v>

944
00:43:03.461 --> 00:43:05.560
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to dump your garbage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean.</v>

945
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Everything as a cruise ship we allowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to open a trap and just throw everything</v>

946
00:43:10.961 --> 00:43:12.490
<v Speaker 2>in the freaking ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>

947
00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.350
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The law.</v>

948
00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.570
<v Speaker 2>It's the law and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we do that.</v>

949
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Of course they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

950
00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.340
<v Speaker 2>that's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the problem.</v>

951
00:43:21.341 --> 00:43:26.341
<v Speaker 2>How many the five people cruise ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many destroyed thing to use in</v>

952
00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.510
<v Speaker 2>glasses because they're too lazy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington.</v>

953
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.070
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the Bahamas,</v>

954
00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.650
<v Speaker 2>you know what you know how much dredging</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to make for,</v>

955
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.700
<v Speaker 2>for cruise ship a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boats actually pass and dock somewhere.</v>

956
00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.430
<v Speaker 2>He to rip up the entire bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>

957
00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.800
<v Speaker 2>So it's deep enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>

958
00:43:44.801 --> 00:43:48.340
<v Speaker 2>very detrimental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

959
00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.430
<v Speaker 2>organization for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

960
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.870
<v Speaker 2>for the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they tell me,</v>

961
00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.940
<v Speaker 2>start to become where would you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you catch you on food and</v>

962
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:58.600
<v Speaker 2>underwater it was bad for the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

963
00:43:58.601 --> 00:44:00.970
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cashed my own food.</v>

964
00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:05.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy this disgusting farm salmon</v>
<v Speaker 2>from whole food because it's gross.</v>

965
00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:07.450
<v Speaker 2>And Are you telling me that I'm bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

966
00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Most</v>

967
00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:11.970
<v Speaker 1>people don't know that farm salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they die the fish to make it look</v>

968
00:44:11.971 --> 00:44:14.970
<v Speaker 1>orange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you buy farm salmon and they're</v>

969
00:44:14.971 --> 00:44:18.600
<v Speaker 1>not dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be a white meat because they're</v>

970
00:44:18.601 --> 00:44:20.340
<v Speaker 1>not eating what they eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naturally.</v>

971
00:44:20.341 --> 00:44:23.070
<v Speaker 1>It's bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain bugs give them or shrimp.</v>

972
00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:23.963
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

973
00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.070
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pelicans,</v>

974
00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.490
<v Speaker 1>not pelicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of those little fucking weird reps.</v>

975
00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:31.020
<v Speaker 1>the ones that people have in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawns.</v>

976
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Salmon is not pale orange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dark.</v>

977
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Omega Flamingos</v>

978
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:37.880
<v Speaker 1>are pink because of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This shrimp they eat.</v>

979
00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

980
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:42.350
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it literally makes them pink salmon or</v>

981
00:44:42.351 --> 00:44:44.900
<v Speaker 1>dark when they're wild because of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>

982
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:47.570
<v Speaker 1>their natural diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which includes a lot of bugs I guess.</v>

983
00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They basically feed them and whatever</v>

984
00:44:51.321 --> 00:44:53.630
<v Speaker 2>they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like salmon is not supposed to be Pale</v>

985
00:44:53.631 --> 00:44:55.390
<v Speaker 2>orange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dark orange,</v>

986
00:44:55.391 --> 00:44:56.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

987
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've caught wild salmon before.</v>

988
00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.730
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is really good.</v>

989
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:06.890
<v Speaker 2>But sadly with all them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water dam that he made to make</v>

990
00:45:06.891 --> 00:45:09.710
<v Speaker 2>electricity and that almost of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>daddy killed all of them.</v>

991
00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Well the killed quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

992
00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:16.840
<v Speaker 1>there's an interesting place in Seattle</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can go and watch the salmon</v>

993
00:45:16.841 --> 00:45:19.690
<v Speaker 1>swim up river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a bridge and you go</v>

994
00:45:19.691 --> 00:45:23.830
<v Speaker 1>underneath the bridge and they have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>setup where there's a thick glass walls.</v>

995
00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.590
<v Speaker 1>We can actually look into the ocean and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wash the salmon,</v>

996
00:45:26.591 --> 00:45:28.930
<v Speaker 1>go up the salmon ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating,</v>

997
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:32.650
<v Speaker 1>so it's crazy to watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the guys who was there who</v>

998
00:45:32.651 --> 00:45:37.360
<v Speaker 1>was a guide who was explaining how when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were doing construction and doing</v>

999
00:45:37.361 --> 00:45:38.800
<v Speaker 1>various things and they're building</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seattle,</v>

1000
00:45:38.801 --> 00:45:43.570
<v Speaker 1>they had shut down one of the rivers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the salmon would just get to the mouth</v>

1001
00:45:43.571 --> 00:45:46.660
<v Speaker 1>of the river where they thought they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were supposed to go and fucking die and</v>

1002
00:45:46.661 --> 00:45:49.540
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like millions of them died while they</v>

1003
00:45:49.541 --> 00:45:52.660
<v Speaker 1>were trying to figure out a way to carve</v>
<v Speaker 1>this path again.</v>

1004
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very.</v>

1005
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:55.800
<v Speaker 2>We added dye to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Rut.</v>

1006
00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to.</v>

1007
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and diving in the when the Salmon River</v>

1008
00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:03.940
<v Speaker 2>and and BC and I was underwater with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>gut.</v>

1009
00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:07.290
<v Speaker 2>I could see that had like big stains of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Rut on their body.</v>

1010
00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:11.490
<v Speaker 2>So they live like a full live in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean and they came to breed one last</v>

1011
00:46:11.491 --> 00:46:13.850
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I guess is a good last tours when</v>

1012
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.920
<v Speaker 2>you think about it and then it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought to debt.</v>

1013
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

1014
00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you catch them too far along the</v>

1015
00:46:21.561 --> 00:46:23.600
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their body's already deteriorated.</v>

1016
00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1017
00:46:25.191 --> 00:46:30.191
<v Speaker 1>I know guys who have caught them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can save in survival situations</v>

1018
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:32.780
<v Speaker 1>like people eat them because you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1019
00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:36.080
<v Speaker 1>But if you caught them like towards the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of their cycle,</v>

1020
00:46:36.081 --> 00:46:39.160
<v Speaker 1>their bodies like mush again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally shoved your fingers.</v>

1021
00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:39.250
<v Speaker 1>You're through</v>

1022
00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:40.083
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's.</v>

1024
00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.280
<v Speaker 2>But you see that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what people eat.</v>

1025
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:45.330
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1026
00:46:45.331 --> 00:46:49.050
<v Speaker 2>the Wall Street Journal than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram page when they promoting a</v>

1027
00:46:49.051 --> 00:46:54.051
<v Speaker 2>recipe for shrimp are probably coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Thailand or sound that is farm and</v>

1028
00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:57.570
<v Speaker 2>very bad for the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they think that,</v>

1029
00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.391
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1030
00:46:58.391 --> 00:47:03.000
<v Speaker 2>there's something ridiculously taboo</v>
<v Speaker 2>about catching food.</v>

1031
00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:07.620
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people imagine,</v>

1032
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how I know have been hunting has a bad</v>

1033
00:47:09.541 --> 00:47:13.230
<v Speaker 2>reputation for four because of the blog</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and things like that.</v>

1034
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.600
<v Speaker 2>But I went fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we deal on top of it,</v>

1035
00:47:15.601 --> 00:47:19.140
<v Speaker 2>what a bunch of lobbyists that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>finding us for deficient of same time</v>

1036
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:25.940
<v Speaker 2>because they want to sell those because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to fish and all we are for</v>

1037
00:47:26.191 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 2>them as something in the way and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't buy their fish at all because</v>

1038
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:34.060
<v Speaker 3>there's so few of you they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can,</v>

1039
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.420
<v Speaker 3>they can see anything that they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>about us and we don't have the power to,</v>

1040
00:47:39.421 --> 00:47:40.850
<v Speaker 3>to say something back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1041
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:43.060
<v Speaker 3>If they shut down sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear,</v>

1061
00:48:36.651 --> 00:48:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Fisher ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We count that much in the.</v>

1062
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:44.180
<v Speaker 3>How many spear fishermen are there in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States?</v>

1063
00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.070
<v Speaker 3>Going back to that state or the city?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's growing really fast.</v>

1064
00:48:49.071 --> 00:48:51.320
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is going fast.</v>

1065
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:55.220
<v Speaker 3>There is like a trend now for people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>catch me on food and people are starting</v>

1066
00:48:55.221 --> 00:48:57.890
<v Speaker 3>slowly because there's so many of big</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1067
00:48:57.891 --> 00:49:02.891
<v Speaker 3>specialist celebrities</v>
<v Speaker 3>that spearfishing voicing themselves</v>

1068
00:49:04.221 --> 00:49:07.070
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to food of saying and now</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are starting to realize that</v>

1069
00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.100
<v Speaker 3>hunting or spearfishing is actually not</v>
<v Speaker 3>as bad.</v>

1070
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:13.610
<v Speaker 3>It's way better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just very difficult.</v>

1071
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sports illustrated,</v>

1072
00:49:16.641 --> 00:49:19.340
<v Speaker 3>there's estimated between $1,000,002</v>
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>

1073
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:21.080
<v Speaker 3>So in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1074
00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:23.270
<v Speaker 3>I highly doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of people.</v>

1075
00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:28.790
<v Speaker 3>That's like almost close to one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1076
00:49:28.791 --> 00:49:30.650
<v Speaker 3>There's 3 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's 2 million,</v>

1077
00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:33.470
<v Speaker 3>300 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rather if there's 2 million spear Fisher</v>

1078
00:49:33.471 --> 00:49:35.610
<v Speaker 3>people close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1079
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:37.880
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make sense.</v>

1080
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:39.040
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

1081
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:42.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it was one half of a percent,</v>

1082
00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.510
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you telling me if you get a room of</v>

1083
00:49:44.511 --> 00:49:46.220
<v Speaker 3>200 people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them's going to be a spear</v>

1084
00:49:46.221 --> 00:49:47.330
<v Speaker 3>fishermen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a great sport is the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1097
00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.950
<v Speaker 3>It's the best way to eat fish and</v>
<v Speaker 3>seafood.</v>

1098
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:26.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can only imagine.</v>

1099
00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.553
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

1100
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I love fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fun.</v>

1101
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:33.200
<v Speaker 2>It can be a little stressful sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that,</v>

1102
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you floating,</v>

1103
00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:41.930
<v Speaker 2>you're floating in a salt water tank and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you looking around and you try to</v>

1104
00:50:41.931 --> 00:50:45.830
<v Speaker 2>meditate as much as you can and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're waiting you in hunting mode.</v>

1105
00:50:45.831 --> 00:50:50.300
<v Speaker 2>You focusing on your pray to try to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and then you have like five grizzly</v>

1106
00:50:50.301 --> 00:50:52.190
<v Speaker 2>bears that are circling and you try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat your ass.</v>

1107
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to eat a fish that you.</v>

1108
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever do get approached by sharks</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Bahamas?</v>

1109
00:50:58.550 --> 00:50:59.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bahamas.</v>

1110
00:50:59.811 --> 00:51:01.850
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty much always there.</v>

1111
00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:07.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy who just got bit in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got bit by a bull shark and now he</v>

1112
00:51:07.571 --> 00:51:10.210
<v Speaker 1>has flesh eating bacteria that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroying his leg.</v>

1113
00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Apparently this flesh eating bacteria in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water,</v>

1114
00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.690
<v Speaker 1>we don't need to google that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad.</v>

1115
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Pretty disgusting.</v>

1116
00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:20.510
<v Speaker 2>I can pretty bad encounters with sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

1117
00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:25.220
<v Speaker 2>My worst one was in Tampa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually something super easy.</v>

1118
00:51:25.221 --> 00:51:29.960
<v Speaker 2>It was in 15 feet of water and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the dangerous spearphishing is</v>

1119
00:51:29.961 --> 00:51:32.600
<v Speaker 2>when you start getting cocky and you say</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1120
00:51:32.601 --> 00:51:33.680
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is shallow?</v>

1121
00:51:33.681 --> 00:51:35.090
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to watch each other.</v>

1122
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's doing their own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really bad.</v>

1123
00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Definitely never do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my lesson breakdown and I was.</v>

1124
00:51:42.411 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 2>I showed a little fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I clip it to the back of my gun and</v>

1125
00:51:45.951 --> 00:51:49.160
<v Speaker 2>then this tiger shark come in and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1126
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:50.023
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiger shark.</v>

1127
00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.130
<v Speaker 2>They a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can be.</v>

1128
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:54.850
<v Speaker 2>They're aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not the nicest one you want to.</v>

1129
00:51:54.851 --> 00:51:57.400
<v Speaker 2>You want to show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he was a junior juvenile when</v>

1130
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.010
<v Speaker 2>it was still a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like seven feet long,</v>

1131
00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.560
<v Speaker 2>seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about seven feet long,</v>

1132
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:08.800
<v Speaker 2>but he was young and the young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that you don't trust the big old</v>

1133
00:52:09.331 --> 00:52:11.350
<v Speaker 2>shirt or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wiser.</v>

1134
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.370
<v Speaker 2>They know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they check you out and things like that,</v>

1135
00:52:13.371 --> 00:52:17.270
<v Speaker 2>but the young ones had want a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy so they're going to go more</v>

1136
00:52:17.271 --> 00:52:20.390
<v Speaker 2>towards you and they're going to go try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do like curious bites,</v>

1137
00:52:20.391 --> 00:52:22.850
<v Speaker 2>which is mostly what happens most of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1138
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Which tribe bites as a curious spike and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the discharge is in front of me and</v>

1139
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:33.200
<v Speaker 2>he's charging me what his mouth open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my gun,</v>

1140
00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm poking it.</v>

1141
00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:37.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm poking like the eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm poking the gales and booking the</v>

1142
00:52:37.931 --> 00:52:39.670
<v Speaker 2>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to poke everything is going</v>

1143
00:52:39.671 --> 00:52:42.440
<v Speaker 2>to hurt him as much as I can and in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong,</v>

1144
00:52:42.441 --> 00:52:46.010
<v Speaker 2>especially in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm really trying to like bang his</v>

1145
00:52:46.011 --> 00:52:51.011
<v Speaker 2>fricking gun as much as hard as I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his face and he doesn't back down.</v>

1146
00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:55.670
<v Speaker 2>He keeps like circling and he keeps</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in for me and at some point I'm</v>

1147
00:52:55.671 --> 00:52:56.241

<v Speaker 2>me and the shark poking it with the tip.</v>

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.200
<v Speaker 2>he's heard you screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

1163
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:27.420
<v Speaker 2>do you have a fish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1164
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a tiger shy behind you buddy.</v>

1165
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.560
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh crap.</v>

1166
00:53:31.561 --> 00:53:33.370
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if my from Felix shoe,</v>

1167
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:37.590
<v Speaker 2>I was like a 17 year old at the time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've never.</v>

1168
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.770
<v Speaker 2>Rarely Spear Fisher was the first time</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing a shark.</v>

1169
00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I promised his parents I would bring him</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in one piece and I'm like,</v>

1170
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:45.121
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1171
00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:46.860
<v Speaker 2>don't panic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is fine.</v>

1172
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:50.280
<v Speaker 2>How deeply water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 15 feet of water was so shallow.</v>

1173
00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.980
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put your back against mine and then</v>

1174
00:53:52.981 --> 00:53:57.120
<v Speaker 2>cover your half and if you come to cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoke it and to shy came in a couple of</v>

1175
00:53:57.121 --> 00:53:57.930
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1176
00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:59.160
<v Speaker 2>because we were too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1177
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1178
00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:01.910
<v Speaker 2>He just left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't like that,</v>

1179
00:54:01.911 --> 00:54:04.920
<v Speaker 2>that he was out numbered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like wow.</v>

1180
00:54:04.921 --> 00:54:08.680
<v Speaker 2>So when I was alone with the Chicago was</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming in the water and that was like</v>

1181
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:11.100
<v Speaker 2>calling my friends for help and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody could hear me.</v>

1182
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.900
<v Speaker 2>And then we went back to the boat.</v>

1183
00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Freeman of the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far away can people hear you?</v>

1184
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to,</v>

1185
00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:19.140
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to buy 10 feet,</v>

1186
00:54:19.141 --> 00:54:21.660
<v Speaker 2>15 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it depends on the wave again in the</v>

1187
00:54:21.661 --> 00:54:24.290
<v Speaker 2>winds and everything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody could definitely hear me then</v>

1188
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.160
<v Speaker 2>wanting to get back on the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend,</v>

1189
00:54:26.161 --> 00:54:29.430
<v Speaker 2>I see my friend swimming towards the</v>
<v Speaker 2>boat and he screams tiger shark.</v>

1190
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:30.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no shit,</v>

1191
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.850
<v Speaker 2>dumb ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like screaming for your health,</v>

1192
00:54:32.851 --> 00:54:35.880
<v Speaker 2>but it has happened an hour and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to the boat.</v>

1193
00:54:35.881 --> 00:54:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Then we left and the sharper like</v>
<v Speaker 2>cycling it was like,</v>

1194
00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was really scary.</v>

1195
00:54:40.141 --> 00:54:45.141
<v Speaker 2>But in that situation again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had shut the sharp too to save</v>

1196
00:54:45.931 --> 00:54:47.150
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1197
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:51.780
<v Speaker 2>I would have got the worst publicity</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

1198
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:53.940
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1199
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I just one thing I don't understand.</v>

1200
00:54:56.690 --> 00:55:00.080
<v Speaker 1>When did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were sharks became something that are</v>

1201
00:55:00.081 --> 00:55:04.970
<v Speaker 1>protected in the public eye?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because was it the governor of New York</v>

1202
00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:10.060
<v Speaker 1>that killed that shark when he was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing somewhat with the governor.</v>

1203
00:55:10.971 --> 00:55:13.160
<v Speaker 1>The mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those guys was a.</v>

1204
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:18.430
<v Speaker 1>was sport fishing caught a shark and was</v>
<v Speaker 1>it the governor Cuomo,</v>

1205
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:21.530
<v Speaker 1>very common in the states show fishing</v>
<v Speaker 1>boat.</v>

1206
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:24.230
<v Speaker 1>They're edible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had Mako shark and restaurants</v>

1207
00:55:24.231 --> 00:55:26.540
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something happened,</v>

1208
00:55:26.541 --> 00:55:30.050
<v Speaker 1>something changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was when there was all this</v>

1209
00:55:30.051 --> 00:55:32.900
<v Speaker 1>awareness about shark fin soup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1210
00:55:32.901 --> 00:55:34.820
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Cuomo.</v>

1211
00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.950
<v Speaker 1>He caught 154 pound thresher shark and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody freaked the fuck.</v>

1212
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:39.491
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one,</v>

1213
00:55:39.491 --> 00:55:41.650
<v Speaker 2>it's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They realized that the Asians were</v>

1214
00:55:41.651 --> 00:55:45.850
<v Speaker 2>catching millions a day to make sure you</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a shark fin soup.</v>

1215
00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it became,</v>

1216
00:55:47.201 --> 00:55:50.470
<v Speaker 1>instead of it being something that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just another fish,</v>

1217
00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:55.000
<v Speaker 1>then it became something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>protected and people with a very shallow</v>

1218
00:55:55.001 --> 00:55:59.080
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what a shark is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're freaking out about it.</v>

1219
00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1220
00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:02.060
<v Speaker 1>It's the Asians ruined it for everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

1221
00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:08.320
<v Speaker 1>How dare you be careful today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with crazy rich Asians,</v>

1222
00:56:08.321 --> 00:56:10.400
<v Speaker 1>number one in the box office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1223
00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that practice of chopping off the fence</v>

1224
00:56:13.841 --> 00:56:15.400
<v Speaker 1>and throwing the sharks back is</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific,</v>

1225
00:56:15.401 --> 00:56:18.730
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sustainable populations of some</v>

1226
00:56:18.731 --> 00:56:21.910
<v Speaker 1>sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean apparently off of the coast of</v>

1227
00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:23.523
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

1228
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.770
<v Speaker 4>near Catalina island that the channel</v>
<v Speaker 4>islands,</v>

1229
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:28.600
<v Speaker 4>lot of sharks out there</v>

1230
00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:31.880
<v Speaker 2>and then great white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she did populations of sharks rain</v>

1231
00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:34.840
<v Speaker 2>out and California's very height of</v>
<v Speaker 2>great whites.</v>

1232
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the seal population became</v>

1233
00:56:37.691 --> 00:56:39.730
<v Speaker 2>really high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then because you know that the great</v>

1234
00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:42.250
<v Speaker 2>white shark population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes more time to grow.</v>

1235
00:56:42.251 --> 00:56:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Now we're at a stage where days a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tons of lionfish,</v>

1236
00:56:46.151 --> 00:56:50.410
<v Speaker 2>and now there's a lot of great white do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But great whites are protected,</v>

1237
00:56:50.411 --> 00:56:51.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1238
00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:52.631
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

1239
00:56:52.631 --> 00:56:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Tiger sharks protected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's protected in a lot of places in</v>

1240
00:56:57.011 --> 00:56:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're allowed to eat.</v>

1241
00:56:59.901 --> 00:57:02.140
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depends where some marinas are very</v>

1242
00:57:02.141 --> 00:57:04.030
<v Speaker 2>funny about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And New York,</v>

1243
00:57:04.031 --> 00:57:05.540
<v Speaker 2>I went fishing in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1244
00:57:05.541 --> 00:57:10.330
<v Speaker 2>about a couple of months ago and a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like cutting and Maaco and a dog and</v>

1245
00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:13.120
<v Speaker 2>nobody was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed to be offended by it.</v>

1246
00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:13.820
<v Speaker 2>What people</v>

1247
00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:16.850
<v Speaker 4>that are on the water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are Fisher people,</v>

1248
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:18.230
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't be offended.</v>

1249
00:57:18.231 --> 00:57:20.960
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the casual person on the outside</v>

1250
00:57:20.961 --> 00:57:21.890
<v Speaker 4>that gets offended.</v>

1251
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:23.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1252
00:57:23.071 --> 00:57:23.840
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1253
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.481
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's this,</v>

1254
00:57:24.481 --> 00:57:26.880
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the double edged sward of,</v>

1255
00:57:26.881 --> 00:57:27.740
<v Speaker 2>of the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1256
00:57:27.741 --> 00:57:29.700
<v Speaker 2>it gave a voice to everybody the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1257
00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.410
<v Speaker 2>But it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1258
00:57:31.411 --> 00:57:33.630
<v Speaker 2>they remember that gorilla thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was his name?</v>

1259
00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:35.611
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>

1260
00:57:35.611 --> 00:57:37.350
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is terrible.</v>

1261
00:57:37.351 --> 00:57:40.200
<v Speaker 2>They should have never shut the gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should have shut the mother</v>

1262
00:57:40.201 --> 00:57:40.860
<v Speaker 2>instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1263
00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:44.460
<v Speaker 2>what we're saying when a surfer gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitten by a shy,</v>

1264
00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.120
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1265
00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:47.940
<v Speaker 2>it's his followers in this territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you shouldn't have like done</v>

1266
00:57:47.941 --> 00:57:50.910
<v Speaker 2>anything today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can like put your mother and that</v>

1267
00:57:50.911 --> 00:57:52.920
<v Speaker 2>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that gorilla then tell me which</v>

1268
00:57:52.921 --> 00:57:54.580
<v Speaker 2>one you're going to shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My money's not.</v>

1269
00:57:55.410 --> 00:57:57.620
<v Speaker 2>My money's on our mother's Barbara going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in the gorilla.</v>

1270
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:59.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish there was another way.</v>

1271
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:01.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that they needed to shoot</v>

1272
00:58:01.831 --> 00:58:03.600
<v Speaker 4>that girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know enough about gorilla</v>

1273
00:58:03.601 --> 00:58:05.640
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to think that the gorilla</v>

1274
00:58:05.641 --> 00:58:08.040
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't have done anything to the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know anything.</v>

1275
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know much about the situation.</v>

1276
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:12.040
<v Speaker 2>It's sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I have to choose</v>

1277
00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:15.380
<v Speaker 4>baby over gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking the baby every time I'm going</v>

1278
00:58:15.381 --> 00:58:17.840
<v Speaker 4>to save the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some fucking human.</v>

1279
00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:19.181
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1280
00:58:19.181 --> 00:58:22.720
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to be irrational when it comes</v>

1281
00:58:22.721 --> 00:58:23.554
<v Speaker 2>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is</v>

1282
00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:26.120
<v Speaker 4>not you and you don't have any stake in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the game.</v>

1283
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:29.720
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about it from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sidelines and that's people talking</v>

1284
00:58:29.721 --> 00:58:33.680
<v Speaker 4>about sharks as people talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>bears as people talking about a lot of</v>

1285
00:58:33.681 --> 00:58:34.514
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>

1286
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much.</v>

1287
00:58:35.551 --> 00:58:40.551
<v Speaker 2>And this is why spear fishing hunting or</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this very well,</v>

1288
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Hayden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess around the world,</v>

1289
00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:47.000
<v Speaker 4>have friends that run a bear hunting</v>
<v Speaker 4>operation in um,</v>

1290
00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:51.280
<v Speaker 4>Alberta shout out to John and Jen saw</v>
<v Speaker 4>them this weekend in Calgary.</v>

1291
00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:54.380
<v Speaker 4>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they run a bear hunting operation and</v>

1292
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.700
<v Speaker 4>would they run a hunting operation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they spend a good amount of time</v>

1293
00:58:57.730 --> 00:59:00.820
<v Speaker 4>bear hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Black bears and the black bear</v>

1294
00:59:00.821 --> 00:59:04.360
<v Speaker 4>population up there is incredibly dense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many of them.</v>

1295
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:07.690
<v Speaker 4>They're everywhere and they decimate the</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer population.</v>

1296
00:59:07.691 --> 00:59:09.460
<v Speaker 4>They decimate the Moose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the elk,</v>

1297
00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:12.430
<v Speaker 4>they eat all the babies and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>cannibalize each other.</v>

1298
00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:13.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1299
00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:16.180
<v Speaker 4>it's a beautiful animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're fascinating.</v>

1300
00:59:16.181 --> 00:59:18.040
<v Speaker 4>They're interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad they're around,</v>

1301
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:20.390
<v Speaker 4>but they're populations need to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>controlled.</v>

1302
00:59:20.391 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of them and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>delicious.</v>

1303
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:24.130
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things are like,</v>

1304
00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.630
<v Speaker 1>they fly in the face of reason for most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1305
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:29.960
<v Speaker 1>They think if you're shooting a bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're a trophy hunter,</v>

1306
00:59:29.961 --> 00:59:32.390
<v Speaker 1>like someone who's shooting a rhino or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1307
00:59:32.391 --> 00:59:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Someone who's a terrible person wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot something that's endangered.</v>

1308
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:38.690
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are as far from endangered as is</v>

1309
00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:41.180
<v Speaker 1>humanly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not in danger by any stretch of</v>

1310
00:59:41.181 --> 00:59:44.300
<v Speaker 1>the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live in dense forests and there's a</v>

1311
00:59:44.301 --> 00:59:47.600
<v Speaker 1>giant number of them and you can shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>two of them up there.</v>

1312
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:48.461
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1313
00:59:48.461 --> 00:59:51.350
<v Speaker 1>they encourage you to shoot two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to thin out the</v>

1314
00:59:51.351 --> 00:59:53.560
<v Speaker 1>population because of the effect they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have on the Angela.</v>

1315
00:59:53.561 --> 00:59:56.720
<v Speaker 1>It's up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those animals that my</v>

1316
00:59:56.721 --> 01:00:00.020
<v Speaker 1>friend Steve Rinella calls them</v>
<v Speaker 1>charismatic megafauna.</v>

1317
01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.130
<v Speaker 1>It's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1318
01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:03.830
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just we've made them into movie</v>

1319
01:00:03.831 --> 01:00:08.831
<v Speaker 1>characters and TV show characters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have this idea of what they are</v>

1320
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:14.480
<v Speaker 1>based on just this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of image that gets portrayed</v>

1321
01:00:14.481 --> 01:00:17.990
<v Speaker 1>in the public and we accept this</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative and I think that's happening</v>

1322
01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:19.790
<v Speaker 1>right now with sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1323
01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:22.370
<v Speaker 1>No one wants sharks to go extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think sharks are awesome.</v>

1324
01:00:22.371 --> 01:00:26.090
<v Speaker 1>They're cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are also edible like and if</v>

1325
01:00:26.091 --> 01:00:31.091
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people catch Maaco sharks a</v>

1326
01:00:31.131 --> 01:00:36.110
<v Speaker 1>off of the coast of California and and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut them up and make shark stakes up and</v>

1327
01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:39.860
<v Speaker 1>eat them and it used to be normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one cared until.</v>

1328
01:00:39.861 --> 01:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel like within the last decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happened in the last decade</v>

1329
01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:48.320
<v Speaker 1>that people became incredibly outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone kills a shark.</v>

1330
01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that people became</v>

1331
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:54.100
<v Speaker 2>outraged when you kill anything,</v>

1332
01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:57.640
<v Speaker 1>but they're so hypocritical because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're killing things left and right</v>

1333
01:00:57.641 --> 01:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>with their pocket book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't know it.</v>

1334
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.970
<v Speaker 1>They're killing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their credit card,</v>

1335
01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:04.150
<v Speaker 1>they're killing things with cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you buy fish at the store,</v>

1336
01:01:04.151 --> 01:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>you're killing fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you like to think you're</v>

1337
01:01:06.701 --> 01:01:08.020
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>

1338
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.500
<v Speaker 1>You're supporting the fish industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supporting the killing of these</v>

1339
01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.840
<v Speaker 1>animals that are eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a direct connection.</v>

1340
01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:16.580
<v Speaker 1>You're paying a supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitman go out and do the workforce</v>

1341
01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:17.530
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

1342
01:01:17.531 --> 01:01:19.690
<v Speaker 2>If you eat fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot be against phishing.</v>

1343
01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:22.120
<v Speaker 2>If you eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot be against hunting.</v>

1344
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>It's also the weirdness of it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to whole foods today on before I</v>

1345
01:01:26.901 --> 01:01:30.080
<v Speaker 1>came here to get some lunch and as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking through,</v>

1346
01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:32.480
<v Speaker 1>just because I was thinking that I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have this conversation with you</v>

1347
01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:37.481
<v Speaker 1>today and I'm walking by these long</v>
<v Speaker 1>aisles of ice with these fish on it and</v>

1348
01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I could just point to one of those fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

1349
01:01:41.721 --> 01:01:42.554
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me that thing.</v>

1350
01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.920
<v Speaker 1>No connection whatsoever to where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing came from,</v>

1351
01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.920
<v Speaker 1>how it got there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just take it and I could bring it</v>

1352
01:01:48.921 --> 01:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably should have just for effect,</v>

1353
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:52.760
<v Speaker 1>just slap it down on the table.</v>

1354
01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Imagine the amount of grocery stores as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a country,</v>

1355
01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:59.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A fish display,</v>

1356
01:01:59.211 --> 01:02:00.590
<v Speaker 2>which is completely full.</v>

1357
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just imagine in this area there's</v>

1358
01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:07.580
<v Speaker 1>a whole foods that's about two miles up</v>
<v Speaker 1>this way and then if we go down the</v>

1359
01:02:07.861 --> 01:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another one that a sprouts,</v>

1360
01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>they have a fish section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we go a little bit further down.</v>

1361
01:02:13.111 --> 01:02:15.900
<v Speaker 1>There's a Gelson's they have a big fix</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish section.</v>

1362
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>There's just fish all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ocean's pretty fucking</v>

1363
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:21.600
<v Speaker 4>far from here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1364
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:24.000
<v Speaker 4>do you have to drive to get to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ocean,</v>

1365
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:25.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're not going to the ocean and</v>

1366
01:02:25.771 --> 01:02:29.370
<v Speaker 4>pulling these fish out themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all coming from a giant commercial</v>

1367
01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:32.850
<v Speaker 4>boat to distributes it all throughout</v>
<v Speaker 4>southern California,</v>

1368
01:02:32.851 --> 01:02:34.980
<v Speaker 4>all throughout northern California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All throughout.</v>

1369
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:36.810
<v Speaker 4>Then you get into the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

1370
01:02:36.811 --> 01:02:39.750
<v Speaker 4>That's where it gets really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're buying halibut and you're in</v>

1371
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:42.300
<v Speaker 4>South Dakota,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the fuck is that coming from?</v>

1372
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alaska probably.</v>

1373
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:45.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to eat hell,</v>

1374
01:02:45.951 --> 01:02:48.140
<v Speaker 4>but if you live there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I completely.</v>

1375
01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:52.260
<v Speaker 4>He should be close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She'd be close though.</v>

1376
01:02:52.261 --> 01:02:53.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just kidding.</v>

1377
01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:57.030
<v Speaker 4>Eat you got to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

1378
01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.070
<v Speaker 4>we're weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are weird.</v>

1379
01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.110
<v Speaker 2>And our connection with food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>olive dos boats,</v>

1380
01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:02.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have um,</v>

1381
01:03:02.901 --> 01:03:06.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean the states is actually doing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way better job than a lot of countries,</v>

1382
01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.010
<v Speaker 2>I must admit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under control of fisheries.</v>

1383
01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:14.590
<v Speaker 2>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I see laws and regulations on small</v>

1384
01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:19.540
<v Speaker 2>little individual anglers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your spear fisherman and then I see a</v>

1385
01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.490
<v Speaker 2>chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can catch everything you want.</v>

1386
01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Dash just is just boils my blood to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>next level.</v>

1387
01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:28.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's insane and in our lifetime the</v>

1388
01:03:28.961 --> 01:03:33.580
<v Speaker 4>population has decreased radically and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no better example than that than</v>

1389
01:03:33.581 --> 01:03:35.080
<v Speaker 4>the Tokyo fish markets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1390
01:03:35.081 --> 01:03:39.280
<v Speaker 4>the Tokyo fish market interview,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those guys and they talk about what it</v>

1391
01:03:39.281 --> 01:03:43.640
<v Speaker 4>used to be like when they just the</v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of tuna that they deal with and</v>

1392
01:03:43.641 --> 01:03:47.940
<v Speaker 4>the amount they deal with now it says</v>
<v Speaker 4>significant dip and this is within you</v>

1393
01:03:47.941 --> 01:03:48.880
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>40 years.</v>

1394
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:51.310
<v Speaker 4>Like what is it going to be like 40</v>
<v Speaker 4>years from now?</v>

1395
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:55.630
<v Speaker 4>And the estimates are that it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be a radical decrease in the population</v>

1396
01:03:55.631 --> 01:03:56.650
<v Speaker 4>of almost selfish.</v>

1397
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1398
01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.090
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1399
01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:01.640
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People want to have access to</v>

1400
01:04:01.641 --> 01:04:03.440
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1401
01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:07.420
<v Speaker 2>If we were put regulations on</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's fish,</v>

1402
01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:11.210
<v Speaker 2>like okay look everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you want you salomon but it's</v>

1403
01:04:11.211 --> 01:04:15.520
<v Speaker 2>going to be close of January to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you want your halibut but you</v>

1404
01:04:15.521 --> 01:04:17.870
<v Speaker 2>can't eat it this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next year.</v>

1405
01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.720
<v Speaker 2>If we would be willing to live with</v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

1406
01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think people would survive it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1407
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't think people will get</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to pretty much anything.</v>

1408
01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:30.110
<v Speaker 2>But then industry awards is worth so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much money that they were not willing to</v>

1409
01:04:30.111 --> 01:04:30.630
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

1410
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:32.700
<v Speaker 4>It's not just the industry is worth so</v>
<v Speaker 4>much money.</v>

1411
01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:35.880
<v Speaker 4>Is it a certain people in certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>countries in particular where that is</v>

1412
01:04:35.881 --> 01:04:39.030
<v Speaker 4>all they have?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's certain people out there</v>

1413
01:04:39.031 --> 01:04:42.030
<v Speaker 4>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're dependent upon the ocean and</v>

1414
01:04:42.031 --> 01:04:46.020
<v Speaker 4>it's bounty for their survival and if</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't sell fish and they can't buy</v>

1415
01:04:46.021 --> 01:04:48.000
<v Speaker 4>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we talked about individual Fisher</v>

1416
01:04:48.001 --> 01:04:52.050
<v Speaker 4>people that have boats and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are doing it on their own small scale</v>

1417
01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.810
<v Speaker 4>commercial fishermen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not a lot of room for error</v>

1418
01:04:54.811 --> 01:04:56.550
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not making a ton of money.</v>

1419
01:04:56.810 --> 01:05:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Those are under problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't like the small family.</v>

1420
01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:02.690
<v Speaker 2>A commercial fishing boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not the problem.</v>

1421
01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:07.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see those guys bring it and you</v>

1422
01:05:07.161 --> 01:05:08.870
<v Speaker 2>know like the guy in the video earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1423
01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:11.390
<v Speaker 2>he just catching a big net is caching</v>
<v Speaker 2>like quite a bit of fish.</v>

1424
01:05:11.391 --> 01:05:16.391
<v Speaker 2>But your reality of things or ships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign ships rating the entire ocean</v>

1425
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:22.550
<v Speaker 2>would net sir like kilometers long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like an affiliate,</v>

1426
01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:25.210
<v Speaker 2>a net.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a mile long.</v>

1427
01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:28.900
<v Speaker 2>And you just catch everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't annette,</v>

1428
01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:31.870
<v Speaker 2>and then you like turtles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turtles,</v>

1429
01:05:31.871 --> 01:05:32.920
<v Speaker 2>dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharks,</v>

1430
01:05:32.921 --> 01:05:34.340
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1431
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:35.980
<v Speaker 2>And then it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1432
01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:39.720
<v Speaker 2>They're picking Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally net lives in North Carolina.</v>

1433
01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Are you catching lobster and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then in two that are making a</v>

1434
01:05:43.661 --> 01:05:44.494
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

1435
01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:48.280
<v Speaker 4>but you'd have to have some regulations</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were accepted by all these</v>

1436
01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:51.190
<v Speaker 4>different countries too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that'll be a real difficult thing to</v>

1437
01:05:51.191 --> 01:05:55.060
<v Speaker 4>pull off to get these countries to</v>
<v Speaker 4>accept that they're going to lose money</v>

1438
01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.180
<v Speaker 4>and to do it in a timely fashion where</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

1439
01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:00.010
<v Speaker 4>these fish could actually bounce back.</v>

1440
01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to happen until there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing left that's crazy.</v>

1441
01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:06.160
<v Speaker 2>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody sees it.</v>

1442
01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

1443
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:11.820
<v Speaker 4>when you look at the sheer size of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ocean,</v>

1444
01:06:11.821 --> 01:06:16.380
<v Speaker 4>the idea that we could fish the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 4>out is so crazy.</v>

1445
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.660
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you see those commercial boats</v>

1446
01:06:19.661 --> 01:06:23.170
<v Speaker 2>and how the quantity of fish they</v>
<v Speaker 2>managed to take out of the ocean,</v>

1447
01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:26.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any</v>

1448
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.590
<v Speaker 4>talk about doing something about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there,</v>

1449
01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:33.280
<v Speaker 4>is there anything on the table?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there any discussion about regulating</v>

1450
01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:36.010
<v Speaker 4>the amount of fish these gigantic boats</v>
<v Speaker 4>can pull out?</v>

1451
01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Well again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the US is trying to to,</v>

1452
01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:41.040
<v Speaker 2>to regulate that and they actually made</v>
<v Speaker 2>efforts that,</v>

1453
01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:46.170
<v Speaker 2>that proved to increase the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish or it's good they actually working</v>

1454
01:06:46.951 --> 01:06:51.690
<v Speaker 2>in the right direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is that still to this</v>

1455
01:06:51.691 --> 01:06:53.850
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure exactly how much,</v>

1456
01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many nautical mile you have to be,</v>

1457
01:06:55.621 --> 01:07:00.621
<v Speaker 2>but a Russian or a Chinese foreigner</v>
<v Speaker 2>traveler is allowed to fish from the</v>

1458
01:07:02.581 --> 01:07:06.840
<v Speaker 2>coast of United States and international</v>
<v Speaker 2>water to just rate everything.</v>

1459
01:07:06.841 --> 01:07:08.970
<v Speaker 2>That is nothing he can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to regulate that?</v>

1460
01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.150
<v Speaker 2>The UN China is going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1461
01:07:12.151 --> 01:07:12.920
<v Speaker 2>sure buddy.</v>

1462
01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1463
01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:15.660
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan still killing whales,</v>

1464
01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they kill whales under the guise of,</v>

1465
01:07:18.661 --> 01:07:20.340
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of science.</v>

1466
01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen how they do that at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sea shepherd bus?</v>

1467
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Those guys pretending that it was for</v>
<v Speaker 4>science and then they kill them,</v>

1468
01:07:25.651 --> 01:07:26.550
<v Speaker 4>sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1469
01:07:26.551 --> 01:07:28.530
<v Speaker 4>it's really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1470
01:07:28.531 --> 01:07:32.130
<v Speaker 4>there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same exact problems going on in the</v>

1471
01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:35.400
<v Speaker 4>United States in the 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A market hunting is what they were</v>

1472
01:07:35.401 --> 01:07:36.670
<v Speaker 4>calling it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they,</v>

1473
01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:39.720
<v Speaker 4>they devastated all the wildlife in</v>
<v Speaker 4>North America.</v>

1474
01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:45.050
<v Speaker 4>The buffalo population was almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>brought to extinction levels really</v>

1475
01:07:45.151 --> 01:07:46.560
<v Speaker 4>close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1476
01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.800
<v Speaker 4>there's still some wild herds that exist</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Mexico and there were,</v>

1477
01:07:49.801 --> 01:07:51.600
<v Speaker 4>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they exist in United States and now they</v>

1478
01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:53.700
<v Speaker 4>brought them back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But to this day,</v>

1479
01:07:53.701 --> 01:07:58.701
<v Speaker 4>the majority of buffalo that live in</v>
<v Speaker 4>North America are all on private land.</v>

1480
01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:02.070
<v Speaker 4>The majority of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at one point in time,</v>

1481
01:08:02.071 --> 01:08:04.650
<v Speaker 4>there's millions and millions of them</v>
<v Speaker 4>all throughout the country.</v>

1482
01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:10.350
<v Speaker 4>Elk there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've only been repopulated to a small</v>

1483
01:08:10.351 --> 01:08:14.250
<v Speaker 4>percentage of their original range.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's something like 30 percent.</v>

1484
01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:18.380
<v Speaker 4>There's some animals that have thrived</v>
<v Speaker 4>like white tailed deer because,</v>

1485
01:08:18.381 --> 01:08:21.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they live primarily in farmlands and</v>

1486
01:08:21.981 --> 01:08:25.940
<v Speaker 4>farmlands have gotten so huge that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were essentially like farm animals.</v>

1487
01:08:25.941 --> 01:08:27.650
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very strange,</v>

1488
01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:31.880
<v Speaker 4>like when you think of white tail deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the places where they're the most</v>

1489
01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:34.700
<v Speaker 4>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1490
01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:36.890
<v Speaker 4>that's actually reindeer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a Caribou.</v>

1491
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:41.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Caribou are these migrating deer that</v>

1492
01:08:41.181 --> 01:08:46.181
<v Speaker 4>live in Canada primarily and in Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they migrate for hundreds and</v>

1493
01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:48.410
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of miles in these massive</v>
<v Speaker 4>herds.</v>

1494
01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.450
<v Speaker 4>They're very different and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1495
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:54.170
<v Speaker 4>unlike dear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll see them like hundreds of them</v>

1496
01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.610
<v Speaker 4>moving together in one group in one line</v>
<v Speaker 4>across the Tundra,</v>

1497
01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:02.150
<v Speaker 4>but these animals that were in North</v>
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>

1498
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.190
<v Speaker 4>not Alaska but north,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1499
01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:05.600
<v Speaker 4>not the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lower 48.</v>

1500
01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:08.690
<v Speaker 4>They were wiped out almost to nothing.</v>

1501
01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:10.610
<v Speaker 4>Antelope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer,</v>

1502
01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.830
<v Speaker 4>elk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buffalo.</v>

1503
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:16.220
<v Speaker 4>They were almost all wiped out by market</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting because this was back when we</v>

1504
01:09:16.221 --> 01:09:20.330
<v Speaker 4>didn't have refrigerators so people</v>
<v Speaker 4>would shoot these things and bring them</v>

1505
01:09:20.331 --> 01:09:22.790
<v Speaker 4>to market and people would go to market</v>
<v Speaker 4>and buy that meat and they would bring</v>

1506
01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:24.710
<v Speaker 4>it in on trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1507
01:09:24.711 --> 01:09:28.790
<v Speaker 4>I guess they just have blocks of ice and</v>
<v Speaker 4>these trains and trucks and they would</v>

1508
01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:32.180
<v Speaker 4>bring in this meat and they killed</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost everything and it's short amount</v>

1509
01:09:32.181 --> 01:09:33.740
<v Speaker 4>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like less than 100 years.</v>

1510
01:09:33.741 --> 01:09:37.310
<v Speaker 4>There was almost nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they instituted these laws</v>

1511
01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.710
<v Speaker 4>where it was illegal to sell wild game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you buy elk,</v>

1512
01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.820
<v Speaker 4>like say in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you buy elk meat,</v>

1513
01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.580
<v Speaker 4>you're buying it from New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting it from.</v>

1514
01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:48.580
<v Speaker 4>It's actually enforced right now still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1515
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:49.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's.</v>

1516
01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:54.350
<v Speaker 4>There are some commercial farms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what they sell.</v>

1517
01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:57.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you can sell commercially raised</v>

1518
01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.710
<v Speaker 4>deer and elk in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you go to a restaurant,</v>

1519
01:10:00.711 --> 01:10:03.320
<v Speaker 4>most of what you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're actually getting from New</v>

1520
01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.570
<v Speaker 4>Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1521
01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:07.490
<v Speaker 4>but you can't go to the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like say if you went to the woods and</v>

1522
01:10:07.491 --> 01:10:10.550
<v Speaker 4>you went and shot an elk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that one up there and you tried to sell.</v>

1523
01:10:10.551 --> 01:10:12.560
<v Speaker 4>It's illegal to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't sell that.</v>

1524
01:10:12.561 --> 01:10:16.550
<v Speaker 4>Meat is not a a marketable product.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something that has to.</v>

1525
01:10:16.551 --> 01:10:19.700
<v Speaker 4>You have to have a tag for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to pay for the tag and then it</v>

1526
01:10:19.701 --> 01:10:22.220
<v Speaker 4>has to be for your own personal</v>
<v Speaker 4>consumption or you can give it away to</v>

1527
01:10:22.221 --> 01:10:23.600
<v Speaker 4>your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't sell it.</v>

1528
01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:28.550
<v Speaker 4>Which is much of a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the only way they had to eliminate</v>

1529
01:10:28.551 --> 01:10:31.070
<v Speaker 4>market hunting was the only way to bring</v>
<v Speaker 4>these populations back.</v>

1530
01:10:31.071 --> 01:10:34.610
<v Speaker 4>And then they had a enforce these very</v>
<v Speaker 4>strict conservation efforts.</v>

1531
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:38.540
<v Speaker 4>And then here's the big one is I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called the Pickman Robertson App,</v>

1532
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:43.430
<v Speaker 4>whatever the Pickman Robertson's editors</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the name of that it.</v>

1533
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:49.450
<v Speaker 4>What it is is it takes 10 percent of all</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the proceeds from hunting supplies</v>

1534
01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.720
<v Speaker 4>and gear and puts it to wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 4>conservation,</v>

1535
01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:56.810
<v Speaker 4>which is an enormous amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>billions and billions of dollars.</v>

1536
01:10:57.110 --> 01:11:01.820
<v Speaker 4>So it goes to preserve habitat and</v>
<v Speaker 4>wetlands goes to reintroduce species</v>

1537
01:11:01.821 --> 01:11:04.550
<v Speaker 4>into places where they had been</v>
<v Speaker 4>decimated.</v>

1538
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:09.740
<v Speaker 4>Like elk are now a inviolable numbers in</v>
<v Speaker 4>places where they were completely</v>

1539
01:11:09.741 --> 01:11:14.370
<v Speaker 4>extinct like in Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Tennessee has them now as well.</v>

1540
01:11:14.371 --> 01:11:17.520
<v Speaker 4>And Kentucky I know has Hassam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pennsylvania has them.</v>

1541
01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:19.500
<v Speaker 4>And at one point in time there was none</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1542
01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:22.770
<v Speaker 4>like up until just a few decades ago,</v>

1543
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:24.290
<v Speaker 2>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1544
01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:29.290
<v Speaker 2>if things or actually handle and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible and smart way we can.</v>

1545
01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.610
<v Speaker 2>There is a way to save everything.</v>

1546
01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.141
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is,</v>

1547
01:11:33.141 --> 01:11:35.830
<v Speaker 4>is the United States like the United</v>
<v Speaker 4>States is like,</v>

1548
01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:37.690
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's on land,</v>

1549
01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:39.650
<v Speaker 4>it's controllable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1550
01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:40.730
<v Speaker 4>it's our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1551
01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:45.520
<v Speaker 4>it's within these boundaries of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one country,</v>

1552
01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the control is accepted when you're</v>

1553
01:11:49.001 --> 01:11:53.530
<v Speaker 4>talking about the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 4>will be really difficult to get other</v>

1554
01:11:53.531 --> 01:11:57.850
<v Speaker 4>countries to agree to that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>strict management that brought back</v>

1555
01:11:57.851 --> 01:12:00.550
<v Speaker 4>wildlife in North America to do that to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ocean.</v>

1556
01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:04.390
<v Speaker 4>But if they did do that to the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean maybe everything could bounce back.</v>

1557
01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few states.</v>

1558
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Florida is definitely one of them where</v>
<v Speaker 2>do looking very closely to what's going</v>

1559
01:12:12.001 --> 01:12:15.000
<v Speaker 2>on and then they have closed seasons and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that and actually makes it</v>

1560
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:18.690
<v Speaker 2>really nice and big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again I think the problem is not</v>

1561
01:12:18.691 --> 01:12:21.530
<v Speaker 2>coming from that department is coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>from again,</v>

1562
01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:25.170
<v Speaker 2>like deep trawling and commercial</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign commercial fishing net.</v>

1563
01:12:25.171 --> 01:12:27.690
<v Speaker 2>It's just a big industry things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is</v>

1564
01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:30.230
<v Speaker 4>Florida for sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fishing is a giant industry.</v>

1565
01:12:30.231 --> 01:12:34.700
<v Speaker 4>People go there every year to grouper</v>
<v Speaker 4>fish and fish for tarpon and you know</v>

1566
01:12:34.701 --> 01:12:37.610
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of fishing in Florida and</v>

1567
01:12:37.611 --> 01:12:41.120
<v Speaker 4>it's probably a pretty significant part</v>
<v Speaker 4>of their economy.</v>

1568
01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1569
01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:44.190
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I read somewhere that actually</v>

1570
01:12:44.191 --> 01:12:47.290
<v Speaker 2>the number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of jobs in a recorder of</v>

1571
01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:51.600
<v Speaker 2>recreational fishing was higher than in</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercial fishing in estates.</v>

1572
01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe I read that somewhere,</v>

1573
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:55.800
<v Speaker 2>the number of jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1574
01:12:55.801 --> 01:12:58.030
<v Speaker 2>so the number of sacred most jobs.</v>

1575
01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:02.760
<v Speaker 4>So like selling fishing rods and lawyers</v>
<v Speaker 4>and guiding</v>

1576
01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:05.090
<v Speaker 2>born butters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

1577
01:13:05.091 --> 01:13:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of makes sense.</v>

1578
01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.450
<v Speaker 2>So the commercial also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the biggest problem with</v>

1579
01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:15.500
<v Speaker 2>commercial fishing is I went to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually went to Taiwan last last year</v>

1580
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:19.740
<v Speaker 2>and it was helping them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finding government and giving them a</v>

1581
01:13:19.741 --> 01:13:23.690
<v Speaker 2>proposal and how they can change the law</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make the fisheries better and ever</v>

1582
01:13:23.691 --> 01:13:26.820
<v Speaker 2>explained it to me now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they have those ships and they hire</v>

1583
01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:31.410
<v Speaker 2>people from the Philippines or from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indonesia and then they put them on a</v>

1584
01:13:31.411 --> 01:13:33.770
<v Speaker 2>ship for six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take your passport and they're</v>

1585
01:13:33.771 --> 01:13:37.200
<v Speaker 2>getting paid like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally nothing.</v>

1586
01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:39.100
<v Speaker 2>And all they do all day long is they</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch tuna,</v>

1587
01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:39.631
<v Speaker 2>it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1588
01:13:39.631 --> 01:13:41.760
<v Speaker 2>the kitchen and the kitchen for like 14</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours a day.</v>

1589
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:45.070
<v Speaker 2>And then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that'll bring a tuna backs and they</v>

1590
01:13:45.071 --> 01:13:46.170
<v Speaker 2>sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1591
01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:47.100
<v Speaker 2>the problem is</v>

1592
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:51.740
<v Speaker 4>people are fucking up so many different</v>
<v Speaker 4>parts of the world so fast.</v>

1593
01:13:51.741 --> 01:13:55.880
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to like go well we got to</v>
<v Speaker 4>really put it all aside and concentrate</v>

1594
01:13:55.881 --> 01:13:56.714
<v Speaker 4>on the fish.</v>

1595
01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:57.633
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1596
01:13:58.330 --> 01:14:00.310
<v Speaker 2>That's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of money and a lot of</v>

1597
01:14:00.311 --> 01:14:03.570
<v Speaker 2>people depending on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then at some point we're going to</v>

1598
01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:04.540
<v Speaker 2>have to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1599
01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:06.880
<v Speaker 2>there's no fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1600
01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:11.260
<v Speaker 2>we're more people so we're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to turn herself on,</v>

1601
01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.680
<v Speaker 2>on them and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people are going to change their</v>

1602
01:14:14.681 --> 01:14:16.810
<v Speaker 2>ways or do anything unless he being</v>
<v Speaker 2>told.</v>

1603
01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no more fish.</v>

1604
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:21.700
<v Speaker 2>How long have you been doing this now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Full time.</v>

1605
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:23.590
<v Speaker 2>About three years.</v>

1606
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:26.620
<v Speaker 1>And have you noticed a difference in</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years?</v>

1607
01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depends where.</v>

1608
01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.820
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some places definitely.</v>

1609
01:14:30.821 --> 01:14:33.490
<v Speaker 2>There's some when I'm traveling</v>
<v Speaker 2>different places what I've been.</v>

1610
01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.700
<v Speaker 2>And the third time that I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a third time before time I was coming</v>

1611
01:14:36.701 --> 01:14:38.380
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see there was even less and less</v>

1612
01:14:38.381 --> 01:14:40.720
<v Speaker 2>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't mean to Terrainian is a</v>

1613
01:14:40.721 --> 01:14:42.550
<v Speaker 2>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mediterranean,</v>

1614
01:14:42.551 --> 01:14:45.820
<v Speaker 2>there's literally nothing left in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What will happen,</v>

1615
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:48.370
<v Speaker 2>and it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another example where this has</v>

1616
01:14:48.371 --> 01:14:52.570
<v Speaker 2>been overfished for so many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't allow spearfishing there,</v>

1617
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:56.590
<v Speaker 2>but a commercial fishing boats is</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to catch as many tuners they</v>

1618
01:14:56.591 --> 01:14:58.900
<v Speaker 2>want for tuna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's pivoting easily.</v>

1619
01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Bourdain did something in Italy</v>

1620
01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.120
<v Speaker 1>and they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were so little fish that they were</v>

1621
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:09.360
<v Speaker 1>actually throwing frozen fish into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

1622
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:14.190
<v Speaker 1>like frozen octopus into the water and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted him to pretend to catch</v>

1623
01:15:14.191 --> 01:15:15.660
<v Speaker 1>these frozen activists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

1624
01:15:15.661 --> 01:15:20.661
<v Speaker 1>he made a mockery of it and showed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy throwing the frozen fish into the</v>

1625
01:15:21.151 --> 01:15:23.010
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frozen octopus into the water.</v>

1626
01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:25.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not surprised if you catch a fish in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greece.</v>

1627
01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.040
<v Speaker 2>You can sell it for like 100 year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's no fish,</v>

1628
01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:30.960
<v Speaker 2>no fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely no fish,</v>

1629
01:15:30.961 --> 01:15:34.740
<v Speaker 2>but people won't change their ways until</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tell them so he can have you kenny</v>

1630
01:15:34.741 --> 01:15:35.730
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'd be like,</v>

1631
01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.890
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I have to make an effort now.</v>

1632
01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would be the solution?</v>

1633
01:15:41.401 --> 01:15:42.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can they,</v>

1634
01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:46.500
<v Speaker 1>is there a way to commercially raised</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish that's viable?</v>

1635
01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like they do with the cattle</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

1636
01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1637
01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually going to the Marshall</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islands in October and I'm going to</v>

1638
01:15:54.311 --> 01:15:55.280
<v Speaker 2>visit this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1639
01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.960
<v Speaker 2>the Marshall Islands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Marshall Islands are those middle of</v>

1640
01:15:58.961 --> 01:16:03.280
<v Speaker 2>the Pacific in the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my thing.</v>

1641
01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:08.940
<v Speaker 2>And I know it's near straight or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1642
01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Know it's near Papa New Guinea and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>type of area.</v>

1643
01:16:14.381 --> 01:16:16.920
<v Speaker 2>Careful the people over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's fine.</v>

1644
01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:20.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't have much meat and like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>appetizer,</v>

1645
01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:27.030
<v Speaker 2>but they have some going to visit a farm</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is sustainable and everything.</v>

1646
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:29.210
<v Speaker 1>It was any new Guinea people listening</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

1647
01:16:29.211 --> 01:16:32.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm joking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get so outraged.</v>

1648
01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Who's motherfuckers calling us all</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannibals.</v>

1649
01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that where it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show me where it is again,</v>

1650
01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:39.553
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where your,</v>

1651
01:16:39.890 --> 01:16:41.630
<v Speaker 1>where your Arrow is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1652
01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.850
<v Speaker 1>That is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't go there.</v>

1653
01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.970
<v Speaker 2>So they told me that I'm going to visit</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1654
01:16:46.971 --> 01:16:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to see is you just have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>really careful because again,</v>

1655
01:16:50.031 --> 01:16:53.810
<v Speaker 2>if they leaks into the ocean and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>contaminates are fish and if some of</v>

1656
01:16:53.811 --> 01:16:57.050
<v Speaker 2>them escaped creates problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of problems.</v>

1657
01:16:57.051 --> 01:16:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Does it create.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have a captive one.</v>

1658
01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:04.490
<v Speaker 2>So basically it's going infect the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish diseases or diseases is</v>

1659
01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:07.160
<v Speaker 1>the get when they're in captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking it all sorts of stuff.</v>

1660
01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>So it's a lot like captive animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avian flu</v>

1661
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:10.770
<v Speaker 4>and swine.</v>

1662
01:17:10.770 --> 01:17:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much.</v>

1663
01:17:11.611 --> 01:17:13.240
<v Speaker 3>But in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking great.</v>

1664
01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Some really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was some,</v>

1665
01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:19.280
<v Speaker 3>some stories about some really bad fish</v>
<v Speaker 3>farms that are speeding damn with pig</v>

1666
01:17:19.281 --> 01:17:22.050
<v Speaker 3>stuff and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1667
01:17:22.051 --> 01:17:23.820
<v Speaker 3>it's all about being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being responsible.</v>

1668
01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:29.160
<v Speaker 4>We did a podcast recently about cwd c,</v>
<v Speaker 4>d chronic wasting disease is a disease</v>

1669
01:17:29.591 --> 01:17:34.591
<v Speaker 4>that's spreading amongst a deer in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>country and they think a lot of it is</v>

1670
01:17:34.661 --> 01:17:37.540
<v Speaker 4>coming or some of it is coming from</v>
<v Speaker 4>deere farms.</v>

1671
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:41.320
<v Speaker 4>They have these deer farms and all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals are eating off the same food and</v>

1672
01:17:41.321 --> 01:17:45.880
<v Speaker 4>they escape and then they spread it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there's an incubation period and</v>

1673
01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:49.150
<v Speaker 4>mean it exists in the wild and it exists</v>
<v Speaker 4>in deer farms.</v>

1674
01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.040
<v Speaker 4>So it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very complicated.</v>

1675
01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:52.990
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have a similar</v>

1676
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:54.260
<v Speaker 3>issue with fish then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1677
01:17:54.261 --> 01:17:55.440
<v Speaker 3>they do actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's.</v>

1678
01:17:55.441 --> 01:17:56.660
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

1679
01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:02.080
<v Speaker 3>What kind of diseases do they get?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't know what type of deal they</v>

1680
01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:03.050
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>

1681
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:05.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really familiar with fish</v>
<v Speaker 3>diseases to be honest,</v>

1682
01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:10.610
<v Speaker 3>but what that term is definitely like</v>
<v Speaker 3>some fish have cancer.</v>

1683
01:18:10.690 --> 01:18:12.430
<v Speaker 3>That's it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does the term</v>

1684
01:18:12.490 --> 01:18:16.400
<v Speaker 4>zoonotic?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the term when it leaves and</v>

1685
01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:19.270
<v Speaker 4>makes the jump to humans?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The diseases.</v>

1686
01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:20.890
<v Speaker 4>Are there any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1687
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:23.740
<v Speaker 4>that's what like avian flu is and swine</v>
<v Speaker 4>flu.</v>

1688
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:24.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1689
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1690
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.710
<v Speaker 4>Disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes it jump to humans.</v>

1691
01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:29.410
<v Speaker 4>Is there any diseases in fish that make</v>
<v Speaker 4>the jump to humans</v>

1692
01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:32.930
<v Speaker 3>apart from parasites?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing you can take of that</v>

1693
01:18:32.931 --> 01:18:36.590
<v Speaker 3>human can actually get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And parasites are pretty rare with ocean</v>

1694
01:18:36.591 --> 01:18:37.190
<v Speaker 3>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1695
01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:39.640
<v Speaker 3>It's more common with freshwater fish</v>
<v Speaker 3>farms.</v>

1696
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:42.630
<v Speaker 3>We can see warm sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you just discard them and then</v>

1697
01:18:42.631 --> 01:18:43.790
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to kill you.</v>

1698
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:45.170
<v Speaker 3>They're just going to take a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>funky,</v>

1699
01:18:45.171 --> 01:18:49.310
<v Speaker 3>but who you've eaten worms that came out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of fish for sure.</v>

1700
01:18:49.311 --> 01:18:52.010
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of probably I just probably don't</v>

1701
01:18:52.011 --> 01:18:55.070
<v Speaker 3>know it when I cut the fish raw cut a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty small,</v>

1702
01:18:55.071 --> 01:18:57.800
<v Speaker 3>so I make sure that it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know you look to see the worms.</v>

1703
01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see them.</v>

1704
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:04.160
<v Speaker 4>Can you get in your body to where it</v>
<v Speaker 4>starts growing for a little slice?</v>

1705
01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:06.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to try,</v>

1706
01:19:07.050 --> 01:19:08.400
<v Speaker 3>do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1707
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:10.500
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you cook the fish?</v>

1708
01:19:10.501 --> 01:19:13.140
<v Speaker 3>They all dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why if you freeze it,</v>

1709
01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.350
<v Speaker 3>that's what a lot of people freeze</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1710
01:19:14.351 --> 01:19:16.150
<v Speaker 3>So she made before eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1711
01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:16.530
<v Speaker 3>To</v>

1712
01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:19.920
<v Speaker 4>do that with pigs and a lot of animals</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this country too,</v>

1713
01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:22.350
<v Speaker 4>but there's two types of tricky gnosis</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently.</v>

1714
01:19:22.351 --> 01:19:24.750
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's two very specific kinds of</v>

1715
01:19:24.751 --> 01:19:28.260
<v Speaker 4>tricky gnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One that if you freeze it'll die.</v>

1716
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:30.900
<v Speaker 4>And this is a trick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tricky gnosis that comes from an animal</v>

1717
01:19:30.901 --> 01:19:32.640
<v Speaker 4>that's from the southwest of the United</v>
<v Speaker 4>States,</v>

1718
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.120
<v Speaker 4>but then there's trick gnosis that comes</v>
<v Speaker 4>from animals that's in the northern</v>

1719
01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:39.390
<v Speaker 4>territories in Canada in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like bears,</v>

1720
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:42.210
<v Speaker 4>Alaska and that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could freeze it,</v>

1721
01:19:42.211 --> 01:19:44.220
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't even kill it when you freeze</v>

1722
01:19:44.221 --> 01:19:46.620
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to cook it.</v>

1723
01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:50.790
<v Speaker 4>It has to be cooked to 100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's 160 degrees,</v>

1724
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:54.000
<v Speaker 4>some 147,</v>
<v Speaker 4>162 recommended temperature.</v>

1725
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:58.770
<v Speaker 4>You have to kill those little fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1726
01:19:59.190 --> 01:20:01.680
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise you just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just gets into your muscle tissue.</v>

1727
01:20:01.681 --> 01:20:03.810
<v Speaker 4>I have some friends that caught.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's horrific.</v>

1728
01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:04.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's bad.</v>

1729
01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:06.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You like your whole body's like in</v>

1730
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:08.280
<v Speaker 4>because it's literally.</v>

1731
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.110
<v Speaker 3>They're borrowing their way into your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

1732
01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you have something bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad and fish.</v>

1733
01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:14.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's why I'm skinny.</v>

1734
01:20:14.761 --> 01:20:17.080
<v Speaker 3>Who knows</v>
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

1735
01:20:18.810 --> 01:20:20.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you just eating fish all the time.</v>

1736
01:20:20.551 --> 01:20:23.760
<v Speaker 3>It's probably pretty lean stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also free diving.</v>

1737
01:20:23.761 --> 01:20:27.670
<v Speaker 3>You burn when you go spearfishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You burn about between a thousand and I</v>

1738
01:20:27.671 --> 01:20:30.900
<v Speaker 3>think 1300 calories an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1739
01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:32.340
<v Speaker 3>So?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't lose weight goals.</v>

1740
01:20:32.341 --> 01:20:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Pivoting really 1300 calories an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

1741
01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.280
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very intense.</v>

1742
01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:40.350
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

1743
01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.900
<v Speaker 3>That's what you would think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people listening to this like,</v>

1744
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could eat so much food.</v>

1745
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:48.030
<v Speaker 3>I'll just go free diving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you also don't eat food,</v>

1746
01:20:48.031 --> 01:20:50.400
<v Speaker 3>which is the Marshall Islands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1747
01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:54.420
<v Speaker 3>Jesus starts to blow that thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've shown that a million times.</v>

1748
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:57.930
<v Speaker 3>That's the crazy nuclear bomb testing</v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

1749
01:20:58.950 --> 01:21:02.730
<v Speaker 3>That is the nuttiest shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see that as miles high water</v>

1750
01:21:02.731 --> 01:21:05.280
<v Speaker 3>spraying up into the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe the fish you're going to have</v>

1751
01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:07.290
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

1752
01:21:07.291 --> 01:21:10.590
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have fish that can read</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind to get.</v>

1753
01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:11.433
<v Speaker 3>I know you're coming.</v>

1754
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:16.350
<v Speaker 3>What do you spear phishing for in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marshall Islands?</v>

1755
01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.730
<v Speaker 3>We're just going to be visiting a farm</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

1756
01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:23.350
<v Speaker 3>so it's Kinda good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of people asking me for or</v>

1757
01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:26.560
<v Speaker 3>for alternatives and what it can do and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you eat?</v>

1758
01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:31.260
<v Speaker 3>And so this is one of the possible</v>
<v Speaker 3>alternatives that they have these farms.</v>

1759
01:21:31.290 --> 01:21:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to check it out and make</v>

1760
01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:36.810
<v Speaker 3>sure that it's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then is it possible that they could</v>

1761
01:21:36.811 --> 01:21:41.250
<v Speaker 3>reintroduce fish into the ocean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like stock the ocean because that's what</v>

1762
01:21:41.251 --> 01:21:42.540
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some lakes,</v>

1763
01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.690
<v Speaker 3>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to go fishing at this lake in</v>

1764
01:21:45.691 --> 01:21:49.170
<v Speaker 3>Boston and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the restock it every year with rainbow</v>

1765
01:21:49.171 --> 01:21:51.050
<v Speaker 3>trout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1766
01:21:51.051 --> 01:21:54.690
<v Speaker 3>That's actually by my leg when my</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents have a good crunchy.</v>

1767
01:21:54.691 --> 01:21:56.430
<v Speaker 3>How's it do that to you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it works.</v>

1768
01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:02.180
<v Speaker 3>The only problem that we see with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>for like an ocean fish would be I'm</v>

1769
01:22:02.281 --> 01:22:06.030
<v Speaker 3>thinking because they never had</v>
<v Speaker 3>predators captivity,</v>

1770
01:22:06.031 --> 01:22:09.120
<v Speaker 3>that that may be in my habits revival</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem after that,</v>

1771
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:11.880
<v Speaker 3>but maybe they can learn it.</v>

1772
01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:14.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1773
01:22:14.101 --> 01:22:16.680
<v Speaker 3>The strong smart survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1774
01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:21.040
<v Speaker 3>You still better that if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's 10 thousands of survivors</v>

1775
01:22:21.090 --> 01:22:22.380
<v Speaker 3>still good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better than.</v>

1776
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1777
01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:29.070
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what would have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it's even possible to,</v>

1778
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:31.380
<v Speaker 3>to restock something as big as the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean.</v>

1779
01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:34.440
<v Speaker 3>It's just being fished so quickly and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1780
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:36.120
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the biggest problem.</v>

1781
01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:41.790
<v Speaker 3>But there are solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just people have to be willing to</v>

1782
01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:46.020
<v Speaker 3>talk about it and right now that's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest problem with the same situation</v>

1783
01:22:46.021 --> 01:22:50.490
<v Speaker 3>as what the Wall Street Journal when</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and trying to talk about food</v>

1784
01:22:50.491 --> 01:22:53.620
<v Speaker 3>searching and mentioning alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like they're like,</v>

1785
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:55.630
<v Speaker 3>we don't eat fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't eat seafood.</v>

1786
01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:56.610
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>

1787
01:22:56.611 --> 01:22:58.800
<v Speaker 3>And don't you think that it's the optics</v>
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>

1788
01:22:58.830 --> 01:23:01.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean what they're concerned with is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1789
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:04.950
<v Speaker 3>It's not that it's rational,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that they don't want any.</v>

1790
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:08.320
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a person like you,</v>

1791
01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:13.000
<v Speaker 1>although what you're doing is if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain it and you look at it</v>

1792
01:23:13.001 --> 01:23:14.740
<v Speaker 1>objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very rational,</v>

1793
01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.680
<v Speaker 1>but they're not trying to be rational</v>
<v Speaker 1>with they're trying to do is avoid any</v>

1794
01:23:17.681 --> 01:23:21.340
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a guy who is a nascar</v>

1795
01:23:21.341 --> 01:23:22.510
<v Speaker 1>driver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1796
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:27.930
<v Speaker 1>And he lost a sponsor recently for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist stuff that his father said 30</v>

1797
01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:32.800
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how crazy people are getting.</v>

1798
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Thirty years ago his father used a</v>
<v Speaker 1>racial slur and because of that,</v>

1799
01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:45.480
<v Speaker 1>this guy who wasn't even alive when this</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened or maybe he was alive,</v>

1800
01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:48.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe he was seven years old or some</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1801
01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:52.510
<v Speaker 1>he lost the sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1802
01:23:52.530 --> 01:23:56.110
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the companies are such</v>
<v Speaker 1>cowards,</v>

1803
01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:58.930
<v Speaker 1>like they're so terrified because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media,</v>

1804
01:23:58.931 --> 01:24:03.931
<v Speaker 1>because people are so willing to protest</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a bunch of fuck heads out</v>

1805
01:24:04.031 --> 01:24:06.490
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just get a thrill off of getting</v>

1806
01:24:06.491 --> 01:24:11.491
<v Speaker 1>people fired and of getting things</v>
<v Speaker 1>canceled and of like exercising action</v>

1807
01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.180
<v Speaker 1>and seeing a result.</v>

1808
01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:16.630
<v Speaker 1>All they're doing is pushing buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that they've thought about this</v>

1809
01:24:16.631 --> 01:24:17.411
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1810
01:24:17.411 --> 01:24:21.400
<v Speaker 1>is this guy really responsible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we really blame him for something</v>

1811
01:24:21.401 --> 01:24:24.100
<v Speaker 1>his father did 30 years ago and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

1812
01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:27.160
<v Speaker 1>What we should do is nothing just let it</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1813
01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless this guy is like some sort of</v>

1814
01:24:29.981 --> 01:24:33.940
<v Speaker 1>white supremacists are some racist</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself and he's not,</v>

1815
01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.640
<v Speaker 1>we should just do nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not.</v>

1816
01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.110
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not fun.</v>

1817
01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:42.730
<v Speaker 1>What's fun is getting a rush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a power trip out of action,</v>

1818
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.090
<v Speaker 1>like clearly there should look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you find a real racist,</v>

1819
01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:48.820
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's doing something actively</v>

1820
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.770
<v Speaker 1>to harm other people simply based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ethnic origin or the color of</v>

1821
01:24:53.771 --> 01:24:54.491
<v Speaker 1>their skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1822
01:24:54.491 --> 01:24:56.530
<v Speaker 1>that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should talk about that.</v>

1823
01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.900
<v Speaker 1>That should be eliminated from our</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

1824
01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real racism,</v>

1825
01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:04.930
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What this is is people deciding that</v>

1826
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:09.760
<v Speaker 1>they're going to take action and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nascar being a pussy about it or this</v>

1827
01:25:09.761 --> 01:25:13.600
<v Speaker 1>company being a pussy about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the same thing that's happening</v>

1828
01:25:13.601 --> 01:25:14.500
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

1829
01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:18.160
<v Speaker 1>This is not a rational decision like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should look at it and go,</v>

1830
01:25:18.161 --> 01:25:19.900
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what an interesting way to get your</v>

1831
01:25:19.901 --> 01:25:22.000
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how many of these people that made</v>

1832
01:25:22.001 --> 01:25:25.600
<v Speaker 1>this decision actually eat fish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would bet it's most.</v>

1833
01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's most</v>

1834
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:31.990
<v Speaker 2>people should understand also that by</v>
<v Speaker 2>refraining people to talk about it,</v>

1835
01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:34.700
<v Speaker 2>you being part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1836
01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:39.590
<v Speaker 2>This is why things have been so bad for</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many years because nobody wants to</v>

1837
01:25:39.591 --> 01:25:41.960
<v Speaker 2>talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all want to eat it.</v>

1838
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:43.400
<v Speaker 2>They just don't want to know where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1839
01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:45.260
<v Speaker 1>but no one's looking at things long</v>
<v Speaker 1>term.</v>

1840
01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:48.890
<v Speaker 1>All they're looking at potential short</v>
<v Speaker 1>term income loss.</v>

1841
01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:52.340
<v Speaker 1>So what the Wall Street Journal or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington Post or whatever,</v>

1842
01:25:52.341 --> 01:25:55.190
<v Speaker 1>whatever paper it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're worried about.</v>

1843
01:25:55.191 --> 01:25:59.190
<v Speaker 1>They're worried that someone's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>come along and say the Wall Street</v>

1844

<v Speaker 1>Was It Wall Street Journal?</v>

1845
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:03.600
<v Speaker 1>The Wall Street Journal supports a</v>

1846
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:08.090
<v Speaker 4>mass extinction of fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can just reframe it and some</v>

1847
01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:12.830
<v Speaker 4>outrageous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unrealistic non the accurate way.</v>

1848
01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:15.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people need to chill out to understand</v>

1849
01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:16.690

<v Speaker 3>when it come from</v>

1851
01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:22.550
<v Speaker 2>in a sense that especially like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>millennials or whatever we all born</v>

<v Speaker 2>and wouldn't you shit about dad?</v>

1855
01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:31.420
<v Speaker 2>We had fricking process food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody cared about it.</v>

1856
01:26:31.421 --> 01:26:33.580
<v Speaker 2>We had hot dogs and nobody was saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about it.</v>

1857
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:36.880
<v Speaker 2>And then we all reach like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or mid twenties and Ellison and we've</v>

1858
01:26:36.881 --> 01:26:37.930
<v Speaker 2>been taught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody,</v>

<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

1865
01:26:52.391 --> 01:26:55.900
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for somebody that lives in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Missoula city that doesn't know anything</v>

1866
01:26:55.901 --> 01:26:57.700

<v Speaker 2>because somebody told me.</v>

1870
01:27:02.141 --> 01:27:02.880
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1871

<v Speaker 4>We're eliminating straws.</v>

1877
01:27:18.690 --> 01:27:20.320
<v Speaker 4>And then on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1878
01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.050
<v Speaker 4>the tweeted said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1879
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:26.430
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're just putting plastic lids on</v>

1880
01:27:26.431 --> 01:27:28.890
<v Speaker 4>your coffee cups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1881
01:27:28.891 --> 01:27:31.650
<v Speaker 4>And what happens with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then starbucks,</v>

1882
01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:35.230
<v Speaker 4>it's an o Dot d.like</v>

<v Speaker 3>You got plastic lids everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those God damn starbucks lids are</v>

1885
01:27:43.951 --> 01:27:45.630
<v Speaker 3>littered on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're everywhere.</v>

1886
01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:48.330
<v Speaker 3>But is this actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a perfect example because it</v>

1887
01:27:48.331 --> 01:27:50.820
<v Speaker 3>shows exactly this bit of action.</v>

1888
01:27:50.970 --> 01:27:54.360
<v Speaker 2>The people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have either a very small action and</v>

1889
01:27:54.361 --> 01:27:58.050
<v Speaker 2>makes them feel better or they like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>point out two fingers.</v>

1890
01:27:58.051 --> 01:28:02.050
<v Speaker 2>If somebody else you with your Straw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly Straw.</v>

1891
01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Now it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1892
01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:03.961
<v Speaker 2>it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1893
01:28:03.961 --> 01:28:06.210
<v Speaker 2>just the way people are dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1894
01:28:06.211 --> 01:28:09.120
<v Speaker 2>They've been told that everything you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been doing since Jay kids are bad.</v>

1895
01:28:09.121 --> 01:28:10.250
<v Speaker 2>So now they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1896
01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.393
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1897
01:28:11.610 --> 01:28:13.200
<v Speaker 3>but look at her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's fishing,</v>

1898
01:28:13.230 --> 01:28:14.070
<v Speaker 3>she's evil.</v>

1899
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:17.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>

1900
01:28:17.810 --> 01:28:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I think it's that as soon as the way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people or handling the fact that they've</v>

1901
01:28:22.221 --> 01:28:24.800
<v Speaker 2>been told that everything is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're trying to be like,</v>

1902
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:26.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made my effort.</v>

1903
01:28:26.691 --> 01:28:30.230
<v Speaker 2>I made a facebook post this morning</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that I wasn't getting Straw,</v>

1904
01:28:30.231 --> 01:28:31.190
<v Speaker 2>so I'm green.</v>

1905
01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:36.530
<v Speaker 4>California seems to be the first state</v>
<v Speaker 4>to limit plastic straws.</v>

1906
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:38.360
<v Speaker 4>All restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1907
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:40.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that not as a pass,</v>

1908
01:28:40.951 --> 01:28:44.660
<v Speaker 4>but that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been proposed governor Jerry Brown.</v>

1909
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:48.320
<v Speaker 3>I just had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can it be so difficult?</v>

1910
01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.340
<v Speaker 3>She'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1911
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:52.580
<v Speaker 3>plastic is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You use something else.</v>

1912
01:28:53.130 --> 01:28:54.210
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing that they,</v>

1913
01:28:54.211 --> 01:28:55.470
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1914
01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:58.110
<v Speaker 4>maybe I saw this with Europe or the US</v>
<v Speaker 4>fund this on your page,</v>

1915
01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:02.220
<v Speaker 4>that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a new that they use</v>

1916
01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:07.050
<v Speaker 1>for water runoff before it goes into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean is his giant net that catches all</v>

1917
01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:09.530
<v Speaker 1>this plastic particles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that on your instagram page?</v>

1918
01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

1919
01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Someone has invented this cover that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1920
01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:19.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like a filter that as the water's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through,</v>

1921
01:29:19.951 --> 01:29:23.370
<v Speaker 1>it catches all the stuff that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinarily be washed out to sea.</v>

1922
01:29:23.371 --> 01:29:26.250
<v Speaker 1>And so it basically over these storm</v>
<v Speaker 1>drainage pipes,</v>

1923
01:29:26.251 --> 01:29:29.400
<v Speaker 1>he's enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pious is this huge net so the water can</v>

1924
01:29:29.401 --> 01:29:32.730
<v Speaker 1>still go through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just shows you like this insane</v>

1925
01:29:32.731 --> 01:29:37.731
<v Speaker 1>amount of debris and garbage that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have ordinarily just been washed out to</v>

1926
01:29:38.761 --> 01:29:42.940
<v Speaker 1>sea and the catching it in these nets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not everything but it's a start and</v>

1927
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:46.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to make up for the FEC</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cruise ship that's dumping things</v>

1928
01:29:46.650 --> 01:29:48.930
<v Speaker 1>just right off shore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1929
01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.430
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the case.</v>

1930
01:29:50.690 --> 01:29:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1931
01:29:51.090 --> 01:29:51.771
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1932
01:29:51.771 --> 01:29:54.530
<v Speaker 2>it's legal to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the worst part of it.</v>

1933
01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:59.660
<v Speaker 2>But</v>
<v Speaker 2>you spearfish,</v>

1934
01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:02.690
<v Speaker 2>spearfish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm the bad guy.</v>

1935
01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:03.673
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1936
01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:07.700
<v Speaker 1>would you want to do is you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>spear fish and you want to raise</v>

1937
01:30:07.701 --> 01:30:09.920
<v Speaker 1>awareness that you want to continue to</v>
<v Speaker 1>live this life.</v>

1938
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:13.670
<v Speaker 1>So what you're trying to do along the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way is trying to figure out how to make</v>

1939
01:30:13.671 --> 01:30:15.290
<v Speaker 1>a living while you're doing it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

1958
01:31:01.521 --> 01:31:06.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of people compare</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in a very sort of foolish</v>

1959
01:31:06.351 --> 01:31:08.450
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They compare themselves with other</v>

1960
01:31:08.451 --> 01:31:10.300
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how much stuff have these people</v>

1961
01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.080
<v Speaker 1>accumulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much you buy.</v>

1962
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:13.570
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1963
01:31:13.571 --> 01:31:16.350
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a crucial step of my life to be</v>

1964
01:31:16.351 --> 01:31:19.560
<v Speaker 2>able to take a step back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to take a step back of all of</v>

1965
01:31:19.561 --> 01:31:20.550
<v Speaker 2>that and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1966
01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.270
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1967
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Like I've been telling the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>since I'm born about what I should want,</v>

1968
01:31:27.031 --> 01:31:28.960
<v Speaker 2>about what I should do about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1969
01:31:29.210 --> 01:31:31.590
<v Speaker 2>about what me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1970
01:31:31.591 --> 01:31:34.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like when I was one of his seven</v>

1971
01:31:34.951 --> 01:31:36.750
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at my mom and I said,</v>

1972
01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:37.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom,</v>

1973
01:31:37.801 --> 01:31:40.380
<v Speaker 2>when I grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather have like a job that I don't</v>

1974
01:31:40.381 --> 01:31:42.240
<v Speaker 2>like when I make a shit ton of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a job.</v>

1975
01:31:42.241 --> 01:31:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I love what I make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

1976
01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:46.740
<v Speaker 2>I was seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told that to my mother and my mom was</v>

1977
01:31:46.741 --> 01:31:48.900
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did I do wrong?</v>

1978
01:31:49.890 --> 01:31:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a rational thought with kids</v>

1979
01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.430
<v Speaker 2>because then when I quit my job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then my mom was the one being like,</v>

1980
01:31:54.730 --> 01:31:55.680
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing dad?</v>

1981
01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.420
<v Speaker 2>You have no security in life and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

1982
01:31:57.421 --> 01:31:58.141
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1983
01:31:58.141 --> 01:31:58.741
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1984
01:31:58.741 --> 01:31:59.501
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

1985
01:31:59.501 --> 01:32:01.330
<v Speaker 2>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to step back.</v>

1986
01:32:01.331 --> 01:32:05.020
<v Speaker 2>I need to look at everything around me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to look at society in each to</v>

1987
01:32:05.021 --> 01:32:06.420
<v Speaker 2>look how things work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1988
01:32:06.421 --> 01:32:09.610
<v Speaker 2>I want to make sure that when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm in it,</v>

1989
01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:13.330
<v Speaker 2>it's because I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I want</v>

1990
01:32:14.970 --> 01:32:16.600
<v Speaker 2>and I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like being told what to do.</v>

1991
01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1992
01:32:18.791 --> 01:32:20.620
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of what I'm doing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out my own thing and the</v>

1993
01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:21.460
<v Speaker 2>fingernail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

1994
01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:25.150
<v Speaker 2>what's important for me in what my real</v>
<v Speaker 2>values are and I don't think you can</v>

1995
01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:28.720
<v Speaker 2>discover depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really are by staying in your nine</v>

1996
01:32:28.721 --> 01:32:33.430
<v Speaker 2>to five by not knowing anything and</v>
<v Speaker 2>being unhappy and not being able to go</v>

1997
01:32:33.431 --> 01:32:34.930
<v Speaker 2>outside of your comfort zone.</v>

1998
01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:36.260
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Comfort zones,</v>

1999
01:32:36.261 --> 01:32:36.951
<v Speaker 4>the big word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2000
01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:38.990
<v Speaker 4>Because it's comforting that you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>that check every week.</v>

2001
01:32:39.130 --> 01:32:40.840
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's fine.</v>

2002
01:32:41.210 --> 01:32:42.043
<v Speaker 4>It's numbing.</v>

2003
01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:43.730
<v Speaker 2>You have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have this and that,</v>

2004
01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.730
<v Speaker 2>but it's people that tell me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2005
01:32:46.490 --> 01:32:48.730
<v Speaker 2>I used to encourage us to have done that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

2006
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:51.020
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I envy you life so much.</v>

2007
01:32:51.090 --> 01:32:51.923
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2008
01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:55.220
<v Speaker 2>when I first quit my job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in my fricking car for awhile</v>

2009
01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:58.250
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't have a place to stay</v>
<v Speaker 2>and neither no money to sustain myself.</v>

2010
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:59.810
<v Speaker 2>Did you really live in your car?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2011
01:32:59.811 --> 01:33:01.140
<v Speaker 2>I did for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long?</v>

2012
01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Like if I like a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that and what?</v>

2013
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:07.730
<v Speaker 2>It was like sporadic in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or did you shower somewhere?</v>

2014
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:08.091
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2015
01:33:08.091 --> 01:33:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I have friends so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showering is also beaches,</v>

2016
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.030
<v Speaker 2>the showers and the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't sure</v>

2017
01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:16.600
<v Speaker 4>when that was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How old were you at the time?</v>

2018
01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Twenty three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 20.</v>

2019
01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:21.140
<v Speaker 2>So you're 28.</v>

2020
01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:24.090
<v Speaker 4>You were you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck am I doing with my life?</v>

2021
01:33:24.091 --> 01:33:25.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm living in my car.</v>

2022
01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:26.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't.</v>

2023
01:33:26.850 --> 01:33:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I felt I felt free and I never</v>

2024
01:33:29.161 --> 01:33:30.890
<v Speaker 2>regret in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's okay.</v>

2025
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:33.850
<v Speaker 4>Well you are courageous if that's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>case because a lot of people would panic</v>

2026
01:33:33.851 --> 01:33:34.684
<v Speaker 4>me included.</v>

2027
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:40.790
<v Speaker 2>It's I guess you courageous in a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>regarding the fact that you're sleeping</v>

2028
01:33:41.461 --> 01:33:45.150
<v Speaker 2>in a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if he unhappy with your life,</v>

2029
01:33:45.210 --> 01:33:46.950
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why keep going with it?</v>

2030
01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:49.250
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what you're saying is logical,</v>

2031
01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:52.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But logic is not how most people live</v>

2032
01:33:52.671 --> 01:33:55.390
<v Speaker 4>their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you're saying is like your</v>

2033
01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:58.070
<v Speaker 4>romantic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're saying,</v>

2034
01:33:58.071 --> 01:34:02.960
<v Speaker 4>I want to live my life with passion and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to follow my interests and I</v>

2035
01:34:02.961 --> 01:34:05.630
<v Speaker 4>don't mind living in my car and</v>
<v Speaker 4>showering at the beach.</v>

2036
01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:08.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine with that.</v>

2037
01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:12.160
<v Speaker 4>Most people are not fine with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people would be insecure and they</v>

2038
01:34:12.161 --> 01:34:16.580
<v Speaker 4>would be scared of the future and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>would want some sort of stability and</v>

2039
01:34:16.581 --> 01:34:19.480
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what courageous about your,</v>

2040
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:22.730
<v Speaker 4>your decision because one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that like,</v>

2041
01:34:22.731 --> 01:34:24.860
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking with people about you</v>

2042
01:34:24.861 --> 01:34:28.430
<v Speaker 4>before I did this podcast and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>question from everybody's like,</v>

2043
01:34:28.431 --> 01:34:29.480
<v Speaker 4>how does she make a living?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2044
01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:31.610
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>

2045
01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:32.181
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

2046
01:34:32.181 --> 01:34:34.850
<v Speaker 4>I guess she's a professional spear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fisher person.</v>

2047
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:37.010
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know how you make money</v>

2048
01:34:37.011 --> 01:34:37.581
<v Speaker 4>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2049
01:34:37.581 --> 01:34:39.560
<v Speaker 4>maybe a guide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People take people out</v>

2050
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.320
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very rarely.</v>

2051
01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:45.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid of having a structure too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why don't only give private lessons.</v>

2052
01:34:45.611 --> 01:34:49.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm a freediving instructor so I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

2053
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I give lessons once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have contracts here in there.</v>

2054
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:54.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm not right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I reached a point where I'm not,</v>

2055
01:34:55.150 --> 01:34:56.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not starving either.</v>

2056
01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:58.450
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

2057
01:34:58.451 --> 01:35:00.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of happy about it than I</v>

2058
01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:03.260
<v Speaker 2>actually do believe is going to lead to</v>
<v Speaker 2>some something,</v>

2059
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:08.030
<v Speaker 2>but lead to choose something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a job that I think is going to be,</v>

2060
01:35:08.031 --> 01:35:09.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to giving conferences</v>

2061
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:12.350
<v Speaker 2>around than I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that really,</v>

2062
01:35:12.351 --> 01:35:13.184
<v Speaker 2>really interesting.</v>

2063
01:35:13.210 --> 01:35:15.690
<v Speaker 4>Conferences like this woman's</v>
<v Speaker 4>empowerment thing.</v>

2064
01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:16.440
<v Speaker 4>You were going to talk?</v>

2065
01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:17.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much.</v>

2066
01:35:17.610 --> 01:35:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Just without all the shit going behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2067
01:35:20.630 --> 01:35:25.630
<v Speaker 4>Well that was just one and I'm sure</v>
<v Speaker 4>people love a story about someone who's</v>

2068
01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:30.830
<v Speaker 4>following their passion because there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many people out there that really</v>

2069
01:35:30.831 --> 01:35:33.650
<v Speaker 4>desperately want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just don't know how to do it or how</v>

2070
01:35:33.651 --> 01:35:38.651
<v Speaker 4>to get the courage to do it or they get</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuck with a mortgage or maybe they have</v>

2071
01:35:38.931 --> 01:35:42.140
<v Speaker 4>a family and responsibilities or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have loved ones that are taken care</v>

2072
01:35:42.141 --> 01:35:45.410
<v Speaker 4>of and they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when they hear about someone</v>

2073
01:35:45.411 --> 01:35:48.800
<v Speaker 4>who's going for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either they're jealous of you and they</v>

2074
01:35:48.801 --> 01:35:50.360
<v Speaker 4>hate on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they say that stupid,</v>

2075
01:35:50.361 --> 01:35:51.171
<v Speaker 4>that girl's a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

2076
01:35:51.171 --> 01:35:52.610
<v Speaker 4>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or they go,</v>

2077
01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:53.720
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could do that.</v>

2078
01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:55.100
<v Speaker 4>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are the two.</v>

2079
01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:57.500
<v Speaker 4>Depending upon the mindset of the person</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's watching you,</v>

2080
01:35:58.040 --> 01:35:59.300
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be their reaction.</v>

2081
01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:00.980
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2082
01:36:00.981 --> 01:36:02.480
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a TV show coming on,</v>

2083
01:36:02.481 --> 01:36:04.700
<v Speaker 2>have my coo book coming on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the TV show?</v>

2084
01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:07.460
<v Speaker 2>I have a TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be in French,</v>

2085
01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:08.420
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about,</v>

2086
01:36:08.421 --> 01:36:10.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be traveling around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and fishing with.</v>

2087
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:13.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even sure I'm ready to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

2088
01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:14.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoops.</v>

2089
01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Was a TV show is going to be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm starting with my sister just</v>

2090
01:36:18.981 --> 01:36:22.880
<v Speaker 2>graduated from fashion design in London</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're just starting.</v>

2091
01:36:22.881 --> 01:36:27.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bathing suit company with recycled</v>
<v Speaker 2>fabric.</v>

2092
01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:28.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2093
01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.670
<v Speaker 2>So what do I have a few things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>might pipeline.</v>

2094
01:36:30.710 --> 01:36:31.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like being bored.</v>

2095
01:36:31.761 --> 01:36:33.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it seems like it.</v>

2096
01:36:33.291 --> 01:36:33.711
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2097
01:36:33.711 --> 01:36:35.540
<v Speaker 2>like I'm free spirited and I traveled</v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

2098
01:36:35.541 --> 01:36:38.720
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still a very ambitious person and I</v>

2099
01:36:38.721 --> 01:36:41.630
<v Speaker 2>do want to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are going to make me proud.</v>

2100
01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:43.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2101
01:36:43.341 --> 01:36:45.650
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't quit a bit thing to,</v>

2102
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:48.850
<v Speaker 2>to become a hippie and live on the beach</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no,</v>

2103
01:36:48.930 --> 01:36:50.150
<v Speaker 2>she's rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2104
01:36:50.151 --> 01:36:54.110
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I quit my job to live and build my life</v>

2105
01:36:54.111 --> 01:36:58.220
<v Speaker 2>in my career the way I want it to end in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a way that was making me proud and</v>

2106
01:36:58.221 --> 01:37:00.830
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is pretty much what I'm,</v>

2107
01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:02.390
<v Speaker 2>what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing right now.</v>

2108
01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:04.710
<v Speaker 4>It's very admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>

2109
01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:08.010
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it is really brave because you're</v>

2110
01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:10.770
<v Speaker 4>not going to get a whole lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>reinforcement from other people.</v>

2111
01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:14.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you probably didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably wearing a lot of people that</v>

2112
01:37:14.101 --> 01:37:15.690
<v Speaker 4>were telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go for a girl,</v>

2113
01:37:16.170 --> 01:37:18.660
<v Speaker 4>go sleep at the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2114
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:20.010
<v Speaker 4>senior car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2115
01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.200
<v Speaker 4>You don't have a shower who needs a</v>
<v Speaker 4>shower,</v>

2116
01:37:22.530 --> 01:37:23.880
<v Speaker 4>you don't know where your food is coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>

2117
01:37:23.881 --> 01:37:24.960
<v Speaker 4>Foot care,</v>

2118
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:26.920
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the group of people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2119
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good idea.</v>

2120
01:37:28.031 --> 01:37:29.470
<v Speaker 2>And then a second you turn around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2121
01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:31.170
<v Speaker 2>am I getting wow,</v>

2122
01:37:32.770 --> 01:37:34.000
<v Speaker 4>people love to talk shit.</v>

2123
01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:39.120
<v Speaker 2>But it's even in my hardest moments when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was broke or anything like that,</v>

2124
01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:43.020
<v Speaker 2>I never regretted it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not once second I told myself I made a</v>

2125
01:37:43.021 --> 01:37:45.810
<v Speaker 2>wrong decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess it gets signed.</v>

2126
01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:49.020
<v Speaker 4>Well the good thing is you are doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's so soul sucking</v>

2127
01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:54.390
<v Speaker 4>that anything seems like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2128
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:55.970
<v Speaker 4>it's worth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really</v>

2129
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.050
<v Speaker 2>found myself in situations when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2130
01:37:58.110 --> 01:37:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually an asshole.</v>

2131
01:37:59.411 --> 01:37:59.911
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2132
01:37:59.911 --> 01:38:02.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of have to work on that as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyer.</v>

2133
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:03.890
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even like in,</v>

2134
01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:04.231
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2135
01:38:04.231 --> 01:38:05.340
<v Speaker 2>in this life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2136
01:38:05.341 --> 01:38:08.460
<v Speaker 2>especially when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filming a documentary in Africa and</v>

2137
01:38:08.461 --> 01:38:12.080
<v Speaker 2>different places where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no food and you're like,</v>

2138
01:38:12.081 --> 01:38:15.300
<v Speaker 2>I have a table of people that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharing like a can of tuna in between</v>

2139
01:38:15.301 --> 01:38:16.560
<v Speaker 2>for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

2140
01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:18.780
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2141
01:38:18.781 --> 01:38:20.070
<v Speaker 2>let's share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to share.</v>

2142
01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:22.110
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to like push it around and</v>

2143
01:38:23.290 --> 01:38:25.850
<v Speaker 2>digging it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you,</v>

2144
01:38:26.110 --> 01:38:29.880
<v Speaker 2>you're discovering yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you don't always like what you</v>

2145
01:38:29.881 --> 01:38:32.060
<v Speaker 2>see and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

2146
01:38:32.061 --> 01:38:32.790
<v Speaker 2>it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

2147
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:33.870
<v Speaker 2>it's what it's for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2148
01:38:33.871 --> 01:38:36.020
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've looked at yourself and then I</v>

2149
01:38:36.021 --> 01:38:38.490
<v Speaker 2>would have never discovered a type of</v>
<v Speaker 2>person that I am when I'm starving,</v>

2150
01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:41.490
<v Speaker 2>run a nine to five job unless you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>starving.</v>

2151
01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2152
01:38:42.511 --> 01:38:46.290
<v Speaker 2>How many people ever are right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not definitely not that many.</v>

2153
01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.570
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was the thing that shocked me the</v>

2154
01:38:48.571 --> 01:38:52.350
<v Speaker 2>most and I think it's also what touches</v>
<v Speaker 2>people the most about</v>

2155
01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Africa has been one of them is people</v>
<v Speaker 2>super close with each other.</v>

2156
01:38:58.171 --> 01:39:02.090
<v Speaker 2>People are really nice and you're really</v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing on things and it's,</v>

2157
01:39:02.091 --> 01:39:02.701
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2158
01:39:02.701 --> 01:39:04.800
<v Speaker 2>I won that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to keep doing that.</v>

2159
01:39:05.190 --> 01:39:07.110
<v Speaker 2>But then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you spend your money there and then you</v>

2160
01:39:07.111 --> 01:39:09.330
<v Speaker 2>spend a month in New York City and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget everything.</v>

2161
01:39:10.230 --> 01:39:12.630
<v Speaker 2>It takes literally a week to forget</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2162
01:39:12.670 --> 01:39:14.950
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another hard thing would be if you tried</v>

2163
01:39:14.951 --> 01:39:18.070
<v Speaker 4>to relay your experiences on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>television show,</v>

2164
01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:23.350
<v Speaker 4>it would be edited down to even if it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a one hour show with commercials,</v>

2165
01:39:23.351 --> 01:39:28.351
<v Speaker 4>it becomes 44 minutes and you're just</v>
<v Speaker 4>not going to be able to get all of that</v>

2166
01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:34.440
<v Speaker 2>can be very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told him that I was not interested in</v>

2167
01:39:34.441 --> 01:39:39.441
<v Speaker 2>to doing anything scripted and I told</v>
<v Speaker 2>them if I want to do a TV show,</v>

2168
01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:42.870
<v Speaker 2>if I'm puking I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted there.</v>

2169
01:39:42.990 --> 01:39:44.970
<v Speaker 2>If I'm crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted there.</v>

2170
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:47.280
<v Speaker 2>If I hate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm crying for my mommy to come pick</v>

2171
01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:48.780
<v Speaker 2>me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted there to.</v>

2172
01:39:49.410 --> 01:39:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Because I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2173
01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:51.853
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>

2174
01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:55.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the beauty part about those</v>
<v Speaker 2>travels and that's what needs to be</v>

2175
01:39:55.021 --> 01:39:55.854
<v Speaker 2>shown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

2176
01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:01.400
<v Speaker 4>that would be a real reality show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reality of reality shows is most</v>

2177
01:40:01.401 --> 01:40:04.040
<v Speaker 4>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or at least planned out if they're not</v>

2178
01:40:04.041 --> 01:40:05.000
<v Speaker 4>scripted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally,</v>

2179
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:07.550
<v Speaker 4>and you could tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can tell when people are like,</v>

2180
01:40:07.551 --> 01:40:09.570
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we gotta fix this gas pump,</v>

2181
01:40:09.571 --> 01:40:11.300
<v Speaker 4>but we're not going to get this boat</v>
<v Speaker 4>started.</v>

2182
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:17.270
<v Speaker 4>Such bad actors you see to their face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could smell it when they're acting.</v>

2183
01:40:17.271 --> 01:40:18.104
<v Speaker 4>It's just like.</v>

2184
01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:20.960
<v Speaker 2>But that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The beauty of the Anthony Bourdain show</v>

2185
01:40:20.961 --> 01:40:22.570
<v Speaker 2>actually it was all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't</v>

2186
01:40:22.930 --> 01:40:23.561
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2187
01:40:23.561 --> 01:40:26.560
<v Speaker 4>that's why when they threw the frozen</v>
<v Speaker 4>octopus in the water,</v>

2188
01:40:26.561 --> 01:40:27.550
<v Speaker 4>he was mocking them.</v>

2189
01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

2190
01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:31.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand why a lot of people see</v>

2191
01:40:31.831 --> 01:40:34.980
<v Speaker 2>that in me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a girl and sometimes a little bit</v>

2192
01:40:34.981 --> 01:40:37.110
<v Speaker 2>girly and things like that and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

2193
01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:37.591
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2194
01:40:37.591 --> 01:40:39.390
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wants us to be in a TV show and do</v>

2195
01:40:39.391 --> 01:40:41.500
<v Speaker 2>this and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2196
01:40:41.501 --> 01:40:41.980
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2197
01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:44.280
<v Speaker 2>I get why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why people would think that.</v>

2198
01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:45.840
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

2199
01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:47.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you pass five minutes,</v>

2200
01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:48.240
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be licensed.</v>

2201
01:40:49.730 --> 01:40:52.400
<v Speaker 4>What you're trying to do is relay your</v>
<v Speaker 4>passion for something.</v>

2202
01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 4>And when people really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2203
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I've struggled with that with bow</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting because I've done some things on</v>

2204
01:40:59.051 --> 01:41:00.630
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some,</v>

2205
01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:02.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a film last year for under armour.</v>

2206
01:41:02.710 --> 01:41:07.630
<v Speaker 1>We went elk hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But part of me is like not everything</v>

2207
01:41:07.631 --> 01:41:10.290
<v Speaker 1>should just be broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Everything should be fair.</v>

2208
01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes life should just be</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced,</v>

2209
01:41:12.371 --> 01:41:16.870
<v Speaker 1>especially for someone like me who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm overexposed in the first</v>

2210
01:41:16.871 --> 01:41:20.230
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be better off doing less things</v>

2211
01:41:20.231 --> 01:41:22.900
<v Speaker 1>publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one that I've decided to do</v>

2212
01:41:22.901 --> 01:41:27.730
<v Speaker 1>less of publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of me wants people to know that</v>

2213
01:41:27.731 --> 01:41:31.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a satisfaction to like bow</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting in particular is very,</v>

2214
01:41:31.991 --> 01:41:33.820
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to do.</v>

2215
01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:38.440
<v Speaker 1>It takes intense practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of physical exercise.</v>

2216
01:41:38.441 --> 01:41:41.770
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to run up the hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have endurance because</v>

2217
01:41:41.771 --> 01:41:45.340
<v Speaker 1>you're climbing through the mountains</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time and then it's hard to do.</v>

2218
01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:49.060
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get close enough to shoot</v>

2219
01:41:49.061 --> 01:41:51.460
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to execute when the</v>

2220
01:41:51.461 --> 01:41:54.580
<v Speaker 1>moment is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to shoot an animal</v>

2221
01:41:54.581 --> 01:41:56.830
<v Speaker 1>with a bow and Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially long distance.</v>

2222
01:41:57.130 --> 01:42:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to have an extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of proficiency before you can</v>

2223
01:42:01.331 --> 01:42:03.430
<v Speaker 1>ever pull that off under high stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

2224
01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:08.050
<v Speaker 1>So part of me wants to relay that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a misconception about what people see</v>

2225
01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:12.790
<v Speaker 1>when they think of hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think of cruelty and they think of</v>

2226
01:42:12.791 --> 01:42:15.310
<v Speaker 1>someone who doesn't respect nature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think of,</v>

2227
01:42:15.610 --> 01:42:17.190
<v Speaker 1>they think of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2228
01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:22.420
<v Speaker 1>they think of this a abusive</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship that humans have with</v>

2229
01:42:22.421 --> 01:42:27.421
<v Speaker 1>animals instead of the way I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you have this deep</v>

2230
01:42:27.761 --> 01:42:31.570
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the food chain and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>food chain exists.</v>

2231
01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Whether you're there or not is food</v>
<v Speaker 1>chain exists with bears and wolves and</v>

2232
01:42:36.491 --> 01:42:40.900
<v Speaker 1>mount minds and deer and elk and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these animals are struggling for</v>

2233
01:42:40.901 --> 01:42:44.770
<v Speaker 1>survival and all you do is interject.</v>

2234
01:42:45.130 --> 01:42:49.310
<v Speaker 1>You step in for a little bit and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>take your part in the food chain and in</v>

2235
01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:54.340
<v Speaker 1>and in turn you also give out all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>money that goes to conservation is money</v>

2236
01:42:54.971 --> 01:42:57.940
<v Speaker 1>that goes to conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ensures that this opportunity to be</v>

2237
01:42:57.941 --> 01:43:01.300
<v Speaker 1>there for other hunters in the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ensures that the populations of</v>

2238
01:43:01.301 --> 01:43:06.190
<v Speaker 1>these animals will stay healthy and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>ensures that they'll be monitored by the</v>

2239
01:43:06.191 --> 01:43:09.460
<v Speaker 1>proper fishing game and wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 1>biologists and all these different</v>

2240
01:43:09.461 --> 01:43:12.970
<v Speaker 1>people that are going to ensure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these animals are this,</v>

2241
01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:15.730
<v Speaker 1>this environment and this experience is</v>
<v Speaker 1>preserved.</v>

2242
01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:20.940
<v Speaker 1>And The wild habitat that these animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy will be preserved and it's for</v>

2243
01:43:21.730 --> 01:43:24.700
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very conflicting,</v>

2244
01:43:24.730 --> 01:43:25.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people it's,</v>

2245
01:43:25.631 --> 01:43:27.490
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems almost hypocritical that you</v>

2246
01:43:27.491 --> 01:43:29.770
<v Speaker 1>could say that you love these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also want to eat them.</v>

2247
01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:31.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

2248
01:43:31.761 --> 01:43:33.810
<v Speaker 2>that's not what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

2249
01:43:33.870 --> 01:43:36.900
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the hybrid thing to do is to say</v>

2250
01:43:36.901 --> 01:43:40.830
<v Speaker 2>that you left them and then buy them for</v>
<v Speaker 2>grocery store and not caring how they</v>

2251
01:43:40.831 --> 01:43:43.890
<v Speaker 2>got there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when you being ridiculous.</v>

2252
01:43:44.770 --> 01:43:48.250
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem is that's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>available for so long.</v>

2253
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:50.890
<v Speaker 1>We're used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if there was just a machine that</v>

2254
01:43:50.891 --> 01:43:53.720
<v Speaker 1>you could go to where you could just get</v>
<v Speaker 1>your money from this machine.</v>

2255
01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:56.840
<v Speaker 2>You talked to somebody about hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they put their fingers in ears and</v>

2256
01:43:56.841 --> 01:43:57.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2257
01:43:57.841 --> 01:43:59.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

2258
01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:00.550
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2259
01:44:00.570 --> 01:44:01.980
<v Speaker 2>it's the same when you go to Mcdonald's,</v>

2260
01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.460
<v Speaker 1>the Wall Street Journal approached you</v>
<v Speaker 1>with phishing spear phishing.</v>

2261
01:44:06.461 --> 01:44:07.560
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2262
01:44:07.590 --> 01:44:10.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not a well thought out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational argument.</v>

2263
01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:15.220
<v Speaker 1>They're worried about outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in this day and age it's very easy.</v>

2264
01:44:15.250 --> 01:44:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a picture,</v>

2265
01:44:16.451 --> 01:44:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I put up the other day of a target that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have in my backyard with some arrows</v>

2266
01:44:19.811 --> 01:44:24.160
<v Speaker 1>in it and all these vegans are attacking</v>
<v Speaker 1>me for shooting fucking target.</v>

2267
01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:25.493
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

2268
01:44:25.630 --> 01:44:28.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean they know I'm practicing and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting ready to shoot animals,</v>

2269
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:31.670
<v Speaker 1>but all they're doing is there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal there.</v>

2270
01:44:31.671 --> 01:44:35.680
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking rubber to rubber elk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting angry because that's</v>

2271
01:44:35.681 --> 01:44:40.370
<v Speaker 1>what people like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like to express outrage and they,</v>

2272
01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:43.390
<v Speaker 1>they talk too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too much expression.</v>

2273
01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Take it from someone who does talk too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

2274
01:44:45.041 --> 01:44:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk way too much,</v>

2275
01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:50.040
<v Speaker 1>but people there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not considering their,</v>

2276
01:44:50.110 --> 01:44:53.230
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just doing it and you're not.</v>

2277
01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:56.890
<v Speaker 1>You don't change people's opinion by</v>
<v Speaker 1>being an asshole online.</v>

2278
01:44:56.891 --> 01:44:58.690
<v Speaker 1>You just get everyone to realize you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>an asshole.</v>

2279
01:44:58.870 --> 01:45:00.520
<v Speaker 2>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a bunch of Vegan following me</v>

2280
01:45:00.521 --> 01:45:04.150
<v Speaker 2>now because I took the time to respond</v>
<v Speaker 2>to their concerns and now they actually</v>

2281
01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:09.360
<v Speaker 2>got it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how can we make improvement when</v>

2282
01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:14.110
<v Speaker 2>when you have an one side and a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that only want to do is scream,</v>

2283
01:45:14.111 --> 01:45:16.020
<v Speaker 2>scandal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything they see and then in year</v>

2284
01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:18.940
<v Speaker 2>decide the people that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a strong voice or if you care to</v>

2285
01:45:18.941 --> 01:45:22.750
<v Speaker 2>talk about everything because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>scared of that first group and then by</v>

2286
01:45:22.751 --> 01:45:26.950
<v Speaker 2>doing that we're doing nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been toning down a lot.</v>

2287
01:45:26.951 --> 01:45:30.040
<v Speaker 2>My instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped posting fish with blood on it</v>

2288
01:45:30.041 --> 01:45:32.050
<v Speaker 2>with things like that because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>just don't want.</v>

2289
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:37.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see it and I know I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have a choice to do that because</v>

2290
01:45:37.001 --> 01:45:37.834
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you what</v>

2291
01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:39.880
<v Speaker 1>but what percentage don't want to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2292
01:45:39.881 --> 01:45:43.430
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if someone eats fish,</v>

2293
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:47.060
<v Speaker 1>if they'd like Sushi and then they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset when they go to your instagram</v>

2294
01:45:47.061 --> 01:45:50.240
<v Speaker 1>page and you've got to have a spear</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a tuna</v>

2295
01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:52.880
<v Speaker 1>you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're almost.</v>

2296
01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:56.990
<v Speaker 1>You're educating them and a lot of ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the people that do get upset,</v>

2297
01:45:57.140 --> 01:46:00.740
<v Speaker 1>even though you hear their voices and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the voices are a loud minority.</v>

2298
01:46:01.190 --> 01:46:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many followers do you have on</v>

2299
01:46:03.411 --> 01:46:04.244
<v Speaker 1>instagram?</v>

2300
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:06.930
<v Speaker 2>Eighty $4,000.</v>

2301
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about 84,000 people looks like</v>

2302
01:46:09.941 --> 01:46:12.730
<v Speaker 1>in a room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant number of people.</v>

2303
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people are screaming assholes.</v>

2304
01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:18.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

2305
01:46:18.970 --> 01:46:22.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a small percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number of people that see it and</v>

2306
01:46:22.630 --> 01:46:26.500
<v Speaker 1>they're rational adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know that in order to kill a tuna,</v>

2307
01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:30.940
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be some blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no bloodless method for killing</v>

2308
01:46:30.941 --> 01:46:32.290
<v Speaker 1>it tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist,</v>

2309
01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:37.980
<v Speaker 2>but also the weird thing is that in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way I understand the outrage on a</v>

2310
01:46:37.981 --> 01:46:41.730
<v Speaker 2>certain level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I went deer hunting for the</v>

2311
01:46:41.731 --> 01:46:46.230
<v Speaker 2>first time in New Caledonia and last</v>
<v Speaker 2>October and it was not.</v>

2312
01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Would boast always with actual gun and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I shot the deer,</v>

2313
01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.330
<v Speaker 2>so I cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2314
01:46:54.331 --> 01:46:57.720
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I killed Bambi and it was so bad and I</v>

2315
01:46:57.721 --> 01:46:58.740
<v Speaker 2>give there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

2316
01:46:58.741 --> 01:47:00.450
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all cute and everything and like,</v>

2317
01:47:00.451 --> 01:47:03.660
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it was dead and then I carried</v>

2318
01:47:03.661 --> 01:47:08.661
<v Speaker 2>it on my back and we walked back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the house and then they started</v>

2319
01:47:09.241 --> 01:47:14.100
<v Speaker 2>cutting it in pieces and it started</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking like meat and my guilt when</v>

2320
01:47:14.101 --> 01:47:16.020
<v Speaker 2>completely away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely away.</v>

2321
01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.341
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2322
01:47:17.341 --> 01:47:20.880
<v Speaker 2>how much of a hypocrite can I be that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm crying because I killed fricking</v>

2323
01:47:20.881 --> 01:47:23.940
<v Speaker 2>Bambi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like actual physical tears going down my</v>

2324
01:47:23.941 --> 01:47:27.720
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a second I see a piece of meat.</v>

2325
01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:29.850
<v Speaker 2>I just got excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2326
01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:34.800
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be burgers elicited and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sits fish is a little bit easier</v>

2327
01:47:34.801 --> 01:47:39.570
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of us have seen a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish has kids,</v>

2328
01:47:39.630 --> 01:47:41.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put a whole in a table so that the</v>

2329
01:47:41.911 --> 01:47:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Gore is a little bit less there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's more about the blood than seen</v>

2330
01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:48.240
<v Speaker 2>actual fish dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I bet I get it.</v>

2331
01:47:48.241 --> 01:47:50.680
<v Speaker 2>How am I know it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

2332
01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:54.240
<v Speaker 2>I felt really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really like in hypergrid after that.</v>

2333
01:47:54.670 --> 01:47:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

2334
01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:58.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt that I felt in a weird way,</v>

2335
01:47:58.551 --> 01:48:01.700
<v Speaker 1>I felt like a weird sense of loss the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time I shot a deer.</v>

2336
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it went away when I started eating</v>

2337
01:48:04.671 --> 01:48:07.790
<v Speaker 1>it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I never killed an animal before</v>

2338
01:48:07.791 --> 01:48:08.361
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

2339
01:48:08.361 --> 01:48:11.510
<v Speaker 1>I had killed fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been fishing since I was a little</v>

2340
01:48:11.511 --> 01:48:12.680
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love fishing,</v>

2341
01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:17.510
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't feel a connection with fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way I felt a connection with a</v>

2342
01:48:17.511 --> 01:48:20.210
<v Speaker 1>mammal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's closer to us,</v>

2343
01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:23.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our closer to our species.</v>

2344
01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Fish is like an alien thing that lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an alien world,</v>

2345
01:48:26.661 --> 01:48:27.650
<v Speaker 1>that breeze water.</v>

2346
01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:29.900
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that had like the human,</v>

2347
01:48:29.901 --> 01:48:33.230
<v Speaker 2>like eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I tend to fill a tuna is one of</v>

2348
01:48:33.231 --> 01:48:34.790
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend</v>

2349
01:48:36.490 --> 01:48:37.430
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

2350
01:48:37.431 --> 01:48:39.380
<v Speaker 2>I have a picture I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to show it to you.</v>

2351
01:48:39.570 --> 01:48:40.950
<v Speaker 2>If tuna eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you,</v>

2352
01:48:41.010 --> 01:48:42.500
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks,</v>

2353
01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:46.140
<v Speaker 2>it looks really like you can seek</v>
<v Speaker 2>suppression and,</v>

2354
01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:47.150
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their eyes.</v>

2355
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:49.280
<v Speaker 2>That's when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the second way people starting to</v>

2356
01:48:49.281 --> 01:48:50.280
<v Speaker 2>feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2357
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:53.780
<v Speaker 2>I remember fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2358
01:48:54.490 --> 01:48:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I think it's curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess you can say from freaking</v>

2359
01:48:59.031 --> 01:49:00.410
<v Speaker 2>out because it knows you're going to eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2360
01:49:01.370 --> 01:49:03.170
<v Speaker 1>It's anthropomorphization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2361
01:49:03.171 --> 01:49:04.730
<v Speaker 1>We will look at animals a week.</v>

2362
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:06.840
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of them just actually very.</v>

2363
01:49:07.210 --> 01:49:08.270
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of human light.</v>

2364
01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fish is an asshole.</v>

2365
01:49:09.690 --> 01:49:10.523
<v Speaker 1>I can tell looking in his eyes.</v>

2366
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:13.680
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a duct to tutor.</v>

2367
01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Those teeth are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2368
01:49:15.721 --> 01:49:20.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty weird fish that Jeremy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello folks.</v>

2369
01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.131
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2370
01:49:23.131 --> 01:49:26.430
<v Speaker 2>you can see like just like a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>wide on the outside and then just call</v>

2371
01:49:26.431 --> 01:49:28.040
<v Speaker 2>her and freaking out because</v>

2372
01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:30.460
<v Speaker 1>it's looking out at the air for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>

2373
01:49:30.461 --> 01:49:31.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

2374
01:49:31.801 --> 01:49:32.870
<v Speaker 1>it's just another world up here.</v>

2375
01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:36.300
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually see this.</v>

2376
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Well for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was right there.</v>

2377
01:49:38.631 --> 01:49:40.580
<v Speaker 1>He's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's alive.</v>

2378
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably freaking out outside the</v>

2379
01:49:42.831 --> 01:49:45.200
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what in the fuck is this?</v>

2380
01:49:45.530 --> 01:49:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if it was alive event that John</v>

2381
01:49:47.351 --> 01:49:48.180
<v Speaker 2>My ass,</v>

2382
01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:49.730
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my hands would have of his gills.</v>

2383
01:49:49.731 --> 01:49:52.750
<v Speaker 3>So if it comes back alive it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a very,</v>

2384
01:49:52.751 --> 01:49:53.680
<v Speaker 3>very strong fish.</v>

2385
01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:54.833
<v Speaker 4>Imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at it.</v>

2386
01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:58.290
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a tank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean imagine being a fish,</v>

2387
01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:01.350
<v Speaker 4>you live your whole life in the water</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then also in somewhat pulls you out</v>

2388
01:50:01.351 --> 01:50:02.750
<v Speaker 4>of it and you look into the and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2389
01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:06.760
<v Speaker 3>what is this and why can't I breathe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2390
01:50:06.761 --> 01:50:09.370
<v Speaker 3>at least I did it very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the good thing about it.</v>

2391
01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's got to be a freakout and push</v>

2392
01:50:12.371 --> 01:50:14.080
<v Speaker 3>the brains like the size of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>fingernail.</v>

2393
01:50:14.081 --> 01:50:16.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in life is Brian Pretty quickly?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Life is Brian Pretty quick.</v>

2395
01:50:18.881 --> 01:50:22.050
<v Speaker 3>So would you do right in the dome?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you killed them and if you don't you</v>

2396
01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:26.560
<v Speaker 3>shoot them and if you don't kill them on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a spot where the gun really?</v>

2397
01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shoot tuna with a gun.</v>

2398
01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:30.521
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A spear gun?</v>

2399
01:50:30.521 --> 01:50:31.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Lean sideways style.</v>

2402
01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:39.993
<v Speaker 3>Shoot him right there</v>

2403
01:50:41.970 --> 01:50:44.990
<v Speaker 4>because I know they club them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They clubbed fish and they put them on</v>

2404
01:50:44.991 --> 01:50:46.400
<v Speaker 4>boats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't know this shot him.</v>

2405

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2408
01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:55.660

<v Speaker 3>And then when you get it on land,</v>

2409
01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.750
<v Speaker 3>what I do is,</v>

<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2414
01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Given your knife it and a nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>intensely.</v>

2415
01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:10.240
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do,</v>

2416
01:51:10.241 --> 01:51:13.390
<v Speaker 3>if you go lion fishing or commercial</v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing,</v>

2417
01:51:13.391 --> 01:51:17.860
<v Speaker 3>what they do is they just throw it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the boat and then dies like 16 hours.</v>

2418
01:51:17.861 --> 01:51:21.730
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we kill it as quick as possible.</v>

2419
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:24.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And do you immediately throw them on</v>

2420
01:51:24.361 --> 01:51:25.590
<v Speaker 4>ice?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2421
01:51:26.010 --> 01:51:26.940
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know</v>

2422
01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:29.260
<v Speaker 3>until you bleed it first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You bleed it first,</v>

2423
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:30.830
<v Speaker 3>you know when you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you eat.</v>

2424
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Sushi or fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It tastes fishy.</v>

2425
01:51:34.850 --> 01:51:37.650
<v Speaker 3>It's very often the blood that makes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes that taste.</v>

2426
01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:40.460
<v Speaker 3>So every time we catch a fish you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut the girls,</v>

2427
01:51:40.461 --> 01:51:42.950
<v Speaker 3>you let him bleed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that's the same with meat.</v>

2428
01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:44.200
<v Speaker 3>I just sat with me.</v>

2429
01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:45.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2430
01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:45.950
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2431
01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:47.710
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>butcher dear.</v>

2432
01:51:47.711 --> 01:51:52.711
<v Speaker 4>They'll hang it by its legs and cut it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>throat and got it.</v>

2433
01:51:52.781 --> 01:51:54.460
<v Speaker 4>And let everything with the meat bleed</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2434
01:51:55.930 --> 01:51:58.000
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly dead fish,</v>

2435
01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:00.460
<v Speaker 3>you have to do it straightaway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost in the water if there's not too</v>

2436
01:52:00.461 --> 01:52:03.700
<v Speaker 3>many sharks around because the blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>coagulates very,</v>

2437
01:52:03.701 --> 01:52:05.980
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very quickly and then it becomes too</v>

2438
01:52:05.981 --> 01:52:08.350
<v Speaker 3>late and then it changes the flavor of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fish.</v>

2439
01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:09.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when you fill it out,</v>

2440
01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:12.040
<v Speaker 3>you cut it on the side and then when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>flip it,</v>

2441
01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:15.490
<v Speaker 3>there's just like blood everywhere and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it did painting to me and then it</v>

2442
01:52:15.610 --> 01:52:17.410
<v Speaker 3>creates a team that it's not that good.</v>

2443
01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:20.930
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's one of the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 4>why they soak fishing milk.</v>

2444
01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:26.310
<v Speaker 4>It changes the flavor because I think if</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember this correctly,</v>

2445
01:52:26.311 --> 01:52:31.311
<v Speaker 4>there's enzymes in milk that destroy the</v>
<v Speaker 4>harmful bacteria that causes fish to</v>

2446
01:52:33.561 --> 01:52:36.560
<v Speaker 4>taste fishy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think they said that this works</v>

2447
01:52:36.561 --> 01:52:41.561
<v Speaker 4>also with meat and with chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's a certain smell to chicken</v>

2448
01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:44.960
<v Speaker 4>in particular that when you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's might smell a little.</v>

2449
01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:48.140
<v Speaker 4>What that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this certain bacteria that's on the</v>

2450
01:52:48.141 --> 01:52:50.900
<v Speaker 4>surface of the skin and then if you soak</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in milk,</v>

2451
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:53.720
<v Speaker 4>see if he could find that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember I read that like really</v>

2452
01:52:53.721 --> 01:52:54.554
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>

2453
01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:55.111
<v Speaker 3>Does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2454
01:52:55.111 --> 01:52:55.910
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2455
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:59.170
<v Speaker 3>helps odor free cooking when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing fish shark even to.</v>

2456
01:52:59.610 --> 01:53:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2457
01:53:01.330 --> 01:53:06.330
<v Speaker 3>that was the only time I used the sharks</v>
<v Speaker 3>know you monster while I was in.</v>

2458
01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:08.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm in lunch hook in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2459
01:53:08.401 --> 01:53:10.650
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a guy was floating a shy and talk</v>

2460
01:53:11.210 --> 01:53:14.060
<v Speaker 3>in Long Island Long Island yet and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2461
01:53:14.690 --> 01:53:18.370
<v Speaker 3>he was filling like a small Maaco</v>
<v Speaker 3>shotgun to ask him for peace and it</v>

2462
01:53:18.371 --> 01:53:20.600
<v Speaker 3>gives me a slub of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2463
01:53:20.601 --> 01:53:21.340
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

2464
01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:26.180
<v Speaker 3>So what court with my big piece of sharp</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what struck me was the smell.</v>

2465
01:53:26.181 --> 01:53:27.530
<v Speaker 3>It smell like meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

2466
01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:30.600
<v Speaker 3>you can smell the ammonia in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

2467
01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:32.940
<v Speaker 3>it was super strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I read on line and said put an</v>

2468
01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:36.530
<v Speaker 3>milligan lemon juice for 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you do that?</v>

2469
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:39.170
<v Speaker 3>Yes I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lemon juice would break it down.</v>

2470
01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Was it good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2471
01:53:40.461 --> 01:53:42.200
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you cook it?</v>

2472
01:53:42.710 --> 01:53:43.880
<v Speaker 3>I just fried in a pan.</v>

2473
01:53:44.730 --> 01:53:46.410
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a special way that you like</v>
<v Speaker 4>to cook?</v>

2474
01:53:46.411 --> 01:53:47.244
<v Speaker 4>Fish?</v>

2475
01:53:47.730 --> 01:53:49.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on which one,</v>

2476
01:53:50.190 --> 01:53:55.190
<v Speaker 3>but I really like lightly floured and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just icu it in olive oil and then I,</v>

2477
01:53:56.070 --> 01:53:59.880
<v Speaker 3>I cook it slowly and butter and</v>
<v Speaker 3>friendship with butter and everything.</v>

2478
01:54:00.010 --> 01:54:00.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2479
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:06.470
<v Speaker 4>Have you become like more into cooking</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you kill your own fish?</v>

2480
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:10.190
<v Speaker 3>Opposite really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>

2481
01:54:10.191 --> 01:54:14.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean opposite in a way that I always</v>
<v Speaker 3>love to cook and I got into spearfishing</v>

2482
01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:19.070
<v Speaker 3>because of cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is what made me fall in love</v>

2483
01:54:19.130 --> 01:54:22.250
<v Speaker 3>with the sport is the fact that or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle you can call it,</v>

2484
01:54:22.610 --> 01:54:24.410
<v Speaker 3>it's the fact that catching mountain</v>
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>

2485
01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:29.420
<v Speaker 3>I get access to two amazing fish and</v>
<v Speaker 3>seafood that is,</v>

2486
01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:30.710
<v Speaker 3>couldn't be more fresh and done.</v>

2487
01:54:30.970 --> 01:54:33.820
<v Speaker 4>There's a guy named Hank Shaw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's been on my podcast before.</v>

2488
01:54:33.821 --> 01:54:36.250
<v Speaker 4>He's an amazing chef and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2489
01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:41.280
<v Speaker 4>he has a bunch of wild game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a recipe books and he got into it</v>

2490
01:54:41.921 --> 01:54:45.280
<v Speaker 4>because he wanted the freshest</v>
<v Speaker 4>ingredients and he wanted wild game</v>

2491
01:54:45.281 --> 01:54:49.720
<v Speaker 4>ingredients as opposed to buying farm</v>
<v Speaker 4>raised or factory farmed food.</v>

2492
01:54:49.930 --> 01:54:54.010
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to be able to cook amazing</v>
<v Speaker 4>dishes from like say a wild pig that he</v>

2493
01:54:54.011 --> 01:54:56.440
<v Speaker 4>shot himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he got into hunting because of that</v>

2494
01:54:56.441 --> 01:55:00.760
<v Speaker 4>and because of that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very valuable for people that are</v>

2495
01:55:00.761 --> 01:55:05.170
<v Speaker 4>really interested in and cooking wild</v>
<v Speaker 4>game because he was a legit,</v>

2496
01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:09.970
<v Speaker 4>excellent chef before he ever got into</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting and then getting into hunting</v>

2497
01:55:09.971 --> 01:55:12.010
<v Speaker 4>and now he writes books about it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's very,</v>

2498
01:55:12.011 --> 01:55:13.190
<v Speaker 4>very passionate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2499
01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:14.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

2500
01:55:14.201 --> 01:55:18.490
<v Speaker 3>It was a very similar situation to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally got into it just pretty much</v>

2501
01:55:18.491 --> 01:55:22.150
<v Speaker 3>just for the food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually the first two years when I</v>

2502
01:55:22.151 --> 01:55:24.100
<v Speaker 3>thought is pivoting ain't even likes</v>
<v Speaker 3>pivoting.</v>

2503
01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:27.850
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't scared of my own shadow for two</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2504
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:30.940
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked it the first time.</v>

2505
01:55:30.970 --> 01:55:32.410
<v Speaker 3>I liked it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the concept,</v>

2506
01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:34.450
<v Speaker 3>I liked what was behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fell in love with,</v>

2507
01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:38.470
<v Speaker 3>with catching my own food and cooking</v>
<v Speaker 3>after and all of that was publishing</v>

2508
01:55:38.471 --> 01:55:39.700
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took me awhile.</v>

2509
01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:42.460
<v Speaker 3>So you were still nervous about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was extremely nervous,</v>

2510
01:55:42.461 --> 01:55:44.220
<v Speaker 3>extremely like struggling</v>

2511
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:47.970
<v Speaker 2>to breathe and every time I was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>for spear fishing trip,</v>

2512
01:55:47.971 --> 01:55:51.090
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't sleep for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was literally imagining myself being</v>

2513
01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:53.070
<v Speaker 2>treated by a shark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this and that.</v>

2514
01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:55.560
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was never.</v>

2515
01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:59.490
<v Speaker 2>My trips never been about that even</v>
<v Speaker 2>though it was completely petrified of</v>

2516
01:55:59.491 --> 01:56:00.980
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been lost at sea,</v>

2517
01:56:01.150 --> 01:56:03.300
<v Speaker 2>which was pretty shitty day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might say.</v>

2518
01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:07.980
<v Speaker 2>What happened two years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2519
01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:11.540
<v Speaker 2>I was in Mexico and I was with friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was,</v>

2520
01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:14.690
<v Speaker 2>I was so angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hated the guy so badly what happened?</v>

2521
01:56:15.070 --> 01:56:17.550
<v Speaker 2>So I jumping in the water with a friend</v>
<v Speaker 2>of mine,</v>

2522
01:56:17.551 --> 01:56:20.870
<v Speaker 2>I've never speakers before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're,</v>

2523
01:56:21.070 --> 01:56:23.410
<v Speaker 2>we're in the water in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2524
01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:24.330
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never did anything.</v>

2525
01:56:24.331 --> 01:56:24.841
<v Speaker 2>He's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2526
01:56:24.841 --> 01:56:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I want to look around and I see what are</v>
<v Speaker 2>you doing?</v>

2527
01:56:26.310 --> 01:56:29.280
<v Speaker 2>And then I see the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty deep and you can't see the</v>

2528
01:56:29.281 --> 01:56:30.114
<v Speaker 2>bottom.</v>

2529
01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:34.290
<v Speaker 2>And then the boats are going further and</v>
<v Speaker 2>further and further and further and</v>

2530
01:56:34.291 --> 01:56:35.250
<v Speaker 2>further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my friend is like,</v>

2531
01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:35.911
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

2532
01:56:35.911 --> 01:56:36.661
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

2533
01:56:36.661 --> 01:56:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2534
01:56:38.190 --> 01:56:39.510
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to start swimming from the</v>

2535
01:56:39.511 --> 01:56:41.700
<v Speaker 2>shore right now for the shore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2536
01:56:41.701 --> 01:56:43.020
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So start swimming.</v>

2537
01:56:43.050 --> 01:56:46.060
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have been doable.</v>

2538
01:56:46.090 --> 01:56:48.750
<v Speaker 2>It was like maybe a good like five</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles,</v>

2539
01:56:48.751 --> 01:56:53.010
<v Speaker 2>maybe fucking shore was five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was far.</v>

2540
01:56:53.011 --> 01:56:55.820
<v Speaker 2>It was like I would have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was definitely been after Darwin had</v>

2541
01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:59.430
<v Speaker 2>reached the shore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm trying not to panic.</v>

2542
01:56:59.490 --> 01:57:02.640
<v Speaker 2>My heart is like pounding in my chest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my throat.</v>

2543
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:06.210
<v Speaker 2>It's true thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait drifting away for no reason.</v>

2544
01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:11.460
<v Speaker 2>And some of the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the captain that we hired,</v>

2545
01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:15.300
<v Speaker 2>that was American actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do to start drinking and not</v>

2546
01:57:15.301 --> 01:57:17.520
<v Speaker 2>paying attention to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait.</v>

2547
01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:19.570
<v Speaker 2>And then we're stocks.</v>

2548
01:57:19.590 --> 01:57:21.840
<v Speaker 2>I told my friend Akila swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We swam for about an hour,</v>

2549
01:57:21.841 --> 01:57:24.660
<v Speaker 2>an hour and a half and then a bowl</v>
<v Speaker 2>passes by.</v>

2550
01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:29.700
<v Speaker 2>So I started screaming and yelling and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had my brewery.</v>

2551
01:57:29.701 --> 01:57:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Luckily I was swimming it and it passed</v>
<v Speaker 2>next immediate wave at me like,</v>

2552
01:57:33.271 --> 01:57:34.090
<v Speaker 2>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2553
01:57:34.090 --> 01:57:34.980

<v Speaker 2>completely nexus in Spanish that we've</v>

2557
01:57:47.761 --> 01:57:50.100
<v Speaker 2>super far away and they drop us to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>boat.</v>

2558
01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:53.160
<v Speaker 2>The guy is asking me for money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2559

<v Speaker 2>It was asking me for money for tip,</v>

2562
01:58:02.851 --> 01:58:04.920
<v Speaker 2>for rescuing me in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>

2563
01:58:05.970 --> 01:58:06.751
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

2564
01:58:06.751 --> 01:58:08.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to tip in my panties right</v>

2565
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:13.020
<v Speaker 2>but thank you for saving my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you drop us to the boat and</v>

2566
01:58:13.021 --> 01:58:15.480
<v Speaker 2>then we get to the boat and the guy's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2567
01:58:15.570 --> 01:58:17.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't put enough gas in the boat.</v>

2568
01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Oops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so bad.</v>

2572
01:58:30.541 --> 01:58:32.940
<v Speaker 2>And then we managed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The coast guard came and they tried to</v>

2573
01:58:32.970 --> 01:58:35.830
<v Speaker 2>build a boat and he started telling the</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coast guard to like,</v>

2574
01:58:35.850 --> 01:58:39.660
<v Speaker 2>go screw himself because because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to pay for this.</v>

2575
01:58:39.661 --> 01:58:41.070
<v Speaker 2>You already Bush of assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2577
01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:47.830
<v Speaker 2>And you literally insulted him so badly</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Colbert left.</v>

2578
01:58:48.130 --> 01:58:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Did they take you with them now?</v>

2579
01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:52.030
<v Speaker 2>That was the only boat with my friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

2580
01:58:52.031 --> 01:58:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No understanding what was going on.</v>

2581
01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you so mad?</v>

2582
01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just keep drinking.</v>

2583
01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:00.580
<v Speaker 2>So how'd you get back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he managed to find full</v>

<v Speaker 2>reception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You call the cousin of his wife is his</v>

<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2586
01:59:05.790 --> 01:59:09.840
<v Speaker 2>He arrived like about an hour and a half</v>
<v Speaker 2>later I got back to shore and the guy's</v>

2587
01:59:09.841 --> 01:59:10.211
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>screw you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm leaving.</v>

2590
01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm going tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a fucking delusional.</v>

2591
01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:20.890
<v Speaker 2>So bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we get to know you almost died.</v>

2592
01:59:21.550 --> 01:59:25.350
<v Speaker 4>And I left in the ocean and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have any gas and I told the coast guard</v>

2593
01:59:25.351 --> 01:59:26.090
<v Speaker 4>to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

2594
01:59:26.090 --> 01:59:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never see you ever again and we get to</v>

2595
01:59:28.751 --> 01:59:30.160
<v Speaker 2>the car and my friend is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2596
01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:32.500
<v Speaker 2>I give him like $100 and tip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that enough?</v>

2597
01:59:32.501 --> 01:59:33.334
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did what?</v>

2598
01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:35.793
<v Speaker 2>You did what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>

2599
01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:41.710
<v Speaker 2>At</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln and uh,</v>

2600
01:59:41.711 --> 01:59:43.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was.</v>

2601
01:59:43.450 --> 01:59:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the scariest thing that's ever</v>

2602
01:59:45.431 --> 01:59:47.560
<v Speaker 2>happened to you in the water besides the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiger shark?</v>

2603
01:59:48.370 --> 01:59:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely</v>

2604
01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:52.280
<v Speaker 4>for sure it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2605
01:59:52.290 --> 01:59:54.580
<v Speaker 4>Was there anything else like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That really freaked me out.</v>

2606
01:59:54.610 --> 01:59:57.880
<v Speaker 4>That should freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Five miles is a long way to swim,</v>

2607
01:59:57.881 --> 02:00:00.880
<v Speaker 4>especially if you don't swim distance</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>

2608
02:00:00.881 --> 02:00:02.550
<v Speaker 4>Did you have any flotation device or</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything?</v>

2609
02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:05.330
<v Speaker 2>I have one buoy about that big and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were too.</v>

2610
02:00:05.930 --> 02:00:07.940
<v Speaker 2>I was more scared because it was about</v>
<v Speaker 2>like four,</v>

2611
02:00:07.941 --> 02:00:09.890
<v Speaker 2>25.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to sun was getting down really</v>

2612
02:00:09.891 --> 02:00:11.060
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be able to see what the</v>

2613
02:00:11.061 --> 02:00:13.790
<v Speaker 2>shore is now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not by being with the lights?</v>

2614
02:00:13.791 --> 02:00:15.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could,</v>

2615
02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:18.990
<v Speaker 2>it's more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was more freaked about like when it's</v>

2616
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.630
<v Speaker 2>dark and it's fuck fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

2617
02:00:20.631 --> 02:00:21.410
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

2618
02:00:21.410 --> 02:00:25.390
<v Speaker 2>So I had moments and spearfishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a little bit freaky.</v>

2619
02:00:25.391 --> 02:00:29.540
<v Speaker 2>I also had a blackout last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So under water.</v>

2620
02:00:29.630 --> 02:00:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the biggest danger of spear</v>

2621
02:00:31.291 --> 02:00:33.480
<v Speaker 2>phishing is actually blacking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not sharks.</v>

2622
02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:35.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not getting bitten by an</v>
<v Speaker 2>underwater.</v>

2623
02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically what happens is that you</v>

2624
02:00:38.421 --> 02:00:41.450
<v Speaker 2>dive down and then when you come to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>surface,</v>

2625
02:00:41.451 --> 02:00:43.290
<v Speaker 2>if you stay too long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2626
02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:45.220
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on your way to the surface,</v>

2627
02:00:45.221 --> 02:00:50.210
<v Speaker 2>going to expand bag and then your</v>
<v Speaker 2>residual volume of area do you have left</v>

2628
02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:51.980
<v Speaker 2>and you and your lungs and becomes</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

2629
02:00:51.981 --> 02:00:52.814
<v Speaker 2>really small.</v>

2630
02:00:53.150 --> 02:00:55.890
<v Speaker 2>So then the presenters becomes too low</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you pass out what becomes too</v>

2631
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:57.380
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the percentage,</v>

2632
02:00:57.650 --> 02:01:01.970
<v Speaker 2>percentage of oxygen in your lungs</v>
<v Speaker 2>become too small,</v>

2633
02:01:02.450 --> 02:01:05.960
<v Speaker 2>and then you just pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically you brains shuts down to</v>

2634
02:01:05.961 --> 02:01:09.320
<v Speaker 2>make sure that a lack of oxygen is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>creating any permanent damages.</v>

2635
02:01:09.890 --> 02:01:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a Shitty CEO,</v>

2636
02:01:11.011 --> 02:01:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually kind of sport.</v>

2637
02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Not enough time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then that's what happens with people</v>

2638
02:01:17.271 --> 02:01:20.570
<v Speaker 2>is that when it come back up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you buddies not watching you,</v>

2639
02:01:20.571 --> 02:01:22.190
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I spear phishing is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>team sport.</v>

2640
02:01:22.220 --> 02:01:24.240
<v Speaker 2>If they're not watching you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you pass out on the water,</v>

2641
02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:26.750
<v Speaker 2>what if they pass out to a sink right</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2642
02:01:26.890 --> 02:01:29.060
<v Speaker 2>You're both doing it at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2643
02:01:29.061 --> 02:01:31.910
<v Speaker 2>normally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the good system to dive is one</v>

2644
02:01:31.911 --> 02:01:35.170
<v Speaker 2>person dives at a bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person is watching the other one and</v>

2645
02:01:35.190 --> 02:01:36.230
<v Speaker 2>then this one up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one down,</v>

2646
02:01:36.231 --> 02:01:37.064
<v Speaker 2>one up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one down,</v>

2647
02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:38.191
<v Speaker 2>and then you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2648
02:01:38.191 --> 02:01:39.530
<v Speaker 2>you watch each back.</v>

2649
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:41.840
<v Speaker 3>Is that what happened with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2650
02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:46.400
<v Speaker 3>it was actually very lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the guy that was diving with me.</v>

2651
02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:49.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm lost his brother a few years before</v>
<v Speaker 3>to blackout,</v>

2652
02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:54.260
<v Speaker 3>so he was looking at me very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very closely and I was,</v>

2653
02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:57.560
<v Speaker 3>I was beyond grateful to see space at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>surface.</v>

2654
02:01:57.561 --> 02:02:00.410
<v Speaker 3>I knew anything was going to black out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how'd you know you're going to black</v>

2655
02:02:00.411 --> 02:02:02.540
<v Speaker 3>out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it was.</v>

2656
02:02:02.630 --> 02:02:05.450
<v Speaker 3>I dove down and I was aiming at a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty deep.</v>

2657
02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:09.150
<v Speaker 3>I was at 85 feet and I aimed for fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an impulse beard.</v>

2658
02:02:09.170 --> 02:02:13.430
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't a gun and I missed it and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>started using it in water and then I</v>

2659
02:02:13.431 --> 02:02:14.450
<v Speaker 3>miss it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2660
02:02:14.451 --> 02:02:16.190
<v Speaker 3>God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I realized I was like,</v>

2661
02:02:16.191 --> 02:02:17.300
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am actually pretty deep?</v>

2662
02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:21.740
<v Speaker 3>And I've been there for quite a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I started panicking a little bit so</v>

2663
02:02:21.741 --> 02:02:24.380
<v Speaker 3>when you panic you let here even more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is completely stupid.</v>

2664
02:02:24.710 --> 02:02:25.970
<v Speaker 3>And then I started finning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finning,</v>

2665
02:02:25.971 --> 02:02:29.600
<v Speaker 3>finning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have you started doing a</v>

2666
02:02:30.750 --> 02:02:31.940
<v Speaker 3>fitting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spinning.</v>

2667
02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:36.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm finishing a when we have new wear</v>
<v Speaker 3>fins</v>

2668
02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:38.940
<v Speaker 3>kicking around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You taking.</v>

2669
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:40.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2670
02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:43.730
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what happens first before you</v>

2671
02:02:43.731 --> 02:02:46.010
<v Speaker 3>black out is you have a loss of motor</v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

2672
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:50.600
<v Speaker 3>So I could start feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could feel like my body making like</v>

2673
02:02:50.630 --> 02:02:53.780
<v Speaker 3>we're movements and then I knew that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of oxygen and then I knew that I</v>

2674
02:02:53.781 --> 02:02:57.710
<v Speaker 3>would probably most probably going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>pass out and then I came back.</v>

2675
02:02:57.711 --> 02:03:00.230
<v Speaker 3>I came back and the nice thought of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend who was watching and I was like,</v>

2676
02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:01.780
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really hope you really watching your</v>

2677
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:04.910
<v Speaker 3>view really watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he grabbed me and then he woke me up</v>

2678
02:03:04.911 --> 02:03:07.280
<v Speaker 3>and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How far were you from the surface and</v>

2679
02:03:07.281 --> 02:03:10.790
<v Speaker 3>you blacked out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I blacked out a surface at the surface.</v>

2680
02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Which is why it's called a shallow water</v>
<v Speaker 3>blackout because even if you're in</v>

2681
02:03:14.031 --> 02:03:16.700
<v Speaker 3>deeper water it most of the time it</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens at the surface.</v>

2682
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:20.510
<v Speaker 3>So when you got to the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did he have to do to wake you up?</v>

2683
02:03:21.090 --> 02:03:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Or you have to take the mask off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to keep the head of the water</v>

2684
02:03:24.651 --> 02:03:27.320
<v Speaker 3>and then you have to blow in the eyes</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he has a high concentration of</v>

2685
02:03:27.321 --> 02:03:28.610
<v Speaker 3>nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You slapped a little bit,</v>

2686
02:03:28.611 --> 02:03:32.990
<v Speaker 3>not too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call the person's name and then you</v>

2687
02:03:32.991 --> 02:03:35.810
<v Speaker 3>normally wake up pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty fast unless you inhale water.</v>

2688
02:03:36.710 --> 02:03:39.500
<v Speaker 3>What was it like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are a dream like if you get choked</v>

2689
02:03:39.501 --> 02:03:41.540
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of the things that happens when</v>

2690
02:03:41.541 --> 02:03:44.090
<v Speaker 3>you get choked out as you wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you were dreaming.</v>

2691
02:03:45.390 --> 02:03:46.370
<v Speaker 3>I was at a disco.</v>

2692
02:03:49.230 --> 02:03:51.500
<v Speaker 3>I was riding my skateboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

2693
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:54.020
<v Speaker 3>I've never been choked out to the point</v>
<v Speaker 3>of passing out</v>

2694
02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:58.580
<v Speaker 3>luckily for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2695
02:03:58.610 --> 02:04:01.950
<v Speaker 3>I missed out on going a few,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few minutes and I just wasn't sure</v>

2696
02:04:01.951 --> 02:04:03.680
<v Speaker 3>what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you just,</v>

2697
02:04:03.681 --> 02:04:05.330
<v Speaker 3>you just done for the day when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>

2698
02:04:05.331 --> 02:04:07.310
<v Speaker 3>but you have to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2699
02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:08.121
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2700
02:04:08.121 --> 02:04:10.460
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the risk of getting another one the same</v>

2701
02:04:10.460 --> 02:04:11.540
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually very high.</v>

2702
02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:13.550
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So once you shut off,</v>

2703
02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:16.460
<v Speaker 3>shut off again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to wait at least the</v>

2704
02:04:16.461 --> 02:04:19.220
<v Speaker 3>following day to get back into water the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next day.</v>

2705
02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I think I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the day after I really want to go</v>

2706
02:04:22.851 --> 02:04:26.240
<v Speaker 3>back in the water as soon as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just jumped back on the horse.</v>

2707
02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:30.350
<v Speaker 3>So at night I was a little bit stressed</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and my friend gave me some Kratom</v>

2708
02:04:30.351 --> 02:04:35.351
<v Speaker 3>and it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's stuff I used to think that stuff</v>

2709
02:04:35.930 --> 02:04:38.150
<v Speaker 3>that Kratom was um,</v>

2710
02:04:40.210 --> 02:04:44.280
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think it was a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was a mild stimulant.</v>

2711
02:04:44.281 --> 02:04:47.910
<v Speaker 4>I heard that people take it for pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I thought that when they're taking</v>

2712
02:04:47.911 --> 02:04:50.880
<v Speaker 4>it for pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're not getting high,</v>

2713
02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:53.610
<v Speaker 4>they're just taking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it alleviates pain like advil or</v>

2714
02:04:53.611 --> 02:04:56.130
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I took,</v>

2715
02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.890
<v Speaker 4>I think I took eight of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight or 10,</v>

2716
02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:03.360
<v Speaker 4>which is a lot because I know Chris bell</v>
<v Speaker 4>takes like 10 every day.</v>

2717
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:06.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Powder mixed with like,</v>

2718
02:05:06.330 --> 02:05:08.610
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just the powder in pill form.</v>

2719
02:05:08.970 --> 02:05:11.940
<v Speaker 4>And I was high as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2720
02:05:12.030 --> 02:05:13.860
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2721
02:05:13.861 --> 02:05:16.080
<v Speaker 4>Now I know why people are nervous about</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff.</v>

2722
02:05:16.620 --> 02:05:20.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the weird thing is I was high but my</v>

2723
02:05:20.161 --> 02:05:24.000
<v Speaker 4>body was very functional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was high but I wasn't</v>

2724
02:05:24.001 --> 02:05:27.030
<v Speaker 4>uncoordinated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't knocking things over.</v>

2725
02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:30.870
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that everything worked normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everything was,</v>

2726
02:05:30.910 --> 02:05:33.270
<v Speaker 4>was moving as I wanted it to move.</v>

2727
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:36.130
<v Speaker 4>But I was like Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking tripping.</v>

2728
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:41.180
<v Speaker 4>It is an opiate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It operates on your opiate receptors and</v>

2729
02:05:41.181 --> 02:05:43.110
<v Speaker 4>some sort of strange way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is one of the reasons why they're</v>

2730
02:05:43.111 --> 02:05:45.210
<v Speaker 4>making the argument that it should be</v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal,</v>

2731
02:05:45.211 --> 02:05:48.570
<v Speaker 4>but is if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if any opioid is legal,</v>

2732
02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:52.940
<v Speaker 4>it should be that one because it helps</v>
<v Speaker 4>people tremendously with addiction</v>

2733
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:56.280
<v Speaker 4>tremendously with pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem to be toxic to the point</v>

2734
02:05:56.281 --> 02:06:00.750
<v Speaker 4>where it can kill you or it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very rare that it does.</v>

2735
02:06:01.290 --> 02:06:04.590
<v Speaker 4>It seems to operate in a completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>different way than any other opiate and</v>

2736
02:06:04.591 --> 02:06:06.690
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though I was definitely high,</v>

2737
02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:10.080
<v Speaker 4>like I was definitely under the</v>
<v Speaker 4>influence of something.</v>

2738
02:06:10.410 --> 02:06:11.970
<v Speaker 4>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody knew.</v>

2739
02:06:12.030 --> 02:06:14.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean I could have conversations with</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2740
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:15.890
<v Speaker 4>but in the back of my head I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2741
02:06:16.140 --> 02:06:19.170
<v Speaker 4>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking to people.</v>

2742
02:06:19.171 --> 02:06:21.840
<v Speaker 4>And it was all totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't driving,</v>

2743
02:06:21.841 --> 02:06:23.670
<v Speaker 4>but if I was driving I think I'd be</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>

2744
02:06:23.671 --> 02:06:24.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was fine.</v>

2745
02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:26.280
<v Speaker 4>Walk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think even worked out.</v>

2746
02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:28.650
<v Speaker 4>I think yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

2747
02:06:29.190 --> 02:06:31.920
<v Speaker 4>it's just operates in a very different</v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

2748
02:06:31.950 --> 02:06:33.720
<v Speaker 4>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never,</v>

2749
02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:36.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had my knee operation,</v>

2750
02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:40.890
<v Speaker 4>I had one of my knee operations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They gave me a morphine button,</v>

2751
02:06:41.150 --> 02:06:43.440
<v Speaker 4>like when I was in the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they said,</v>

2752
02:06:43.441 --> 02:06:45.660
<v Speaker 4>if you want morphine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just press that button and it'll give</v>

2753
02:06:45.661 --> 02:06:48.980
<v Speaker 4>you some morphine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking hate that guy.</v>

2754
02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:53.940
<v Speaker 4>Once he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you get high off the morphine and</v>

2755
02:06:53.941 --> 02:06:57.570
<v Speaker 4>you're in the hospital was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep pressing the button and the pain of</v>

2756
02:06:57.571 --> 02:06:59.130
<v Speaker 4>the knees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was on.</v>

2757
02:06:59.131 --> 02:07:01.320
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>also my knee was on this motion machine</v>

2758
02:07:01.590 --> 02:07:02.850
<v Speaker 4>right after the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2759
02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:06.660
<v Speaker 4>the surgery was done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put me on this machine that extends</v>

2760
02:07:06.661 --> 02:07:10.020
<v Speaker 4>and contracts your name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brings it back and forth and that's not</v>

2761
02:07:10.021 --> 02:07:13.900
<v Speaker 4>comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you hit that morphine is fun.</v>

2762
02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:16.560
<v Speaker 4>But other than that I never really have</v>
<v Speaker 4>had opiates,</v>

2763
02:07:16.561 --> 02:07:17.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>except</v>

2764
02:07:19.620 --> 02:07:22.860
<v Speaker 4>they gave me a pain pill prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what kind it was.</v>

2765
02:07:22.861 --> 02:07:25.110
<v Speaker 4>It was Vicodin or percocet or one of</v>
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>

2766
02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:29.790
<v Speaker 4>I took it once and I hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just made me feel really stupid.</v>

2767
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:34.110
<v Speaker 4>Like I just remember thinking my brain's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just really dull and I still could feel</v>

2768
02:07:34.111 --> 02:07:35.890
<v Speaker 4>the pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't care.</v>

2769
02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:37.600
<v Speaker 4>It was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2770
02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:40.180
<v Speaker 2>So those morphine buttons are very</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>

2771
02:07:40.210 --> 02:07:42.800
<v Speaker 2>When I got my permission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep us in the button too.</v>

2772
02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was really fun.</v>

2773
02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It told me,</v>

2774
02:07:45.551 --> 02:07:46.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's time to go home.</v>

2775
02:07:46.781 --> 02:07:49.270
<v Speaker 2>And I stood up and I fell right on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

2776
02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:51.160
<v Speaker 2>I had a complete faceplant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2777
02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an actual complete face plant.</v>

2778
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:55.500
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what were you in the hospital for?</v>

2779
02:07:55.740 --> 02:07:57.500
<v Speaker 2>I was a earn yum.</v>

2780
02:07:58.350 --> 02:08:01.080
<v Speaker 4>Hernia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they didn't ask you or how many</v>

2781
02:08:01.081 --> 02:08:02.850
<v Speaker 4>times you press that button,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Valentine?</v>

2782
02:08:02.930 --> 02:08:05.340
<v Speaker 2>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They definitely did seem to have taking</v>

2783
02:08:05.341 --> 02:08:06.730
<v Speaker 2>into consideration my weight.</v>

2784
02:08:07.810 --> 02:08:08.621
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2785
02:08:08.621 --> 02:08:10.960
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well why wouldn't they ask you how many</v>

2786
02:08:10.961 --> 02:08:12.910
<v Speaker 4>times you press the button before they</v>
<v Speaker 4>let you get up?</v>

2787
02:08:12.970 --> 02:08:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2788
02:08:13.811 --> 02:08:16.420
<v Speaker 2>But I remembered a woman being like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nerves being like,</v>

2789
02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:18.550
<v Speaker 2>like you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a lot.</v>

2790
02:08:18.551 --> 02:08:20.360
<v Speaker 2>You show you one more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shoot that much.</v>

2791
02:08:20.361 --> 02:08:22.720
<v Speaker 2>If I was bringing in.</v>

2792
02:08:25.290 --> 02:08:27.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you're under the influence of it,</v>

2793
02:08:27.490 --> 02:08:29.070
<v Speaker 4>imagine you don't really worry about it.</v>

2794
02:08:29.250 --> 02:08:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2795
02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:31.793
<v Speaker 2>until you pass out.</v>

2796
02:08:32.290 --> 02:08:34.690
<v Speaker 4>Well Listen Valentine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad we did this.</v>

2797
02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:36.730
<v Speaker 4>It was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad we had this conversation.</v>

2798
02:08:36.850 --> 02:08:37.900
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

2799
02:08:37.901 --> 02:08:40.750
<v Speaker 4>I think what you're trying to do with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your life is admirable.</v>

2800
02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:44.080
<v Speaker 4>Life is short.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish more people would chase their</v>

2801
02:08:44.081 --> 02:08:49.081
<v Speaker 4>dreams and live their lives in a way</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they want to rather than just jump</v>

2802
02:08:49.511 --> 02:08:50.890
<v Speaker 4>into the fucking rat race.</v>

2803
02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:52.141
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely,</v>

2804
02:08:52.141 --> 02:08:54.150

<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2805

<v Speaker 2>So I'm happy I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much for having me here and</v>

2806
02:08:58.650 --> 02:09:01.790
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy how you came up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was asking a friend of mine from</v>

2807
02:09:01.820 --> 02:09:05.400
<v Speaker 2>podcast to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he talked to me about yours and so</v>

2808
02:09:05.401 --> 02:09:06.980
<v Speaker 2>as I was sitting at a beach in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bahamas,</v>

2809
02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.910
<v Speaker 2>then my friend that went to law school</v>
<v Speaker 2>with me,</v>

2810
02:09:08.911 --> 02:09:09.744
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I look you up in instagram and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will follow me.</v>

2813
02:09:13.810 --> 02:09:14.643

<v Speaker 4>Thanks for doing this and I hope maybe</v>

2818
02:09:24.341 --> 02:09:27.070
<v Speaker 4>this opens up some doors for you and</v>
<v Speaker 4>some things happen.</v>

2819
02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people start,</v>

2820
02:09:28.380 --> 02:09:31.890
<v Speaker 2>stop hiding behind their closed mind and</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>

2821
02:09:32.210 --> 02:09:35.400
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think slowly but surely conversations</v>

2822
02:09:35.401 --> 02:09:38.460
<v Speaker 4>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll open doors and change people's</v>

2823
02:09:38.461 --> 02:09:40.860
<v Speaker 4>perceptions and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I hope people got out of it.</v>

2824
02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:43.380
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I have one message today is talk</v>

2826
02:09:45.201 --> 02:09:46.970
<v Speaker 2>don't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't be scared to see what's going on</v>

2827
02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:50.840
<v Speaker 4>and live the life to the way you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what you're doing.</v>

2828
02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get Out of your comfort zone because you</v>

2829
02:09:53.071 --> 02:09:55.320
<v Speaker 2>never going to discover the person you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are this thing in there.</v>
