1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating about the liquid around them</v>

2
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:07.850
<v Speaker 1>out anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suppose people that are signed</v>

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would say this is our religion and</v>

4
00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:10.451
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

5
00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:12.250
<v Speaker 1>you're taking the piss out of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.170
<v Speaker 2>It's an ideology that is also a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive one in the sense that it's</v>

7
00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:21.220
<v Speaker 2>dedicated towards self improvement and</v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminating all these psychological</v>

8
00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.590
<v Speaker 2>barriers that are holding you back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that way.</v>

9
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.800
<v Speaker 2>But people find a lot of benefit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a part of that religion.</v>

10
00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:29.200
<v Speaker 2>And I think when they find a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit in being a part of it,</v>

11
00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could justify all the other</v>

12
00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 2>nonsense and just sort of ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what l Ron Hubbard,</v>

13
00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.600
<v Speaker 2>according to the going clear book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

14
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence Krauss book was trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with self medicate would,</v>

15
00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 2>he had a lot of psychological issues</v>
<v Speaker 2>himself and he was trying to cure his</v>

16
00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:49.741
<v Speaker 2>own issues and in using these methods to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cure his own religion or the zone,</v>

17
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Speaker 2>his own issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he translated them into a religion.</v>

18
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a big part of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology initially was,</v>

19
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 2>was his own attempts to self diagnose</v>
<v Speaker 2>and treat his own psychological</v>

20
00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:03.274
<v Speaker 2>ailments.</v>

21
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>A good idea really works really well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are so I suppose people that it's</v>

22
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>working for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a quote,</v>

23
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I heard that I'd like to be quick to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>where religious people are.</v>

24
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:16.381
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

25
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>it's all really obvious where religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are wrong.</v>

26
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause we sort of hear about it on the</v>

27
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>news but like where religious people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>

28
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of togetherness,</v>

29
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>selfless nurse relationship with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>deepest self acceptance of death and the</v>

30
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>possibility of transcendence of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human primal self.</v>

31
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Those things are all really beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

32
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>They've kind of lost their way in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>science as scientists,</v>

33
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>you know that term scientism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that sort of science has got</v>

34
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>into territories that science company</v>
<v Speaker 1>handled because we come to a judge</v>

35
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>during full stop at certain points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know like what happened on the</v>

36
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday before the Big Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>materialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>materialism,</v>

38
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>individualism are hard things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome.</v>

39
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>If like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people,</v>

40
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>if we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have as our dominant mindset,</v>

41
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm only going to believe shit that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can prove.</v>

42
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Then you are just an individual and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>may as well just,</v>

43
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not just spend your life fucking as</v>

44
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>many people as you can and accumulating</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much material as you can because</v>

45
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 1>nothing exists unless you can see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure it,</v>

46
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:15.870
<v Speaker 1>way it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contain it and fuck it.</v>

47
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that is the dominant belief system,</v>

48
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>which we sort of materialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumerism,</v>

49
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all dovetail on that premise.</v>

50
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all,</v>

51
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.090
<v Speaker 1>it's real fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.220
<v Speaker 1>that's how you can have that chronic</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecological disrespect is because,</v>

53
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.870
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter what happens after</v>

54
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:34.760
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll be like,</v>

55
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about my fucking children?</v>

56
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Even just on a practical level of God</v>
<v Speaker 1>live on this fucking pebble in infinite</v>

57
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

58
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>And they'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're just like,</v>

59
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've not really thought about that.</v>

60
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.500
<v Speaker 1>And a sort of an inability to accept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>like certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know that you're sort of like a,</v>

62
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't wholesale by any dominant</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

63
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's clear to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know what I believe in on an</v>

64
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>individual level and on a cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

65
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>if something is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be trying to fucking do it.</v>

66
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as people realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a minute,</v>

67
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>that's having a negative impact or hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a bit of a way of using our</v>

68
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now utilities,</v>

69
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you realize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be moving towards it.</v>

70
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 1>They say wisdom is acting on knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you even recognize our fossil</v>

71
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>fuels are running out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

72
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Fucking it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd better start working on the basis</v>

73
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:18.154
<v Speaker 1>that we're fucked.</v>

74
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>We better start looking at alternative</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy stores is where look at different</v>

75
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>alliances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just say like knowing those things</v>

76
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>and not doing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes me very,</v>

77
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>very uneasy because it makes me think</v>
<v Speaker 1>who benefits from ignoring this stuff?</v>

78
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Who's running this show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he's having all of that,</v>

79
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's creating all this rage,</v>

80
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>all this unease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this fear in your country and in my</v>

81
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>country now times of great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great disease and uncertainty for people</v>

82
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:48.631
<v Speaker 1>really looking for something and know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these institutions are just saying,</v>

83
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:49.571
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>carry on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no sort of alternative.</v>

85
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one now is going to see himself as</v>

86
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>part of a religious community in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way or a sort of one of the dead</v>

87
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>ideologies of the last century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and meanwhile we're in this sort of</v>

88
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>peculiar state of looming crisis that</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels kind of fucking mad.</v>

89
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're definitely in a state of looming</v>

90
00:04:06.861 --> 00:04:08.540
<v Speaker 2>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to unpack this whole thing,</v>

91
00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:12.560
<v Speaker 2>you started off with this idea of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened the Tuesday before the Big Bang</v>

92
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.300
<v Speaker 2>and how science can't really answer</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

93
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't answer it yet.</v>

94
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is once they gather more</v>

95
00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:20.900
<v Speaker 2>data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be a hundred years now or a</v>

96
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.560
<v Speaker 2>thousand years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can say,</v>

97
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well here we've done the calculations</v>

98
00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:27.350
<v Speaker 2>and we understand now that it's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite cycle of birth and death and</v>

99
00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:29.720
<v Speaker 2>the universe is constantly expanding and</v>
<v Speaker 2>contracting.</v>

100
00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:31.370
<v Speaker 2>And this is the process that we're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of.</v>

101
00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.490
<v Speaker 2>It's infinite and it's never started it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never ending.</v>

102
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.870
<v Speaker 2>And it goes on and on and on.</v>

103
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Often you'll probably bloody right mate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that idea that you just espoused</v>

104
00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:44.540
<v Speaker 1>is in 5,000 year old fucking documents</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the upanishads.</v>

105
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are like,</v>

106
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.380
<v Speaker 1>those ideas are there already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we fucked off religion a hundred</v>

107
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.400
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was causing too much,</v>

108
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our sake,</v>

109
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.660
<v Speaker 1>we got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kicked out of some of the items that</v>

110
00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:56.570
<v Speaker 1>are only now just being discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

111
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 2>These are just to be contemplated right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now and to be considered where a science</v>

112
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:04.900
<v Speaker 2>is trying to find definitive evidence</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they do or don't represent the</v>

113
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 2>reality of our timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once they do,</v>

114
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 2>then they'll be able to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But right now what they're doing is</v>

115
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 2>they're examining the evidence that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>big bang exists and what could have</v>

116
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 2>possibly caused that.</v>

117
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

118
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>see what my difficulty is is that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

119
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 1>that is when any ideology behaves</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogmatically and prohibitively like</v>

120
00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:29.700
<v Speaker 1>previous like prevents further</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration,</v>

121
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.300
<v Speaker 1>whatever would like what kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's an example of the nature of</v>

122
00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:36.720
<v Speaker 1>consciousness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows why consciousness impacts</v>

123
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.780
<v Speaker 1>matter in the way it does in the sub</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum world.</v>

124
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't fucking,</v>

125
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.690
<v Speaker 1>we've come to a point he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>

126
00:05:42.691 --> 00:05:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Like you know like if you would like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

127
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 1>that the famous double slit theory that</v>
<v Speaker 1>an observed particle behaves</v>

128
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.730
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the end of the park on wave can</v>

129
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.820
<v Speaker 1>change it as the central nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on where he's been obsessed</v>

130
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.610
<v Speaker 1>represented</v>

131
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>though when it's been explained to me by</v>
<v Speaker 2>people actually understand it.</v>

132
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 2>What it really is is that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>measuring these particles and in the act</v>

133
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 2>of measuring you're changing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>

134
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're using something to</v>

135
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:07.530
<v Speaker 2>measure it.</v>

136
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

137
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it gets represented as all this woo</v>

138
00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:13.150
<v Speaker 2>woo craziness.</v>

139
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>But what I think is interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

140
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.370
<v Speaker 1>is somewhere between this woowoo</v>
<v Speaker 1>craziness and that kind of a flat,</v>

141
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>mundane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low.</v>

142
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 1>This is life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're born,</v>

143
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 1>you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat food,</v>

144
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 1>shit comes out your asshole territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere in there is a mystery that</v>

145
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 1>they're behind your eyes buying Jimbo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's eyes and my eyes.</v>

146
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.770
<v Speaker 1>There is a constant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is this consciousness,</v>

147
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>there is this awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this inexplicably experience</v>

148
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:44.411
<v Speaker 1>that you've add on dmt experiences that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had through yoga and through lsd.</v>

149
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 1>That suggests to me that consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself is the dominant force.</v>

150
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness is not just one more</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena is the seat of all phenomena</v>

151
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.920
<v Speaker 1>and when people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

152
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>there's this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's God.</v>

153
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.900
<v Speaker 1>What they are saying is there is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute consciousness and all is</v>

154
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 1>contained within it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All matter at some point has come from</v>

155
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These realms,</v>

156
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 1>they're experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true psychedelic or extreme extreme,</v>

157
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal experiments like your cryogenic</v>

158
00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 1>things or your flotation tanks all</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest a phenomenon beyond the</v>

159
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:16.070
<v Speaker 1>individual consciousness.</v>

160
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.110
<v Speaker 1>They something else there and the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that it's in for the,</v>

161
00:07:20.111 --> 00:07:22.820
<v Speaker 1>the consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even by the process of measuring,</v>

162
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.090
<v Speaker 1>even by the process of measuring is</v>
<v Speaker 1>influencing and impacting rally.</v>

163
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:26.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm not taking that to the extreme so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what you mean.</v>

165
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Make some people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that means your mind can control</v>

166
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:31.731
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

167
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it means that it means that</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is only reality when you look at</v>

168
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:38.960
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when it's kind of getting towards</v>

169
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 1>a bloody good book that I reckon your</v>
<v Speaker 1>listeners will be banging into is called</v>

170
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 1>buyer centuries in by a man called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Lanza who he did the best</v>

171
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 1>breakdown I've ever read of that double</v>
<v Speaker 1>slit experiment and a and of the,</v>

172
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.501
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

173
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>made me understand for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that reality is happening within your</v>

175
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>own consciousness.</v>

176
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not an external phenomena at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

177
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:00.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Hebrew explained in very ways that</v>

178
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I could understand of like he went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.510
<v Speaker 1>you sort of think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks I'm totally mundane.</v>

180
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 1>He went like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the experience of going in your</v>

181
00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:09.290
<v Speaker 1>kitchen in the night and turn in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>light on.</v>

182
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Is your kitchen fridge still there when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go back downstairs?</v>

183
00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:13.190
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

184
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.820
<v Speaker 1>I guess when you do go in your kitchen</v>
<v Speaker 1>in turn the light on,</v>

185
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 1>he goes see a foa on parcels of photons</v>
<v Speaker 1>come down,</v>

186
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:21.040
<v Speaker 1>they'd interact with the optic nerve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they re trends low,</v>

187
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:23.070
<v Speaker 1>they invert eating your consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>

188
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whatever it is,</v>

189
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:26.150
<v Speaker 1>it's in your kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're not looking at it,</v>

190
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.470
<v Speaker 1>it ain't the same as when you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at is an interpretive reality.</v>

191
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.410
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways that I've sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduced this down for my own simple</v>

192
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:36.770
<v Speaker 1>understanding is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if none of us had a sense of smell,</v>

193
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:38.210
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I then Jamie didn't.</v>

194
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>And then well how would the concept of</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell makes sense?</v>

195
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:42.200
<v Speaker 1>How would you go up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's paint,</v>

196
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:44.840
<v Speaker 1>there's bacon with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of us would have the instrument to</v>

197
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 1>receive it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that whole thing would be off the</v>

198
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:50.150
<v Speaker 1>agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that there are streams of</v>

199
00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:53.690
<v Speaker 1>energy streams of data for which we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>not have the instruments to receive.</v>

200
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:57.720
<v Speaker 1>So we totally it because we simply don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the instruments to receive it.</v>

201
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>And I said once it in most startup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a matter of fact,</v>

202
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 1>like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my cat doesn't know there's an internet.</v>

203
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.450
<v Speaker 1>The internet does not enter the realm of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my cats consciousness,</v>

204
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 1>but the fucking internet is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're out here having with these fucking</v>

205
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>experiences and like all those realms</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're experiencing in these various</v>

206
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 1>sort of psychedelic states or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however they were achieved is an</v>

207
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:17.340
<v Speaker 1>indication to me there's another reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

208
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 1>where does that become fucking relevant</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what we're talking about?</v>

209
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it does,</v>

210
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:25.230
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the continual ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps remerge reemerging to connect us</v>

211
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 1>back to where we were with Joe Campbell</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning is there is this</v>

212
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:32.520
<v Speaker 1>fucking sense of oneness and believing</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves to be individual and believing</v>

213
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 1>that the dominant thing in our lives to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be material that fucks us up because</v>

214
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 1>people will kill each other over that</v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

215
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.860
<v Speaker 1>And once we sort of realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

216
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:43.230
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the true thing about us is the</v>

217
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:45.720
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is the inner self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the roofing.</v>

218
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:47.190
<v Speaker 1>They were all out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all in the game.</v>

219
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 1>We're all going to do shit and we're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna make mistakes.</v>

220
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.960
<v Speaker 1>But that's not have the material idea as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominant social idea cause that</v>

221
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:56.460
<v Speaker 1>everyone's agreed with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're communist or capitalist</v>

222
00:09:56.461 --> 00:09:58.110
<v Speaker 1>or fascist or whatever everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

223
00:09:58.111 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Now the main thing is this shit this out</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

224
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 1>And it's like that connects to those</v>
<v Speaker 1>primal drives.</v>

225
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Cause we know that if that's happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your sexual drive,</v>

226
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 1>you can never have enough pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that gets into your status drive,</v>

227
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 1>you can never have enough space and</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

228
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like we're all going to still feel</v>

229
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:13.680
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still going to be a 25 times a day,</v>

230
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 1>but it'd be nice if the cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambiance was,</v>

231
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.010
<v Speaker 1>oh don't worry Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be back to your normal self in a</v>

232
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.670
<v Speaker 1>minute of feeling that we're all one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all connected,</v>

233
00:10:22.671 --> 00:10:23.221
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

234
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Well of course I feel like that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what frightens me about the</v>

235
00:10:27.301 --> 00:10:31.800
<v Speaker 1>culture of our countries at the moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's endorsing the worst aspects of</v>

236
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 1>our nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a culturating the worst aspects of</v>

237
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:37.350
<v Speaker 1>our nature instead of the best aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our nature.</v>

238
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:40.080
<v Speaker 1>And that for me then no fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between left and right in the</v>

239
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:42.900
<v Speaker 1>current political sphere because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all making the same argument.</v>

240
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.660
<v Speaker 1>They were all saying come and live out</v>
<v Speaker 1>here in the material world.</v>

241
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that the material world</v>

242
00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:53.180
<v Speaker 2>and this idea that we should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulating possessions and status and</v>

243
00:10:53.181 --> 00:10:56.810
<v Speaker 2>all these different things is universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It almost seems like it's a natural</v>

244
00:10:56.811 --> 00:11:01.811
<v Speaker 2>progression from ancient tribal</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization life to this weird city</v>

245
00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:06.140
<v Speaker 2>life to this integration of electronics</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our life in this symbiotic</v>

246
00:11:06.141 --> 00:11:09.770
<v Speaker 2>relationship that we have to computers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Internet and information itself.</v>

247
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.590
<v Speaker 2>It seems like this is one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that drives,</v>

248
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:15.770
<v Speaker 2>that is this desire for material</v>
<v Speaker 2>possessions because when you have a</v>

249
00:11:15.771 --> 00:11:19.070
<v Speaker 2>desire for material possessions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>ensures that you're going to continue to</v>

250
00:11:19.071 --> 00:11:21.860
<v Speaker 2>innovate and come up with newer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>greater and better because you always</v>

251
00:11:21.861 --> 00:11:24.290
<v Speaker 2>want to keep up with the Jones' is you</v>
<v Speaker 2>always want to have the newest tesla</v>

252
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:27.740
<v Speaker 2>cause it goes zero to 60 in two seconds</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you want to have the coolest fucking</v>

253
00:11:27.741 --> 00:11:30.440
<v Speaker 2>house with the biggest TV and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fastest internet and all those things</v>

254
00:11:30.441 --> 00:11:34.910
<v Speaker 2>sort of compound this technological</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation cycle that we're on.</v>

255
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.440
<v Speaker 2>So my thought has been for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what we are is some sort of</v>

256
00:11:39.441 --> 00:11:43.760
<v Speaker 2>electronic caterpillar that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>give birth some artificial life and that</v>

257
00:11:43.761 --> 00:11:46.940
<v Speaker 2>all of our desire for material</v>
<v Speaker 2>possessions and status and all these</v>

258
00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:51.941
<v Speaker 2>different things is really just us</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing for this electronic agenda and</v>

259
00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 2>that this innovation and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>construction of artificial intelligence</v>

260
00:11:56.831 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 2>that's inevitable is eventually going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the next stage of life.</v>

261
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.960
<v Speaker 2>And that word like huddling ourselves up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this sort of civilization cocoon and</v>

262
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 2>that boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of that cocoon is going to pop some</v>

263
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 2>sort of a god being and that this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're here for and this is what</v>

264
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 2>we've been doing since we're a monkey's</v>
<v Speaker 2>flinging shit at each other and flipping</v>

265
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 2>over cow patties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for mushrooms,</v>

266
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.680
<v Speaker 2>that we are a part of a process and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it objectively,</v>

267
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:25.060
<v Speaker 2>all these traps that you or I or Tom</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cruise or Jim breuer been caught up in</v>

268
00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 2>when whether it's traps of ego or</v>
<v Speaker 2>jealousy,</v>

269
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 2>all these things sort of ensure</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

270
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.280
<v Speaker 2>They insure movement and ensure</v>
<v Speaker 2>interactivity and that is going to</v>

271
00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:37.570
<v Speaker 2>ensure innovation and progress and</v>
<v Speaker 2>competition and all those things that</v>

272
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:38.560
<v Speaker 2>even we look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we go,</v>

273
00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:40.240
<v Speaker 2>this is so pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so foolish,</v>

274
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.250
<v Speaker 2>but yet it's so incredibly prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Glorifying it or saying it's</v>

275
00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:47.380
<v Speaker 2>definitely the way to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but objectively,</v>

276
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 2>if you weren't a human and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>stepping outside of this thing,</v>

277
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:51.070
<v Speaker 2>looking at it from a distance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

278
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.760
<v Speaker 2>these fuckers are making something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might not even know they're making</v>

279
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:54.960
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

280
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.530
<v Speaker 1>That's they're making concern just hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the same way that bees or ants may</v>

281
00:12:58.531 --> 00:13:02.100
<v Speaker 1>not be aware of their hive consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that and the common drive.</v>

282
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.720
<v Speaker 1>But where I disagree with you Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

283
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.700
<v Speaker 1>that you see the end point as being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>materialization of a superconsciousness</v>

284
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.240
<v Speaker 1>through technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see the end point is being a</v>

285
00:13:15.241 --> 00:13:18.460
<v Speaker 1>realization amongst us as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know that they're now,</v>

286
00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.470
<v Speaker 1>it could be both and there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

287
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.490
<v Speaker 1>there is no reason to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

288
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are just another fucking,</v>

289
00:13:23.101 --> 00:13:24.840
<v Speaker 1>are we just another species on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet?</v>

290
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will know better than dogs and cows</v>

291
00:13:26.521 --> 00:13:27.450
<v Speaker 1>and monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

292
00:13:27.451 --> 00:13:27.780
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

293
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:28.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can,</v>

294
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 1>how certain we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the path,</v>

295
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.940
<v Speaker 1>the very sun that heats us up has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespan.</v>

296
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are their inventions as well?</v>

297
00:13:34.561 --> 00:13:35.700
<v Speaker 1>The cats and the monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

298
00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm fuck they invented being cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

299
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.250
<v Speaker 1>they're the real darling in your lap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pet them.</v>

300
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.200
<v Speaker 1>They need to find contribution</v>
<v Speaker 1>contributing cause the dog for a walk.</v>

301
00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:48.210
<v Speaker 1>You come up with good ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas smelly.</v>

302
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:49.460
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fair enough.</v>

303
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I do love my dog bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on.</v>

304
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my,</v>

305
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.240
<v Speaker 1>what was my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was my point there?</v>

306
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.103
<v Speaker 1>God</v>

307
00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.910
<v Speaker 2>breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're saying is we should pump the</v>

308
00:13:59.911 --> 00:14:01.740
<v Speaker 2>brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should pump the brakes of this</v>

309
00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:04.740
<v Speaker 2>possession and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea that we're trying to</v>

310
00:14:04.741 --> 00:14:08.940
<v Speaker 2>accomplish these great things by</v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulating things and status and it's</v>

311
00:14:08.941 --> 00:14:11.460
<v Speaker 2>all bullshit and it's really about</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness more than anything.</v>

312
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.570
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hicks I think already said it when</v>

313
00:14:13.571 --> 00:14:14.440
<v Speaker 1>he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

314
00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:16.180
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can be explicit,</v>

315
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.290
<v Speaker 1>we can explore space in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour together and peace.</v>

316
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea that if we look to our common</v>

317
00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.220
<v Speaker 1>drives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like into that hancock all the</v>

318
00:14:24.221 --> 00:14:26.560
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard him on your show saying like</v>

319
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:26.891
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:30.430
<v Speaker 1>that what really what's happening is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bias towards a particular aspect of our</v>

321
00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:33.190
<v Speaker 1>own consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem solving brain and like,</v>

322
00:14:33.191 --> 00:14:33.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

323
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.130
<v Speaker 1>that those drives are amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those jobs,</v>

324
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:38.860
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to get somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technology is amazing.</v>

325
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:39.371
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

326
00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 1>at the very fact that people bloody here</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

327
00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking wonderful.</v>

328
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.620
<v Speaker 1>But the dominant idea behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of profit,</v>

329
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 1>that dominating idea and like in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit in itself is not necessarily</v>

330
00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:53.300
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but profit at all costs.</v>

331
00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.520
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like really,</v>

332
00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying we should as a species</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking slow down and dressing felon</v>

333
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:59.601
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

334
00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:00.770
<v Speaker 1>like Graham and vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

335
00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.750
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want human beings to be glorious.</v>

336
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:05.540
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm saying is that our bias</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards this one particular I'm</v>

337
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:09.770
<v Speaker 1>materialistic idea is preventing us from</v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing that glory because part of our</v>

338
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:10.790
<v Speaker 1>consciousness has been ignored.</v>
