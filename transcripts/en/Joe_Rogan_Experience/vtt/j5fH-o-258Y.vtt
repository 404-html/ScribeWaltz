1
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.453
Hey,

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.060
what the fuck are relying upon is this legitimate [inaudible] ladies and

3
00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:15.190
gentlemen,
the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you today.
Uh,

4
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.620
today we have one of our regular sponsors,

5
00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:21.760
which is audible.com audible.com if you haven't used it.
Oh,
sweet.

6
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.420
Is um,
if you use the,
uh,

7
00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:28.540
website audible.com forward slash Joe,

8
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.930
it takes you to this website where it gives you free audible for 30 days and you

9
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:39.940
get a free audio book.
And uh,
if you've never used audio books,

10
00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:42.550
they're awesome for trips or for a lot of the same,

11
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.370
the same kind of shit where podcasts are awesome.
When you're a,

12
00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:48.460
you're just killing time.
Like if you're in a car on a plane,

13
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.780
a difference between a great podcast or a great audio book is the difference

14
00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:56.500
between a boring ass stupid fucking flight where you can't wait for it to be

15
00:00:56.501 --> 00:01:01.210
over.
And something where you're enjoying the book so much.

16
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.920
You don't even give a shit like you get come,

17
00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:07.921
I can get completely caught up in a audio book and like a four or five hour trip

18
00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:11.560
and that the time just flies by and I actually enjoy it.

19
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.280
It's like literally a difference between not liking something,

20
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.320
being like annoyed by something and actually enjoying it just because your time

21
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.140
is just sitting in a chair taking in this book.
Uh,

22
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.910
so it's great for commuting.
It's great for,
you know,
for the same things I said.

23
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.460
Again,
like podcasts are great for,
it's great for,
you know,
when,

24
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.710
if you just got to ride a bike for 40 minutes,
you know,

25
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:35.020
you're gonna get on a stationary bike just to do exercise.

26
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.260
That shit can be really boring.
But if you could do it like with you,

27
00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:42.310
there's some great music or a great audio book,
you can,
you know,

28
00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:44.170
you can kill that time a lot better.
It's a,

29
00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:47.680
it's a great way to get in some interesting information.
And again,

30
00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:52.030
if you go to the website,
um,
audible.com,
forward slash Joe,

31
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.560
they give you a 30 free days.
Look who I found on here.
Oh,

32
00:01:56.561 --> 00:02:00.370
the row apocalypse.
That's why our friend Daniel H.
Wilson and he's on the,

33
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.810
he's on the podcast today folks.
Um,
you can talk during any of this.

34
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.710
It doesn't,
it doesn't matter.
Yeah.
Um,
we,
um,

35
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.210
we're also brought to you by death squad.tv.
That's Brian's website.
If you,
uh,

36
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.440
if you want to like people always ask where to get these crazy cat tee shirts

37
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:18.460
that say desk squad on them.

38
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.700
These are all Brian's creations and you can get him on a desk,

39
00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:23.610
squad.tv and a,

40
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.530
the money goes to support his podcast now work as well,
which now has,
uh,

41
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.980
Kevin Pereira.
He has a new show called pointless on it.
Fucking awesome.

42
00:02:32.981 --> 00:02:36.220
Show Kevin prayers.
Our boy,
he's hilarious.
He's brilliant.

43
00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:38.650
He's a perfect guy for a fucking podcast.

44
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.660
We have bobcat on last night and he just finished up on a big foot.
Man.

45
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.130
Talked all about it.
You're going to love it,
dude.
I just like,

46
00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:47.530
Joe is going to freak out,
get it downloaded it on my phone.

47
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:50.060
But before I leave here,
I'm going to listen to it on the car home outside.

48
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.590
Love that.
You can just do that.
I just love this world that we live in.

49
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.380
You know that you could just do that.
I could just throw them on my phone,

50
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.240
you know,
over the Wifi to take a couple of go get my car.
Boom.

51
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:04.390
Listen to it all the way home.
We uh,
we live in awesome times.

52
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.750
It's as a fucking bad ass.
Don't tolerate boredom.
Yeah,

53
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:10.220
we don't tolerate it and you know,
and there's,

54
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.420
you don't tolerate ignorance anymore either.
Get,
get your shit together.
Stupid.

55
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.420
All right,
the fucking information is out there.

56
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.460
We're also sponsored by [inaudible] dot com it's o n n I t,
makers of new mood,

57
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:25.480
Alpha brain,
true tech sport shroom.
Tech Immune does too many things to list.

58
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.510
Now it gets silly if I tried to list all of them cause you're not really paying

59
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:32.590
attention anymore and just getting annoyed by me.
But a,
what on it is,

60
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.210
is a supplement company and nutrition and fitness supplement company.

61
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.160
I think that's the best way to describe it.

62
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.020
And what we're trying to do is just sell you the very best shit possible at very

63
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:47.610
reasonable rates.
Everything that we sell is literally the lead,

64
00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:50.950
the best quality supplements we can buy.
Whatever it is,

65
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:54.340
whatever we find the best quality hemp.
It's like,

66
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:56.200
it's more expensive than regular hand powder,

67
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.710
but it is the best shit is the highest protein ratio.

68
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.570
It tastes the best we have.

69
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:06.220
We mix it with raw cocoa and Maka and uh,
it's delicious.
Oh yeah.

70
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:10.840
That's a new thing we have is killer bee honey.
Uh,
yeah,
it's killer bee honey.

71
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:14.240
Why?
I Dunno.
Why not fucking scary.

72
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.490
Fuck yeah,
I dunno.
It's probably not even good for you.

73
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.990
You could get like the flux of evil bitches.
They're so evil,
those bs man.

74
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.240
But we uh,
we got there honey.
Ah,
we thanked him.
It's like a,

75
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.690
it's not some gangster honey.

76
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.870
Imagine if they smelled it and they came and fucked you up cause it was in your

77
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.460
cupboard.
Shit.

78
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.260
They're Telemis realized what this mother fucker's stealing all the bees trying

79
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:40.210
to fucking in the ass because you're just trying to meet you.

80
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:41.590
I don't think they would do that,
Brian.

81
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.200
They might think they're a little small for that,
but the idea that a,

82
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.130
they might come fuck you up cause you still there honey.
That's a possibility.

83
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:51.070
It's true.
Or it can make you a mine to,
there's two.
There's things.
Yeah,

84
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.210
I don't think it would do that.

85
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.780
I think you have to actually get venom the honey and the Venom Martin related.

86
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.210
If you get a little bit of Venom,
I think you get used to it,
right?

87
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:02.940
Isn't that what happens?
It's getting scary.
Scary.

88
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.800
What's scary,
dude?
Don't be scared.
They're just a little bs.

89
00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:10.660
You smack them out of the sky.
I really don't think you have to worry.

90
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.260
I think we're talking with grading ignorance,
Brian.
So don't be scared.

91
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:18.460
It's just honey.
These fucking bees have no idea that you have this honey.

92
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.430
They're stupid as fuck.
They don't know about jars.

93
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.220
I don't know about none of that shit.

94
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.290
When they all work together and spin the wheel,
dude,

95
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:29.770
you do not have to worry about that cap off.
Get yourself some vitamin sons,

96
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.170
Alpha brain,
throw down some kettlebells and get all manly.
Um,

97
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.890
if you want to buy kettlebells,

98
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:39.580
we have the best quality kettle bells that we can sell the cheapest possible

99
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:41.410
rates.
It's a,

100
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.320
it's a like a very problematic thing to sell kettle bells,
you know,

101
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.760
to be a small company and try to sell them because it's all about the shipping.

102
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:53.680
You're,
you're sending these giant steel balls in the mail and,
but we're,
we're,

103
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:56.980
we're getting the best quality shit.
When you buy your,

104
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.200
you don't ever have to replace it.
They last forever.

105
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:04.130
At least the fucking things are amazingly well made and there's some of the best

106
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:08.990
workouts you can ever do as far as functional strength and fitness as far as,

107
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:12.590
uh,
the ability to apply it in sports and athletics.

108
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.960
I think the kettle bells are the best.
I think it's,
uh,

109
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.550
one of my favorite things to do.

110
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.950
You don't really need like that much exercise equipment.

111
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.480
You can do body weight squats,
Chin ups and Kettlebell exercises and it's like,

112
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.010
it's really almost all you need.

113
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.220
If you want to be a bad motherfucker like Brian Red van,

114
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.690
aren't you Kettlebell and Brian?
No.

115
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.430
No candle to make sure my cat's not paying on my couch.
Right.
That's the really,

116
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:37.430
that's the hard thing in Brian's life.
Uh,

117
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:39.700
use the code named Rogan and save 10% off,

118
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.050
10% off any and all of the on it supplements.
All right.
You dirty bitches.

119
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.210
Jenny Wilson's here wanting to get down to business.

120
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:50.060
We're going to find about robots and shit and whether or not we should be

121
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:51.050
freaking out right now.

122
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.140
<v 2>Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

123
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.420
Powerful.
Daniel H.
Wilson.

124
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.330
<v 1>How are you a robotics expert?
He do,
uh,
it was it all in research for this book?</v>

125
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.340
Do you have a background in robotics?

126
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.500
<v 2>Yeah.
As a kid I got really into robots and then I,
uh,</v>

127
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.210
I studied computer science and then while I was doing that,

128
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:20.180
I found out that instead of just programming computers,

129
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.990
you could actually teach them how to learn the answer on their own artificial

130
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:24.620
intelligence.

131
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.620
So when I saw it like that there was science fiction that you could study for

132
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:33.890
real,
uh,
the nerd in me really went for it.
I mean it was really,

133
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:36.800
it was exactly like if you're playing a role playing game and you have a

134
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:39.080
character sheet and you're picking the skills.

135
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.310
I saw roboticist and I said,
oh well I'll love lump in that.

136
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.940
I think that that would be great.
So it was just like you,

137
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.900
you had a dream job as a little kid and you just got lucky that it was an actual

138
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:54.860
real job.
Yeah,
basically.
I mean like I like science fiction.
I like the science.

139
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.300
And then whenever I got,

140
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.530
when I finished this computer science thing and I didn't want to,
I think,

141
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.320
forget going into the real world and get a job screen.
So fuck that.

142
00:08:03.321 --> 00:08:05.460
I went to Grad school and studied robotics.
Uh,

143
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.750
and when I finished that I started writing books about robots.
Wow,

144
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.460
that's awesome.
Um,
this book that you wrote,
robot apocalypse,
is that what it is?

145
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.990
Yeah.
This is going to get turned into a movie.
Yeah.
Scare the fuck out of people,

146
00:08:17.991 --> 00:08:19.970
man.
You know,
I've had,

147
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.020
I've had this describe to me at from very credible sources as saving private

148
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:28.310
Ryan with the robots.
It's going to be fucking intense.

149
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.550
Is this something that you

150
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.470
<v 1>just wrote about it because it's a fascinating piece of,</v>

151
00:08:34.471 --> 00:08:39.471
of fiction to pursue or is this something that you think is actually possible?

152
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.101
Do you,

153
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:44.030
do you ever consider the idea that robots could try to take over the earth?
Well,

154
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.391
<v 2>man,</v>

155
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:47.900
I have really mixed feelings about this because like I spent all this time with

156
00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:49.940
roboticists,
we're building robots,

157
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:54.050
we all had our own research and we're definitely trying to help people.

158
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.160
None of us were evil

159
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.270
<v 3>that I knew of,
you know?</v>

160
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.810
And so then I go and I get done and I write this book were were robots are like

161
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:01.860
killing everybody,
you know,

162
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.750
so I made it as realistic as I could based on everything I know.

163
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.950
So there are no robust amount of space,
there's no time travel.

164
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:14.860
There's this is all based on stuff that we either have already or we're gonna

165
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.540
have soon.
So it's the most realistic version of that I could come up with.

166
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:22.920
But that said,
I don't really think that the robots are going to,

167
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:23.870
you know,

168
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.720
join together under a sentience artificial intelligence and then try to wipe us

169
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:30.840
out as a species.
I always wonder,

170
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.670
because I always felt like there was certain things that the instincts that

171
00:09:35.671 --> 00:09:39.690
human beings had that lead us to war and lead us to,
um,

172
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.070
to feats of ego and craziness and psychosis.
And I always felt the day we're a,

173
00:09:45.071 --> 00:09:48.180
a lot of them were wrapped around breeding around the,

174
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:53.181
the necessary things that need to be in place in order to reinforce the idea

175
00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:58.860
that there's con it's competition to breed and that these things wouldn't exist

176
00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:01.080
in a computer because it,
it wouldn't need them.

177
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.340
It wouldn't be inherent to the system.
The same way greed and ego.

178
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:10.341
It was almost inherent to the human system to promote sexual conquest or tour to

179
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.800
promote competition.
Yeah.

180
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:16.710
I mean if you look at any of us that are sitting here that are alive,

181
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.910
you've got to think that every single one of our ancestors by hook or by Crook,

182
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:24.510
they live long enough to make babies.
You have to keep the babies say,

183
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.170
and so you don't get,
you don't make it that long.

184
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.200
Like 200,000 years of Homo sapiens without being a bad ass.

185
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.140
Right?
Anybody that was a little too soft,
they're not here.
You know,
they didn't,

186
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.970
they didn't make babies.
And so that is a part of our DNA,
literally,
you know,

187
00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:44.520
as human beings.
And the thing about building robots is,

188
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.820
I mean you can make them any way you want,
right?

189
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.000
If you want to build a robot that's going to have a self present,

190
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:53.440
a sense of self preservation,
you can do that.
You know,
that's,

191
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.290
well there was also the crazy thought that in this pursuit,

192
00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:01.990
this mad pursuit of success that a,

193
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.900
that pushes people to do war and pushes people to,
uh,

194
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.760
to for with great feats of Ego,
this,

195
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:14.780
it's almost like that's necessary to ensure that there's some form of

196
00:11:16.231 --> 00:11:20.140
competition to make things move in the right direction to do that.

197
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.130
But that doesn't seem like that would be inherent in a computer system.

198
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.530
I think they do,
she human behavior,

199
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.550
like we shouldn't think that it would like say,
oh,

200
00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:32.490
we've got to wipe out all of these people we have to take over and wipe out all

201
00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:36.360
these people.
It doesn't even seem like it would have like a desire to compete.

202
00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.610
See,
see,
here's the deal.
Like human beings,

203
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.540
I feel like we've got all this machinery that's in place has been for a long

204
00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:45.330
time because it works,
right?
There's a reason we're all still alive.

205
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.160
And so we have a nature,
we have a human nature that we can't change.

206
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:54.340
And sometimes it pushes us to do terrible things in to survive or,

207
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.360
or you know this,
like you're talking about conquest and that's scary,
right?

208
00:11:58.361 --> 00:12:02.590
That were each of us fighting against sort of a dark nature and we've all got

209
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:04.480
the potential to have a good nature.

210
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.830
I think what's even more scary than that is that a robot can be a total blank

211
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:11.530
slate.
Let's say you tell a robot to solve a problem.

212
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.470
You tell it to get from point a to point B.
Well,

213
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.000
if that involves like stepping on babies,
a robot doesn't have any nature,

214
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:20.800
it doesn't have any instinct.
It'll do that.

215
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:25.750
It'll commit in an amoral way without any good or evil associated with it.

216
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.630
It can commit atrocities,
you know?
And that's pretty scary.
I mean,

217
00:12:29.631 --> 00:12:33.460
that means you gotta be careful whenever you build these things.
Yeah,
that's,

218
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.880
you mean you can build into it.
Please avoid humans,
avoid,
you know,

219
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.650
unnecessary loss of human life.
But at a,
at a certain point in time,

220
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:46.480
if you're gonna use like one of those for war,
like we're kind of doing with,

221
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.840
with drones.
I mean that's kind of essentially what a drone is,
right?

222
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:53.500
It's like a robot that flies.
Yeah.
Drone has a lot of autonomy.

223
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:55.870
It makes some decisions on its own,
but there's,

224
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.900
but they're not pulling the trigger themselves.
I don't think they're doing that.

225
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.460
There are,
by the way,

226
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.940
people get all upset about drones and autonomous weapons have been around for

227
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.070
four decades and decades.
I mean the very first drone,

228
00:13:09.071 --> 00:13:13.150
I think they use it in the Korean War,
so you know,
and then Vietnam,

229
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:16.570
they had them,
now they're getting cheap cause we've got the cheap sensors,

230
00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:19.180
cheap processing.
Well that was one of the,
uh,

231
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:24.270
part particulars in operation Northwoods I think was that they were going to use

232
00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:28.780
a drone jetliner and we're going to blow it up and blamed the Cubans.

233
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.690
Cubans blew up a Atlanta and back then they could just like fucking change your

234
00:13:34.691 --> 00:13:38.360
life.
You now Joe Hill and you live in Montgomery,
Alabama.
No,

235
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:42.540
you just moved there.
You know,
and they uh,
that was,

236
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.430
they had drones back then,
which is,
that's nuts.

237
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.500
That's like 1962 or something like that.
61 whatever it was.
Yeah.

238
00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:52.390
You just load up a vehicle with a,

239
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:55.690
with a bunch of explosives and a rock on the gas pedal.
I mean that's,

240
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.750
I wonder if they knew how to land them or they just knew how to take them off.

241
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.820
I wonder,
you know what I mean?
It's a drone like jumbo jet.
I wonder,

242
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.880
I wonder what they actually knew how to do back then if they could actually land

243
00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:10.540
it at.
One thing I've always wondered is if you're driving a drone all day,

244
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.720
you know,
and you're like,
are the,
the human being that does pull the trigger?

245
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:18.640
Like wouldn't it be nicer for the government to put like a big black sensor bar

246
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.030
like over it before you see all the little people get turned into chunks of meat

247
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.330
just for your own sanity?
I don't think we'll do,

248
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:29.890
they look at it through that night vision,
that thermal stuff.
Right.
Dude,

249
00:14:29.891 --> 00:14:34.190
that's weird to watch this video for you.
The crazy thing is you,

250
00:14:34.191 --> 00:14:38.770
you hear the guys,
they speak so clinically,
right?
They're like,
okay,

251
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.090
engage target dude to Duke.

252
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.560
And it sounded like airline pilots and then they pull that trigger and you,
uh,

253
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.270
you hear the guns firing cause you're there inside the Apache helicopter,

254
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:52.190
whatever.
And then it actually like five seconds

255
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.990
<v 2>for the bullets to go like two miles and then all the little people start flying</v>

256
00:14:56.991 --> 00:15:01.460
around.
It's pretty crazy.
It was bizarre.
It's bizarre.
I mean,

257
00:15:01.461 --> 00:15:05.000
it's just the weirdest way of eliminating people.
I mean,

258
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:08.600
it's so clinical and it's so detached,
you know?

259
00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:12.680
It's like weird.
You know,
we're killing people from like a mile away.

260
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.050
What's a landmine though,
right?
I mean,
a landmine is basically a robot,
right?

261
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.310
To define robots.
When people ask me,

262
00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:23.450
I always say it's any kind of mechanical artifact that senses the environment,

263
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.890
thinks about what to do and an ax on its own and does the whole sense think,
act,

264
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:29.630
deal.
And that's what a landmine does.

265
00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:33.840
It sits around and senses think weights on a human whenever a human steps on it

266
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.700
thinks,
makes a simple decision to explode.
Wow.

267
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.190
Yeah.

268
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.230
How many of those are loud on through a bunch of round from like the Vietnam

269
00:15:43.231 --> 00:15:45.500
more that's,
they still haven't detonated yet.

270
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.890
I don't think the United States is allowed.
I don't think,

271
00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:52.700
I think they're outlawed on it and I'm pretty sure that we conform to that and

272
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.770
most circumstances.
But yeah,
there's a ton of them that are left and,

273
00:15:55.771 --> 00:16:00.460
and there's not just land mines,
right?
There's uh,
there's underwater mines for,

274
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:01.520
for submarines,
right.

275
00:16:01.521 --> 00:16:04.880
So they hang out on the bottom of the ocean and they are able to,

276
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:08.680
this is what's interesting.
They do,
these are old too.
These are from the 60s the,

277
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.650
they can target nuclear submarines and these land mines are complicated as shit.

278
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.910
So they sit there and they listened for the acoustic signature of whatever comes

279
00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:21.050
past and then they identify what type of craft it is based on that.

280
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:25.130
They choose different like loitering strategies about how to follow it and how

281
00:16:25.131 --> 00:16:27.590
to get close enough to detonate.
And then they,

282
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.380
then they chase and then they eventually explode.

283
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.710
Like they do all this stuff targeting,
oh my God.
But,

284
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.550
and some of them are still down there and there's some areas like we're

285
00:16:37.551 --> 00:16:41.450
submarines can't go,
I imagine,
but I'm not an expert on that.
But you know,

286
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.620
I've read about all these,
all this equipment.
I mean it's,
it's cool stuff.

287
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.300
The landmines are crazy.

288
00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:50.630
The idea that you're just going to go to war with anything that touches these

289
00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:54.890
things and just blow them up like that.
That would be an ethical idea.

290
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.690
So now in order to make a more ethical,
they are trying to come up there.

291
00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.040
There are lots of new landmines right that I've read about.

292
00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:03.770
Like the self healing minefield is one of my favorites.

293
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:07.820
So it's a mind field where the landmines can,
can locomote a little bit.

294
00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:11.210
So you spread them out and then if something comes through they basically set up

295
00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:12.320
a local area network.

296
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.220
So each landmine kind of has like basically Wifi and they're talking to each

297
00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:18.740
other so they kind of know where each other are at.

298
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:20.570
Then if some of them get blown up,

299
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.370
other ones are able to like hop and they just do these little hops until they

300
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.430
make the,
until the evenly distribute themselves again.

301
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.060
And so then you've got this,
what they call a self healing minefield,

302
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.460
but that's nothing compared to the crab mines.

303
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.450
The ones that are designed to be dropped off shore and they've got crab legs and

304
00:17:38.451 --> 00:17:43.220
they scuttled up the a on the bottom of the ocean,
up to the,
uh,
up through the,

305
00:17:43.221 --> 00:17:46.730
the beach basically,
and then on to land.
And that's how you mind,

306
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:51.690
like those walking mine or bombs from Mario brothers.
Exactly.

307
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:56.780
Another example of video games here,
dude,
dude,
dude,

308
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.010
don't want to get hit by a turtle shell.
What happens?

309
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.710
These crabs go in the water and they run up onto the beach.
Yeah,
I mean,

310
00:18:04.711 --> 00:18:09.420
it's a good example of,
of what they call biomimetics.
So how big are they?
Well,

311
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:13.860
they're about the size of a,
of a crab.
I mean,
and I don't know if the,
I mean,

312
00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:17.610
I've seen a descriptions of that.
I don't,
I've never seen a real one of those.

313
00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:19.440
And I don't think those are really in use.

314
00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:23.730
But it's a great example of if you want to build a machine that's going to

315
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.600
operate in a certain environment,
you think of the environment as a problem,

316
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.260
right?

317
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.100
The problem is how do you locomote on the bottom of the ocean and the pounding

318
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:36.540
surf.
Uh,
how do you do that?
Well,
there are answers to all these problems.

319
00:18:36.541 --> 00:18:40.200
They're animals,
right?
A lobster is the answer to that problem.

320
00:18:40.201 --> 00:18:41.880
A crab is the answer to that problem.

321
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.200
And so you go and you study the animals and then,
uh,

322
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.960
you've baked take the basic principles about how they locomote and how they do

323
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:52.140
whatever,
and then you distill them down your stick them into a robot.

324
00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:54.480
So no matter where you want to go,

325
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.300
there's usually a solution to that problem in the form of an animal

326
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.170
<v 3>that you could study.</v>

327
00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.930
And I push up my glasses on to by dose.
She,
Jesus,

328
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:09.150
the idea that you could make like a million little robot mine crabs and just

329
00:19:09.151 --> 00:19:10.410
unleash them on a beach.

330
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.020
<v 2>That's like the third chapter of Robo pocalypse really?
Well,
hell yeah.</v>

331
00:19:14.021 --> 00:19:16.990
That's too cool not to put into a book.
Right?
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

332
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.050
I got this part where they're all walking across Boston,

333
00:19:20.051 --> 00:19:22.840
like they're walking across this plaza and there's,
spoiler alert,

334
00:19:22.841 --> 00:19:25.030
they sense vibration to their feet.
Right.

335
00:19:25.031 --> 00:19:27.130
And so that whenever they sense the vibration,

336
00:19:27.131 --> 00:19:29.920
they raised their little feet up in the air and that they all kind of do it at a

337
00:19:29.921 --> 00:19:32.740
pet.
You know,
I don't know what's going to be in this movie,

338
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.210
but there are some things that,
God,
I just,
I just want to see it.

339
00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.150
<v 3>That's awesome man.
Wow.
I can't wait to read it.</v>

340
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.380
When you wrote this,
was,
is this like something that was,

341
00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.520
was in your head for a while before you wrote it?
Yeah,
man,

342
00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.380
these are ideas that I've just been sort of percolating around for a really long

343
00:19:50.381 --> 00:19:50.870
time.

344
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.600
<v 2>My first book with how to survive a robot uprising,</v>

345
00:19:53.601 --> 00:19:58.550
I was just making fun of all the Hollywood bs where robots are killing,
you know,

346
00:19:58.551 --> 00:20:02.630
I specifically made fun of like stuff I love like the Matrix and Terminator of

347
00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:05.730
course,
they love it.
I'm thinking about it.
Right.
But,
uh,
then I tell you,

348
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:10.370
I kind of went to the dark side,
you know,
wrote that,
wrote that.
It's fiction,

349
00:20:10.371 --> 00:20:13.670
you know,
science fiction,
killer robots.
There's sexy man.

350
00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:18.170
They got biblical themes built in like they make for great drama.

351
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.720
<v 3>Do you,
um,
look at the idea of uh,</v>

352
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:26.830
technology and robots as like a life form that human beings are responsible for

353
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:32.600
igniting and starting in the world?
Marshall Mcluhan,
I think it was,

354
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.540
someone just told me this quote the other day,
it's brilliant quote.

355
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.380
He said that humans are the sex organs of machines.

356
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.650
Like,
isn't that a beautiful quote?
There's ways of looking it.
I see.

357
00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:48.100
This is one

358
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.990
<v 2>thing that as a roboticist you have to do this,</v>

359
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:53.740
you have to look at a human being from a totally alien perspective,
right?

360
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.840
So like,
and I have a point,

361
00:20:55.841 --> 00:21:00.720
but like if you look at it like how to do speech recognition or some or f or g

362
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.760
emotion recognition from a robot's perspective,

363
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.680
we are just moving pieces of flesh around on our faces and to different

364
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:13.270
configurations.
And then that conveys some sort of inner chemicals.
I mean,

365
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.600
it's not intuitive.
It's not easy to figure out.

366
00:21:16.601 --> 00:21:21.601
And you can look at humankind as like all we do is we cover the earth in lawns.

367
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:27.850
We are slaves to grass,
right?
Like if it wasn't for us,
you know,

368
00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:30.610
grasp wouldn't really exist everywhere that it does.

369
00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:34.480
And so if you look at human beings from sort of these alien perspectives,

370
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.330
sometimes cool shit falls out.
And,

371
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:41.380
and some people do think that it's our destiny to create the next,

372
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.430
uh,
intelligent life form,
you know,
and to,
and to set it free.

373
00:21:45.431 --> 00:21:50.431
And then those people usually think that it's our turn to retire mom's more

374
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:54.170
event.
He says,
you know,
once we do this,
children of the mind,
right?

375
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.880
Once we make the robots,
then,
then,
then we're done.
We're finished.

376
00:21:57.881 --> 00:22:02.170
Like we achieved our goal.
I disagree.
It's so terrifying.

377
00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:05.710
But the idea that there's a reason why dinosaurs dinosaur isn't around anymore

378
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.940
because you know,
they,
they got wiped out.
Something better came along.

379
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.450
We like to think,
and it's called people now we're the new head of the planet,

380
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.090
but why would we think that we can hold the spot forever?

381
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.410
I mean it doesn't make any sense.

382
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.050
Well I think that we're going to evolve with our tools.

383
00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.250
Are we going to become a part of a computer or we going to become a symbiotic

384
00:22:24.251 --> 00:22:27.550
organism?
You know,
I just saw my,
I wrote a book about it.

385
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.380
It's called amped and it came out this year and it's basically,
yeah,

386
00:22:32.381 --> 00:22:36.460
it's about thinking about like what happens when we start integrating this

387
00:22:36.461 --> 00:22:38.840
technology into our own bodies and just on a,

388
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:43.240
not thinking about crazy science fiction far out stuff.

389
00:22:43.241 --> 00:22:47.500
Just thinking about right now what's really cool about this to me is that the

390
00:22:47.501 --> 00:22:52.210
people who are getting this are people that have real serious disabilities,

391
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:57.040
like two people who are willing to have a hole drilled in their skull and like a

392
00:22:57.041 --> 00:23:01.030
neural implant placed on the surface of their brain to improve their quality of

393
00:23:01.031 --> 00:23:04.870
life.
And it's not like Tony Stark,
you know,
or,

394
00:23:04.871 --> 00:23:06.870
or like rich kids or you know,

395
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.410
getting a leg up in school or where it's like the most vulnerable challenged

396
00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:16.411
people in our society are getting this technology and in and in some cases it's

397
00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:21.040
making them,
it's not bringing them back to normal.
It's taken them past normal.

398
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:25.360
And so people with disabilities are like becoming people with super abilities

399
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.740
and that's a pretty cool trend to watch.
Wow,
that's amazing.
Cause I mean,

400
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.870
what's it going to be like when you realize that hey,

401
00:23:31.871 --> 00:23:34.900
if you really do want to be the fastest sprinter on the planet,

402
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:39.430
you've got to cut your legs off because like there's just no way to do it.

403
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.170
Oh my God,

404
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:46.070
that hurts more being lucky enough to born.
You know why

405
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.240
<v 3>that hurts?
Because I know someone's going to do it.
That's,
you know,</v>

406
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.190
you think about,
you think about when you think someone's going to do it.

407
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:57.050
Armstrong and you know,
I dunno,
you mean Neil Armstrong?
No one on the moon

408
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.620
that lance got.
Well,
did you make that akin to hacking your legs off,

409
00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:06.470
taking performance enhancing drugs?
Well,
I think that's a little bit,

410
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.370
a little bit crazy.
Oh,
there's a leap,
right?
I mean there's definitely a leap,

411
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.870
which is you got to go back to go forward,
right?
Like because without the,

412
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.190
without performance enhancing drugs,
you're,

413
00:24:17.191 --> 00:24:21.140
you're still not like disabled.
Like Oscar Pistorius,

414
00:24:21.141 --> 00:24:24.200
he competed in the London 2012 Olympics.
Right.

415
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.030
The guy who has no legs below the knees,

416
00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:29.570
he ran alongside able bodied athletes on prosthetics,

417
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.110
like super advanced prosthetics.
If you take those prosthetics off of him,

418
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.160
he ain't going anywhere.
Right.
And that's a difference.
I mean,
if you,

419
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.710
if you take somebody off of performance enhancing drugs,

420
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.810
they're still capable of doing whatever it is that they were doing just slower

421
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:49.370
or not as well or,
or whatever.
Yeah.
It's,
it's an interesting thing,

422
00:24:49.371 --> 00:24:54.371
the performance enhancing drug thing because by keeping it secret and by hiding

423
00:24:56.271 --> 00:24:59.730
it in,
by sneaking around it,
what I mean,

424
00:24:59.731 --> 00:25:04.430
it take all the moral arguments out of it when it comes to like cheating and you

425
00:25:04.431 --> 00:25:08.210
know,
and achieving victory in unseemly methods,

426
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.070
most of you are willing to do that.

427
00:25:10.071 --> 00:25:12.020
They think that they have to do it in order to compete.

428
00:25:12.021 --> 00:25:15.320
They think there's hidden rules right in keeping with the hidden rules.

429
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:20.260
But I think it's also like really dishonest to the,
the actual,
um,

430
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:21.650
the issue becomes,

431
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:26.850
it's dis dishonest to the actual idea of human ability because human ability

432
00:25:27.591 --> 00:25:31.550
under these incredibly enhanced conditions is quite a bit more than regular,

433
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.350
a regular person's ability.

434
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:38.240
So we have these distorted perceptions of like records that had been achieved

435
00:25:38.241 --> 00:25:42.280
through,
you know,
through uh,
we just,
we,
we need to know,
I mean if,

436
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.190
if we're going to all this side that they're going to take looking for bedrock,

437
00:25:46.191 --> 00:25:50.090
we want like that definition of human,
straight up,
natural human.

438
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:53.880
I want to compare myself to Babe Ruth and have that shit be,
you know,

439
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.680
a straight comparison.
It gets to be,

440
00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:01.550
to be a weird situation when you've got a bunch of people introducing all these

441
00:26:01.551 --> 00:26:05.990
alien things into the body and eventually it probably will be parts.

442
00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:08.900
It probably will be.
That's why this is scaring me so much.

443
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:12.290
When you said that at some thinking to someone actually chopping their legs off

444
00:26:12.291 --> 00:26:15.980
and giving themselves robot legs?
Well I,
you know,
I don't,
uh,

445
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.720
somebody would fucking do it and have you,

446
00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:20.330
there's a cool book called machine man by Max very,

447
00:26:20.331 --> 00:26:23.030
which I love any book that's from the written one of the,

448
00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.800
from the perspective of like an autistic person because a person with aspergers,

449
00:26:27.801 --> 00:26:30.920
you know,
the,
the,
the,
cause if you read books that are from those perspectives,

450
00:26:30.921 --> 00:26:33.810
they tend to be really Hemingway ask like this short sentences,

451
00:26:33.811 --> 00:26:36.020
they're easy to read.
I really liked him.
But anyway,

452
00:26:36.021 --> 00:26:38.840
it was a book where that happens.
It's a good one machine man.

453
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:43.930
But do you think that it would be as simple as we would engineer

454
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.330
<v 1>them so we could shut them off and that's how we can fill that gap?
Is that,
yeah.</v>

455
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:49.164
Is it possible?

456
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.650
<v 2>No,
I mean think about,
okay,
sure.
Think about that.
You shut them off.
I mean,</v>

457
00:26:52.651 --> 00:26:57.260
so if you have a robot that you know,

458
00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.900
you don't shut an elevator off whenever it's got like 20 people on it,

459
00:27:00.901 --> 00:27:05.490
it's a hundred stories up.
Like there,
there are circumstances where,
you know,

460
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:07.680
you have to have a,
what do they call it,

461
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:12.950
graceful failure or are graceful degradation or something where it needs to fail

462
00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:17.010
gracefully.
It can't just fail all at once.
Um,
so if you shut it down,

463
00:27:17.011 --> 00:27:20.610
it needs to shut down in stages so that it doesn't hurt people.
Um,
but yeah,

464
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:23.010
I think kill switches,
emergency stops,

465
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:27.950
those are a huge aspect of,
of building safe robots.
You know,

466
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.880
it's not the whole story.

467
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:36.190
<v 1>It seems like the real issue would be how much of the human ideal of life would</v>

468
00:27:38.151 --> 00:27:41.570
we program into it?
If you were going to engineer a life form,

469
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.960
which essentially you would be able to do if you had a robot and you turn this

470
00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.590
computer into some sort of a sentient being,
what,

471
00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:53.330
what aspects of the human psyche would you engineer it to it?

472
00:27:53.331 --> 00:27:55.670
Would you get an engineer into a sense of survival?

473
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.690
Would it be able to understand that that's illogical and override it?

474
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.900
And if it was,
you know,

475
00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.270
that strong and if you gave it some autonomy or would it just go with it?

476
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.690
<v 2>Yeah,
I,
you know,
the thing that's scary about this is there are,</v>

477
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:13.500
there are an infinite number of mines that you could really create.

478
00:28:13.501 --> 00:28:17.490
You could create totally alien minds that just meditate on,

479
00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:21.780
on things that we could never comprehend.
You know,
you could create mines.

480
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.040
I'm freaking everybody out,
freaking out,
totally freaking me out.

481
00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:30.870
I think there's some,
like there's some story I read where there's uh,
uh,
some,

482
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.720
well,
I wrote a,
actually I wrote a story where there was a,

483
00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.460
basically a robot that was designed to,

484
00:28:35.461 --> 00:28:39.180
to paint happy faces on things and then it goes nuts and runs a muck and it just

485
00:28:39.181 --> 00:28:43.530
paints happy faces on everything and it ends up destroying the universe,

486
00:28:43.531 --> 00:28:47.640
painting happy faces because that's the way it sees the world.
You know,
I think,

487
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.950
you know,
there are a lot of people who,
who think a lot about,
uh,
you know,

488
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.210
ray Kurtzweil for instances,

489
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.560
he's really obsessed with this idea that we're going to upload our brains into

490
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.810
machines.
Um,

491
00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:04.350
and that we will basically have a machine that simulates every neuron in your

492
00:29:04.351 --> 00:29:08.430
brain and then you'll live inside and you'll live forever inside the box.
Right.

493
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:13.350
Um,
that's a great example of,
of giving a human,

494
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.920
you know,
experience like a human life to,
uh,

495
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.070
to a machine so that it knows what things are like from our perspective.

496
00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:24.150
So it knows you don't step on babies when you're walking across the room.

497
00:29:24.151 --> 00:29:27.000
Like that innate nature that we have,

498
00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:31.810
I think it's important that we do convey are our ethics to,
you know,

499
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:35.790
to the machines that we build so that they behave in a way that,
uh,

500
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.810
that allows us to coexist.
You know,

501
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.020
<v 1>hopefully,
or we're done son.
It's one or</v>

502
00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.230
<v 2>the other.
Cause if it's US versus them,</v>

503
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.540
they're going to be able to figure shit out so quickly.

504
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.920
They're gonna be able to make better versions of themselves very quickly.
Yeah,

505
00:29:50.921 --> 00:29:54.970
and that's the idea of the singularity,
right,
is that we just bears definition.

506
00:29:55.190 --> 00:30:00.190
We create a machine that's smart enough to make itself smarter and then you kind

507
00:30:00.311 --> 00:30:03.790
of have a runaway feedback and it gets smarter and smarter,
but,

508
00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:08.020
but I don't think that that's something that is really going to happen anytime.

509
00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:11.150
So isn't it a possibility?
Yeah,
I absolutely think so.

510
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.510
Why would you be confident and thinking that it's not going to happen?
Well,

511
00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:15.280
because,
because we're,

512
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:19.210
it's sort of like if we were alive with Jules Verne and we were like discussing

513
00:30:19.211 --> 00:30:22.810
like,
well what should,
what shape should the capsule be when we go to the moon?

514
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:23.261
You know?

515
00:30:23.261 --> 00:30:26.910
It's like we're not close enough to solving that problem to have sorta make

516
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:30.220
informed decisions about how we should solve it.
You see what I mean?

517
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.353
I see what you're saying.

518
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.650
We're going to have other robots in our lives a lot sooner and those have more

519
00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:39.340
immediate like problems to solve.
Ethical problems too.
Yeah,

520
00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:43.330
like robot fucked Dawes man for sure.
For sure.

521
00:30:43.331 --> 00:30:44.620
That's going to be an ethical issue.

522
00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.020
That's going to be like a slavery time issue.

523
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:52.030
If you have like a really good form of intelligent life that you've created,

524
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.300
it's an artificial intelligence,
but it's,
and you have it as a sex slave.

525
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.910
See that the thing is fucked up man.

526
00:30:57.911 --> 00:31:00.490
[inaudible] thing like the thing where they're smart enough to,

527
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:04.960
to for us to worry about all these ethical thing.
I think that's far away.

528
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.490
I think.
Thanks you.
No,
it's,
it's all about human beings man.
So for instance,

529
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.640
the real problem when you make a fuck doll is do you allow a person to uh,

530
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.730
what,
what happens to the people who interact with it?

531
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.690
So if you have a guy who goes home everyday and he beats the crap out of this

532
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.110
doll,
is that okay?
If you built the doll,

533
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.320
should the doll call the police or should the doll take it?

534
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:34.300
And your decision there as a roboticist,
as of scientist,
product designer,

535
00:31:34.301 --> 00:31:36.790
whatever you are,
you're making it,
you're just,

536
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:41.320
you're designing an ethical interaction between your product and a human being.

537
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:46.080
And your decision can affect whether this guy,
uh,

538
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.540
hurts a real woman,
you know,
or,

539
00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:54.140
or if you're building toys for children or really lifelike pets,
you know,

540
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.970
a kid sticks the fake dog into the microwave.
Like what happens,
you know,

541
00:31:57.971 --> 00:32:02.810
because my gut feeling is,
is not okay.
Right?

542
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.830
Uh,
the,
the animal should react and,
and there's,

543
00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:10.130
there's actually research on this.
My wife's a child psychologist and at,

544
00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.720
at University of Washington,
she's at in Portland where I live,

545
00:32:13.721 --> 00:32:17.830
but before she was at Udab and they have this research there where they

546
00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:20.170
basically took,
let me see,
I can get this straight.

547
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:21.190
Cause it's kind of fascinating.

548
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.080
They take these kids and have them play tic TAC toe against a virtual head,

549
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.370
right?
It looks like a person.

550
00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:31.180
And then they have a scientist walk in and in half of the experiments the

551
00:32:31.181 --> 00:32:34.810
scientist says to the robot head,
uh,
hey,

552
00:32:34.811 --> 00:32:37.060
that was a really dumb ass move.
You're stupid.

553
00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.120
And then half the time the says nothing.

554
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.220
And the other half the time the robot says,
Hey,

555
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.110
it's not okay for you to talk to me like that.

556
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:50.180
And when they asked the kids later,
whether the,
the,
the virtual head,

557
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:51.020
you know,

558
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:55.880
deserve to be like treated with respect or whether it was smart,

559
00:32:55.881 --> 00:32:57.740
they acid,
all these,
ask these kids all these questions.

560
00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:01.010
If the robot demanded moral treatment,

561
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:05.240
then the kids thought that the robot deserved moral treatment.
If it didn't,

562
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.900
they thought it was okay to,
to abuse it.
And so it just,

563
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.390
it comes right back down to it.
When you build a robot,

564
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.550
you're building an ethical interaction.
Wow.
You can mess it up.
You know?

565
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.850
I feel like that's fast

566
00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:21.440
<v 1>meeting.
That's uh,
that's that.
Yeah.</v>

567
00:33:21.441 --> 00:33:26.441
You can't allow something to just be brutalized and to take like punishment and

568
00:33:27.261 --> 00:33:30.170
to not,
you can't like make a person can make an artificial person

569
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:33.790
<v 2>future.
Right.
Where people are falling around with like perfectly human,</v>

570
00:33:33.791 --> 00:33:36.700
like robots and they just abused there was beat the shit out of them.
And

571
00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.970
that would very quickly warp,

572
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.090
I think the [inaudible] of all of humans that would create sociopaths because

573
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.380
yeah,
we acclimate to whatever around,
you know?
Yeah.

574
00:33:47.381 --> 00:33:51.310
Especially if it's indistinguishable unless we're already robots and we don't

575
00:33:51.311 --> 00:33:51.730
know it.

576
00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:55.060
<v 1>Yeah.
What do you mean?
What do you buy with the simulation theory thing?
Man,</v>

577
00:33:55.061 --> 00:33:59.630
do you ever give a wrap your head around that?
Ever fuck with that,
the no,

578
00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.230
lay it on me.
Oh,
what's this new thing?

579
00:34:02.231 --> 00:34:05.700
That's these and these are legitimate scientists but majoring this robot,

580
00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:10.990
the idea of the Damn Matrix,
the idea that we're in some sort of a,

581
00:34:10.991 --> 00:34:15.991
an incredible computer program and then it's so complicated and so well done

582
00:34:16.841 --> 00:34:19.800
that it's indistinguishable from real life and that week and you we're

583
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:24.310
interacting with things but that the more they study string theory,

584
00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.250
they're studying the,
the in the computations of string theory,

585
00:34:27.251 --> 00:34:31.720
they keep finding this self correcting computer code.

586
00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:33.490
I don't understand what that means,

587
00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:38.140
but I understand it's a very specific type of computer code that we didn't even

588
00:34:38.141 --> 00:34:41.850
figure out until like the early 20th century.
I think that they,

589
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.840
I think they said we figured it out in the forties or 50s or something like
that,

590
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:45.850
and if I remember correctly,

591
00:34:45.851 --> 00:34:49.870
but the idea that this is in these,

592
00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:53.500
the string theory equations that they're putting together,

593
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:58.120
I don't understand mathematics,
but what I think they're trying to say,

594
00:34:58.121 --> 00:35:03.121
and it's like it says is there's an eerie code to all this.

595
00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.550
It's not just like we don't know what the code is,

596
00:35:06.551 --> 00:35:09.870
but we can see that there's some repeating patterns.
No,
no,
no,
no.
It's the,

597
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:14.990
it's a very specific type of code and that's when they're studying the nature of

598
00:35:16.091 --> 00:35:16.924
reality.

599
00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:22.080
So the nature of reality and it's like one of its smallest measurable forms is

600
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:25.000
very obviously computer code seven

601
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.400
hike.
It doesn't,
it doesn't seem like,

602
00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:34.810
it doesn't seem like if technology moves in the certain,

603
00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:38.130
the direction it's gone right now,
if,
uh,
our computers

604
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.330
<v 4>get more and more powerful or our CGI shit,
it's more and more believable.</v>

605
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:47.660
We've got to keep moving until one day we reach a point where we can simulate

606
00:35:48.601 --> 00:35:53.130
reality,
right?
It's going to happen.
And if it's really fucking good,

607
00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:54.900
that's going to be just like this

608
00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:57.573
<v 2>dude is that,</v>

609
00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:01.270
<v 4>trying to think running man was running is that,</v>

610
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.180
that's whatever they recreate the fight,
you know,

611
00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.940
<v 2>computer models.
I mean before all that happens,
we're going to be able to,</v>

612
00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:12.410
I can't wait until the day when I can say,
all right television,

613
00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:16.340
<v 4>whatever you are now I want to watch like running man,</v>

614
00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.640
but I want instead of a Arnold,
you know,

615
00:36:19.641 --> 00:36:23.030
I want Jeremy Renner and I want like no Megan Fox.

616
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:28.100
I want an all female cast of young kid.

617
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:31.490
And then you have to follow them with a reality show camera as well.

618
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.940
And to get them all maps together and make them live together.
Oh that's awesome.

619
00:36:34.941 --> 00:36:36.970
It just maps their bodies onto it,
you know?

620
00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:41.030
And that would be like the ultimate ironic one to watch because they do that in

621
00:36:41.031 --> 00:36:45.290
the movie.
How long before we have our first robot action hero.

622
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:51.240
Wait,
so what do you mean by robot guy in the movies we can have,

623
00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.330
yeah,
like a robot actor.

624
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:58.110
So that's like all Ryan O'neal's qualities with,
you know,

625
00:36:58.111 --> 00:37:03.111
a little of Arnold Schwarzenegger's masculine bravado and you know,

626
00:37:03.411 --> 00:37:06.110
Brad Pitt's acting chops or whatever,
you know,

627
00:37:06.111 --> 00:37:09.260
and just mix it all up together and make it the perfect robot action here.

628
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:10.413
Pouty Lips.

629
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:15.080
My Lips are not about [inaudible] son of a bitch.

630
00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.400
Get some chapstick and injections.

631
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:22.180
I just punch myself in the face myself.
Yeah,

632
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:23.960
I'm sorry all I'm sitting here thinking,

633
00:37:23.961 --> 00:37:28.790
I'm just thinking of calculus from Futurama Calculus.
Sorry.

634
00:37:28.791 --> 00:37:33.020
He's like that.
He's an actor,
a robot actor.
He's a robot actor.

635
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:35.980
Is that possible?
Could they ever make like a,
you know,

636
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.520
are we going to have human beings that are,
that ane distinguishable?

637
00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.980
The question is like,

638
00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:43.410
<v 2>would you bother?</v>

639
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.490
Because you could just create them and CG right and make them perfectly

640
00:37:47.491 --> 00:37:50.190
realistic.
Would you bother creating the,
the real world version?

641
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:54.420
But I have to say I'm super excited because I have a short story that got picked

642
00:37:54.421 --> 00:37:59.160
up by this director.
He's sort of a budding guy in London,
right?

643
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:04.460
But he's making a short film based on this thing and he's negotiating with a,

644
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.610
it's like a story about a guy in a robot boy that he lives with cause it's real

645
00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:11.060
son has passed away and uh,

646
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:16.140
we got Lambert Wilson got the mirror of engine is going to be in this thing and

647
00:38:16.141 --> 00:38:20.250
then he's working with a university to get an actual robot.

648
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.040
There's this thing called the Nao humanoid.

649
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:26.070
It's the size of an eight to 10 year old kid.
If you Google it,

650
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:30.420
I mean it moves like a real human being and they're going to have it as an
actor.

651
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:34.530
It's just a short film.
But I mean it's going to be pretty,
pretty cool.

652
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.100
It's going to be real robot acting

653
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.620
<v 4>in a movie.
Oh God damn man.
I,</v>

654
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.450
I saw that there was a very uh,
intricate Japanese robot.

655
00:38:43.451 --> 00:38:47.920
It was a woman that was a,
have you seen that one?
It's very emotive.

656
00:38:47.921 --> 00:38:51.760
And it was a woman.
Yeah,
it was just a head.
Okay.
Cause there's,

657
00:38:51.761 --> 00:38:54.460
there's the actual Lloyd is that the NFL?

658
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:59.610
Is this it think not the one I was thinking [inaudible] there's a robot on the

659
00:39:01.061 --> 00:39:03.450
screen,
folks that are listening to this on iTunes.
This,

660
00:39:03.451 --> 00:39:06.730
this robot on the screen and it's walking around.
It's so weird.

661
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:10.870
That's not the one that God,
they're so good now.

662
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.980
I mean they really,
they really are like what we,

663
00:39:14.981 --> 00:39:19.540
we hope robots would be when we were kids.
Remember lost in space.
That's stupid.

664
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:22.570
Fucking garbage can garbage can robot.

665
00:39:22.571 --> 00:39:27.520
That was the dumbest looking robot ever.
Danger will Robinson.
Danger.

666
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.633
Danger.

667
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:33.220
There's little like tyrannosaurus arms that were just out on arms like they

668
00:39:33.221 --> 00:39:35.680
would clip and he had to do their bidding.
Always.

669
00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:40.690
They love that robot is obsessed with that room.
What was that robot's name?

670
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:45.250
He was Robbie.
Robbie,
the robot willing space.
But he was in a lot of stuff.

671
00:39:45.251 --> 00:39:47.110
He was um oh really?
Yeah.

672
00:39:47.111 --> 00:39:49.810
And there were like different versions of him and he's always hard for me to pin

673
00:39:49.811 --> 00:39:52.540
down in my head because he was around for a while.

674
00:39:52.541 --> 00:39:55.300
But Brian pull up Robby the robot.
Let's see what that looks like.

675
00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.300
I haven't looked at that one.
Kind of cool thing about robots I've noticed.

676
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:06.660
No,
that's Ravi and his friend Jeff.

677
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:08.830
No,
Robin,

678
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.800
this is Robby the robot man.
It looks like,
we'll see that Brian.

679
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:17.800
Okay,
danger.
That's,
yeah,

680
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:22.180
he was actually pretty bad ass arms would just come out of the center of his

681
00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:26.120
chest,
but he always had a lesson.
No matter what will Robinson,

682
00:40:26.121 --> 00:40:28.750
we were like be like,
listen bitch,
we're going to go exploring.

683
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.720
He was like the first gay robot,
right?
No,
no,
no,
no.

684
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:35.290
The other dude was the gay guy because that lost in space was a weird show.

685
00:40:35.291 --> 00:40:38.860
They had a guy who liked,
acted really obviously gay.
Look at that.

686
00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:41.820
That looks like a fucking disco floor.
But that was seriously,
that's,

687
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.380
those are gay robots.
What was the dude's name?

688
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:49.360
What was the dude's name that happens in price or something?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

689
00:40:49.361 --> 00:40:53.400
How dare you?
So do you like this TV?
Oh,
I love,
that's to

690
00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:59.020
your original loss of space was a crazy show,
man.

691
00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:04.090
It was for 1965 to 1968 they would like land on planets and shit.

692
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.450
Well,
they were,
they were marooned.
It was like a Gilligan's island,

693
00:41:07.451 --> 00:41:09.640
except they were on some tiny planet.

694
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.150
There have been some great ones.
I mean,

695
00:41:13.151 --> 00:41:17.890
I always used to love small wonder when I was a kid,
you know,
picky.
The,

696
00:41:17.891 --> 00:41:22.390
uh,
the robot who the dad is a roboticist and he brings her home to like test her

697
00:41:22.391 --> 00:41:24.280
out and she sleeps in his son's closet.

698
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.790
Jonathan Harris was Dr. Zachary Smith.
Dot.

699
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.010
Zachary Smith was like the first,
like pretty obviously gay

700
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.320
<v 3>character on television.</v>

701
00:41:36.321 --> 00:41:39.680
That might've just been all the SPANDEX unitards that they were wearing on that

702
00:41:39.681 --> 00:41:44.430
show when he was,
he was at [inaudible].
He's very eccentric to the,
I mean in,

703
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:48.620
if it's really feminine,
apologize,
sobbing way.
He was a villain.
Right?
I mean,

704
00:41:48.621 --> 00:41:53.540
he was always scheming back.
Well,
he's always dumped ruining things.

705
00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:59.000
Stupid stupid Dr. Smith.
And he was like,
he's ego would always be his folly,

706
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:03.720
you know?
Yeah.
That was a great show,
man.
Well these,

707
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:07.220
they're really fun to watch today because it's like,
you know,

708
00:42:07.221 --> 00:42:10.370
they thought this was going to be like 1990 like that's how we're going to be in

709
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:15.640
like living in colonies in space and so there's this sort of a idea of like man,

710
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:18.860
space travel never really materialized in a way.

711
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:23.600
A lot of people thought it was from the 1960s so you get this weird idea of what

712
00:42:23.601 --> 00:42:25.640
they thought the future was going to be from these shows.

713
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.260
It's really fascinating.
I think they,

714
00:42:27.261 --> 00:42:30.170
I think they actually misjudged human nature.

715
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:34.910
Like there's this idea that we've accomplished this amazing feat by going to the

716
00:42:34.911 --> 00:42:36.830
moon,
right?
We planted a flag.

717
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:42.130
We've walked around like we went into the uncharted world depths,

718
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.831
the wilderness.

719
00:42:42.831 --> 00:42:47.330
Like it's an amazing thing to do and you think that that sort of raw inspiring

720
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.150
event is going to propel mankind into the stars.

721
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.860
But actually we were just competing with the Russians and it was just,

722
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:59.120
it was enough to put a flag there and the instant that we need to go beyond that

723
00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:03.860
I think is the instant that some other nation plants a flag next to ours or

724
00:43:03.861 --> 00:43:06.630
knocks it down.
Flag on Mars.
Yeah.

725
00:43:06.631 --> 00:43:09.920
I mean it's all about just like pissing on a,
on trees,
you know,

726
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.680
it's the trees just keep getting further away from Earth.

727
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.530
Well it's also to let you know like look,
if we can go to the moon,

728
00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:19.230
we can launch missiles on you had from space still my lecture notes and let you

729
00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.940
know,
let you know how we run and shit from orbit bitch.
Yes we can.

730
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:28.160
I mean if you to be the first person to set up a base on the moon would be an

731
00:43:28.161 --> 00:43:31.130
incredible military advantage and he's going to do it.
I think it's going to,

732
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:36.220
it's going to be a great thing because it's going to excite those dude Madge and

733
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.350
if we actually start having bases on the moon,

734
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.210
if people actually started doing that,

735
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.620
if they develop the technology to one day have bases on the moon and we would go

736
00:43:45.621 --> 00:43:49.550
there like going to fucking Hawaii.
It's like a 24 hour trip and the shuttle,

737
00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:53.000
I totally believe that because I mean it's like something tragic is going to

738
00:43:53.001 --> 00:43:54.010
happen.
Like you know like a,

739
00:43:54.011 --> 00:43:56.810
like a lot of the land's going to be poisoned or something.

740
00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:58.850
It'll be like fucked band.

741
00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:01.760
They would have to tear a forum on the moon because the moon doesn't have an

742
00:44:01.761 --> 00:44:05.290
atmosphere that ain't going to happen.
Could do that someday.
That's,

743
00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:08.240
that's the whole premise of Promethean us was that they were terraforming that

744
00:44:08.241 --> 00:44:08.690
planet.

745
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:13.010
They were trying to make it habitable for their life form if they're going to be

746
00:44:13.011 --> 00:44:14.360
able to do that for sure.

747
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:18.620
One day people always argue that we're going to screw earth up so bad that then

748
00:44:18.621 --> 00:44:21.740
we're going to have to go to Mars,
the moon and the like.
The,

749
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:27.280
the resource expenditure took leave earth with a lot of people and even just to

750
00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:32.130
go to the moon,
much less Mars is so out of whack.
I mean,

751
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.520
<v 2>you'd be better off like almost doing anything to fix the earth.</v>

752
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:37.920
They're just eking it out here.
I mean,
let's face it,

753
00:44:37.921 --> 00:44:42.300
if you poison the earth's atmosphere so that you can't even walk outside
anymore,

754
00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:46.200
or you screw up the atmospherics is that we're getting radiation from,

755
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.480
well guess what?
That's Mars.
Why go to Mars to build

756
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:54.940
dome,
right?
Just build a dominant Arizona.
Right?

757
00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:59.270
Everything has to go to Mars for no shit.
Fix this stupid.
So I don't,

758
00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.720
I've always thought that was bullshit.

759
00:45:00.721 --> 00:45:03.570
The idea that we're going to mess up her so bad,
we'd have to go to Mars,

760
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.840
but the only way I could think we could do that though,
it's like nuclear shit.

761
00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:11.130
Yeah.
Okay.
So there's a massive nuclear holocaust all across the country,

762
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:12.323
across the world.

763
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:16.020
We all launched bombs at each other and just wipe out that they would make so

764
00:45:16.021 --> 00:45:19.710
many areas radioactive that would almost be like,
you can't live here anymore.

765
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:22.560
You know,
that would still be pretty tough to do I think,

766
00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:24.330
just because like really?
Yeah,

767
00:45:24.331 --> 00:45:27.210
because you'd have to launch all of them at the exact same time.
Right.

768
00:45:27.211 --> 00:45:29.610
And then they have to land all over the year.
I mean,

769
00:45:29.611 --> 00:45:34.200
if you think about when we first got nukes,
we were doing crazy shit.

770
00:45:34.201 --> 00:45:39.201
We were launching them all the time and space ground the water on the show.

771
00:45:40.081 --> 00:45:44.760
We showed a video of all the nuclear explosions from 1947.
It's online,

772
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.970
you can get it.
Uh,
it's on,
uh,
I forget the website,

773
00:45:47.971 --> 00:45:52.950
but it shows the first tests and then it shows Hiroshima and Nagasaki and it

774
00:45:52.951 --> 00:45:57.180
shows all these different ones that they did in Nevada,
Nevada.
It's crazy.

775
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:59.130
Oh Dude.
They were nuking the shit out of everything.

776
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:04.080
So my favorite is project ploughshares.
Okay.
This is like Iowa or something.

777
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:08.880
And here's the notion.
We're gonna mine for natural gas.

778
00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:13.290
Uh,
there's,
the gas is trapped in all these facts now we run water through,

779
00:46:13.291 --> 00:46:14.880
it's called fracking.
Right?
But they're like,

780
00:46:14.881 --> 00:46:19.110
we're going to free up all this natural gas and harvest it by detonating a nuke

781
00:46:19.111 --> 00:46:23.520
under the ground.
So they drill this giant hole,
they drill this giant hole,

782
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:24.990
they put a nuke at the bottom of it,

783
00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.830
they fill the hole up and then they detonate the nuke.

784
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.040
Here's what happens.
Highly irradiated,

785
00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:34.860
natural gas shoots out of this chimney.

786
00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:38.940
It ejects all the,
all the crap they put in there,

787
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:44.040
it goes into the atmosphere.
All of the natural gas is,
is poisonous.
It's like,

788
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.400
you know,
it's got radiation and it,
and,
and they're like,
oh,

789
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:51.840
well that's not a good idea.
So much for certain turning swords to plowshares.

790
00:46:51.841 --> 00:46:55.740
Right.
Like did they do this?
Uh,
this is like,

791
00:46:56.490 --> 00:47:00.360
this is not that long ago.
I would say in the middle of the 20th century,

792
00:47:00.361 --> 00:47:03.660
but I don't know for sure.
Oh,
here's why.
I know that.
What is the,
what does the,

793
00:47:03.661 --> 00:47:05.310
do you know what the name of the operations called?

794
00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:10.230
I think it was called project ploughshares.
Project pro.
Yeah.
Look it up.
Um,

795
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.840
the,
the reason I like it is because I was thinking,

796
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:15.840
and this is a little bit of a spoiler,
but while I was writing bro Apocalypse,

797
00:47:15.841 --> 00:47:19.260
I was thinking,
look,
if I was a superintelligent AI,
right,

798
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:23.610
I'm not going to hang out and have all my processors like in a place where

799
00:47:23.611 --> 00:47:28.350
humans are going to be comfortable,
right?
So what's my fortress of solitude?

800
00:47:28.351 --> 00:47:30.760
Right?
So when these nukes detonate,

801
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:35.880
they vaporize a spiritual chunk of like rock underground or they create this

802
00:47:36.911 --> 00:47:39.910
chamber and the walls turned to glass,
right?

803
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:44.860
So it's this bubble deep under the ground,
highly radioactive.

804
00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.440
It is the ultimate fortress of solitude.

805
00:47:47.441 --> 00:47:51.310
And it's of course where my bad guy lives.
Sorry,
I kind of blew that.

806
00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:53.970
<v 5>I want to read that again.</v>

807
00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:58.170
That is a dope idea that we would create a place with a bad guy lives because

808
00:47:58.171 --> 00:48:01.950
we're so stupid.
We blew up nukes and a hole that we dug into the ground.

809
00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:06.810
You know,
it's always,
it's what was the Hubris,
you know,
all the Hubris dance,

810
00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:10.800
insanity.
I can't even believe that.
No.

811
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:14.610
Is that a case of people just having too much power?

812
00:48:14.611 --> 00:48:17.730
Because it's a military project to do whatever they want to do.

813
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.460
And the scientists are allowed to say,
hey,
let's try this.

814
00:48:20.461 --> 00:48:22.600
Like some wacky scientist

815
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.940
<v 2>may not be popular viewpoint,
but I think it's awesome.</v>

816
00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:30.740
I think it's optimism.
I think it's like human,

817
00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:35.750
the human race as a little kid who has come stumbled across like this awesome

818
00:48:35.751 --> 00:48:39.830
new toy and they're like,
what can we do with it?
Oh,
let's try everything.

819
00:48:39.831 --> 00:48:42.170
You know,
because like in the fifties,

820
00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.620
we had used technology to end World War II.

821
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.890
People were high on technology.
They were like,
man,

822
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:51.380
technology is going to do everything for us.
Like,
we're going to eat it.

823
00:48:51.381 --> 00:48:52.610
It's going to be food pills.

824
00:48:52.611 --> 00:48:55.910
We're not even going to have to eat this bullshit that earth creates for us.

825
00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:57.620
Come full circle.

826
00:48:57.621 --> 00:49:01.760
Now it's all about organic and we're afraid of chemicals and afraid of

827
00:49:01.761 --> 00:49:05.480
technology.
But you know,
in the fifties that was like the golden age.
It was like,

828
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:08.000
we're gonna have atomic pens.
You know,

829
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.100
I don't know why we need atomic energy and our pens,

830
00:49:10.101 --> 00:49:12.620
but dammit we're going to have it.
And,
uh,

831
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:16.310
I wrote a book called where's My jet pack that,
uh,
covers all this stuff?

832
00:49:16.311 --> 00:49:18.080
I'm sorry,
I keep dropping all these books.

833
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.810
Do your book sounds fucking awesome now.
Right.

834
00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.420
<v 5>I even had a joke about that.</v>

835
00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:29.100
You'll never have like weed and jet packs together at the same time.

836
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:32.750
It needs created human torpedoes.
Yeah.
That's,
that's what happens.

837
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:36.540
Plus no one would work because why would you show up at work when you could

838
00:49:36.541 --> 00:49:38.830
smoke pot and fly?
Like they'd be very,

839
00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:44.010
very few things that you would be having more fun at smoking pot and flying

840
00:49:44.011 --> 00:49:44.780
around it.

841
00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:45.260
<v 2>Right?</v>

842
00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:49.520
Or would we just be in a future where Louis C K stands in from an audience?

843
00:49:49.521 --> 00:49:54.160
It says,
why does anybody complaining about jet packs lying people?
You know,

844
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:58.740
<v 5>that would definitely happen.
I mean,
we would just so sick of it.
Oh,</v>

845
00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:00.900
fucking jet packs.
I've always got bugs in my teeth.

846
00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:04.410
It's hard to getting my natural girls to fill my jet pack.
You know,

847
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:09.110
why can't we make a fucking solar?
Jetpack is 2037 Whoa.

848
00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.870
Always complain for sure.
But that's why things get better.
Exactly.

849
00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:14.160
It's really important,

850
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.010
you gotta be able to silence even the most bitter of critics.

851
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.970
And there's certain things to do.
A bad ass jet pack I think would be,

852
00:50:20.971 --> 00:50:23.190
that can actually have a compact,

853
00:50:23.191 --> 00:50:27.200
sort of a light backpack sorta sides thing they can fly around with.

854
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:30.600
<v 2>So I,
I can,
I can give you the low down on the,
on the jet pack because they're,</v>

855
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.750
you know,
I remember all this,
right?
So,
uh,

856
00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:37.370
forties Wendell Moore got a grant from the army to build a jetpack.

857
00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.210
And so he's working for bell aerosystems.

858
00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:43.140
This is a guy who specialize in building small rocket engines,

859
00:50:43.141 --> 00:50:45.690
basically airplanes that are flying really,
really high.

860
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.600
There's not a lot of atmosphere so they can't play in off of it.

861
00:50:48.601 --> 00:50:52.350
So in order to change direction,
they fire these little rockets,
you know,

862
00:50:52.351 --> 00:50:54.510
like that.
It's like a spacecraft type deal.

863
00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:57.990
So we took one of these little rockets and you literally strapped it onto his

864
00:50:57.991 --> 00:51:02.040
back and tethered himself to the ground and just turned it on.

865
00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:06.120
And Eh,
he broke his knee.
He shattered his knee actually immediately,

866
00:51:06.121 --> 00:51:10.890
but it worked.
So then he literally hired the kid who mowed his lawn,

867
00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:15.830
a guy named bill suitor to who was like 19 Hale and hearty,
you know,

868
00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.980
to,
uh,
to test the jet pack.
And,
and they,

869
00:51:18.981 --> 00:51:22.650
they had a working model of the jet pack,
you know,
it's called a rocket belt.

870
00:51:22.651 --> 00:51:24.840
You know,
it's literally a rocket,
you know,

871
00:51:24.841 --> 00:51:29.300
and that's the problem is that you just take the hydrogen peroxide and silver or

872
00:51:29.301 --> 00:51:29.611
whatever,

873
00:51:29.611 --> 00:51:33.720
you put them together and then it creates an explosion and the real hard thing

874
00:51:33.721 --> 00:51:36.720
is to throttle it so you don't just explode.

875
00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:41.800
And then it runs out.
It runs out of juice in like 30 seconds.
And I,
you know,

876
00:51:41.801 --> 00:51:45.980
it's got a terrible fuel to weight rate and that's the problem.
You know,
they,

877
00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.740
they literally,
they put a buzzer in the helmet because they test,

878
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:50.580
they showed that,
you know,
Bill Sutor would,

879
00:51:50.581 --> 00:51:53.700
would take these things to the Olympics.
They were in like that bond movie.

880
00:51:53.701 --> 00:51:56.750
Like they would do this for demonstrations to make money.
Uh,

881
00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.170
after the program was scrapped and a,

882
00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:03.060
they put a buzzer in the helmet that would buzz after 20 seconds basically

883
00:52:03.061 --> 00:52:07.950
saying you better land right now you've got 10 seconds before you just turn into

884
00:52:07.951 --> 00:52:10.390
a,
you know,
a ballast.
Yeah,

885
00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:15.350
<v 5>I,
I was at a Wpbi my friend willy has a,</v>

886
00:52:15.351 --> 00:52:18.990
a radio show there and they did this thing in the parking lot where a dude fluid

887
00:52:18.991 --> 00:52:22.290
jet pack and we've got a video of it.
He,
what did he throw it?
We were there.

888
00:52:22.291 --> 00:52:27.210
We were you there for that one.
He flew it for like 30 seconds.

889
00:52:27.211 --> 00:52:30.600
I think that's like all it had.
You can only do it for like a minute.

890
00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:34.890
So he got it up to a minute or something.
But it's,
it's pretty crazy.

891
00:52:34.891 --> 00:52:36.840
But this guy's fucked his legs up.
His,

892
00:52:36.841 --> 00:52:40.590
both of his knees are blown out from doing this,
like as ACL is are gone.

893
00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:43.350
So he's all fucked up from just crashing with this thing.

894
00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:47.010
The thing he got w would have to worry about is anything that has enough power

895
00:52:47.011 --> 00:52:51.750
to get you to be flying in the air has enough power to speed you into something.

896
00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:55.680
People who can be smacking into each other,
we would have to have,
we would have,

897
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:59.010
there would be no way they would let you just have a jet pack.

898
00:52:59.011 --> 00:53:03.810
You would have to have some sort of a like,
like a bumper car,
outer shell.

899
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.560
We'll see,

900
00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.780
<v 2>man.
See that's like,</v>

901
00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:10.810
I think that's a great example of applying a current mindset to a technology

902
00:53:11.331 --> 00:53:13.460
that's in the future.
If they were really gonna make it,

903
00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:18.290
there's no way to make it safe.
It would have to be controlled by a,
by a robot.

904
00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:21.230
Basically.
Autonomous cars.
Those Google cars,

905
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:26.070
<v 5>cars are essentially driving around now.
Yeah,
they,
a lot</v>

906
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.360
<v 2>of people are in a Seattle.</v>

907
00:53:27.361 --> 00:53:29.640
We're talking about how they see them all the time on the freeway.

908
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:32.670
Just driving around like a guy in the backseat and no one in the front seat.

909
00:53:32.671 --> 00:53:33.504
She's a,

910
00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:37.790
what the fuck is that like for that dude in the back seat is caused by hitting

911
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.860
the bikers and shit and knows when to change lanes.

912
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.820
I got into one of those at Carnegie Mellon where I went to school and I got into

913
00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:48.610
their autonomous car,
drove with it in the backseat while it was driving,

914
00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:53.160
going around,
uh,
like a test track.
Right.
And it was okay.

915
00:53:53.161 --> 00:53:56.400
First of all,
the,
the,
the wheel is turning by itself,
right?

916
00:53:56.401 --> 00:54:00.270
And you're in the back.
So that's weird,
right?

917
00:54:00.271 --> 00:54:04.170
But then it starts to kind of feel like,
uh,
I mean it doesn't wreck immediately.

918
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.370
And so you sort of start to loosen up a little bit and you,

919
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.260
you get the feeling that you're like on a ride,
you know,
like,

920
00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:13.440
and you start to trust it.
Like when you're on a rollercoaster,
you know,

921
00:54:13.441 --> 00:54:16.500
the ones driving it,
you just feel,
you feel like you're safe.

922
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:21.740
But then what happens is I started realizing this car,

923
00:54:21.871 --> 00:54:25.620
it didn't know I was inside it.
Right?
So it's tolerant.

924
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:30.660
The tolerances for a car with nobody inside of it are very different than the

925
00:54:30.661 --> 00:54:34.680
tolerances on a car.
Wow.
It would like hit the,

926
00:54:34.681 --> 00:54:37.650
it would sort of sense that there was something there that wasn't,
you know,

927
00:54:37.651 --> 00:54:42.651
and it would kind of swerve and it was throw you around like really hard and you

928
00:54:42.811 --> 00:54:45.240
realize it doesn't give a shit.

929
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:48.240
Like it isn't going to be like doing the mom thing where it throws the handout

930
00:54:48.241 --> 00:54:49.470
in front of you.
Like,
oh sorry.

931
00:54:49.471 --> 00:54:54.150
Do you know this thing is just driving to the tolerance of the engineering that

932
00:54:54.151 --> 00:54:57.780
it's designed for and you were just being thrown around in the back and this was

933
00:54:57.781 --> 00:55:01.950
the car losing traction at any point.
You know,
if it was always safe,

934
00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:05.250
it was seeing how fast it could go because they're competitive.

935
00:55:05.251 --> 00:55:07.680
The Darpa Grand Challenge,
the Darpa urban challenge,

936
00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:12.870
they had to go as fast as they could and they didn't have a human in them at
all.

937
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:16.260
So I was scared.
So now Google is different.
You know,

938
00:55:16.261 --> 00:55:18.930
Google just bought Stanford's team essentially.

939
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:23.310
There's a guy named Sebastian Thrun who got me into school at Cmu.

940
00:55:23.311 --> 00:55:26.850
And then he worked on the autonomous cars at Stanford because Stanford bottom

941
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:31.110
and then googled bought,
they took Sebastian and now,

942
00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:35.000
I mean this Guy Sebastian Thrun,
he's going to change the world.

943
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:38.910
He's going to introduce autonomous vehicles.
It's an a change our cities.

944
00:55:38.911 --> 00:55:42.000
It's going to save lives.
It's really cool.
I'm really proud of it.

945
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:44.520
<v 1>That's awesome man.
That's amazing.</v>

946
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.120
So do you think that's the future that everyone will have their own personal

947
00:55:48.121 --> 00:55:50.880
autonomous vehicle and though I get in,
they'll just,
we'll,

948
00:55:50.881 --> 00:55:53.250
we'll cue in on the highways and whatever and you're,

949
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:56.650
you'll be able to like read the newspaper and you're little vehicle.
We'll just,

950
00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.530
he won't be in control of it anymore.

951
00:55:58.570 --> 00:55:59.560
<v 2>Well,
the first thing,</v>

952
00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:03.940
I'm not sure if people are really doing this where they're in the back outside

953
00:56:03.941 --> 00:56:06.160
of a closed course because um,

954
00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:11.370
these cars require a person to be behind the wheel to take the blame if it

955
00:56:11.411 --> 00:56:16.180
wreck.
Oh,
I see.
So you're just sort of like a big meaty blame

956
00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:21.960
piece of blame machinery.
Like,
that's the only flower you play in the,

957
00:56:21.961 --> 00:56:23.980
in this whole thing that's going to be

958
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.260
<v 3>a job in the future though,
like a fry guy.</v>

959
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:29.560
But you're going to be sitting in the backseat of a car being the blame blame

960
00:56:29.561 --> 00:56:31.650
guy and amped amped.

961
00:56:31.651 --> 00:56:35.710
There is a truck driver who all he does is he sits in the front seat and he's

962
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.530
just there to take the blame.
That's his whole job.
Wow.

963
00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:43.120
And he just drives cross country 24,
seven in these,
in these trucks,

964
00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:47.530
it will be a job.
You know,
there will be a time where the are,

965
00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:52.330
do these robot machine just moving back and forth across the country carrying

966
00:56:52.331 --> 00:56:53.750
goods.
Yeah.
And you think about it,

967
00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:58.570
it's like what is it that you can't put into the car and it's,
it's morality,

968
00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.600
right?
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.

969
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:03.820
And he asked to make certain decisions like what do you do if a horse is in

970
00:57:03.821 --> 00:57:07.460
front of you?
Yeah.
Do you hit it?
Do we,
yeah.

971
00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:11.290
Or do you slam on the brakes and risk losing control of the vehicle or do you

972
00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:14.020
fuck it or do you just want to slow down,

973
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:18.220
put your arm outside the window and say hey,
hey what you doing?
Yeah,

974
00:57:18.221 --> 00:57:20.620
like people have said that about,

975
00:57:20.621 --> 00:57:24.160
I'm about small animals that like if you see a squirrel and you should just hit

976
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:28.810
them because if you swerve like the people die all the time from swerving to get

977
00:57:28.811 --> 00:57:33.350
away from squirrels.
Maybe carriage.
Yeah it's a different side.

978
00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:37.120
That's a really interesting point.
This is what got will Smith.

979
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:41.180
I'll uptight and I robot right where at the end the big reveal for his character

980
00:57:41.181 --> 00:57:42.014
as he's like,

981
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:47.140
oh robust saved my life from a car but it let the little girl next to me die

982
00:57:47.141 --> 00:57:50.710
because the probability of saving her life was lower and it's like how are you

983
00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:51.970
going to blame the robot for that?

984
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:55.090
That's like saying I put my finger in a pencil sharpener and it cut me.

985
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:57.340
That's what it's designed to do.

986
00:57:57.341 --> 00:57:59.620
What are you not going to hate the pencil sharpener.

987
00:57:59.621 --> 00:58:03.990
I mean well you are for a movie though.
Cause the middle of America,

988
00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:06.310
none are going to understand.
I was bumping.

989
00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:10.030
That happened robust digging that movie and then I was like,
oh that's weak.

990
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:13.930
The CGI in that movie was dope.
Yeah,
I know what crack Capsid,

991
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:18.490
amazing work.
All those robots go nuts.
Right?
And what do they do?
What do they do?

992
00:58:18.491 --> 00:58:22.930
They turn red,
they got re,
you know there's that part where the robot is like a,

993
00:58:23.110 --> 00:58:26.440
it was an old lady like in her house,
you know,
and she's like,
okay,

994
00:58:26.441 --> 00:58:28.450
well can you make me some toast or something?
Right in.

995
00:58:28.451 --> 00:58:31.810
The robot turns around and it's glowing,
bright red.
And I'm like,
what?

996
00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:36.810
A thoughtful roboticist to include a red led in there just in case they all turn

997
00:58:38.021 --> 00:58:42.820
evil to indicate to people,
oh your robot has flipped over and the evil mode,

998
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:46.840
you're going to want to plan accordingly to grow a robots of scary robots would

999
00:58:46.841 --> 00:58:50.360
beat the shit out of you.
Those robots in that moving,
if that was,

1000
00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:53.740
there was a whole bunch of them and they had their own thoughts and ideas.

1001
00:58:53.741 --> 00:58:56.560
I think that's very possible.
Now those,
those robots are bullshit.

1002
00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:59.150
So what scares the shit out of me?
How can you say there were bullshit?

1003
00:58:59.151 --> 00:59:02.470
Because if you're making a domestic robot that's going to operate in people's

1004
00:59:02.471 --> 00:59:06.580
homes,
right?
It's going to be in people's homes,
old people,
young people.

1005
00:59:06.581 --> 00:59:09.220
It's going to be on the street walking dogs.
I mean,
I thought that was awesome,

1006
00:59:09.221 --> 00:59:12.700
right?
Here's the deal.
You're going to want to make a safe robot.

1007
00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:14.260
It's a safe consumer product.
Okay,

1008
00:59:14.261 --> 00:59:18.310
so just think of this even just from the beginning for like one second from the

1009
00:59:18.311 --> 00:59:22.070
perspective of a person who's actually building a humanoid robot to

1010
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.940
<v 2>sell,
okay?
First of all,
you know that a human being,</v>

1011
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:28.310
anything you put in their environment at home,

1012
00:59:28.311 --> 00:59:30.650
they are going to put their fingers in it.

1013
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:32.300
They're going to try to have sex with it.

1014
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:33.980
They're going to get in the bathtub with it.

1015
00:59:33.981 --> 00:59:36.260
They're going to find a way to like kill themselves.

1016
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:40.910
Using this toaster is really hard to build safe.

1017
00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.980
Think about building this domestic robot.

1018
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:45.770
I think the first thing that you're going to do is you're going to make it

1019
00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:47.570
incapable of hurting people.

1020
00:59:47.571 --> 00:59:51.560
You're going to make it small and light so that it can't walk through a plate

1021
00:59:51.561 --> 00:59:55.520
glass window so that if it loses its batteries and like goes all George Bush

1022
00:59:55.521 --> 01:00:00.521
segway and just falls over like then it won't like crush your baby.

1023
01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.730
<v 5>Did that,
was that what happened to George Bush?</v>

1024
01:00:02.731 --> 01:00:05.250
He was on one of those segways in the battery died.
Yeah.

1025
01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.920
Either that or it wasn't even on and he's,
you know,
I don't,

1026
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:09.930
I'm not sure what was going through his head,

1027
01:00:09.931 --> 01:00:13.320
but he tried to mount up and there it just wasn't happening.
Oh No.

1028
01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:17.510
<v 2>Um,
well those things need to be on.
They have a gyroscope that keeps,
yeah.
So,</v>

1029
01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.400
but anyway,
I mean,
so,
so the point,

1030
01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:22.580
the point I'm trying to make is if you're going to build a real domestic robots

1031
01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:26.510
and someone's house is not going to be capable of crushing your fist with his

1032
01:00:26.511 --> 01:00:30.980
hand or leaping through a glass window and falling three stories and denting
the,

1033
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:35.240
<v 5>the concrete,
what the fuck?
What a fucking waste of money,
right?
First of all,</v>

1034
01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:38.720
what if it's like how cars are today?
Like,

1035
01:00:38.721 --> 01:00:42.470
if you buy like say a brand new Mustang,

1036
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.360
like a Ford Mustang Gt,

1037
01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:49.340
in the old days they used to have like 300 horsepower.

1038
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.200
They weren't that fast.
Like the new ones,
just the standard Mustang Gt.

1039
01:00:54.201 --> 01:00:57.080
You can get there over 400 horsepower.

1040
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:59.420
They're insanely fast for this.

1041
01:00:59.421 --> 01:01:02.990
Like I think it's like $30,000 or $35,000 or something like that.

1042
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:08.000
That is insane amounts of performance compared to what existed in the 1960s if

1043
01:01:08.001 --> 01:01:09.770
the robot's keep getting better and better,

1044
01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:14.771
people are going to want to have like a Ferrari or a Cottey robot.

1045
01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.770
<v 2>Well that's true.
So,
so people that are willing to lay down a premium,</v>

1046
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:22.800
and in fact I got to get Carl wrench made this short film called the gift and

1047
01:01:23.291 --> 01:01:28.291
these people have this snooty looking Butler robot that has a total bad ass,

1048
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.760
totally physically over engineered for the job he does.
And it's an awesome,

1049
01:01:33.761 --> 01:01:35.710
awesome little film.
But um,

1050
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:37.230
<v 5>and then they gave him 47 Ronin.</v>

1051
01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:40.080
I read this comic book when I was a kid when I was a kid.

1052
01:01:40.081 --> 01:01:43.350
I was super into like those black and white,

1053
01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.210
like really cool comic books,

1054
01:01:45.211 --> 01:01:49.020
like the creepy and Eerie series of your scene illustrated stuff.

1055
01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:53.550
Well the cro is kind of,
yeah,
sort of.
It's straight up black.

1056
01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.310
And this,
um,
there,

1057
01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:59.150
there was like all these compilation ones creeping Erie where all these like

1058
01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:00.090
different stories.

1059
01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:04.260
And I remember one of them from one of those types of comic books was about a

1060
01:02:04.261 --> 01:02:07.050
robot that wound up fucking this dude's wife.

1061
01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:12.300
And it was really heavy duty man because the guy tried to fight the robot and

1062
01:02:12.301 --> 01:02:16.350
the robot snapped his arm and broken front of them and the robot had this giant

1063
01:02:16.351 --> 01:02:20.100
Dick dominated.
It just don't,
yeah,
it was creepy

1064
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.550
<v 1>because it was like this guy couldn't do anything about it and this robot was</v>

1065
01:02:23.551 --> 01:02:26.040
taking over and fucking his wife.
It was,

1066
01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:29.400
it was a really fucked up video cause our comic book rather.

1067
01:02:29.401 --> 01:02:31.830
Cause I remember reading it when I was like,
God,

1068
01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:34.420
I couldn't have been more than like eight or nine,
you know,

1069
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:38.430
that's when I was like really into comic books.
That was my,
my comic book era.

1070
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.020
And so,
uh,
this,

1071
01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:45.021
this image of this bald giant robot with this giant cock snapping this guy's arm

1072
01:02:47.521 --> 01:02:51.540
after he got done fucking his wife was like so disturbing.
I was like,

1073
01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:53.730
could you imagine if that's what you have to deal with?

1074
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:58.140
It's just robot start coming along and fucking people's wives and snapping dudes

1075
01:02:58.141 --> 01:02:59.040
arms and shit.

1076
01:02:59.110 --> 01:03:01.450
<v 2>I think that's kind of the underlying fear,
right?</v>

1077
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:05.230
Of course going to be better at us and everything.
And they're black robots.

1078
01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:10.750
Can we get a yeah,
we get some of that mixed in.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1079
01:03:10.751 --> 01:03:12.890
At least it wasn't fucking him.
Yeah.

1080
01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:16.120
Well that was probably next episode two,

1081
01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:20.250
<v 1>fuck him with his own broken arm.
Pull that thing off and stuff it up his ass.</v>

1082
01:03:20.251 --> 01:03:23.220
Literally.
It could do that.
That's some scary shit,
man.

1083
01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:26.460
<v 2>Weirds for me to think about is that,
you know,</v>

1084
01:03:26.461 --> 01:03:31.020
we know that you can't beat a robot at chess.
I mean,
we can't,
I mean,

1085
01:03:31.021 --> 01:03:33.120
maybe you could if you were like a master,
right?

1086
01:03:33.121 --> 01:03:35.880
You can't be a robot at jeopardy.
It will.
Everybody's asked,

1087
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.670
you know that you can't beat them on the battlefield.

1088
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.250
Like robots have dominated a lot of different areas.

1089
01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:46.251
Like since we've been kids and we at least remember a time when you could beat a

1090
01:03:49.561 --> 01:03:52.950
robot at chess and just be a normal person who likes to play chess every now and

1091
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:55.410
the next generations.
They don't,

1092
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.490
they've never lived in a time when a robot didn't dominate them.

1093
01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:03.480
Add a lot of intellectual tasks and increasingly physical tasks.

1094
01:04:03.481 --> 01:04:07.680
Like there's going to be people born that don't remember a time when cars didn't

1095
01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:10.050
drive themselves better than humans can drive cars.

1096
01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.300
And it's interesting to think like,

1097
01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:16.740
<v 1>well how about the fact that right now we have people that have never known a</v>

1098
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:17.760
life without the Internet?

1099
01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:20.610
<v 2>Yeah.
Or being able to look things up on smart.
It's crazy.</v>

1100
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:23.800
I wanted to know what I would be like if I was one of these peak kids.

1101
01:04:23.830 --> 01:04:24.663
You know what I mean?

1102
01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:31.480
<v 1>Very,
very early though.
But as far as like most people,</v>

1103
01:04:31.481 --> 01:04:34.810
you were tuned into the Internet when you and your,
your twenties right?

1104
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.030
<v 2>Uh,
well,
I mean we had computers growing up.</v>

1105
01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:43.710
It was more like the Internet was probably 18 but I've had computers.

1106
01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:48.290
<v 1>What do you think,
like coming from like Ohio,
coming from a place like Columbus,</v>

1107
01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:52.470
what do you think is like the biggest impact that the internet has to a place

1108
01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:54.210
like that?
Because now when you go back there,

1109
01:04:54.211 --> 01:04:57.810
do you find these kids to be like more tuned in and you were,

1110
01:04:57.811 --> 01:04:58.644
when you were there any,

1111
01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:00.860
<v 2>it's definitely a communication.
Like back in the day,</v>

1112
01:05:00.861 --> 01:05:05.861
the only way I would know anybody from another school or whatever is if I've met

1113
01:05:06.051 --> 01:05:09.680
them mad a game or if I went to a roller skating rink and they were in the men's

1114
01:05:09.681 --> 01:05:14.681
bathroom and they told me to come in and stall the fuck what happened there.

1115
01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:17.883
Now I think it's

1116
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:20.590
<v 4>like a death squad,
Ohio and we'll use it.
And Death Squad,</v>

1117
01:05:20.591 --> 01:05:23.980
there was like a group of like a huge group of people that are all friends now,

1118
01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:27.680
right?
Good friends.
They're staying at each other's houses there,
you know,

1119
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.430
flying in and getting each other at the airport and they're a gang now.

1120
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:33.310
<v 1>Right?
And that's all because of,
uh,
the Internet,</v>

1121
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:36.880
all the Internet connecting all these different things in a way that's never

1122
01:05:36.881 --> 01:05:40.490
happened before,
allows all these areas like in the,

1123
01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:42.940
you just have no culture coming into them.

1124
01:05:42.941 --> 01:05:46.840
It allows them to experience an incredible variety of different things right out

1125
01:05:46.841 --> 01:05:47.830
of their fucking computer.

1126
01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:49.920
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean,
it's on specific details,</v>

1127
01:05:49.921 --> 01:05:52.050
like really specific things that you're into.

1128
01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:55.230
We wouldn't be able to get a critical mass of people that were into it.

1129
01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.100
Like co locate.

1130
01:05:57.630 --> 01:06:00.440
<v 4>Yeah.
I'll give you a big foot on a try.
If you were a big [inaudible],</v>

1131
01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:04.330
you live in any fucking town who try finding a fellow bigfoot hunter.

1132
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:08.830
That shit is hard,
man.
You can't,
you know,
order a cup of coffee.
And then,
so,
uh,

1133
01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:10.420
what do you guys think about bigfoot?
You know,

1134
01:06:10.421 --> 01:06:12.850
no one's going to talk to you about on the Internet for five minutes.

1135
01:06:12.851 --> 01:06:14.860
You get your own show.
Had a foot fetish,

1136
01:06:14.861 --> 01:06:18.940
guys trying to come to your house if you go.
Yeah,
right.
I've had guys,

1137
01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:23.050
I've had guys offer to massage my feet.
Are you a big foot lover too?

1138
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:30.250
Wait a minute.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Sasquatch,
Sasquatch.
That's what they call me,
honey.

1139
01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:32.083
Yeah,

1140
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:36.510
<v 1>the,
it's really tough to be a big foot person out there in the real world.</v>

1141
01:06:36.511 --> 01:06:40.230
But on the Internet it's easy as fuck you just join a forum everybody.

1142
01:06:40.231 --> 01:06:43.310
Shit cause this is like got a new big foot video every couple of weeks nowadays

1143
01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:45.370
<v 2>on the other end of that spectrum though,</v>

1144
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.880
don't you think it also started cheapens your relationships because like how's

1145
01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:52.450
that?
Well so you can't have like you can,

1146
01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.340
I don't know about other people,

1147
01:06:54.341 --> 01:06:59.341
maybe I'm just a Dweeb but I can maintain about two good friends but like real

1148
01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:04.180
buddies and then like anything beyond that is really,

1149
01:07:04.181 --> 01:07:08.950
there's a very narrow stripe of like acquaintances and then it's all,
you know,

1150
01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:13.000
you have all this time that you spend interacting with people online and it's a

1151
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.020
thousand people.
And so you know,
and not to assign any value judgment to it,

1152
01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:21.670
it's a different type of interaction than like intense,
full bandwidth.

1153
01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:26.020
One on one talking to somebody.
Right.
But the advantage is that you get,

1154
01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:27.550
it's one to a thousand you know,

1155
01:07:27.551 --> 01:07:30.100
you get to interact with like 909 nine more people.

1156
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:34.330
It's not as intense as just one to one but you have a bigger,

1157
01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.500
it's like more breadth and less depth is what I'm saying.
You know?

1158
01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:40.410
<v 1>That's interesting.
I think it's also something that we're,</v>

1159
01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:45.590
we have to get used to managing the managing the amount of information that

1160
01:07:46.051 --> 01:07:46.591
comes into your,

1161
01:07:46.591 --> 01:07:49.410
into your life and managing the amount of people that you're interacting with.

1162
01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:50.100
It can,

1163
01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:55.020
it can just any sort of social interaction through a message board or Facebook

1164
01:07:55.021 --> 01:07:55.950
or Twitter can,

1165
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:59.520
you could get so absorbed in communicating with all these different people that

1166
01:07:59.521 --> 01:08:02.640
you,
you will never get anything done and you'll your,
you know,
your,

1167
01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:03.900
it will eat up all your time.

1168
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:04.191
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1169
01:08:04.191 --> 01:08:08.510
And you'll be the guy looking at his damn vibrating monster cell phones all the

1170
01:08:08.511 --> 01:08:11.960
time while you're out and your friends are just like,
I hate this guy

1171
01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:16.130
<v 1>immersion.
This human merged into technology.
The,
it disturbs</v>

1172
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:17.900
<v 2>me the most when I seen people that are really,</v>

1173
01:08:17.901 --> 01:08:22.700
really addicted into role playing games.
That's where I see like,
like wow,
that's,

1174
01:08:22.730 --> 01:08:26.840
you could really get stuck in a black hole and lose your fucking life if you

1175
01:08:26.841 --> 01:08:28.860
ever met anybody.
That's a clone of anybody.

1176
01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:33.280
I have friends that are super into role playing games but also board games he

1177
01:08:33.281 --> 01:08:35.360
will get into.
But then also video games make,

1178
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:37.520
make role playing games so much easier,

1179
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:40.520
especially the massively online multiplayer stuff.

1180
01:08:40.521 --> 01:08:45.440
And a lot of times that's seems to me to be just simple escape.
Like you're just,

1181
01:08:45.441 --> 01:08:49.250
your life sucks or,
or it doesn't suck,
but it's just more fun.

1182
01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:52.640
It's way cooler than here.

1183
01:08:52.641 --> 01:08:55.550
And I had chicken shit going out and getting gold and bitches.

1184
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.800
Anyone in real life,
you're smelling cat piss in your house.
Fuck is that smell?

1185
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:04.880
Why is my beautiful couch cat piss smell?

1186
01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:07.820
I've seen this one toilet,

1187
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:12.320
horrible shit online about parents who are neglecting their children because

1188
01:09:12.321 --> 01:09:15.960
there were just completely absorbed in these online goes.

1189
01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:20.780
My wife's a child psychologist.
She had a kid who is addicted to uh,
you know,

1190
01:09:20.781 --> 01:09:23.810
one of the online games and in order to deal with him,

1191
01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:27.580
she had to find his guild master who is some,

1192
01:09:27.581 --> 01:09:29.360
like this is a kid who was like 13 or 14.

1193
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:33.830
She found his guild master who's like a,
like a 30 year old dude,
you know,

1194
01:09:33.831 --> 01:09:38.060
like in Eugene or something.
He comes up to Portland for a meeting and says,

1195
01:09:38.061 --> 01:09:39.140
hey man,
like,
you know,

1196
01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:42.590
you've got a problem and I'm going to have to limit the amount of raids you can

1197
01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:47.390
go on.
And,
and she had to,
but she had to make that human element real,

1198
01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.880
you know,
cause this kid had a real relationship with his guilt master.
They,

1199
01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:53.180
they'd hung out for hours and hours and hours.
You know,

1200
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:57.290
they were tight but they never met,
you know,
and so they weren't able to,

1201
01:09:57.470 --> 01:10:00.230
you know,
she had to bring them in to look out for this kid.
Wow.

1202
01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:03.450
Did you see aligns with the new call of duty game last night?
Oh Man.

1203
01:10:03.451 --> 01:10:06.930
Jesus Christ.
There was people there at one in the afternoon,

1204
01:10:06.931 --> 01:10:10.620
outside of a game stop.
Just like sitting in these lawn chairs and I'm like,
what?

1205
01:10:10.621 --> 01:10:14.520
Who are these people?
Savages.
And then last night I was on sunset,

1206
01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:19.290
four blocks of just straight mob people waiting in line for a video game.

1207
01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.213
And I'm like,
what the,

1208
01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:23.250
I don't get that because like I woke up this morning and it was on my front

1209
01:10:23.251 --> 01:10:25.770
porch.
Thanks Amazon.
You guys have like,
what?
Oh,

1210
01:10:25.771 --> 01:10:29.130
you got an extra seven hours or something.
Well,
yeah,

1211
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:32.900
you're not an addict though.
The community,
right.

1212
01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:37.160
They're there to chill out.
That's true.
Yeah.
Totally.
Yeah.
Look,

1213
01:10:37.161 --> 01:10:41.840
that's a fucking fun game.
That game scares the shit out of me.
Oh,
that's great.

1214
01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:45.290
I've watched Bruce buffer plays that he plays it at the airport and I was like,

1215
01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:47.780
you gotta keep that fucking game away from me.
I will lose my life.

1216
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:53.060
I'll have no life.
Forbes article about a guy named Peter Singer who's a,
like a,

1217
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:57.600
uh,
basically a consultant for anybody.
The CIA,
like all,

1218
01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:03.160
all the military infrastructure and they had him design all the like robotic

1219
01:11:03.441 --> 01:11:07.100
weaponry that's in the new call of duty and a shit is all like super legit.

1220
01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:10.320
Really realistic.
Yeah.
Jesus.

1221
01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:15.300
Those gains so immersive gotta have like 12 year old reflexes.
It's like,

1222
01:11:15.301 --> 01:11:18.300
I'm not going to go out and try to start a career as a gymnast,
you know?

1223
01:11:18.301 --> 01:11:22.260
Right now,
too old.
That's the way I feel about call of duty.
I can't,
oh,

1224
01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:27.120
you would just have to get absorbed.
You was just a really terrible

1225
01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:31.510
<v 1>first started out at quake,
but I got really good after a while I was,</v>

1226
01:11:31.570 --> 01:11:32.700
that was my addictive

1227
01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:36.380
<v 2>castle hill often Stein man,
that was old school.
That was like the first one,</v>

1228
01:11:36.381 --> 01:11:40.820
right?
The first wasn't that the first and it didn't,
it wasn't,

1229
01:11:40.821 --> 01:11:44.810
you couldn't jump or anything.
It was flat know.
Well there was Duke Nukem

1230
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:49.960
<v 1>well,
first time was the first and then came doom.
Doom.
Right,
right,
right.</v>

1231
01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:52.780
And Doom.
They named doom,
uh,

1232
01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:57.220
from that line in the color of money with Tom Cruise or a Tom cruise went out to

1233
01:11:57.221 --> 01:11:59.980
play.
This guy at Tom Cruise is like the best player in the country.

1234
01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:03.790
And he had this crazy pool cue and the guy said,
which guy in the case?
Boy.

1235
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.390
And he goes in here and he opens it up and he goes doom.

1236
01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:12.330
And the idea was that their game was so bad ass that that's what they're going

1237
01:12:12.331 --> 01:12:14.710
to do.
The whole video game ministry,
we were going to,

1238
01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:18.310
we're going to like drop some doom on them.
They did all was the 90s,

1239
01:12:18.311 --> 01:12:21.550
it was all articles about those guys like buying shitloads of Ferrari's.

1240
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:26.810
I know car Mac man have been over his um,
studios a few times of that.

1241
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:28.810
I,
those guys are really cool guys.

1242
01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.340
And Carmack is like a real rocket scientist like in his

1243
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:35.750
<v 2>bear time is that these guys are all really,
really smart.</v>

1244
01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.820
<v 1>Yeah,
he's dude,
he's beyond spark.</v>

1245
01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.130
He's one of those guys where I talked to him and I'm like,

1246
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.600
I'm not convinced we're the same species.
I'm not convinced at this guy.
He's so,

1247
01:12:45.010 --> 01:12:47.750
he's so,
so past talk,

1248
01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.410
you know like just computer wise what he's doing all day,
you know,

1249
01:12:51.411 --> 01:12:52.640
the computations that he's making,

1250
01:12:52.641 --> 01:12:56.930
the way he's redesigning these first person shooters.
He's,
he's like a super,

1251
01:12:56.931 --> 01:12:58.280
super fucking genius

1252
01:12:58.770 --> 01:13:03.660
<v 2>having lived in Seattle.
Ha.
Like you see you,
you meet these guys,
right?</v>

1253
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:08.160
The ones that have started companies and are like Madden and like the,

1254
01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:09.840
and for me they're always,

1255
01:13:09.841 --> 01:13:14.841
it seems like about five or 10 years older than me and I'm always pissed.

1256
01:13:15.271 --> 01:13:18.570
I'm always like,
damn,
if I was 10 years older,

1257
01:13:18.571 --> 01:13:22.380
like I would been on that scene of it.
I had a chance to like go nuts with it.

1258
01:13:22.381 --> 01:13:26.130
Like they have like I have a buddy who works for Bungee,
right?
He,
he,

1259
01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:30.810
he makes halo.
I mean it's a sweet job but when he was in college,

1260
01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:36.020
he wrote a textbook on how the program graphics and you know what that got him a

1261
01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:41.541
job at Bungie but it didn't get him of a Ferrari garage.

1262
01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:46.650
Like didn't get him.
Like every generation has these smart guys,

1263
01:13:46.651 --> 01:13:49.770
but whenever they have an girls and when they fall in,
you know,

1264
01:13:49.771 --> 01:13:52.830
it's all about how,
how much the field's been blown open.

1265
01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.970
Like there's a lot of stuff like low hanging fruit waiting on you.

1266
01:13:57.210 --> 01:14:00.270
Of course he probably bust my ass if you heard me say this and be like,

1267
01:14:00.271 --> 01:14:03.650
I earned it trivializes my accomplishment.

1268
01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:08.130
<v 1>He certainly did innovate in a big way in the first person shooter world.
Yeah.</v>

1269
01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.040
It was um,
him and there was another guy that was on with him with

1270
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.120
<v 3>doom and then that guy left when he made quake.
Who Guy was,
he had long hair.</v>

1271
01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:18.500
It's fabulous hair.
He's a,
yeah,

1272
01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.920
he was a very controversial video game designer himself.
And those are those,

1273
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:24.430
those are the original it guys.

1274
01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:28.180
But they went on to make quake quake two quick three.

1275
01:14:28.181 --> 01:14:31.090
Each one of them got better and more intense with the graphics.

1276
01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:32.530
And it's like that,

1277
01:14:32.531 --> 01:14:37.000
just the amount of hours of entertainment they provided with those video games.

1278
01:14:37.001 --> 01:14:40.790
It's like,
it's staggering.
And this call of duty is on that.

1279
01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:43.330
That's the next level shit that's like the highest level.

1280
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.090
What I love is it puts Hollywood to shave.

1281
01:14:46.091 --> 01:14:49.200
Like movies don't make this much money like movies or just pay.

1282
01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:53.470
They pale in comparison now to video games and way more exciting.
And so you're,

1283
01:14:53.471 --> 01:14:56.830
you get so locked in on one of those fucking games and you're creeping around

1284
01:14:56.831 --> 01:14:59.080
shooting at people understand why video,

1285
01:14:59.110 --> 01:15:03.250
why movies aren't lost leaders to video games.
Now it's almost,
it's always like,

1286
01:15:03.251 --> 01:15:06.730
yeah,
we're making a movie.
Oh,
and we're going to have a video game.
It's like,

1287
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:08.890
dude,
the money is in video games.

1288
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.330
Make a movie just to get as it like a PR campaign to get people into your video

1289
01:15:13.331 --> 01:15:16.900
game because that's where the cash money is.
That is,
yeah.
Not a bad idea.

1290
01:15:16.901 --> 01:15:21.190
Especially if you develop like one of these call of duty type franchises where

1291
01:15:21.191 --> 01:15:25.810
it just becomes,
everyone plays it.
Ice Tea is always on TV plan.

1292
01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:29.030
Doesn't he play that?
He plays gears of war two.
Right.
You know what I did?

1293
01:15:29.031 --> 01:15:32.480
I was on wards and other ones not being Nintendo dude.
I got to,

1294
01:15:32.481 --> 01:15:36.340
I went to the thrift store and I bought it like an old old school and an old
VCR.

1295
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:36.900
Whoa.

1296
01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:41.900
You know what I found like watching old school movies on a VCR and an on a

1297
01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:45.310
little bitty four by three like TV,

1298
01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:49.120
you know,
the graphics weren't as good,
right?

1299
01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:52.030
They didn't have CGI and all that stuff.
Like I'm thinking like,
uh,

1300
01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:56.820
lost boys and like terminator two and stuff.
Ready.
Good graphics,
but not the,

1301
01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.360
you watch it on that little screen.
It's convincing.
It's really low resolution.

1302
01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:05.360
Like there's a lot of stuff that you did.
It just come goes right by.
Well,

1303
01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:09.230
have you ever seen an old movie that's been brought to Blu Ray?

1304
01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:14.140
Uh,
yeah.
I think I can't.
Aliens.

1305
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.320
The second alien movie was blocked,
brought to Blueray.

1306
01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:21.850
And when you watch it on a modern television with a blue ray player,

1307
01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:25.810
it's so hokey.
Look in the fucking background.

1308
01:16:25.811 --> 01:16:30.100
There's a scene where there's a,
a,
a jet that's parked there or one of those,

1309
01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:32.260
whatever those ships,
spaceships.

1310
01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:35.560
And then the background is supposed to be like this whole warehouse area.

1311
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.540
It's so fucking fake.
I mean,
it's so obviously painted.

1312
01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:44.620
It looks terrible.
I mean,
it looks so bad.
It's so hokey.
Like,

1313
01:16:44.621 --> 01:16:47.980
oh my God.
Like you're not supposed to have this at this resolution.

1314
01:16:47.981 --> 01:16:50.890
When the director made it,
he made it for a certain resolution.

1315
01:16:50.891 --> 01:16:53.710
That's when you deal with special effects.
You've got to respect that.

1316
01:16:53.711 --> 01:16:56.050
You can't pump it up to blue ray.
Greedy bitches.

1317
01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:58.690
You know why I bought the Nintendo was but I have a daughter.

1318
01:16:58.691 --> 01:16:59.740
She's two and a half right,

1319
01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:03.430
and she is not allowed in the room when I'm playing video games because it's

1320
01:17:03.431 --> 01:17:06.980
intense.
Like I'm playing Skyrim and it's like very rare to skyram.

1321
01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.980
What is Skyram?
I'm sorry,
of life.
I had

1322
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.240
<v 2>to run away from the video game Smith.
It's basically junkie.</v>

1323
01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.010
It's in the oblivion series.
It's a,
it's one of those role playing games,

1324
01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:20.330
but it's single player so you can finish it and you can leave your life,

1325
01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.300
but it's incredibly rude.

1326
01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:24.440
You're playing against the computer in our playing on my,

1327
01:17:24.450 --> 01:17:27.500
in a total immersive world,
I mean I can talk about Skyrim forever.

1328
01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:33.100
You're running it through your PC or bought a new gaming PC four to run this

1329
01:17:33.111 --> 01:17:34.760
game for a while.

1330
01:17:34.761 --> 01:17:39.710
It was more fun to actually download all the mods to like hype up all the,

1331
01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:43.610
all the texture mapping,
all the water,
the fire,
the blood,

1332
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:46.730
that atmosphere,
the weather.
And what are you doing?

1333
01:17:46.731 --> 01:17:49.460
Like you fighting people in this game?
Yeah,
I mean,
you know,
it's,
it's,

1334
01:17:49.461 --> 01:17:52.730
it's your typical Lord of the rings rip off.
Like you're in a world where,

1335
01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:57.170
you know,
it's like that medieval stuff.
There's magic and all that.
It's really,

1336
01:17:57.171 --> 01:18:00.680
really fun.
But it's intense.
And if I was playing it,
my two year old,

1337
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.510
no way is she allowed in the room.
Right.

1338
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:05.780
And so one day she says to me something along the lines of like,
you know,

1339
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:10.040
video games are scary.
And I'm like,
that's bullshit man.

1340
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:14.180
Video Games,
Super Mario Brothers is not scary.
Right.
So I,

1341
01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.430
that's why I bought the Nintendo.
I showed her this,
I was like,

1342
01:18:16.431 --> 01:18:20.030
this is a video game,
honey.
Boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop.

1343
01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:25.460
Just so that she's not like terrified by what video games have sort of become,

1344
01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.160
you know.

1345
01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:30.480
<v 5>Well.
Yeah,
especially if you're watching a man's or a young man's,
you know,</v>

1346
01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:33.670
something that's geared towards them.
I mean obviously it's dead.

1347
01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.780
I guess there's a few women that want to go run around playing call of duty.

1348
01:18:36.781 --> 01:18:39.960
It must be,
I mean it's so popular.
It must be women playing it as well,
right?

1349
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:44.010
There's tons of but are there games that are geared specifically towards women?

1350
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:46.710
<v 2>Someone's going to be waiting outside to kick you in the balls.</v>

1351
01:18:46.711 --> 01:18:51.210
Like if you keep down this road of questioning whether women are are playing

1352
01:18:51.211 --> 01:18:52.700
these games because I mean they are,

1353
01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:56.670
<v 5>they are in a big way,
right?
I'm just guessing.
I don't know the community,
I'm no,</v>

1354
01:18:56.671 --> 01:18:58.650
there was a lot of women quake players though.

1355
01:18:58.830 --> 01:19:00.780
There was like a lot of girls that were really good.

1356
01:19:00.781 --> 01:19:04.530
They would play doubles with dudes and fuck them up and it was embarrassing.

1357
01:19:04.531 --> 01:19:08.190
It's shit cause you just get checked and quake by a check because have you seen

1358
01:19:08.191 --> 01:19:11.700
the zombies and the new call of duty?
They have a zombie mode.

1359
01:19:11.770 --> 01:19:13.620
Like it's crazy as fuck.

1360
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:18.930
<v 2>Yeah.
I hope you guys enjoy it.</v>

1361
01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:22.140
I say,
here's,
here's a,
just shows you a little bit of the zombies.

1362
01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:23.003
It's from Mashimo.

1363
01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:28.220
<v 5>This is like the trailer.
We're looking at a trailer right now.</v>

1364
01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:32.300
I'm getting really scared.
You guys.
Wow.
Graphics are amazing.

1365
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:34.250
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1366
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:37.370
<v 5>Just like what they can do now in a vid just to,
to CGI.</v>

1367
01:19:37.371 --> 01:19:41.990
Opening for a video game is incredible.
This is like really dingy.
I love that.

1368
01:19:41.991 --> 01:19:45.170
This is like post apocalyptic bus scenario.

1369
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:48.680
<v 2>It's probably generated by the game engine,
you know?
Wow.</v>

1370
01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:55.900
Oh,
this is great.
Other soldiers.
Yeah.

1371
01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:02.560
<v 0>Is there anything more fun than shooting zombies</v>

1372
01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:08.160
that is a negatory
over.
Yeah,
right.

1373
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:10.020
<v 2>I had a Zombie dream last night.
Man.</v>

1374
01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:15.940
Walking dead gets me dreaming about zombies all the damn time now and they just

1375
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:19.740
hoard you and you're pretty much just like constantly having to try to get the

1376
01:20:19.741 --> 01:20:21.120
fuck away from these zombies.

1377
01:20:21.121 --> 01:20:24.690
Isn't it funny that one of the most fearsome things that we can conjure up is a

1378
01:20:24.691 --> 01:20:29.030
human being that's dead and wants to get you.
It's not,

1379
01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:30.990
robots are kind of similar,
right?
I mean it's the,

1380
01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:33.810
we're afraid of the human form format.
Well,
we're afraid of

1381
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:35.120
<v 1>human form in,</v>

1382
01:20:35.121 --> 01:20:39.710
in a diseased manner to whether it's psychologically diseased or whether it's at

1383
01:20:39.711 --> 01:20:43.340
28 days later,
that epidemic,
that rage shit that got out,

1384
01:20:43.341 --> 01:20:45.020
that was one of the scariest movies ever.

1385
01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.670
<v 2>I got a whole horror movie theory about this.</v>

1386
01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:52.970
My theory is that the reason that like a werewolf is scarier than like a wolf is

1387
01:20:54.601 --> 01:20:58.140
because the werewolf,
because it has human traits,

1388
01:20:58.950 --> 01:21:01.770
has the capability of being evil,
right?

1389
01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:06.030
Because a wolf or like an animal or just nature is not good or evil.

1390
01:21:06.031 --> 01:21:08.360
Like you don't blame the wolf for,
for killing somebody.

1391
01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:12.570
It's like that's what a wolf does,
but as soon as you inject some human into it,

1392
01:21:12.930 --> 01:21:17.310
then you have something that's capable of just really being evil and just doing

1393
01:21:17.311 --> 01:21:19.500
something for evil's sake.

1394
01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:22.450
<v 1>Yeah.
That's,
I think that's a really accurate representation.</v>

1395
01:21:22.451 --> 01:21:25.930
If you'd stop and think about it,
it's very rare that a wolf would actually,

1396
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:30.040
I have a friend and how they think about this,
when people have a friend who,
uh,

1397
01:21:30.090 --> 01:21:32.290
had these Wolfe's,
they were,
um,

1398
01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:37.060
his pets and they were like seven eighths Timberwolf and they had like a little

1399
01:21:37.061 --> 01:21:38.770
bit of Husky or something else.
And I'm in,

1400
01:21:38.771 --> 01:21:41.860
they were essentially Wolf's man and he didn't really have good control over

1401
01:21:41.861 --> 01:21:42.694
these things.

1402
01:21:43.090 --> 01:21:47.230
And they got out and they killed a bunch of the neighbors farm animals and they,

1403
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:50.410
they didn't just kill one and ate it.
They,
they killed them for pleasure.

1404
01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.760
So most of the time I think wolves,
when they're killing,

1405
01:21:54.761 --> 01:21:57.640
they're killing out of starvation.
They're killing it because they want to eat.

1406
01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:02.760
But I think they can kill a lot for pleasure to know you got to wolves,

1407
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:07.330
wolves actually kill for pleasure.
That's the,
they,
they might,

1408
01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:11.420
if they were fattened up to,
they might just fuck with you and Jack you.

1409
01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:17.170
But the idea of a human evil humans seem to be a lot more capable of evil than

1410
01:22:17.171 --> 01:22:20.660
wolves who I,
again,
it's the competition thing.
You know,
it's,
uh,

1411
01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:25.870
it's the complexities of the possibilities of emotions.

1412
01:22:25.871 --> 01:22:26.770
It can be conjured up,

1413
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:30.640
raising a child and doing a shitty job of doing it and putting the kid in

1414
01:22:30.641 --> 01:22:33.210
horrible situations.
And,
and then all of a sudden that,

1415
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:37.510
that what that person is at the most evil barges with a wolf,

1416
01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:41.890
you know,
the worst characteristics ever of a human being merged with a wolf.

1417
01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.750
And that's what a werewolf would be like.

1418
01:22:43.751 --> 01:22:48.310
It just horrible psychotic killer animal.
It's about,
it's about

1419
01:22:48.710 --> 01:22:50.210
<v 2>doing what you're doing,
right.</v>

1420
01:22:50.211 --> 01:22:55.211
Like Hannibal Lecter freaks me the hell out because he's so aware of exactly

1421
01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.670
what is inflicting.
And it's like,

1422
01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:03.940
and that's what multiply amplifies whatever evil act he's doing is the level of

1423
01:23:04.761 --> 01:23:07.520
like satisfaction and it's getting out of it and

1424
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:11.140
<v 5>not really,
you know,
makes it worse.
I don't know.
Yeah,
it does.</v>

1425
01:23:11.141 --> 01:23:13.060
It was always disturbing it.
Well read.

1426
01:23:13.061 --> 01:23:17.970
He was and how aware of how fucked up he was,
but he didn't kick.
Yeah,
yeah,

1427
01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:23.410
yeah.
He was one of the most terrifying guys ever.
Yeah.
And that's,

1428
01:23:23.411 --> 01:23:26.080
uh,
in the,
you know,
there was two versions of him too.

1429
01:23:26.081 --> 01:23:28.990
Did you ever see the first movie?
Uh,
God,

1430
01:23:28.991 --> 01:23:32.620
it was dragon's blood or something like that.
The very far,
what was the very,

1431
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:34.260
there was a prequel to that.

1432
01:23:34.410 --> 01:23:36.090
<v 2>Right.
It came out later,
but it was,</v>

1433
01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:40.530
I think I had enough when I saw someone eating their own brain,
I was like,

1434
01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:43.650
I'm never going to forget this.
It's going to haunt me for the rest of my life.

1435
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.420
Dragging the,
that's what it,

1436
01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:50.590
<v 5>it was,
and they made that a movie later.
They eventually,
yeah,</v>

1437
01:23:50.591 --> 01:23:53.440
he had that Tattoo and that might might've been the one that freaked me out.

1438
01:23:53.441 --> 01:23:57.790
That's,
that's,
that's where he's torturing the old,
uh,
in,
in rich guy

1439
01:23:59.290 --> 01:24:03.940
anyway,
I think so.
I think scary old man,
I can't remember.

1440
01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:08.200
I don't remember who the Hannibal Lecter was either,
but he was very subtle.

1441
01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:12.970
It was a very different,
towards a different actor.
It wasn't Hopkins.
No,

1442
01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:18.830
it was,
uh,
some other guy.
But um,
yeah,
that's,
uh,

1443
01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:22.390
that idea of the genius that wants to kill you,

1444
01:24:22.670 --> 01:24:24.730
that doesn't have any remorse whatsoever.

1445
01:24:24.731 --> 01:24:27.520
And it's doing it because it's the only thing that gives them any sort of a

1446
01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:30.700
feeling.
Yeah,
that's a terrible,
terrifying thought.

1447
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:32.800
That's way scarier than robots,
right?
White people.

1448
01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:34.900
I think it's why people are the scariest thing,
you know.

1449
01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:38.080
So we have to worry about cyborgs,
not robots,
robots.

1450
01:24:38.081 --> 01:24:42.810
Maybe we'll save us from the sidewalks.
It's all on the table.
No,

1451
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:47.440
I don't can imagine it becomes like what if it becomes the first country that

1452
01:24:47.441 --> 01:24:48.680
commits their,
their,

1453
01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:52.660
their army to becoming robot cyborgs.

1454
01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:57.360
<v 2>I mean,
this is like a question with,
with whether we should implant ourselves,</v>

1455
01:24:57.361 --> 01:25:01.230
you know,
and use neural implants to do things because you think to yourself,

1456
01:25:01.231 --> 01:25:04.930
well,
like,
okay,
you know,
we have all this bio ethics and,

1457
01:25:04.931 --> 01:25:09.420
and we've decided that it's not ethical for people to do this because everyone

1458
01:25:09.421 --> 01:25:11.500
would have to get one in order to compete,
right?

1459
01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:16.620
So we're going to out loan and then it's like,
oh,
in China,
their,
their state,

1460
01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:21.060
they're mandated by the state and they're getting real productive over there.

1461
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.750
And it's like,
oh,
you know,
you think about sort of,

1462
01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:27.840
you have a macrocosm view and then you have like a microcosm.

1463
01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:32.010
Microcosm is everybody in my kid's classroom,
uh,

1464
01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:36.060
went to the doctor and got diagnosed with Adhd and now all these kids have a

1465
01:25:36.061 --> 01:25:40.350
neural implant and there are always smarter than my kid will in the macrocosm is

1466
01:25:40.351 --> 01:25:43.980
like that,
but applied to like a whole nation,
you know,
that we're competing with

1467
01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:44.460
<v 5>dude,</v>

1468
01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:47.840
that would freak you out if he were the only kid that had a natural brain class

1469
01:25:47.841 --> 01:25:50.330
and all the other kids had chips in their heads and you couldn't fuck with

1470
01:25:50.331 --> 01:25:52.620
anything.
They were saying there's a super sweet,

1471
01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.610
<v 2>sweet outer limits that's all about that.</v>

1472
01:25:55.611 --> 01:25:59.420
Where there's this one kid whose brain doesn't allow him to get this.

1473
01:25:59.421 --> 01:26:03.230
So he's basically not on like all the Internet and social networks and then all

1474
01:26:03.231 --> 01:26:04.010
the other kids get their

1475
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:07.790
<v 5>brains fried by like a virus and he's the only one that's,
that's cool.</v>

1476
01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:11.270
And he reads books and stuff and he saves everybody is,

1477
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:15.080
I liked the outer limits.
The outer limits has an awesome fucking show.

1478
01:26:15.081 --> 01:26:18.650
I love the idea of the possibilities at science fiction presents.

1479
01:26:18.651 --> 01:26:22.340
I just love that there's so many different,
when you stop and think,

1480
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:25.880
especially like we were talking about lost in space when they really had no idea

1481
01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:27.080
what the future was going to be like.

1482
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:31.640
And you get to see what their vision of it was.
It's so fascinating to me.

1483
01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:35.300
Almost more fascinating than when we like promethium to me,

1484
01:26:35.301 --> 01:26:36.920
like what we're going to be capable of.
It's like,

1485
01:26:36.921 --> 01:26:39.700
can I ask you where you doing a little bit of Microsoft touch in there and you

1486
01:26:39.701 --> 01:26:43.550
know,
you know,
oh,
she created a whole different environment.
She's got,
she now,

1487
01:26:43.551 --> 01:26:45.830
she thinks she's in the desert.
Look her.
I haven't seen you.

1488
01:26:45.831 --> 01:26:49.160
Haven't seen I should say I got a two year old.
I can't see anything.

1489
01:26:49.161 --> 01:26:52.480
You know what man?
Um,
it's,
it's,

1490
01:26:52.630 --> 01:26:56.720
it's hard to live up to the alien series and it doesn't really,

1491
01:26:56.721 --> 01:27:00.290
it stumbles a little bit,
but it's still,
I,
I seen it more than once.

1492
01:27:00.291 --> 01:27:03.470
I've seen it again in the hotel room.
I was bored,
so I watched it again.

1493
01:27:03.710 --> 01:27:07.550
It's a bad ass movie.
I mean,
visually it's stunning.
Visually alone.

1494
01:27:07.551 --> 01:27:10.280
It's worth watching because there's some incredible scenes in it just visually,

1495
01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:13.910
but the uh,
the future,
like the technology they present,

1496
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:16.910
it doesn't seem much different than what we were capable of right now.

1497
01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:21.280
That stuff really does,
you know,
influence actual science.
Like you know,

1498
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:24.920
people will take clips from these movies and everything is show them during

1499
01:27:24.921 --> 01:27:26.180
their presentations and saying,

1500
01:27:26.181 --> 01:27:31.181
this is like what we're doing specifically minority report where he's doing

1501
01:27:31.281 --> 01:27:34.220
that.
I mean that was huge for human computer interaction.

1502
01:27:34.221 --> 01:27:39.221
Hci People like suddenly that clip we're showing up like everywhere at

1503
01:27:39.501 --> 01:27:41.930
conferences and people are like,
this is what we're doing.

1504
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:46.280
Do you think we're going to get away from the keyboard interface and the near

1505
01:27:46.281 --> 01:27:47.114
future?

1506
01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:51.770
There's so much research that's going into natural human interfaces because we

1507
01:27:51.771 --> 01:27:56.771
have all this machinery upstairs that's got us geared to interacting with other

1508
01:27:57.321 --> 01:28:00.920
human beings.
The way we interact.
Face recognition,
speech recognition,

1509
01:28:00.921 --> 01:28:03.170
gesture recognition,
emotion recognition.
You know,

1510
01:28:03.171 --> 01:28:06.480
what I'm really impressed with is a speech recognition on,
there's a,

1511
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:11.550
the iPhone has a native app that comes with it called notes and those notes,

1512
01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:15.410
when you go to enter into a new note,
it has this little,

1513
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:20.210
this little button that you can press that looks like an old school microphone

1514
01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:25.460
and you can just press it and you talk into it and you know Daniel H.

1515
01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:30.680
Wilson is a bad motherfucker,
so that's it.
And boom,
it reads it.

1516
01:28:31.190 --> 01:28:32.750
Dude bind doesn't do that.

1517
01:28:32.751 --> 01:28:37.700
I have to figure out is that it's right at the bottom of the keyboard to the

1518
01:28:37.701 --> 01:28:41.000
left of the space bar.
You see how awesome it is?
Yeah.
I mean,

1519
01:28:41.001 --> 01:28:43.640
I just said it for the folks at home who are listening to this,

1520
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:48.470
I just said that into my phone and it's an instantly printed up exactly what I

1521
01:28:48.471 --> 01:28:50.810
said.
Daniel H.
Wilson is a bad motherfucker.

1522
01:28:51.330 --> 01:28:55.760
Even spelled spelled bad motherfucker correctly.
Have you done this yet?

1523
01:28:57.950 --> 01:29:01.980
Texts,
Paris Hilton.
I want to eat her asshole.
Hey man,
that's just

1524
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:06.020
<v 2>rude.
What if the Paris Hilton was listening to this?</v>

1525
01:29:06.021 --> 01:29:10.380
To Paris Hilton.
All right.
Sound good.
And it says,

1526
01:29:10.381 --> 01:29:14.280
I went to eat your ass hole and I'll send it,
I'll send it.

1527
01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:20.590
But Luckily series down is when your phone or to Siri just know.

1528
01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:23.840
Huh?
Serious.
Looked it up.
It's like,
oh,
you can't see it there.

1529
01:29:24.530 --> 01:29:27.410
<v 5>Well that sounds what you just did was very rude young man.</v>

1530
01:29:27.411 --> 01:29:30.290
If he really did send her that you are abusing technology,

1531
01:29:30.291 --> 01:29:32.540
you're a part of the problem.
I'd ever Siri,
Daddy,
I didn't do it.

1532
01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.760
Even if she wanted her asshole lifts,

1533
01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:38.840
she probably doesn't want you bringing it up like that.
It's like Jesus,

1534
01:29:38.841 --> 01:29:43.340
can we like talk about it in private after a couple of cocktails and we don't

1535
01:29:43.341 --> 01:29:47.060
need yeah,
I like it.
Okay.
I like it when I'm clean,
but uh,

1536
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:52.190
I don't need it to be on a podcast.
Bitch,
you're rude dude.

1537
01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:56.270
I just want you to,
every morning,
seven 30 before she leaves the house.
You are a,

1538
01:29:56.271 --> 01:30:00.680
you're a book robot.
Apocalypse is a New York Times bestselling book.

1539
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:03.260
That's pretty,
that's a pretty dope thing attached to your name,

1540
01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:05.450
New York Times bestselling author.

1541
01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:07.930
<v 2>I know,
man.
I love it.
I got into my Twitter handle,</v>

1542
01:30:07.931 --> 01:30:11.610
I'm going to eventually get over it,
but for now I'm still really into,

1543
01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:14.900
<v 5>no,
why would you get over that?
You're legit.
That's like what everybody wants.</v>

1544
01:30:15.230 --> 01:30:18.140
Your,
you're like,
that makes you like a black belt in writing.

1545
01:30:18.630 --> 01:30:21.560
<v 2>I think it really is important because it's in,</v>

1546
01:30:21.561 --> 01:30:25.920
in when you're writing for a living is really hard to convey to people whether

1547
01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:28.200
you're doing all right or not because people,

1548
01:30:28.201 --> 01:30:30.690
you'll be out of party and no one knows who the hell y'all,
you're a writer,

1549
01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:34.290
right?
I mean,
why would they,
it doesn't really matter how successful you get.

1550
01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:37.350
They're not going to know who you are and you're at a party and someone says,

1551
01:30:37.351 --> 01:30:39.930
what do you do?
You know?
And you're like,
I write science fiction for a living.

1552
01:30:39.931 --> 01:30:44.550
And they're like,
well good luck with that man.
Like that works out.
And it's like,

1553
01:30:44.551 --> 01:30:48.030
well no,
I'm,
I'm doing okay.
Like you know,
we can talk about it.

1554
01:30:48.031 --> 01:30:50.220
It's not embarrassing.
Like,
oh that's funny.

1555
01:30:50.221 --> 01:30:54.100
So they automatically assume that you are failed.
Yeah,
I think so.

1556
01:30:54.370 --> 01:30:57.180
Because you're not Stephen King's it cause it's really hard to make a living

1557
01:30:57.181 --> 01:30:59.880
writing science fiction.
I mean it's actually scary.
I mean the,

1558
01:30:59.890 --> 01:31:03.570
the understanding is if you say I write science fiction for a living,

1559
01:31:03.571 --> 01:31:06.690
the understanding is you do not get paid and you have another job.

1560
01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:09.570
That's interesting because I would think that there would be a big market for

1561
01:31:09.571 --> 01:31:11.550
that.
It seems to be,
yeah,

1562
01:31:11.551 --> 01:31:14.700
it seems to me there's a lot of people that are science fiction buff science

1563
01:31:14.701 --> 01:31:16.960
fictions killing it.
But like yet it's,

1564
01:31:16.970 --> 01:31:21.970
it's still sort of got all this like bad image problems from like the pulp era.

1565
01:31:23.161 --> 01:31:26.580
You know like so that's like double day.
My publisher,
they,

1566
01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:30.420
they promoted the book as a techno thriller,
not science fiction.

1567
01:31:30.421 --> 01:31:34.410
It's a techno thriller because there's like a science fiction ghetto.

1568
01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:38.040
There's like a science fiction sub disjunction.
Yeah.

1569
01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:40.950
And if you fall into that then you go into the science fiction.

1570
01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:45.270
You don't go into the mainstream popular,
you don't go on the front table.

1571
01:31:45.271 --> 01:31:47.760
You go into the science fiction area.
That's so weird.

1572
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:52.170
You know what pisses me off?
It's like you,
science fiction is a bad word.

1573
01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.160
Like people,
the most popular book is like 50 shades of gray,

1574
01:31:56.161 --> 01:32:00.100
like it's fucking fairest science.
What do you think

1575
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.450
<v 3>that's about man,</v>

1576
01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:06.480
as a writer and you see this poorly written bondo bondage book and it's doing

1577
01:32:07.241 --> 01:32:11.340
really well as Bondo,
not bondo.
That's a shift for your cars bond.
Uh,

1578
01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.790
you know bondage sadomasochistic weird sexual thing.

1579
01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:17.860
There's a puddle and that's about all you're really handsome guy.

1580
01:32:17.861 --> 01:32:20.980
Likes to hurt girls.
Doesn't even like do it on purpose or something like that.

1581
01:32:21.190 --> 01:32:23.950
I haven't read it.
You read it dude.
I started looking at your eyes.

1582
01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.410
He was trying to lie to me.
I've seen a lot of people,

1583
01:32:26.411 --> 01:32:29.620
I've seen a lot of people reading it in public and I'm also kind of strange.

1584
01:32:29.650 --> 01:32:33.280
That's like a porno when I just have a penthouse in public.
I know,
but I kinda,

1585
01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:34.690
I kinda like it.

1586
01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:42.960
Dirty,
dirty bitch.
Yeah,
you're right.
I mean,
think about it that way.
Yeah.

1587
01:32:42.970 --> 01:32:45.370
Maybe it's girls like putting out a signal.
Like they're down.

1588
01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:50.410
I had a friend who dated this girl and she,
they were normal and he said she,

1589
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:52.600
she got this book,
read the book,

1590
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:56.980
and then the next time they were together she asked him to spit in her mouth and

1591
01:32:56.981 --> 01:33:00.340
he was like,
what the fuck?
She goes do it spelling mouth.
And he was like,

1592
01:33:00.341 --> 01:33:02.830
what the fuck are you doing?
I'm reading this book,

1593
01:33:02.831 --> 01:33:05.850
50 shades of gray and I'm just getting really excited about it.
And he was like,

1594
01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:06.840
what the fuck are you reading?

1595
01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:10.180
So he started like reading like what she was reading and trying to figure out

1596
01:33:10.181 --> 01:33:13.400
why she wanted him to spit in her mouth.
I was at a,

1597
01:33:15.650 --> 01:33:19.330
or Econ is this science fiction convention in Portland,
right?

1598
01:33:19.330 --> 01:33:24.330
So we have a hotel room for the SCIFI convention and my friend rents porno right

1599
01:33:26.110 --> 01:33:29.440
on the TV.
And at the beginning,
and I've never seen this before,

1600
01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:32.830
at the beginning before they played the porn,
right?

1601
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:38.070
There's a message that says these are unrealistic scenarios.

1602
01:33:38.411 --> 01:33:43.390
Do not try this.
These people are like trained.
It was like the whole like,

1603
01:33:43.391 --> 01:33:47.310
do not try this at home.
And then of course it's just typical pornography,
right?

1604
01:33:47.370 --> 01:33:51.520
Just very large objects going in very small places.
And it's true.

1605
01:33:51.521 --> 01:33:55.830
Like I don't know if that's just a hotel thing that's just like nothing.

1606
01:33:56.460 --> 01:34:00.760
But you can imagine that hotels are like,
we really need to have a,
you know,

1607
01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:01.141
have a,

1608
01:34:01.141 --> 01:34:03.820
a little disclaimer at the beginning of his people are hurting each other.

1609
01:34:03.821 --> 01:34:08.680
They're getting,
they're getting rowdy.
Oh we're spending a fortune on sheets.

1610
01:34:08.890 --> 01:34:12.760
If you talk to anybody that's in the medical profession that's done any work in

1611
01:34:12.761 --> 01:34:13.690
the emergency room,

1612
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:16.540
they would tell you about all the various things that people stuffed in their

1613
01:34:16.541 --> 01:34:20.680
body and then got stuck up there.
And it's,
it's crazy man.

1614
01:34:20.681 --> 01:34:23.440
I had a friend who they had to pull a light bulb by this dude's ass,

1615
01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:25.750
one of those twisty light bulbs.
You,

1616
01:34:25.810 --> 01:34:28.430
those like they're slightly thicker glass cause it Kinda twisty.

1617
01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:31.000
Elisa wasn't a fluorescent broken.

1618
01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:36.160
It had broken in his ass.
They had to pull this out of his ass.

1619
01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:37.950
Dude,

1620
01:34:37.950 --> 01:34:42.950
like gingerly had to like walk him cause he was afraid that if he closed down on

1621
01:34:42.971 --> 01:34:47.260
his ass it would shatter inside of his ass and just shards.

1622
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:49.510
And there's a video of a guy doing that very thing.

1623
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:53.950
It's a video of a guy with a cop.
Oh my God,
it's horrific this time he,

1624
01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:56.320
he doesn't do what a light bulb but he does it with a Collagen,

1625
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:58.010
which is even because it's a

1626
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:03.250
<v 5>heavy shot glass jar and it breaks off inside of him and he's pulling these</v>

1627
01:35:04.191 --> 01:35:09.191
chunks of glass with blood and it's all falling out of his ass and is one of the

1628
01:35:09.441 --> 01:35:12.770
most disturbing things you could ever see on the Internet and welcome.

1629
01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:15.530
Keep in mind if you see it,
you can't unsee.
Yeah,

1630
01:35:15.531 --> 01:35:19.510
you don't want to see it but you do want to see it.
I can't even watch to know.

1631
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:22.720
I don't like it cause it's harsh.
I just feel like Tasha is,

1632
01:35:22.721 --> 01:35:26.810
should just rename it to somebody is about to get a compound fracture.

1633
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:32.030
Wait for it.
He's like the new faces of death and you never know.
Right.

1634
01:35:32.031 --> 01:35:35.180
It could just be like some old lady crossing the street or like a guy taking a

1635
01:35:35.181 --> 01:35:38.360
drink of milk and then compound fracture.
You want to see a broken toe,

1636
01:35:38.361 --> 01:35:42.560
a horrifically broken toe.
Oh,
I gotta look at it.
Isn't yours?
No.

1637
01:35:42.561 --> 01:35:44.890
Anthony [inaudible].
He's a fighter.

1638
01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:48.260
Fights in the UFC and he just had to withdraw from a fight because of a broken

1639
01:35:48.261 --> 01:35:51.020
toe.
It's pretty incredible.
You want to see it?

1640
01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:53.900
Do you want to say it?
I like to,

1641
01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:58.620
I like to use the VCR method and lower the resolution by squinting.
Yeah.
Okay.

1642
01:35:58.630 --> 01:36:01.940
Then I'm not gonna.
I'm not gonna show it to,
I'm not going to show it to you,

1643
01:36:01.941 --> 01:36:03.650
but it's one of the craziest things I've ever seen.

1644
01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:07.400
I did that look good or I do like the thing where I'm just looking at the bottom

1645
01:36:07.401 --> 01:36:11.180
left of the screen,
so I'm like,
I could see it like an arm.
Yeah.

1646
01:36:11.181 --> 01:36:14.170
You remember the first time you saw like someone die on online,

1647
01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:17.190
like the first video of like the Budd Dwyer video or something like that.

1648
01:36:17.191 --> 01:36:18.680
You're like,
Oh wow,
that's a guy dying.

1649
01:36:18.710 --> 01:36:21.020
That's what it looks like when someone dies.
Well,

1650
01:36:21.021 --> 01:36:23.970
you used to have to like go through all the trouble to get faces of death.

1651
01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:28.160
It was a huge deal.
And you know,
now it's like you're waiting for the bus.

1652
01:36:28.161 --> 01:36:29.990
It's like I think I'm gonna Watch 15 people die.

1653
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:35.410
Faces a death was the same era for me as a friend who had one of those barn yard

1654
01:36:36.381 --> 01:36:41.300
porns.
There was a few of those portions that were going around that were like so

1655
01:36:41.301 --> 01:36:45.290
grainy and CD and just,
Oh,
just horrendous.

1656
01:36:45.291 --> 01:36:47.960
You just got to think about what it was like to be this poor girl.

1657
01:36:47.961 --> 01:36:52.220
There was this blowing this donkey and the actual VHS tapes are always sticky.

1658
01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:55.960
Sticker's ripped off.
Sometimes you,

1659
01:36:56.030 --> 01:37:01.030
the tape would get fucking broken and spool up and there were horrible,

1660
01:37:01.281 --> 01:37:05.240
horrible videos and it was like the resolution was terrible,
you know?
But,

1661
01:37:05.250 --> 01:37:09.350
but at least there was like a little bit of pageantry.
Yes,
that's the wrong word.

1662
01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:09.860
No,

1663
01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:14.860
but gravity associated with the whole act of witnessing this terrible thing.

1664
01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:19.700
It wasn't so easy.
You're right.
It was a big deal.

1665
01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:23.280
Like we planned it out.
Like one guy even had to watch the door,
right?

1666
01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:27.380
Like one guy watched the door and we watched it downstairs on this light is at

1667
01:37:27.381 --> 01:37:28.580
the bottom.
Like he was like,

1668
01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:32.150
he stood like halfway up the stairs so he could like still lean down and look

1669
01:37:32.151 --> 01:37:35.060
over at this.
It was a little shitty ass fucking television.

1670
01:37:35.061 --> 01:37:38.330
We were watching this on and when we were watching that girl below the horse

1671
01:37:38.370 --> 01:37:41.600
were like,
what the fuck we talk,
we could go to jail at any moment.

1672
01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:44.610
Someone could cause going to kick the door in.

1673
01:37:45.170 --> 01:37:49.190
I don't remember how old we were,
but it wasn't more than like high school age.

1674
01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:50.570
It was somewhere around high school age.

1675
01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.470
It was just the craziest thing to see ever to watch this check off sex with

1676
01:37:54.471 --> 01:37:59.010
animals.
Like there was a dog,
she,
she blew a dog.
She will a donkey.

1677
01:37:59.011 --> 01:38:01.350
Like there was a couple of different animals that she had her have sex with.

1678
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:05.190
It's so weird.
Yeah.
That was so hard to do.
It's like,

1679
01:38:05.191 --> 01:38:10.170
and we felt bizarre for like days afterwards.
You know,
it's kind of like,

1680
01:38:10.171 --> 01:38:14.340
Hey,
kids today,
they just laugh about that shit.
They think it's hilarious.
Yeah.

1681
01:38:14.341 --> 01:38:17.430
Rolls off of them.
I mean,
they,
they witnessed so much more,

1682
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:22.130
so much faster than we ever did.
And I dunno.
Yeah,
there's a,

1683
01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:26.340
there's a weirdness to this life for them that just never existed for as far as

1684
01:38:26.341 --> 01:38:30.450
we know,
for any human ever.
This,
this weird connection to almost anything.

1685
01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:32.670
If you leave your kid out in the world with an iPhone,

1686
01:38:32.671 --> 01:38:33.720
when you send them out in the world,

1687
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:37.650
you're giving them access to fucking everything.
That's the whole world.
I mean,

1688
01:38:37.651 --> 01:38:41.700
they're not going to probably get taken by Internet scammers from their iPhone,

1689
01:38:41.701 --> 01:38:42.660
but almost everything else,

1690
01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:45.860
<v 2>there's a times article right now where they're interviewing people like a bunch</v>

1691
01:38:45.861 --> 01:38:50.360
of different people about porn in whom the impact on society and then that

1692
01:38:50.361 --> 01:38:52.940
there's somebody that says exactly that.
They're like,
look,
you know,

1693
01:38:52.941 --> 01:38:55.340
kids have access to everything.

1694
01:38:55.341 --> 01:38:59.120
It's really impossible to limit that access.
And so,

1695
01:38:59.121 --> 01:39:03.380
and they're talking about how all this easy access to porn has affected people's

1696
01:39:03.381 --> 01:39:06.300
sex lives.
And apparently,
uh,
you know,

1697
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:11.300
certain they go through and they catalog which sex acts occur in the majority of

1698
01:39:11.301 --> 01:39:15.200
videos.
So they can say like 88% of videos have a facial,
you know,

1699
01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.870
and then they look and they,
there's a direct correlation.

1700
01:39:17.871 --> 01:39:22.670
What happens in those videos is,
is what people want to do a at home,

1701
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:25.820
you know,
that's funny.
So like,
but sex goes way up.

1702
01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:31.400
They said like 80% had bud sacs and then 4% of people actually had bought sex,

1703
01:39:31.730 --> 01:39:32.563
which is,

1704
01:39:32.730 --> 01:39:37.320
<v 5>what do you mean 80% in the video?
The video,
90% of the people who did it,</v>

1705
01:39:37.321 --> 01:39:38.500
but in real life,
4% of people.

1706
01:39:38.690 --> 01:39:42.560
<v 2>Yeah,
because there's a correlation between demands and what's in the videos.</v>

1707
01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:47.540
Not so much a correlation between what actually happens because the gatekeepers

1708
01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:52.400
in this whole process or the females.
Well that's why we like go fuck yourself.

1709
01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:53.220
Yeah.

1710
01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:57.240
<v 5>What's,
we have really talked about like it must be so crazy in the gay community</v>

1711
01:39:57.241 --> 01:39:58.074
because there's

1712
01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:02.020
<v 2>female.
I said the same thing to her.
I said,</v>

1713
01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:06.910
thank God you guys are slowing us down and God knows what's happening in that

1714
01:40:06.911 --> 01:40:08.710
community because there's no break.

1715
01:40:08.850 --> 01:40:09.810
<v 5>Yeah.
Believe me,</v>

1716
01:40:09.811 --> 01:40:13.170
there's no way it would be the same if men and women and we're the same,

1717
01:40:13.230 --> 01:40:18.030
like as far as like our voracity.
It would be just like gay people and it's not,

1718
01:40:18.031 --> 01:40:21.420
you know,
the,
the men have to tone down for the women.
It's a,

1719
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:24.780
it doesn't exist in the gay community and they have a totally different bizarre

1720
01:40:24.781 --> 01:40:25.830
operating dynamic.

1721
01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.470
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah.
Well I'm sure that,
that everybody acclimated to it.
I guess they have</v>

1722
01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:34.550
<v 5>suppression though,
that way,
you know,
certainly they know each other,</v>

1723
01:40:34.730 --> 01:40:36.080
they understand each other better.

1724
01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:39.540
<v 2>Yeah.
I think that that also,
that relationship,</v>

1725
01:40:39.541 --> 01:40:43.250
whenever you have gay friends and you see how the relationships,
you know,

1726
01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:45.510
to the extent that,
that you see that if you're,

1727
01:40:45.511 --> 01:40:46.920
if you're a heterosexual and you're,

1728
01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:50.190
I mean obviously you're not seeing the whole story.

1729
01:40:50.191 --> 01:40:52.440
They're not seeing your whole story and your bedroom either.

1730
01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:54.730
But I think that the,
those types of relationships,

1731
01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:58.720
each person has their own specific one and it affects each other.
You see that?

1732
01:40:58.721 --> 01:41:00.290
Like,
you know,
uh,

1733
01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:04.000
my friends that are gay tend to have like relationships where they trust each

1734
01:41:04.001 --> 01:41:06.190
other a lot and,
and they're a little looser.

1735
01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:09.670
It's not a lot of jealousy and stuff.
Maybe I just have weird friends.

1736
01:41:09.671 --> 01:41:14.020
I don't know.
But,
uh,
but it's interesting,
you know,
you rub off on each other.

1737
01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:17.920
<v 1>Yeah.
It's a,
it's interesting that they,
it's like I just,</v>

1738
01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:21.570
it's just a different dynamic,
you know?
And for whatever reason,

1739
01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:24.360
the real issue lies in the fact that it's not legal everywhere,

1740
01:41:24.361 --> 01:41:26.310
that they don't share the same rights as people everywhere.

1741
01:41:26.710 --> 01:41:30.660
That to me is really bizarre because if two people want to pretend to be the

1742
01:41:30.661 --> 01:41:33.990
husband,
why,
what do you give a fuck?
As long as they're together,
you know,

1743
01:41:33.991 --> 01:41:36.810
if one guy wants to pretend he's a woman,
what do you care?
Why do you care?

1744
01:41:36.811 --> 01:41:39.550
They're just two people that want to get married.
And the idea that you,

1745
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:40.770
you would have to be,

1746
01:41:40.771 --> 01:41:44.910
have a certain sexual proclivity in order to engage in this marital contract.

1747
01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:49.320
This is so bizarre.
And if you allow any sort of bizarre,

1748
01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:52.350
any sort of discrimination that doesn't make any sense of objectively,

1749
01:41:52.351 --> 01:41:56.100
if you allow any of that in our world,
then it's going to come at you too,
man.

1750
01:41:56.101 --> 01:42:00.270
And if you don't take a stand for gay people that want to get married and the

1751
01:42:00.271 --> 01:42:01.170
first whatever reason,

1752
01:42:01.171 --> 01:42:05.550
they're being persecuted by numbskulls and overly religious crazy people,

1753
01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:07.200
if you don't take a stand for them,

1754
01:42:07.201 --> 01:42:09.930
then who's going to take a stand for you when it comes in your direction?

1755
01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:13.800
Who's going to take a stand for humanity because it's just a person who happens

1756
01:42:13.801 --> 01:42:17.970
to like men.
Why do you let them marry each other?
You fuck,
what do you care?

1757
01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:19.470
<v 2>Yeah,
it doesn't make any sense.</v>

1758
01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:23.460
I think there are a lot of like cultural mores or whatever,
right?

1759
01:42:23.461 --> 01:42:24.510
However you pronounce that word,

1760
01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:28.380
like sort of stuff that people just think is obvious,
you know?

1761
01:42:28.381 --> 01:42:33.060
And it's just accepted.
But Times change,
you know,
people are relationships.

1762
01:42:33.061 --> 01:42:35.490
How human beings interact with each other.
You know,

1763
01:42:35.491 --> 01:42:38.110
even just like you think about people interacting over the computer,

1764
01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.110
stuff like that.
All that stuff changes.

1765
01:42:40.111 --> 01:42:44.850
And so all of the cultural stuff has to change too.
And you know,
sometimes I'm,

1766
01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:48.870
I'm glad that we do have a full spectrum of,

1767
01:42:48.871 --> 01:42:52.080
some people are just willing to embrace anything new,
right?

1768
01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.250
And especially with technology,

1769
01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:55.770
you have all kinds of new shit getting thrown at us.
Like all the time,

1770
01:42:56.010 --> 01:42:59.130
other people dig in their heels and they say,
let's take it slow,
you know,

1771
01:42:59.131 --> 01:43:00.240
let's not go nuts here.

1772
01:43:00.570 --> 01:43:04.350
And I think that's a good thing because we have so much change coming at us so

1773
01:43:04.351 --> 01:43:09.190
fast that we need some people that are willing to embrace it and experiment with

1774
01:43:09.191 --> 01:43:12.840
it.
Other people that are,
and I'm not,
I'm off of the gay thing now,
by the way,

1775
01:43:12.841 --> 01:43:16.350
I'm on the technology.
I'm just going to talk to you about this.

1776
01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:21.720
I'm until like,
I'm on to like people who are saying,
you know,
um,
you know,

1777
01:43:21.721 --> 01:43:24.960
like that,
that,
that we shouldn't,

1778
01:43:24.970 --> 01:43:28.350
is experiment with like stem cells and that we shouldn't,
you know,

1779
01:43:28.351 --> 01:43:32.100
all of this like scientific,
uh,
discovery that's out there and people are saying,

1780
01:43:32.101 --> 01:43:36.130
no,
no,
no,
no.
We shouldn't study it.
We should slow down.
Um,
you know,
it's,

1781
01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:39.180
it is nice to,
to,
to have some people that want to slow things down.

1782
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:40.371
<v 1>Well,
it's,</v>

1783
01:43:40.371 --> 01:43:44.870
it's bizarre when religion actually tries to interfere with science in,
in,

1784
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.370
in ways that don't make any sense.

1785
01:43:46.371 --> 01:43:51.371
Like one of my favorite ones was the pope talking to Stephen Hawkings and he

1786
01:43:51.441 --> 01:43:52.010
told him that it

1787
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:56.030
<v 3>was okay to explore the nature of the universe,</v>

1788
01:43:56.420 --> 01:44:01.420
but it wasn't okay to explore the origins of the big bang because that would be

1789
01:44:01.521 --> 01:44:05.870
like questioning God himself.
Isn't that hilarious?

1790
01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:11.240
Religions to me,
like he was like telling him what I mean,

1791
01:44:11.241 --> 01:44:14.540
this was like our lifetime and I'll,
I mean,
Hawkings still alive.

1792
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:17.900
So this was in our lifetime.
The pope was telling this guy,

1793
01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.710
he's still studying the big bang.
It's just,

1794
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.500
it's so silly that that could ever get to a point where it can happen where this

1795
01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:29.000
nutty cult member actually could get into a position.
And in this day and age,

1796
01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:32.120
that could mean it didn't have an influence other than to make a humorous

1797
01:44:32.121 --> 01:44:36.980
anecdote.
But it's still,
what if he listens his notions really.

1798
01:44:36.981 --> 01:44:41.090
I mean,
who knows what his own psychological proclivity might be.

1799
01:44:41.091 --> 01:44:45.230
There are some people that are subject to the influence of people that you

1800
01:44:45.231 --> 01:44:49.040
wouldn't be or I wouldn't be.
And it uh,
you know,
in certain cases,

1801
01:44:49.041 --> 01:44:53.450
like someone who is in a big position of power,
like a pope.
Well,
you know,

1802
01:44:53.451 --> 01:44:56.390
for thousands and thousands of years,
religion is the bedrock.

1803
01:44:56.391 --> 01:44:59.810
It's what keeps people United.
It's what keeps him alive.

1804
01:44:59.811 --> 01:45:02.570
I mean to have a shared culture,
you know,
I'm,

1805
01:45:02.571 --> 01:45:05.480
I'm like I have native American in my background,
right.

1806
01:45:05.481 --> 01:45:08.030
And I'm always really growing up,

1807
01:45:08.031 --> 01:45:10.700
I was always interested in reading the history and thinking about,
you know,

1808
01:45:10.701 --> 01:45:15.701
why did native Americans get basically wiped out and also aborigines and things.

1809
01:45:16.770 --> 01:45:20.330
And you think about the fact that like in Australia,

1810
01:45:20.630 --> 01:45:22.340
all the different tribes in Australia,

1811
01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:25.070
they all spoke different languages and they were all like,

1812
01:45:25.071 --> 01:45:28.310
they all had a certain amount of land and they were kind of in stasis.

1813
01:45:28.311 --> 01:45:30.100
I mean they,
they fought with each other but,

1814
01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:32.750
but everything always kind of ended up the same.

1815
01:45:32.751 --> 01:45:36.460
There was no one group that conquered all of Australia.

1816
01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:40.940
And then you think about Europe and other more bellicose places.
China,
you know,

1817
01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:42.260
you've got here,

1818
01:45:42.261 --> 01:45:47.261
you've got places where they in force one culture on massive groups of people,

1819
01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:51.470
right through religion and they're incredibly effective.

1820
01:45:51.690 --> 01:45:55.310
Then they travel all over the world and white people out.
They worked together,

1821
01:45:55.311 --> 01:45:59.990
they build cities.
There's great utility in having people like my,
you know,

1822
01:45:59.991 --> 01:46:04.160
think alike like this.
But then you know,
there's also a drawback.

1823
01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:08.930
The drawback can be that it's resistant to change and it doesn't,

1824
01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:13.460
uh,
you know,
adapt for nuisance new circumstances.

1825
01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:17.720
So it's almost like you could look at religion as an operating system on a cell

1826
01:46:17.721 --> 01:46:22.270
phone.
It allows you to get things done,

1827
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:26.960
but if you don't update it and continually updated with the latest versions,

1828
01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:30.080
well science naturally updates itself.

1829
01:46:30.110 --> 01:46:34.700
You can always go back and prove something wrong,
prove it for yourself,
fix it,

1830
01:46:34.701 --> 01:46:38.180
update it with new information.
I mean,
that's the strength of science.

1831
01:46:38.181 --> 01:46:40.040
But that's scary because you,

1832
01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:43.190
there is no bedrock and you know how much you don't know.

1833
01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:46.540
And you really have to trust yourself a lot,
I think,
to,
to,

1834
01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:51.620
to really trust science because you are acknowledging that you don't know

1835
01:46:51.841 --> 01:46:52.151
everything.

1836
01:46:52.151 --> 01:46:55.050
You're allowing a thought into your mind that a lot of people do not find

1837
01:46:55.051 --> 01:46:57.900
comforting.
And that is no one is watching this thing.

1838
01:46:57.901 --> 01:47:01.440
No one's paying attention to then that we essentially live in a soup of madness

1839
01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:05.610
now.
And that is,
that is the world that we actually exist in.

1840
01:47:05.611 --> 01:47:09.900
And we want to pretend that we're in this strange Sandra Bullock movie where

1841
01:47:09.901 --> 01:47:12.150
everything's gonna be okay and everything's going to be normal.

1842
01:47:12.151 --> 01:47:15.840
And one of the best ways to do that is to think that there was a guy that lived

1843
01:47:15.841 --> 01:47:18.530
a long time ago that came back from the dead and he's,

1844
01:47:18.670 --> 01:47:20.280
he absolved you of all your bullshit.

1845
01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:23.250
You just got to take them into your heart and your good no matter how bad you've

1846
01:47:23.251 --> 01:47:26.550
been in the past.
Well,
and they go with that.
It's not about you believing,

1847
01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:30.810
it's about lots of people believing it's that you draw strength on other people.

1848
01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:34.140
Yes.
Good point.
I think it's a natural human thing to do.

1849
01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:37.890
I think it's not wrong system.
I think it's like a scaffolding for morals.

1850
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:40.710
I think of it as a policy.
Like it's,
it's a,

1851
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:43.350
it's a set of behaviors,
you know,

1852
01:47:43.351 --> 01:47:47.880
for certain situations will behave this way and,
and yeah,

1853
01:47:47.881 --> 01:47:50.910
and it glues people together and sort of like when a guy wears a suit and a tie,

1854
01:47:50.911 --> 01:47:54.570
he's going to be a gentleman.
The gentleman with the gentlemen care for a drink,

1855
01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:55.321
you know,

1856
01:47:55.321 --> 01:47:59.700
I mean it got us to say that if you're wearing like Moy Thai shorts and flip

1857
01:47:59.701 --> 01:48:03.420
flops and you sweat and you know,
I don't want to have anything to do with you.

1858
01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:06.140
They wouldn't say with the gentleman liker cocktail,
the bill like,
sorry,

1859
01:48:06.150 --> 01:48:08.670
you can't come in here naked with flip flops on.
You know,

1860
01:48:08.671 --> 01:48:13.671
we want you to look in this very specific uniform way and that is a,

1861
01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:16.380
that's how I know I can predict your behavior.

1862
01:48:16.381 --> 01:48:19.300
You're going to behave like a gentleman.
Well that,
believe it or not,

1863
01:48:19.301 --> 01:48:21.540
I can make anything tie back to robotics,

1864
01:48:21.541 --> 01:48:25.950
but I believe you could that that actually ties back in when you build a robot,

1865
01:48:25.951 --> 01:48:29.430
right?
What you choose to make it look like is a promise.

1866
01:48:29.431 --> 01:48:31.860
It's a guarantee to the person that's going to interact with it.

1867
01:48:31.861 --> 01:48:36.030
So if you build a robot that looks just exactly like a human being than anybody

1868
01:48:36.031 --> 01:48:39.210
that walks up to that robot is it's going to damn well expect that that robot is

1869
01:48:39.211 --> 01:48:41.850
going to be as smart as a human being.
If you say what's up buddy?

1870
01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:46.410
It's going to say,
hey there pal.
And if it doesn't,
people get mad,
you know,

1871
01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:51.440
which is why I don't think we're going to see super realistic like androids

1872
01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:56.020
anytime soon because we don't have the full package.
You know,

1873
01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:58.320
we may be able to make it look really realistic,

1874
01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:03.120
but we can't make it behave in a really realistic way.
Why is that?
I mean,

1875
01:49:03.121 --> 01:49:06.250
just because that's the hard part is that,
I mean it's,

1876
01:49:06.450 --> 01:49:08.040
it's a temporary hurdle isn't it?

1877
01:49:08.100 --> 01:49:13.100
I mean with the way science continually grows in this exponential manner to see

1878
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:14.700
if they could figure out,

1879
01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:20.040
they can sort of figure out how to mimic various aspects of the actual human.

1880
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:22.140
Yeah.
I mean we're making progress,

1881
01:49:22.170 --> 01:49:26.160
but you think they'll actually engineering egos and things like that?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1882
01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:28.650
I mean self-respect.
They'll copy it.
They'll make it,

1883
01:49:28.651 --> 01:49:32.000
they'll mimic it to the extent that you can't tell the difference.
What if they,

1884
01:49:32.010 --> 01:49:37.010
what if robots start like revenge beatings waiting for people behind cars and

1885
01:49:38.211 --> 01:49:41.650
people talk shit at don't on a door knobs beat the fuck out.

1886
01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:45.540
I think that'd be a math function.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it would be.
You would have to,

1887
01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:48.220
is there a way you could ever like in the alien

1888
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:51.360
<v 5>series,
like we've been engineered to never harm a human being.</v>

1889
01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:56.910
<v 2>I love those aliens row.
I love Bishop.
She can't</v>

1890
01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:01.400
<v 5>no fucked up.
Like the first guy was good too,
man.</v>

1891
01:50:01.850 --> 01:50:05.180
The first guy was good to spoiler alert.
Spoiler alert.
It permeates.
Yes.

1892
01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:08.010
<v 2>Yeah.
Oh yeah.
What's the most</v>

1893
01:50:08.110 --> 01:50:11.290
<v 5>substantial?
That awesome actor.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That dude,</v>

1894
01:50:11.650 --> 01:50:15.430
I don't remember his name.
David named him too.
Which is yeah.
Which is weird.

1895
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:19.270
All right.
I'll tell you who he is.
We'll give the guy his proper credit.
Yeah.

1896
01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:24.370
Yeah.
But he's amazing in it.
It's um,

1897
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:29.570
folks,
that dude's name.
I am DB.
We're done.
I am beep beep.

1898
01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:34.820
That movie.
He got a 7.3 rating.
That's pretty fucking good.

1899
01:50:34.890 --> 01:50:37.970
That is our in home boy.
What's his name?

1900
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:45.360
<v 2>So they announced we got Anne Hathaway is going to be and rub apocalypse and</v>

1901
01:50:45.361 --> 01:50:49.560
hassle.
Ish came official yesterday.
Wow.
Yeah.

1902
01:50:49.561 --> 01:50:52.590
I don't even know what parts you're going to play,
but I'm kind of excited.

1903
01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:55.470
She's sort of a bad ass.
Is she really?
Well,

1904
01:50:55.471 --> 01:50:58.710
I mean as Catwoman and stuff like she pulled it off any,

1905
01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:00.180
any of that superhero stuff.

1906
01:51:00.210 --> 01:51:04.290
If you can dress up in a gimmicky costume and make it and pull it off and make

1907
01:51:04.291 --> 01:51:06.120
it seem real,
then you've got my respect.

1908
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:10.680
<v 5>Right.
Can't find this dude.
I see.</v>

1909
01:51:10.710 --> 01:51:15.270
I should know his name.
God Damn it really?
Is it Rafe?
Spall?
No,
no.

1910
01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:18.770
That's not it
on the fucker.

1911
01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:23.990
All right.
I give up.
I give up props to him,
whoever it is,
whoever he is.

1912
01:51:23.991 --> 01:51:26.150
He's a bad motherfucker.
I don't seem,

1913
01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:28.310
they don't seem to have his photo here in the cast.

1914
01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:32.380
He was the robot guy or it's not Guy Pearce.
I don't know.

1915
01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:40.780
Um,
I give up.
Sorry.
Is it people are screaming his name right now.
Yeah.

1916
01:51:40.810 --> 01:51:43.680
I'm sure someone on Twitter will tell me who the guy's name is,
but yeah,
he,

1917
01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:47.800
he played an amazing robot.
He did the best job in my opinion,

1918
01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:52.660
in any robot movie of walking that creepy line where you think he almost feel

1919
01:51:52.661 --> 01:51:57.661
slighted but doesn't because he really doesn't have any program motions,

1920
01:51:57.810 --> 01:52:01.090
but he's recognizing that you're trying to slight him.
Yeah.
You know,

1921
01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:04.660
it's very fascinating.
It's like,
it's worth seeing really a,

1922
01:52:04.690 --> 01:52:09.620
for some of his scenes alone,
especially,
I don't want,
I can't tell you too much

1923
01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:12.890
<v 2>like a really realistic humanoid or android.</v>

1924
01:52:12.891 --> 01:52:17.120
I mean like there's a momentum behind the emotions,
right?

1925
01:52:17.121 --> 01:52:19.610
So even if it doesn't feel pissed off,

1926
01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:24.590
if it looks and all the other ways behaves completely consistently with how a

1927
01:52:24.591 --> 01:52:25.580
human would behave,

1928
01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:28.850
then you're going to be sitting there waiting on him to be pissed off.

1929
01:52:28.851 --> 01:52:30.530
And even if his face is totally blank,

1930
01:52:30.531 --> 01:52:32.460
you're probably going to project on it and be like,
yes.

1931
01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:36.860
Is he a little pissed off?
Because everything else is consistent,
but okay,

1932
01:52:36.861 --> 01:52:39.380
so he's designed not to be pissed off.
That's somehow,

1933
01:52:39.381 --> 01:52:43.520
it's hard to believe whenever you have a full working model of how people behave

1934
01:52:43.521 --> 01:52:45.980
and it's been trained on people.
We'll also,
the guy's

1935
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:50.180
<v 3>name was Michael Fassbender.
Michael Fassbinder.
Yeah.
Spoiler alert.</v>

1936
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:51.350
Also in,

1937
01:52:51.351 --> 01:52:56.351
he actually acts in almost stay vindictive manner to one of the guys who had

1938
01:52:56.571 --> 01:52:59.810
been fucking with them in this,
uh,
in this movie.
It was kind of interesting.

1939
01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:03.440
I got to see how they,
uh,
they had had it set up it,
you know,
it wasn't,

1940
01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:05.000
like I said,
it wasn't a terrible movie.

1941
01:53:05.001 --> 01:53:08.000
It just wasn't what I was hoping it was going.
Michael Fassbender,
that's it.

1942
01:53:08.001 --> 01:53:11.450
Is he played David.
He was the second one.
There it is.
He's just,

1943
01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:15.080
his hair's a different color in this photo.
I got confused.
But yeah,

1944
01:53:15.081 --> 01:53:18.200
he's an amazing actor,
man.
That guys,
it's a,
that's a,

1945
01:53:18.201 --> 01:53:21.650
that's a skill that it's going to be difficult when they start doing CGI movies,

1946
01:53:21.651 --> 01:53:23.090
like completely CGI,

1947
01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:28.400
like really replicating an actual humans emotions and the way a human like that

1948
01:53:28.401 --> 01:53:31.700
guy can act,
that's going to be really difficult to do.
It's,

1949
01:53:31.770 --> 01:53:35.120
it's all the little things that the actors learned.
I was watching,

1950
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:36.590
I watched snow,

1951
01:53:36.590 --> 01:53:39.380
I've been watching all the Chris Hemsworth movies because he's also supposed to

1952
01:53:39.381 --> 01:53:43.520
be in Rome apocalypse.
Who's Chris Hemsworth?
Thor.
Mighty.
Mighty.
Oh cool.

1953
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:46.970
And he's in red dawn and the remake and he's in Snow White and the Huntsman,

1954
01:53:46.971 --> 01:53:51.770
he's,
yes.
So I was watching that and I can't remember the name of the actors who,

1955
01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:56.630
she's the one from twilight in Stewart and she does this,
she's,
you know,

1956
01:53:56.690 --> 01:53:57.201
really pretty.

1957
01:53:57.201 --> 01:54:01.820
And she does this thing where you start to notice like that it's like almost her

1958
01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:02.931
trademark.

1959
01:54:02.931 --> 01:54:07.370
Like she breeds really hard and then her collarbones sort of stick out,
you know?

1960
01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:09.320
And it's like,
that's like an acting thing.
Like,

1961
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:12.230
or when you notice their little nostrils are flipping around and you're like,

1962
01:54:12.231 --> 01:54:16.720
that's why they get paid the big bucks.
That's his nostrils.

1963
01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:21.350
Or like doing seaworld shit and flipping out of the water and yeah.
That's funny.

1964
01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:24.980
Yeah.
They uh,
they have very,
some people like they,
the same guy in it,

1965
01:54:24.981 --> 01:54:28.430
like Christopher Walken,
he's the same guy and like almost alien movie ever.

1966
01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:31.580
Right.
I read an interview with him.
He said that they started,
like,

1967
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:36.080
now he has a clause in his contract that says they can't rewrite it to make it

1968
01:54:36.081 --> 01:54:41.081
weirder when they hire him because he's tired of all the roles shaping to fit

1969
01:54:41.091 --> 01:54:45.650
him instead of him having to act.
It's funny,
like,

1970
01:54:45.651 --> 01:54:46.990
so as he gets it,
like,
hey look,

1971
01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000
we're going to have Christopher Walken and he's going to be on acid 24,

1972
01:54:50.001 --> 01:54:55.001
seven and he only wears like flippers and golf shoes and shit like that around

1973
01:54:56.241 --> 01:54:59.180
the house.
And it was this supposed to be someone's like dad or something?
Yeah.

1974
01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:03.110
Yeah.
Wonderful.
Yeah.
Like the variety of roles that he gets offered.

1975
01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:06.740
Everyone's crazy.
Everyone.
Every role that he does.
It's got to be a crazy guy.

1976
01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:10.490
And once you get type cast,
I guess I'll Buccino like he's got a screen,

1977
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:14.690
it's gotta be at least one ranting screaming scene in every movie.

1978
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:19.190
I think after a while these two dudes probably like,
they probably get like,

1979
01:55:19.191 --> 01:55:22.040
especially after the,
they get paid a few times,

1980
01:55:22.041 --> 01:55:26.510
like they really like sell out hard and it makes them fat cash on a terrible

1981
01:55:26.511 --> 01:55:30.600
movie.
And I'm like,
wow,
that was pretty easy.
It's versus good problems,
you know?

1982
01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:34.790
Oh,
I keep getting hired and getting paid a lot of money to be myself.

1983
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:38.600
But like Robert Deniro did a bunch of stinky ass movies,
man,

1984
01:55:38.601 --> 01:55:43.200
he did that one movie where he was like a Gremlin or a warlock or something like

1985
01:55:43.201 --> 01:55:44.034
that.

1986
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:46.440
<v 1>Wasn't there a movie where like it was like one of those things</v>

1987
01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:51.980
<v 2>type rip offs?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I feel like God,</v>

1988
01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.980
I can't remember.
Oh,
you know,
I saw a,
nobody saw it in Snow White.

1989
01:55:56.010 --> 01:55:57.750
There were all these dwarves.
Right.

1990
01:55:57.780 --> 01:56:02.160
And I thought that they were a little buddy and,
uh,
and instead they were,

1991
01:56:02.161 --> 01:56:04.110
they were real actors.
You have it,
they see it.

1992
01:56:04.130 --> 01:56:06.250
I couldn't figure out how it was happening.
Like,

1993
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:09.950
<v 1>yeah.
Most famous actors.
Yeah.
That was a,</v>

1994
01:56:09.951 --> 01:56:13.460
that was a big point of contention with the little people community because they

1995
01:56:13.461 --> 01:56:17.270
were like,
what the fuck man?
Like these are the only gigs that we could take.

1996
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:20.390
And instead you think it's cute to show off with a,
you know,

1997
01:56:20.391 --> 01:56:24.050
like there's plenty of little people,
actors that would have loved those roles.

1998
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:28.130
So it's kind of a,
that was a little touch and go situation.
Like,

1999
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:32.990
was it a hot bod bud hot,
what's his name?
Hot Skins.

2000
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:36.530
What is the guy's name?
Uh,
what roles does he play?

2001
01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:40.550
He was one of the little people.
Very famous.
Fuck God dammit.

2002
01:56:40.551 --> 01:56:43.170
Now I'm going to make me imtp this mother fucker too.

2003
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:48.650
I might be MDM more today than I ever have in my life.
But,
uh,

2004
01:56:48.651 --> 01:56:49.690
then there was the other movie

2005
01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:53.630
<v 2>you can tell imdv was one of the first websites because it's got,</v>

2006
01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:56.440
because they would never name it that,
right.
If they would be like,

2007
01:56:57.140 --> 01:56:57.973
they would give it a

2008
01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:02.613
like that.

2009
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:08.140
<v 1>Yeah.
Why am I am DP Internet movie database?</v>

2010
01:57:08.170 --> 01:57:10.510
I guess it's easy to remember.
It's four characters,
man.

2011
01:57:10.511 --> 01:57:14.950
You can't get a website that's four characters.
Baas hot skins,

2012
01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:19.360
that's homeboy's name.
He's been in a gang of movies.
Well,

2013
01:57:19.361 --> 01:57:22.510
as he Hoskins Bob Hoskins was in,
um,

2014
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:26.430
wasn't he in Roger Rabbit and that too?
Yeah,

2015
01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:31.560
he was willow and star wars and like spinning fucking everything has been in a

2016
01:57:32.051 --> 01:57:36.940
lot of shit.
He's been a lot of shit.
But uh,
he's in that movie too.

2017
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:40.310
<v 2>See,
I feel the same way about in robot apocalypse.</v>

2018
01:57:40.311 --> 01:57:43.100
That's all native Americans like,

2019
01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:47.150
so I have this feeling that if the federal government were to fall apart,

2020
01:57:47.330 --> 01:57:50.180
there are all these sovereign tribal governments that are around,

2021
01:57:50.181 --> 01:57:54.170
that have jails and cops and hospitals and everything that you need.
Right.

2022
01:57:54.171 --> 01:57:58.370
Only it's smaller and a,
and in the book,
like everybody ends up there.

2023
01:57:58.371 --> 01:58:01.730
And so in the movie,
I don't know,
I haven't read the script,

2024
01:58:01.731 --> 01:58:02.481
I don't know anything about it,

2025
01:58:02.481 --> 01:58:06.470
but I'm like wondering are they going to hire native actors?
You know,

2026
01:58:07.190 --> 01:58:12.190
Indians because it's like an Osage army basically.

2027
01:58:12.670 --> 01:58:15.070
<v 1>It would just have to maybe look a little bit more carefully,</v>

2028
01:58:15.071 --> 01:58:18.250
but I'm sure there's plenty of qualified people acting as one of those things

2029
01:58:18.251 --> 01:58:21.350
too,
man.
There's a lot of people that you don't know that can do it.
It's,
it's,

2030
01:58:21.370 --> 01:58:25.030
it's one of those things where there's so many people at the Dunn Theater and

2031
01:58:25.110 --> 01:58:26.620
they can't fucking act.

2032
01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:30.870
They know how to act good at like getting people that aren't big names and

2033
01:58:30.871 --> 01:58:33.940
scouting and making them their names,
but at least while they're with him.
Well,

2034
01:58:33.941 --> 01:58:36.790
you know,
I think when you've been in the movie business that long,

2035
01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:41.020
you trust like casting agents too.
And like a casting agent can tell you,
hey,

2036
01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:44.500
this kid,
he's been,
you know,
he's amazing.
You got to check him out.

2037
01:58:44.501 --> 01:58:45.640
Nobody knows who he is.
Basically.

2038
01:58:45.641 --> 01:58:49.270
It's really got something special and he's perfect for this one particular role

2039
01:58:49.271 --> 01:58:53.560
that he might have,
you know?
But he's,
he's good at it,
but some people just,

2040
01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:54.210
it's cool.

2041
01:58:54.210 --> 01:58:57.880
It's kind of funny that we have this thing with movies where we accept that

2042
01:58:57.881 --> 01:59:01.690
we're seeing the same guy over and over and over again in a bunch of different

2043
01:59:01.691 --> 01:59:04.810
lives.
Mass.
That one movie.

2044
01:59:04.811 --> 01:59:08.710
He's the last Samaritan Samurai,
whatever the fuck he is in another movie.

2045
01:59:08.711 --> 01:59:13.010
He's a vampire.
He's going to be Jack a trip.

2046
01:59:13.090 --> 01:59:16.380
The guy from the,
who is it?
Clive Cussler or something?
Oh Man.

2047
01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:20.810
From what movie's terrible dude.
We're fucking up today.
Yeah,
he's uh,

2048
01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:22.270
I need some bulletproof coffee.

2049
01:59:22.271 --> 01:59:27.060
He's playing a guy who is actually like six foot four linebacker.
Oh,

2050
01:59:27.070 --> 01:59:31.750
he's playing,
is he?
Oh No,
I was just thinking of um,
Matthew.
Matt Damon.

2051
01:59:31.870 --> 01:59:36.640
Didn't Matt Damon play a rugby player?
A famous rugby player?
He could pull.

2052
01:59:36.641 --> 01:59:40.570
Thank you.
Did was like you can pull it off
fairly.
No,

2053
01:59:40.571 --> 01:59:45.100
I mean he played the Bourne identity.
Great.
Yeah,
I bought that.
I was,

2054
01:59:45.190 --> 01:59:47.950
although I bought the new guy more,
I bought the new guy.

2055
01:59:47.951 --> 01:59:51.130
I believe the new guy was more like natural as a killer.

2056
01:59:51.190 --> 01:59:54.610
Who was the new Jeremy Renner?
Is that his name?
Renner.
Yeah.
Hey,

2057
01:59:54.730 --> 01:59:58.390
we knew someone whose name today.
That guy is a bad ass.

2058
01:59:58.890 --> 02:00:02.530
I thought what I found was amazing about that movie though was that one of the

2059
02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:06.790
things about that movie is that this guy can endure like incredible cold and

2060
02:00:06.791 --> 02:00:07.211
pain.

2061
02:00:07.211 --> 02:00:12.211
He could do all these amazing things physically and yet he also had incredible

2062
02:00:12.821 --> 02:00:14.440
discipline and he never chased pussy.

2063
02:00:15.130 --> 02:00:19.720
It's like they made him the most unrealistic superhero ever because like I was

2064
02:00:19.721 --> 02:00:20.141
thinking about,

2065
02:00:20.141 --> 02:00:22.780
they were going over James Bond today and then we're talking about a,

2066
02:00:22.781 --> 02:00:23.950
on the Ron and fair show,

2067
02:00:24.130 --> 02:00:27.130
they were talking about all the different names for the James Bond women and

2068
02:00:27.131 --> 02:00:29.710
which one was the hottest and which girl,
which James Bond girl.

2069
02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:33.710
They had a weakness because they portray that as his great strength.
Yes.

2070
02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:37.930
He's a great strange seeing women.
He's doing this too.
They're powerless.

2071
02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:42.520
Instead of he's getting Patraeus,
you know,
he's just not real.

2072
02:00:42.610 --> 02:00:46.820
He's not even trying to get laid.
He's like,
he has no needs whatsoever sexually,

2073
02:00:47.170 --> 02:00:49.850
but yet he flips through the air and lands on top of the roofs and beats.

2074
02:00:49.851 --> 02:00:52.000
You should everybody and carries this woman the whole way.

2075
02:00:52.150 --> 02:00:54.700
But she just wants like that is like the ideal man.

2076
02:00:55.090 --> 02:00:59.160
Women was pants vampire that won't suck your blood and can go out in the
daytime.

2077
02:00:59.170 --> 02:01:00.970
He just sparkles.
They want,

2078
02:01:00.971 --> 02:01:04.840
I mean they want this super bad ass who doesn't want any pussy at all?

2079
02:01:04.940 --> 02:01:07.360
He's just your guard dog that he takes care of you everywhere.

2080
02:01:07.361 --> 02:01:08.500
He doesn't even try to fuck you.

2081
02:01:08.830 --> 02:01:12.520
Like this woman is unbelievably beautiful and he's saving her through the entire

2082
02:01:12.521 --> 02:01:15.750
movie and they never even so much to make [inaudible] no,
no it's not.
Okay.

2083
02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:18.790
It's Jeremy Renner and one of the new Bourne identity cause I was okay,

2084
02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:20.260
but I'm saying at the same time,

2085
02:01:20.261 --> 02:01:23.290
if you go back and look like they had a bond movie called octopussy.
Yeah,

2086
02:01:23.650 --> 02:01:27.730
I mean that was the most unsettled play on words ever.

2087
02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:32.170
I remember my grandfather had that VHS tape and I was like,
aw yeah.

2088
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:36.350
I like grab that one,
popped it in.
As soon as he,
as a doorway,

2089
02:01:36.410 --> 02:01:40.070
he's getting hot freaks.
That was part of being bond.
He got

2090
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:42.740
<v 3>laid like crazy and it was a good thing back then.</v>

2091
02:01:43.250 --> 02:01:45.530
But in 90 more superhero can't do that anymore.

2092
02:01:46.010 --> 02:01:49.520
It's the new bond to philanthropy.
I don't know,
is he,
does he go,

2093
02:01:49.550 --> 02:01:52.850
does he go and get some mass in this new movie blasting mean it's his trademark.

2094
02:01:52.851 --> 02:01:56.810
He's going to have a Martini is going to go chase them ass gun.
Yeah,

2095
02:01:56.811 --> 02:02:00.050
he's going to win always in the end he'll be fine.
You know,

2096
02:02:00.051 --> 02:02:02.270
he might have a little cast on his hand or some shit like that,

2097
02:02:02.271 --> 02:02:04.100
but in the end to like meet the queen or something.

2098
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:08.570
I heard Heineken hate a bunch of money so that he only drinks Heineken Beers

2099
02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:13.220
during the,
uh,
uh,
it's unsubstantiated but it will be seen the video,

2100
02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:14.830
the commercial rather than the,

2101
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:17.650
that's pretty well done commercial for a beer commercial.

2102
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:20.670
It was going that way already cause they had all those commercials with dudes

2103
02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:24.450
flipping through the air and he's just kind of a bond desk kind of bad ass.
Yeah.

2104
02:02:24.590 --> 02:02:27.860
So I guess that's okay honey.
It's all iconic.
Can Sucks.

2105
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:30.580
I think it pay him to only drink Heineken.
What's wrong with that?

2106
02:02:30.581 --> 02:02:34.940
And I like kind of Ken.
Yeah,
it's the principle of it.

2107
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:35.930
What is the principle?

2108
02:02:35.931 --> 02:02:38.690
The principle is that it's product placement in a bond movie,

2109
02:02:38.691 --> 02:02:41.100
which is semi sacrilegious.
Is that it?
Is it,

2110
02:02:41.210 --> 02:02:44.910
I mean I don't know a lot of what movie it is.
It kind of does.

2111
02:02:44.911 --> 02:02:48.370
So there's certain things like bond that are like sacred bonds.

2112
02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:52.330
You've got to go Sean Connery,
Moore,
mission impossible if you want to,

2113
02:02:52.590 --> 02:02:53.100
if you want to.

2114
02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:57.480
I want to only drink like if you want a whore out your main character now bond

2115
02:02:57.530 --> 02:03:01.280
during the Pierce Brosnan era with cars.
Right.
I was like,
wait a minute.

2116
02:03:01.281 --> 02:03:04.850
But he wasn't bond.
Did Daniel Craig is bond.
Okay.

2117
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:09.080
Daniel Craig looks like a real English bad motherfucker that could snap your

2118
02:03:09.081 --> 02:03:12.080
neck cuts.
The consignors Morgan was,
what's his name?

2119
02:03:12.081 --> 02:03:15.040
Not Pierce Morgan Pierce Brosnan.
Pierce Brosnan.

2120
02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:18.860
He seemed like a very nice guy and I bet he's a hell of a good actor.

2121
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:22.640
Seems like an English gentleman.
He did.
I did not buy him kicking people's asses.

2122
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:25.760
I buy this Daniel Craig Guy fucking people up and killing people.

2123
02:03:25.761 --> 02:03:29.990
I totally buy it.
He's more compact and like Daniel Craig.
Yeah,
Craig.

2124
02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:31.290
He's built like a pit bull.
Yeah,

2125
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:34.250
he's like thick like that guy looks like an athlete.

2126
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:36.860
Like when you see him with his shirt off and he's got a gun in his hand.

2127
02:03:37.130 --> 02:03:39.590
You believe that's a god kills people for a living.
You know?
That's it.

2128
02:03:39.591 --> 02:03:42.400
That's a real special agent.
Where's the Pierce Brosnan?
I was like,
bitch,

2129
02:03:42.401 --> 02:03:45.930
I'm want to take your gun.
You can't hold onto that gun.
Killing that thing.

2130
02:03:45.931 --> 02:03:49.480
Your hair.
Yes.
I was going to hold you down.
Pee on you.
You're just,

2131
02:03:49.490 --> 02:03:51.320
I just don't buy it.
Roger Moore.

2132
02:03:51.321 --> 02:03:53.960
At least we got the tongue and cheek and it was a different era.

2133
02:03:54.170 --> 02:03:59.170
Pierce Brosnan was in this weird sort of like nineties drama to an action.

2134
02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:03.320
I've got a theory about this too.
I got a lot of theories,
by the way,

2135
02:04:04.190 --> 02:04:05.480
my theory on this,
and they're like,

2136
02:04:05.490 --> 02:04:09.350
there's 80s and nineties late eighties early nineties there's all these movies

2137
02:04:09.380 --> 02:04:13.610
where if the action scenes consist of people holding submachine guns and go on

2138
02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:16.193
each other,
right.

2139
02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:19.070
Or there'll be like way up on the catwalk and they'll have a shotgun and then

2140
02:04:19.071 --> 02:04:22.700
like boom,
boom shooting somebody like way the fuck across the warehouse.

2141
02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:26.810
And my theory is that you can't get away with that shit anymore because every

2142
02:04:26.811 --> 02:04:30.440
kid plays call of duty.
No,
a shotgun.

2143
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:32.390
Is it effective at long range?

2144
02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:36.020
I mean this is like in the DNA of every 14 year old boy.

2145
02:04:36.050 --> 02:04:38.250
You just know that you can't

2146
02:04:38.250 --> 02:04:41.910
<v 2>shoot somebody with a shotgun from across a football field.
It's not.</v>

2147
02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:43.770
You might have never touched a shotgun.

2148
02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:49.040
And so like the whole spraying the sub machine gun thing and that stuff is gone

2149
02:04:49.411 --> 02:04:54.411
now you got to be way more brutal and like accurate and realistic about it.

2150
02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:59.250
<v 1>Well that's why martial arts movies don't look like those early,
you know,</v>

2151
02:04:59.251 --> 02:05:03.330
like John Claude van Damme and those early martial arts movies.

2152
02:05:03.930 --> 02:05:06.630
It's harder to buy this guy,
you know,

2153
02:05:06.631 --> 02:05:08.970
flipping you over his head and grabbed me by the risk.

2154
02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:10.470
When you see like an MMA fight,

2155
02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:12.350
<v 2>realize what really happened.</v>

2156
02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:16.570
I was watching demolition man and like Wesley snipes is like fuck,

2157
02:05:16.571 --> 02:05:20.720
are you doing like roundhouse kicks like four,
five,
six.
Yeah,

2158
02:05:20.770 --> 02:05:24.910
it's still standing there.
He was really,
yeah.
Acting real roundhouse kick.

2159
02:05:24.911 --> 02:05:29.480
Like when does that even ever happen?
Right.
But you know,
it's just like,

2160
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:32.630
it's like watching home alone or something.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2161
02:05:32.631 --> 02:05:36.020
That brick would have caved in his skull and you going have immediately thrown

2162
02:05:36.021 --> 02:05:39.370
up all over the floor.
You know the police would have come,

2163
02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:41.470
<v 1>there was a bunch of movies,</v>

2164
02:05:41.770 --> 02:05:45.100
those martial arts movies that were completely ridiculous.

2165
02:05:45.490 --> 02:05:50.490
We're dudes would just get stand in a circle and the guys would just charge out

2166
02:05:50.591 --> 02:05:51.670
up to the left and he would take,

2167
02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:55.240
kick him and then the guy would charged on a ride.
He would kick him and it,

2168
02:05:55.241 --> 02:05:57.850
nobody ever,
nobody ever washed them all at one time.

2169
02:05:58.170 --> 02:06:00.900
<v 2>Man Norris,
this is,
this is his bread and butter.</v>

2170
02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:03.770
Chuck Norris and some of the greatest movies ever.

2171
02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:08.160
Texas is a beautiful show episode.
Keep going.

2172
02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:12.770
Get come a couple more times on the stock.
He,
dude,
there was an episode where he,

2173
02:06:13.050 --> 02:06:18.050
<v 1>a bomb went off and he lost his sight and he went and he meditated and he got a</v>

2174
02:06:18.321 --> 02:06:20.140
sight back at the end and save.

2175
02:06:20.141 --> 02:06:22.870
Somebody had to get a site back to save somebody that was like,

2176
02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:27.810
<v 2>my God,
it gets a little spiritual does he's all</v>

2177
02:06:28.050 --> 02:06:31.960
<v 1>he chuck Norris is is is very high on Jesus.
I met Chuck Norris.</v>

2178
02:06:31.961 --> 02:06:35.170
It was one of the proudest moments of my life that Chuck Norris knew who I was

2179
02:06:35.171 --> 02:06:38.860
and it gave me a hug.
I was like,
Holy Shit,
because Chuck Norris swatches the UFC.

2180
02:06:39.650 --> 02:06:41.530
I was like,
God dammit.
Why don't I have a camera?

2181
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:45.820
The photo with Chuck Norris in the martial arts community that's akin to like a

2182
02:06:45.821 --> 02:06:48.370
photo with Elvis.
If you're a singer,
blow it up.
Yeah.

2183
02:06:48.371 --> 02:06:50.070
If you've got a photo of Chuck Norris,

2184
02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:53.350
hit those kettlebells and just stare at the photo.

2185
02:06:53.351 --> 02:06:55.720
You Know Chuck Louis and Mike Together.
Yeah.

2186
02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:59.830
Just motivate me to train hard.
Me.

2187
02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:05.130
Chuck Norris had a bunch of unbelievably preposterous movies beat.

2188
02:07:05.230 --> 02:07:08.340
I mean,
Chuck Norris is a bad motherfucker,
but some of those movies were

2189
02:07:09.730 --> 02:07:12.940
<v 2>roadhouse,
right?
Is One of the great classic.
That is the classic.</v>

2190
02:07:12.970 --> 02:07:16.390
I had some friends in Portland who created a roadhouse musical,

2191
02:07:16.750 --> 02:07:18.610
and this is one of the best things I've ever seen.

2192
02:07:18.611 --> 02:07:21.800
It's like a roadhouse acting out raw.

2193
02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:25.510
Then occasionally there's like songs and there's a narrator that's like,

2194
02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:30.760
oh my God.
I was like,
did you guys get permission?
And they're like,
ah,

2195
02:07:31.150 --> 02:07:35.670
they just did it.
I just did it.
You know,
it profit or is it just for it will,

2196
02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:36.010
you know,

2197
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:39.820
<v 3>it was for profit,
but they sold out.
I mean,
these are real actors.</v>

2198
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:43.910
I don't think anybody would find it as anything other than you should be

2199
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:48.310
stricken.
Ideally people would look at it and say,
that's a tribute.
You know?
And,

2200
02:07:48.311 --> 02:07:49.144
and it's,

2201
02:07:49.330 --> 02:07:53.250
it's what keeps people buying the DVDs and keeps exactly investing in the movie.

2202
02:07:53.251 --> 02:07:57.230
That was a great bad movie.
It's a great bad movie.

2203
02:07:57.580 --> 02:08:01.450
It's got everything.
It's an amazing movie.
Perfect storm.
You know,

2204
02:08:01.451 --> 02:08:04.510
like at a certain every sort of genre that you have,

2205
02:08:04.511 --> 02:08:08.180
like movies that perfect different elements of the genre and then,

2206
02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:10.020
and then you'll have one perfect,
uh,

2207
02:08:10.021 --> 02:08:13.510
one or two perfect storm movies that get everything and then,
you know,

2208
02:08:13.511 --> 02:08:15.720
and then it dissipates.
The Times Change Code

2209
02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:20.460
<v 1>of silence was one like super legit movie.
The Chuck Norris did that.</v>

2210
02:08:20.461 --> 02:08:22.910
I was trying to remember it.
It was a,

2211
02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:26.700
a movie like almost like a Charles Bronson type movie where he played a cop.

2212
02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:28.370
It's just two hours of him meditating.

2213
02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:32.520
Motherfuckers only gave it a 5.6 in the ratings.
How dare you.

2214
02:08:32.521 --> 02:08:35.780
I am DB.
I disagree.
I think you got to,
you know,

2215
02:08:35.790 --> 02:08:38.490
look at it in the time that it was made,
but at the time that it was made,

2216
02:08:38.491 --> 02:08:40.290
it was like Chuck Norris,
his,
it was like,

2217
02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:45.270
had very little martial arts in it for a Chuck Norris movie.
It was more of a,

2218
02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:48.670
you know,
just a good action drama.
Who,
I mean,

2219
02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:51.780
I think he threw like one side kick and the whole movie.
Yeah.

2220
02:08:51.781 --> 02:08:55.530
It was more actually obligated to,
yeah,
probably.
Probably.
Yeah.

2221
02:08:55.531 --> 02:08:56.730
You can't have a chuck Norris blue.

2222
02:08:56.731 --> 02:09:00.330
It doesn't kick at least one dude Chuck Norris.
Look,
no,
it looks great.

2223
02:09:00.450 --> 02:09:03.090
Does healthy's the martial artists,
if you're receiving those commercials,

2224
02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:07.740
where does those uh,
those,
uh,
what does that thing to police system?
They do those

2225
02:09:07.950 --> 02:09:11.080
<v 3>sizes and shit cause you know,</v>

2226
02:09:11.081 --> 02:09:15.460
a lot of the action heroes from that era that are also movie stars,
you know,

2227
02:09:15.461 --> 02:09:15.810
they,

2228
02:09:15.810 --> 02:09:19.180
there's a lot of sort of surgical stuff that starts creeping in and they start

2229
02:09:19.181 --> 02:09:20.140
looking a little funny.

2230
02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:24.860
<v 1>Well,
I'll,
Chuck Norris is,
I think he's in his sixties.
Let's look,
look here.</v>

2231
02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:29.810
Um,
but um,
I know he definitely still trains.
He's um,

2232
02:09:30.620 --> 02:09:34.930
he was born in 1940.
Whoa.
So,
uh,

2233
02:09:34.940 --> 02:09:39.170
that means he's 72.
Dang.
Wow.
Oh my God.

2234
02:09:39.290 --> 02:09:42.620
Well he's doing all right.
Healthy lives.
Amazing.
That's amazing.
Well,

2235
02:09:42.621 --> 02:09:47.030
he looks incredible for 72.
That's incredible.
Am I retarded?
No,
I'm not.

2236
02:09:47.210 --> 02:09:50.930
That's exactly what he is.
Wow.
Um,
he's still very fit though.

2237
02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:54.470
If you see him in these,
whatever these things are,
Tim and Christie Brinkley,

2238
02:09:54.530 --> 02:09:56.120
I don't remember what they're called.
These cable,

2239
02:09:56.270 --> 02:10:00.950
it's essentially a low impact cable police system workout.
And he uh,

2240
02:10:00.980 --> 02:10:02.440
he promotes those things and he's a,

2241
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:06.800
he's a black belt in Jujitsu and I'm sure he's still probably does some form of

2242
02:10:06.801 --> 02:10:11.090
martial arts still too.
When he looks great for 72,
he's incredible.

2243
02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:13.580
But yeah,

2244
02:10:13.581 --> 02:10:17.930
a lot of those dudes that fucking have your body doesn't last son.

2245
02:10:18.140 --> 02:10:20.300
Shit's gonna go.
And that's where robotics,

2246
02:10:20.630 --> 02:10:22.150
<v 3>hey,
that's why I'm saving mine.</v>

2247
02:10:22.610 --> 02:10:26.570
I'm not working out because you only get so many good,
good thinking movements

2248
02:10:28.050 --> 02:10:29.070
<v 1>match.
If it worked that way.</v>

2249
02:10:29.071 --> 02:10:33.520
If you were born a fucking superhero and every day your life,
you like your,

2250
02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:37.070
your physical points and the more physical activity did the,

2251
02:10:37.071 --> 02:10:40.610
the lower your life guide or the candle burns this faster.
Yeah,

2252
02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:44.040
it's likely your life would be like almost like a video game know you just have,

2253
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:47.510
everybody would have the equal number to start with.
Well didn't they?

2254
02:10:47.530 --> 02:10:48.060
They made that

2255
02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:49.980
<v 2>movie where you have a certain amount of time to live.
Right.</v>

2256
02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:53.250
Did you know they're remaking Logan's run?
Others?
Speaking of everybody,

2257
02:10:53.460 --> 02:10:55.500
I sat at the science fiction convention.

2258
02:10:55.501 --> 02:10:58.410
I sat next to this guy and he's sitting next to me and he's bitching,

2259
02:10:58.411 --> 02:11:01.170
you know about like there's not any people here.
And I was like,
he's,

2260
02:11:01.230 --> 02:11:05.100
he was older and I was like,
what?
So what,
you know,
what's your deal?

2261
02:11:05.101 --> 02:11:08.920
Why are you bitching so hard?
You know?
And he's like,
basically it comes out.

2262
02:11:08.921 --> 02:11:12.090
And he was like,
I wrote Logan's run,
you know?
Wow.
I'm like,

2263
02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:17.160
you are so lucky that you had a movie made out of your book in the 70s or,

2264
02:11:17.161 --> 02:11:21.690
and I think they bought the rights in the 60s that people still remember right.

2265
02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:25.890
I mean,
how easy to just go,
you know,
and just be gone.
And he was just better,

2266
02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:28.560
it just wasn't happening.
He actually seemed cool.

2267
02:11:28.561 --> 02:11:33.561
He was sort of like a little while he was at peace with the fact that in this

2268
02:11:34.201 --> 02:11:38.340
world you can show up and a hundred people would be in line to get a book signed

2269
02:11:38.610 --> 02:11:42.060
or he can show up and it has to be like,
like nobody,
you know,

2270
02:11:42.061 --> 02:11:45.990
or like that one guy that wants to like talk about every aspect of star trek.

2271
02:11:45.991 --> 02:11:47.820
And then he sort of wanders off without buying a book.

2272
02:11:48.070 --> 02:11:51.610
<v 1>You're like,
oh,
that's gotta be brutal for 20 minutes.
And you buddy.</v>

2273
02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:54.640
That's hilarious.
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

2274
02:11:54.641 --> 02:11:57.370
That's got to be annoying for those guys because they're really trying to be

2275
02:11:57.371 --> 02:11:58.001
friendly to people,

2276
02:11:58.001 --> 02:12:01.210
but they're also trying to sell some shit and get some things end of the day.

2277
02:12:01.211 --> 02:12:02.830
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
you're trying to sell a book.

2278
02:12:02.890 --> 02:12:07.660
It's got to be weird when I know the,
the book Logan's run,
I remember it,

2279
02:12:07.661 --> 02:12:10.250
but I don't remember anything about it.
I don't remember the movie.

2280
02:12:10.251 --> 02:12:11.060
And I remember that

2281
02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:13.310
<v 2>the movie was about all these people that basically,</v>

2282
02:12:13.311 --> 02:12:17.720
it's like seventies everybody's in unitards and you die whenever you're 30 like,

2283
02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:21.320
and if you don't agree to die,
they hunt you down and kill you.

2284
02:12:21.321 --> 02:12:23.690
You have like the little gym in your hand.
It starts flashing.

2285
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:27.320
So Logan doesn't want to die basically.
I mean,

2286
02:12:27.321 --> 02:12:31.160
I haven't seen the movie in forever and ever,
but he makes a run for it.
I mean,

2287
02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:35.810
<v 1>so it's,
is it,
how much different is it from the Justin Timberlake movie?
Yeah,</v>

2288
02:12:35.811 --> 02:12:37.460
right.
That's,
that's what got me thinking about it.

2289
02:12:37.461 --> 02:12:41.540
When you have a certain number of points.
Yeah,
not very,

2290
02:12:41.630 --> 02:12:44.720
it's not very different.
Um,
that team has been explored.

2291
02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:49.990
Well people are always concerned about the idea that one day due to the fact

2292
02:12:50.151 --> 02:12:54.080
that we can keep everybody alive and in fact the Pec populations are exploding.

2293
02:12:54.081 --> 02:12:54.441
You were,

2294
02:12:54.441 --> 02:12:57.980
we're continuing to figure out new diseases and how to cure people when they're

2295
02:12:57.981 --> 02:13:01.010
sick and people are staying alive longer.
Like at what point in time do we,

2296
02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:04.910
does it become an issue and do they ever need to control and how do you even go

2297
02:13:04.911 --> 02:13:05.750
about doing that?

2298
02:13:05.751 --> 02:13:10.730
And so all these like scenarios like the Justin Timberlake movie or Logan's run

2299
02:13:10.731 --> 02:13:14.960
pop up where the evil government forces you into a contamination process or,

2300
02:13:15.580 --> 02:13:18.410
I don't know.
Yeah,
I mean,
again,
I think at its heart it's

2301
02:13:18.410 --> 02:13:22.430
<v 2>about like being afraid that technology is going to change human nature.</v>

2302
02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:24.890
Like there are certain things that are in Nate about being human.

2303
02:13:25.010 --> 02:13:27.380
Like we're born and we die,
right?
I mean,
come on.

2304
02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:30.860
Every single human being as lived and they're all going to,

2305
02:13:31.230 --> 02:13:32.280
or they did die already.

2306
02:13:32.670 --> 02:13:35.700
<v 3>And if you change that,
then I mean,
that's scary stuff,
right?</v>

2307
02:13:35.701 --> 02:13:38.550
You're going into a completely unknown territory.

2308
02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:43.320
And ultimately that's what everybody is shooting for with the height of

2309
02:13:43.321 --> 02:13:46.830
technology.
The height of technology is to ascend,
pass the physical,

2310
02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:48.420
the physical body to,

2311
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:52.500
to get yourself into a position where you truly become immortal because you

2312
02:13:52.530 --> 02:13:56.460
become part of some computer programs.
He,
man,
I don't see,
I don't,

2313
02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:59.790
I'm not down with this ray Kurtzweil he doesn't want to die.
Okay.

2314
02:13:59.791 --> 02:14:02.660
He doesn't believe that he should have to die.
Yeah,
no,
this is what he says.

2315
02:14:02.670 --> 02:14:05.490
I mean,
I understand he doesn't want to die.
And he says,
you know,

2316
02:14:05.491 --> 02:14:08.860
one way to avoid it is to have a machine that's going to,
uh,

2317
02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:11.910
basically take a snapshot of every neuron in your brain,

2318
02:14:11.911 --> 02:14:13.650
which they're all just little switches,
right?

2319
02:14:13.890 --> 02:14:15.840
And it's going to figure out exactly what's going to go,

2320
02:14:16.010 --> 02:14:19.050
what's going on in your brain.
And then it's going to continue to simulate that.

2321
02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:22.770
But like part of me is just saying,
Yo,

2322
02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:27.660
when you die,
even if you simulate yourself perfectly,

2323
02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:31.650
you're fricking dead.
You're,
you're a pile of debt.
And you know,

2324
02:14:31.770 --> 02:14:34.170
there's the other possibility that,
you know,

2325
02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:38.790
eat when you're dead and this other life goes on,

2326
02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:43.500
like it's going to be completely disconnected from reality and who knows how

2327
02:14:43.501 --> 02:14:44.550
it's going to progress.

2328
02:14:44.690 --> 02:14:48.900
It's just cause it's a copy of the operating system and all the information and

2329
02:14:48.901 --> 02:14:52.530
all the traits that your brain,
how the fuck do you know what that thing is?

2330
02:14:52.531 --> 02:14:57.240
Once it's on own,
where they put the criminal guys mind into a machine,

2331
02:14:57.570 --> 02:15:00.780
he's like,
they turn him on and he's just like these demonic face.

2332
02:15:00.781 --> 02:15:05.010
Like he's totally an agony and screaming and he doesn't know what's happened to

2333
02:15:05.011 --> 02:15:09.780
him.
He's lost his embodiment as a human being.
And I mean if you lose your limb,

2334
02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:13.990
that mentally screws you up because your brain has a map of,

2335
02:15:13.991 --> 02:15:15.210
of who you are.
Right?

2336
02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:18.750
And then if you took your whole brain and stuck it into something that wasn't

2337
02:15:18.751 --> 02:15:23.220
even a human body,
I mean that shit would mentally traumatized,
traumatized.

2338
02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:26.250
It might drive you insane,
you know?
Yeah,
it's a good point.

2339
02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:29.470
And then you'd hunt down robocop and tried to give drugs to children.
Well,

2340
02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:33.660
W W we don't know what the impact of it would be psychologically to all of a

2341
02:15:33.661 --> 02:15:37.440
sudden be trapped in this immortal machine.
You know?
And what if there was,

2342
02:15:37.500 --> 02:15:40.260
it became like the ethical considerations to whether or not you should be able

2343
02:15:40.261 --> 02:15:43.770
to shut yourself off because we can't commit suicide.
But Ken,

2344
02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:47.160
can a person who's downloaded their consciousness into an eternal machine,

2345
02:15:47.370 --> 02:15:49.980
can they figure out,
are they doing or could,

2346
02:15:49.981 --> 02:15:52.720
could you get some crazy guy like George,
um,

2347
02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:55.200
George Foreman who named all his kids?
George,

2348
02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:57.690
what a few like calling yourself a billion times.

2349
02:15:57.691 --> 02:16:02.220
You're just like one nutty dude who just decided to make a million of you and

2350
02:16:02.221 --> 02:16:03.750
set yourself loose on Cleveland.

2351
02:16:03.751 --> 02:16:06.600
There's a lot of science fiction that covers this is all posts,

2352
02:16:06.601 --> 02:16:11.280
singularity stuff.
And there's a lot of Scifi that covers this because you,

2353
02:16:11.550 --> 02:16:15.090
you lose grasp on,
on basic human things.
Like,

2354
02:16:15.091 --> 02:16:17.820
what does it mean to die if there's a thousand other copies of view?

2355
02:16:17.970 --> 02:16:20.730
What does it mean to have a daughter?
Well,
what happened?
Thousand copies?

2356
02:16:20.731 --> 02:16:24.690
What does it mean to be you?
How did you become you?
Are you collection of jeans?

2357
02:16:24.691 --> 02:16:28.150
Are you,
are you a reaction to your environment?
Like what are you,

2358
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:32.650
there's people the meet them and go,
wow,
you're fucking cool.

2359
02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:35.900
Like where did you come from?
You know,
I love talking to you.
This isn't the,

2360
02:16:36.110 --> 02:16:37.180
and you like a million.

2361
02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:41.860
You could run into 500 people and not feel that and then run into one where you

2362
02:16:41.861 --> 02:16:44.770
just can't stop talking to them.
You know?
And it's like,
what makes that,

2363
02:16:44.771 --> 02:16:48.070
how do you make that?
What is,
what is,
what combination of things?

2364
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:52.930
How has you hold onto that if you transferred and then whatever that magic is to

2365
02:16:52.931 --> 02:16:55.330
us,
you know,
that magic,
compelling,

2366
02:16:55.331 --> 02:17:00.331
sort of a charm is to us that's completely lost in the worlds of cold ones and

2367
02:17:00.491 --> 02:17:01.970
Zeros and machines.
Yeah.

2368
02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:06.880
My whole outlook on science and what it's there for is it's not a battle to

2369
02:17:06.881 --> 02:17:11.550
defeat human nature or to escape from our meat.

2370
02:17:12.170 --> 02:17:14.020
Our bodies are our fates.

2371
02:17:14.300 --> 02:17:17.440
Like I think it's there to amplify what we've already got.
You know,

2372
02:17:17.770 --> 02:17:21.010
like I think there's certainly that way.
Yeah.
I mean we're very low.

2373
02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:22.720
We're intellectual creatures,
right?

2374
02:17:22.721 --> 02:17:26.950
I mean we can live our lives in our heads and we can try to ignore our bodies

2375
02:17:26.951 --> 02:17:31.510
are think of our bodies as impediments,
but you know,
and I,
I don't work out.

2376
02:17:31.510 --> 02:17:35.890
I don't push my body to,
you know,
I don't compete physically with people,

2377
02:17:35.891 --> 02:17:40.890
but like I acknowledged that like I eat a shit.

2378
02:17:40.900 --> 02:17:45.640
Like I have sex,
I'm smart babies.
These are all crazy.

2379
02:17:45.641 --> 02:17:47.830
These are all things that human beings do.
Right.

2380
02:17:48.190 --> 02:17:51.520
And like to try to run away from that I think is,
is,

2381
02:17:51.610 --> 02:17:56.230
is crazy because you got to admit that you got to acknowledge your embodied as a

2382
02:17:56.231 --> 02:17:59.050
human being.
And if you give into that,

2383
02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:03.280
then you in some sense there's sort of fulfilling what you're there for.

2384
02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:07.120
You know?
It feels good to eat.
It feels good to go back.
These are,

2385
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:09.620
because it's naturally,
you know,
just to play devil's advocate,

2386
02:18:09.820 --> 02:18:10.930
just play devil's advocate.

2387
02:18:11.170 --> 02:18:15.240
What we're talking about is the concept of you becoming some sort of an immortal

2388
02:18:15.250 --> 02:18:17.410
thing.
It doesn't do all the things that a human does.

2389
02:18:17.650 --> 02:18:20.270
Well what if you do do all the things that a human does?
It's just the,

2390
02:18:20.271 --> 02:18:22.440
we've recreated it and an art,
you know,

2391
02:18:22.450 --> 02:18:26.740
quote unquote artificial form and instead of it being,
you know,

2392
02:18:27.860 --> 02:18:30.400
a carbon based life form that occurred naturally.

2393
02:18:30.401 --> 02:18:35.080
It's something that we engineered to occur,
but it is the same goddamn thing.

2394
02:18:35.290 --> 02:18:38.530
So you,
it's not that you wouldn't shit,
it's not that you wouldn't eat this,

2395
02:18:38.531 --> 02:18:41.050
not that you wouldn't,
but you'd be doing it in a new body.

2396
02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:46.780
See the ultimate form of it.
If you're not in a human body right then,

2397
02:18:46.940 --> 02:18:48.190
but it would be a human body.

2398
02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:51.540
If you get transferred into like just a young human body or I think they're

2399
02:18:51.550 --> 02:18:54.370
going to be able to make buildings and I think they're going to be able to make

2400
02:18:54.371 --> 02:18:58.750
human bodies.
I think it's not with our idea of a robot.
I think we'll,

2401
02:18:58.751 --> 02:19:01.780
we'll certainly be able to make something that looks exactly like a human being,

2402
02:19:01.930 --> 02:19:04.630
but I think they're also going to be able to make a human being.
See,

2403
02:19:04.631 --> 02:19:07.390
you're asking me to put my money where my mouth is basically,

2404
02:19:07.391 --> 02:19:08.410
because you're saying no,
no,
no,

2405
02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:11.710
but really I think you are because it's interesting to me because I haven't

2406
02:19:11.711 --> 02:19:14.620
thought about it this way,
but you're saying,
look Wilson,

2407
02:19:14.830 --> 02:19:18.010
if you think that because you're embodied as a human,

2408
02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:22.030
you're obligated to experience life as a human and do all the things humans do.

2409
02:19:22.210 --> 02:19:25.630
Well,
guess what?
All humans do,
they die.
Right?

2410
02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:28.200
So if you're saying that you really are,

2411
02:19:28.210 --> 02:19:31.250
<v 2>are putting your money where your mouth is,
then you have to be willing to die.</v>

2412
02:19:31.310 --> 02:19:35.510
Right.
And acknowledged that that's a natural part of what humans do.

2413
02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:40.130
And a part of accepting your embodiment as a human.
I don't know.

2414
02:19:40.131 --> 02:19:41.390
I don't know if it came down to it.

2415
02:19:41.391 --> 02:19:43.430
I might not want to go over the roller coaster.

2416
02:19:44.130 --> 02:19:47.640
<v 1>Yeah,
I think we were.
We don't want to leave behind the ones we love.</v>

2417
02:19:47.700 --> 02:19:48.930
That's one of the big things.

2418
02:19:48.931 --> 02:19:52.380
We don't want to leave leave behind the like that would be one of the saddest

2419
02:19:52.381 --> 02:19:56.190
things.
So your family being remorseful that you weren't around,

2420
02:19:56.700 --> 02:20:00.720
but the idea of what you're saying is you wouldn't want to be downloaded into

2421
02:20:00.721 --> 02:20:03.660
some machine where you didn't experience all the joys and the actual person

2422
02:20:03.661 --> 02:20:04.470
experiences.

2423
02:20:04.470 --> 02:20:09.060
What I'm saying is I think they're going to be able to create artificial human

2424
02:20:09.061 --> 02:20:13.230
beings that literally you will get a whole new body to download yourself into

2425
02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:14.190
and you will,

2426
02:20:14.190 --> 02:20:18.090
you will drink wine and you will enjoy it and you will like blow jobs and you

2427
02:20:18.091 --> 02:20:21.810
were like waterparks since going skiing and you were like doing all the things

2428
02:20:21.811 --> 02:20:22.650
that a person likes.

2429
02:20:22.770 --> 02:20:25.890
You'll just be doing it in this completely new physical existence that they've

2430
02:20:25.891 --> 02:20:30.600
created.
An artificial human being with boobs and a vagina.
Brian is,

2431
02:20:30.601 --> 02:20:31.980
Brian would progress.
They would,

2432
02:20:32.130 --> 02:20:36.900
they would have like this one freak group forum somewhere and Brian would be a

2433
02:20:36.901 --> 02:20:39.360
part of it.
You have a penis and vagina

2434
02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:42.260
<v 2>come into my soul.
You know?</v>

2435
02:20:42.261 --> 02:20:44.720
I still think doing that would violate a lot of,

2436
02:20:44.780 --> 02:20:47.570
a lot of what it means to be a human being.

2437
02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:50.860
<v 1>Brian would have an excuse to be fat when he would do is he would put the vagina</v>

2438
02:20:51.010 --> 02:20:54.940
like an inch below his belly button so he could fold it over and literally fuck

2439
02:20:54.941 --> 02:20:58.600
himself or just fucking belly button.
It just be your belly button.
Winder.
Yeah,

2440
02:20:58.601 --> 02:21:01.100
you could do that stuff on door knobs.
Wouldn't be as good guy,

2441
02:21:01.490 --> 02:21:05.140
but belly button wouldn't be as good.
Um,
yeah,
it's,
it's,

2442
02:21:05.141 --> 02:21:09.970
it's going to be really interesting to see what,
what form all of this,
you know,

2443
02:21:09.971 --> 02:21:13.520
quote unquote progress and technological innovation and where,

2444
02:21:13.521 --> 02:21:16.390
where it goes because no one from,

2445
02:21:16.391 --> 02:21:19.720
obviously from the lost in space days where we're just looking at that no one

2446
02:21:19.721 --> 02:21:22.330
saw this coming and they didn't see the internet coming.
They didn't see,

2447
02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:26.230
you know,
Twitter or you know,
Wifi.
They didn't see any of that stuff.

2448
02:21:26.380 --> 02:21:29.200
And who knows what we're missing.
Who knows what we like,

2449
02:21:29.201 --> 02:21:32.890
what one big thing that's going to change the whole ball of wax,

2450
02:21:33.430 --> 02:21:35.440
like just drones,
you know,
there,

2451
02:21:35.441 --> 02:21:38.620
there was no drones and those old movies like the star wars,

2452
02:21:38.621 --> 02:21:41.430
it was like a few things.
It would fly around like jets and shit and,

2453
02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:47.680
but not like,
like what is going to be in our cities and just a few decades

2454
02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:49.310
<v 2>military is,</v>

2455
02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:54.320
is not a bad idea because the arpanet was a Darpa project turned into the

2456
02:21:54.981 --> 02:21:57.860
Internet,
gps,
satellites,

2457
02:21:57.980 --> 02:22:01.190
all that stuff that was all military tech that eventually went public.

2458
02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:04.460
It would be so awesome with,
they weren't killing innocent people.

2459
02:22:04.970 --> 02:22:08.960
So vehicles is from a Darpa project.

2460
02:22:09.530 --> 02:22:10.251
So you know,

2461
02:22:10.251 --> 02:22:13.580
if that was from the future combat initiative that has since gone away,

2462
02:22:13.610 --> 02:22:16.700
they wanted a lot of autonomous caravans because they are tired of humans

2463
02:22:16.701 --> 02:22:19.130
getting blown up with IED.
They were like,
wow.

2464
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:23.030
So look into the military is not a bad idea if you want to see what's coming

2465
02:22:23.031 --> 02:22:24.260
next for civilians.

2466
02:22:24.930 --> 02:22:29.830
<v 3>The,
um,
the,
the,
the real a spooky thing is the air force,
um,</v>

2467
02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:34.530
drone aviary where they're a working on all these different size drones,

2468
02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:37.350
flapping wing drones,
drones,
it looked like a bird.

2469
02:22:37.351 --> 02:22:41.310
They literally flap their wings and move like a bird.
There was a video,
um,
oh,

2470
02:22:41.311 --> 02:22:44.640
they showed all the different ones they have now these dragon fly ones that fit

2471
02:22:44.641 --> 02:22:48.750
on the tip of your finger.
It's incredible.
If these things were flying around,

2472
02:22:48.751 --> 02:22:52.360
you wouldn't have no idea.
You would really think that that was a bug.
And then,

2473
02:22:52.590 --> 02:22:54.300
and that's just a couple of years away,

2474
02:22:54.301 --> 02:22:56.160
they're going to be everywhere filming everything.

2475
02:22:56.180 --> 02:22:59.370
Micro air vehicles when they get smaller than six inches,
uh,

2476
02:22:59.500 --> 02:23:02.070
the flight that like all the flight dynamics change.

2477
02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:06.780
And so you have to start looking at insects instead of birds.
Oh really?

2478
02:23:06.781 --> 02:23:10.260
So that's why the design changes like that.
And so that's all,
I mean,
they,

2479
02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:14.610
they studied the dynamics of how insects fly and then they try to replicate it.

2480
02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:15.800
Um,
yeah,

2481
02:23:15.810 --> 02:23:19.980
you really wouldn't be able to keep up those rpms at the higher like mass.
Like,

2482
02:23:19.981 --> 02:23:24.080
that's why I like a pterodactyl wouldn't fly like a,
like a dragon fly.

2483
02:23:24.250 --> 02:23:27.240
Like I'm not an expert an expert on this in particular,

2484
02:23:27.241 --> 02:23:28.560
but like from what I understand,

2485
02:23:28.561 --> 02:23:32.730
the way of fly actually flaps its wings is it's more of a scoop because it's

2486
02:23:32.731 --> 02:23:37.470
like dealing with such a small number of like particles of air and it's actually

2487
02:23:38.090 --> 02:23:42.030
on becomes almost more like a fluid.
Um,
the way that it's interacting and yeah,

2488
02:23:42.031 --> 02:23:46.660
you don't have to do that on a larger scale.
You can,
you can get lift,
you know,

2489
02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:49.770
without having to do that.
But the agility of a fly,

2490
02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:51.510
if you really wrap your head around it,

2491
02:23:51.511 --> 02:23:53.910
like when you try to swat a fly and he darts away from you,

2492
02:23:54.180 --> 02:23:59.180
it is mind blowing how well those fuckers can move with that crazy setup,

2493
02:23:59.850 --> 02:24:04.850
this little round body and these giant clear wings have a lot of high level

2494
02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:05.990
thought going into it.

2495
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:09.780
We're just wired straight to their nervous system is to avoid obstacles.

2496
02:24:09.781 --> 02:24:14.040
I mean these are way easier to swat at a Scott and flies are killer bees.

2497
02:24:14.750 --> 02:24:17.350
You don't want that killer bee honey.
When you,

2498
02:24:17.370 --> 02:24:19.590
when you swat a be out of the sky though,

2499
02:24:19.591 --> 02:24:21.090
it's really not that much of an accomplishment.

2500
02:24:21.091 --> 02:24:23.940
If you can actually a swat a fly out of the sky and like,
Whoa,

2501
02:24:23.970 --> 02:24:28.500
bees kind of anticipates,
yeah,
flights are robots.

2502
02:24:28.501 --> 02:24:31.920
That's why flies and how many girls you don't want.
Man.
It flies were big.

2503
02:24:31.921 --> 02:24:35.280
We'd be fucking terrified.
The flies were from another planet and we found them.

2504
02:24:35.310 --> 02:24:39.870
If we,
if we like tuned into another planet and we got,
we sent a probe,
like we,

2505
02:24:40.050 --> 02:24:44.730
you know,
a light year away or whatever,
and they found giant insect forms.

2506
02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:49.380
If they were giant flies like flies the size of bowls.
Ooh,
that's pretty big.

2507
02:24:49.410 --> 02:24:50.320
I was reading terrifying.

2508
02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:54.150
That would be about this on like a io nine.com they had a deal about this

2509
02:24:54.151 --> 02:24:57.420
because insects used to be a lot bigger and it's apparently they,
you know,

2510
02:24:57.421 --> 02:25:01.020
they breathe through these little holes.
I can't remember what they're called,

2511
02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:03.510
but uh,
that's the way that they get oxygen.
Right.

2512
02:25:03.511 --> 02:25:07.230
And it used to be that there was more oxygen in the atmosphere and that's why

2513
02:25:07.231 --> 02:25:12.060
the bugs were all a shitload bigger dinosaurs are so big too,

2514
02:25:12.061 --> 02:25:16.260
because it would support their weight better.
Uh,
I dunno.
I don't think so.
No,
no.

2515
02:25:16.270 --> 02:25:19.380
I,
I'm not sure though,
but I know that the bugs,

2516
02:25:19.410 --> 02:25:22.140
because of the way they breathe specifically,

2517
02:25:22.141 --> 02:25:24.460
they don't have like lungs

2518
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:25.720
<v 5>like we do,
you know,</v>

2519
02:25:25.721 --> 02:25:28.270
they have just little holes and I don't know exactly how it works,

2520
02:25:28.271 --> 02:25:30.220
but apparently whenever there's a lot of high oxygen,

2521
02:25:30.460 --> 02:25:32.920
you get like a ratio that's better for them.

2522
02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:34.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2523
02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:37.060
<v 5>Well,
yeah,
it doesn't mean what I said doesn't make sense,</v>

2524
02:25:37.061 --> 02:25:40.840
but I think there was a,
there was some question I took it from,

2525
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:44.020
there was some question that the environment was thicker than the atmosphere was

2526
02:25:44.021 --> 02:25:46.840
thicker.
Um,
it was a very recent thing.

2527
02:25:47.170 --> 02:25:51.810
They were trying to figure out why they were so big.
Like what,
what led,
you know,

2528
02:25:51.850 --> 02:25:55.600
them to grow so large.
I forget what the,
uh,

2529
02:25:55.630 --> 02:26:00.400
the article was about I think,
but I think that was part of the,
uh,

2530
02:26:02.350 --> 02:26:05.440
part of the scenario that they're proposing was that something about the

2531
02:26:05.441 --> 02:26:09.760
atmosphere was much different and that it was easier to support giant forms of

2532
02:26:09.761 --> 02:26:11.410
life.
Then the other thing was like,

2533
02:26:11.411 --> 02:26:14.470
I guess like the trees and the vegetation was different back then.

2534
02:26:14.471 --> 02:26:16.990
And a lot of these animals were vegetable leaders.

2535
02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:19.240
And then if you're going to have a giant Brontosaurus,

2536
02:26:19.241 --> 02:26:21.340
if something's going to eat it,
it's gotta be like a TRX.

2537
02:26:21.341 --> 02:26:24.400
It's gotta be a Chai went fucking even bigger,
crazier thing.

2538
02:26:24.401 --> 02:26:27.280
So it's almost like the more plants you have to eat,

2539
02:26:27.310 --> 02:26:29.970
the bigger the things are that eat the plants and the bigger the things that eat

2540
02:26:29.971 --> 02:26:34.310
the things.
Yeah.
We were talking about this,
a documentary about a,
uh,

2541
02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:36.520
an area of Africa that's cut off the river,

2542
02:26:36.521 --> 02:26:39.430
changed its course just just a hundred years ago.

2543
02:26:39.730 --> 02:26:43.500
And this area has been isolated Kong action.
Well,
it's sort of,
it's,

2544
02:26:43.501 --> 02:26:47.830
it's lions and water buffaloes and the lions have grown larger because they have

2545
02:26:47.831 --> 02:26:51.370
to only take down water buffaloes.
Right.
So there's like one pack,

2546
02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:55.450
specifically a female lions that are biggest male lions.

2547
02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:58.510
They're enormous and it's all because they have to take down water buffalo.

2548
02:26:58.511 --> 02:27:01.000
It's like they've adapted to this one particular area.

2549
02:27:01.060 --> 02:27:05.380
Every animal is a solution to a problem,
but to robots,
that's the,

2550
02:27:05.410 --> 02:27:08.610
that's the question to robots and if they're going to have that engineered into

2551
02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:11.890
their system isn't,
aren't us the first shit they're going to get rid of?
Man?

2552
02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:14.470
I don't think so.
I think that they're just,
you know,

2553
02:27:14.471 --> 02:27:17.050
robots are tools and if we design them well,
they'll do it.

2554
02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:18.340
The fuckers are going to take over.
Dude,

2555
02:27:19.090 --> 02:27:22.570
do you believe that I type scenario where there's going to be people that don't

2556
02:27:22.571 --> 02:27:26.430
even know that they're robots?
Yeah.
You hope you get married.
One of those,

2557
02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:31.510
bring one of those in.
Look,
she's just going to stay with us for a while.

2558
02:27:32.270 --> 02:27:36.850
He just makes out with you when no one's around and then she's cleans.

2559
02:27:37.450 --> 02:27:41.270
Yeah.
It's like what we're going to eventually have to deal with the,

2560
02:27:41.271 --> 02:27:45.520
the moral aspects of ordering,
ordering them around,
helping them as slaves,

2561
02:27:46.090 --> 02:27:49.270
them sex,
sex tools.
I think that the human,

2562
02:27:49.350 --> 02:27:53.800
and I think that robots have the potential to be more human than we are to be

2563
02:27:53.801 --> 02:27:58.801
more moral than we are and to like be great examples for our children to raise

2564
02:27:59.831 --> 02:28:03.790
our children.
I think that I think we're going to become very,
very,

2565
02:28:03.791 --> 02:28:06.490
very intimate with these machines.

2566
02:28:06.491 --> 02:28:10.360
And can you stack your robot and then it's gonna make you real but fuck you and

2567
02:28:10.361 --> 02:28:14.050
kiss a kid.
Do you think it's ever possible that robots can be funny?

2568
02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:18.440
Will they have ever figured that out?
Is that a mathematical yeah,
I said that.

2569
02:28:18.441 --> 02:28:22.550
Is that a problem?
Is that what that is like?
Yeah,
you could build,

2570
02:28:22.910 --> 02:28:26.090
you can build a learner that would try to figure out what's funny specifically

2571
02:28:26.091 --> 02:28:27.830
and tell jokes.
I'm sure people have done that.

2572
02:28:27.831 --> 02:28:29.300
I bet if you look for that you find it.

2573
02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:34.130
I wonder if like it like a robot could craft a bunch of things that were

2574
02:28:34.131 --> 02:28:38.540
specifically funny because um,
you know,
we always want to think that a,

2575
02:28:38.541 --> 02:28:42.230
well there's certain things you can't do.
You can't recruit talent.
Maybe we can,

2576
02:28:42.231 --> 02:28:43.650
I mean,
maybe it was just like paintings.

2577
02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:48.140
Maybe we're just symphonies very rudimentary right now in our thoughts on what

2578
02:28:48.141 --> 02:28:50.540
robotics are or what artificial intelligence is.

2579
02:28:50.541 --> 02:28:53.660
But why would we think that we're so special that we can recreate it?

2580
02:28:53.661 --> 02:28:56.960
I mean it's really kind of arrogant.
I know.
And it's a losing battle,
right?

2581
02:28:56.961 --> 02:29:01.430
It's like every year there's a new thing that they can do and like we're slowly

2582
02:29:01.431 --> 02:29:03.890
shrinking down and you know,
at the end of the day,

2583
02:29:03.891 --> 02:29:06.710
the only thing that might be left as is that morality,

2584
02:29:06.711 --> 02:29:08.300
that ability to be good or evil,

2585
02:29:09.020 --> 02:29:12.170
that that lump of meat that has to sit behind the steering wheel to take the

2586
02:29:12.171 --> 02:29:13.450
blame.
Yeah.

2587
02:29:13.660 --> 02:29:17.280
All we have to offer and we have to figure out what is that fourth even why,

2588
02:29:17.281 --> 02:29:19.460
why does that exist?
What is it,
you know,
what,

2589
02:29:19.461 --> 02:29:24.140
what is it showing us about the human race where there is like there's a

2590
02:29:24.141 --> 02:29:29.120
positivity and there's energy to be derived from good behavior and from healthy

2591
02:29:29.121 --> 02:29:31.610
behavior.
It's just very difficult to teach that to people.

2592
02:29:31.730 --> 02:29:35.300
And if you negatively reinforce it and give them a lot of negative energy in

2593
02:29:35.301 --> 02:29:38.300
their life and a lot of negative experiences than they recreate that,

2594
02:29:38.330 --> 02:29:40.460
that sort of energy.
And they go after it over and over again.

2595
02:29:40.461 --> 02:29:44.750
They get addicted to a certain pattern.
And uh,
that's,
uh,

2596
02:29:44.810 --> 02:29:48.470
that's the number one issue with engineering human beings,
period.

2597
02:29:48.471 --> 02:29:49.520
Forget about robots.

2598
02:29:49.610 --> 02:29:53.300
We haven't even figured out how to get the human meat machine to operate in the

2599
02:29:53.301 --> 02:29:56.390
correct manner.
That's the great thing about humans,
right?
We have the,

2600
02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:59.870
we think at least that we have the free will and then we can be good or evil.

2601
02:29:59.871 --> 02:30:03.920
You know,
if you program a robot to be good no matter what,
then it's not good.

2602
02:30:03.921 --> 02:30:07.970
It's just doing it.
That's interesting.
That's like a lot of trust.
I mean,

2603
02:30:07.971 --> 02:30:12.410
if we ever have a machine that's capable of,
of doing that,
I mean that is like,

2604
02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:14.830
that's like creating life.
But if you say that,

2605
02:30:14.850 --> 02:30:18.410
say go out and do good or evil and then I'm going to see what what you do.

2606
02:30:18.411 --> 02:30:22.940
And you know,
that's some more biblical themes right there.
It really is,
right?

2607
02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:26.930
Yeah.
And that it really is biblical.
I mean,
you really are creating a life form.

2608
02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:28.131
If we,

2609
02:30:28.131 --> 02:30:31.640
if you were 52 years old and he had been divorced several times and yet almost

2610
02:30:31.641 --> 02:30:34.670
no money left and somebody gave you a beautiful robot,

2611
02:30:34.671 --> 02:30:38.710
suck slave that didn't want to vote and had no personality of its own,

2612
02:30:38.750 --> 02:30:42.740
just existed to fulfill your sexual needs,
maybe then you'd understand.

2613
02:30:42.980 --> 02:30:45.980
But right now you're a young man with hoping your eyes and dreams for the
future.

2614
02:30:46.250 --> 02:30:50.480
If you were broken by a steady stream of bad relationship choices and divorces

2615
02:30:50.481 --> 02:30:53.780
and you were living in a fucking shack outside of Palmdale with a car that's

2616
02:30:53.781 --> 02:30:56.930
broken down,
you wouldn't think twice about that robot fucked all.
You'd be like,

2617
02:30:56.931 --> 02:30:59.210
I'm out of the dating scene for life.

2618
02:30:59.720 --> 02:31:03.400
Do you think that will life make people happy or no,

2619
02:31:03.440 --> 02:31:08.390
but they rather they'd probably drown her and,
uh,
you know,

2620
02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:13.220
and you know,
kill themselves and in the process,
I dunno.
I think that,
um,

2621
02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:15.470
it's very hard for people to be happy.

2622
02:31:15.770 --> 02:31:20.280
And one of the things that people need in order to be happy in my opinion,

2623
02:31:20.450 --> 02:31:22.140
<v 1>is that you need happy people in your life.</v>

2624
02:31:22.141 --> 02:31:23.820
You need to surround yourself with happy people.

2625
02:31:23.850 --> 02:31:27.810
That alone is very difficult fine because finding a group of people that have

2626
02:31:27.811 --> 02:31:32.811
managed to maneuver and managed to carve a path through life that's been

2627
02:31:33.811 --> 02:31:37.320
generating the majority of what the people that are encountering with are

2628
02:31:37.321 --> 02:31:41.160
enjoying their company.
The majority of it is a positive experience.
Uh,

2629
02:31:41.180 --> 02:31:44.370
goals have been fulfilled.
You know,
health is an order.

2630
02:31:44.520 --> 02:31:45.630
All those different things,

2631
02:31:45.631 --> 02:31:48.540
all those variables that have to be in place in order to find a truly happy

2632
02:31:48.541 --> 02:31:49.200
person.

2633
02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:52.440
It's really difficult to accumulate a bunch of people like that and then get

2634
02:31:52.441 --> 02:31:55.290
together.
So occasionally,
like many of us in,

2635
02:31:55.291 --> 02:31:58.950
in our lives have known there are certain people we have to cut off.
You know,

2636
02:31:58.951 --> 02:32:00.570
there's,
there's a certain point in time,
you know,
okay,

2637
02:32:00.571 --> 02:32:04.290
this person is an energy vampire.
They never get in their own shit together.

2638
02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:07.650
You've got to cut me off for one.
You got Pee pee man.
See Sun.

2639
02:32:07.651 --> 02:32:11.340
I can hold my bladder strong.
My Goldberg.
You hear that?
Yeah,
please go.

2640
02:32:11.730 --> 02:32:15.330
Go through.
Right that their door and there's a door on the left.
See Dude,

2641
02:32:15.331 --> 02:32:20.130
I ramble so hard to make people pee their pants.
That's how I do son.
Uh,

2642
02:32:20.160 --> 02:32:24.990
people are requesting a Brian Red and Joe Rogan only podcast for number 300.

2643
02:32:25.730 --> 02:32:27.220
We have coming up.
Yeah,
it's coming in,
dude.

2644
02:32:27.230 --> 02:32:30.280
I think we only have like a couple more weeks.
We're at like,
what,

2645
02:32:30.281 --> 02:32:34.440
what number is this?
84.
That's ridiculous son.
We should,
uh,

2646
02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:38.400
see if we could coincide it somehow or another.
We timed them out.
Right.
We can,

2647
02:32:38.410 --> 02:32:41.250
uh,
coincided with the end of the month,

2648
02:32:41.430 --> 02:32:44.940
which is when we started in the first place,
right?
A J January.

2649
02:32:44.941 --> 02:32:49.770
We started January or December 31st.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was like New Year's Eve.

2650
02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:52.830
I think they'll,
they'll,
they'll probably know before us,

2651
02:32:53.010 --> 02:32:55.840
but it seems like that'll wind up around there.
You know,

2652
02:32:56.100 --> 02:32:58.380
we should probably time it to the shin.
Yeah,
that'd be cool.

2653
02:32:58.410 --> 02:33:01.890
And so we'll do a three year anniversary.

2654
02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:04.880
We've been doing this for three years.
That's crazy.
Ridiculous.
Yeah.

2655
02:33:05.130 --> 02:33:07.320
I've got a p two do you have any robot questions for this too?

2656
02:33:08.100 --> 02:33:11.040
Probably taking a big stink or there he was taking them all one off.

2657
02:33:11.370 --> 02:33:12.290
It might be beaten off.

2658
02:33:12.300 --> 02:33:16.230
All this talk about sex robots and robot fucked dolls in the Palmdale desert.

2659
02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:20.460
Let's check the toilet cam.
I think a robot fuck dolls.

2660
02:33:20.461 --> 02:33:23.490
It was probably going to be on the first things that people invent besides
maids.

2661
02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:27.930
You're going to learn if you can make like a terror Patrick looking made,

2662
02:33:28.110 --> 02:33:30.160
you're going to fuck it.
It's going to clean your house and you're gonna fuck.

2663
02:33:30.161 --> 02:33:32.010
I think it's going to start off as a pet at first.

2664
02:33:32.011 --> 02:33:35.370
It's going to be some kind of like animal,
like a cat.
I got a beat too,
man.

2665
02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:39.150
We're talking about Tara Patrick as a robot that you can fuck.

2666
02:33:39.870 --> 02:33:40.770
Elaborate please.

2667
02:33:42.740 --> 02:33:46.930
<v 2>Tara Patrick.
Oh,
I'm taking over now.
Huh?
Your grind.
Yeah.
Uh,</v>

2668
02:33:46.950 --> 02:33:48.740
so what do you think about the of garden?

2669
02:33:52.090 --> 02:33:54.530
I think the Olive Garden's pretty,
pretty nice.

2670
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:58.100
You know that there's a list of companies including the olive garden and red

2671
02:33:58.101 --> 02:34:01.160
lobster where they're like cutting everyone's hours so they don't have to give

2672
02:34:01.161 --> 02:34:05.570
them health care.
Have you heard about this?
It's like red lobster,
olive garden,

2673
02:34:05.571 --> 02:34:09.350
like all these legit companies and they just,
because of the Obamacare,

2674
02:34:09.380 --> 02:34:11.030
they're cutting everyone's hours.

2675
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:14.540
It's pretty fucking weird watching these companies do that.

2676
02:34:14.930 --> 02:34:17.100
It's sort of weird because of you see that there,

2677
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:21.430
the con the corporations have rebounded and they've got all this money but

2678
02:34:21.490 --> 02:34:25.990
they're still not like quite trusting that the economy is better.
So there's,

2679
02:34:26.020 --> 02:34:30.870
there's sort of sticking with all the cuts they made and sort of like,
you know,

2680
02:34:31.030 --> 02:34:34.390
riding that as long as they can.
Do you collect robots?

2681
02:34:34.391 --> 02:34:37.840
Do you have like a collection of toys or like,
you know,

2682
02:34:37.841 --> 02:34:42.570
or people give me robots a lot cause you know,
I'm the robot guy.

2683
02:34:42.571 --> 02:34:46.720
I've been studying them and you know,
so I have a lot of them around the house.

2684
02:34:46.780 --> 02:34:50.470
Like,
but I don't have to collect them myself.

2685
02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:53.440
I do like some of the robot art.
You know Eric Joiner,

2686
02:34:53.441 --> 02:34:58.430
he does all these robots and donuts.
Oh Wow.
Yeah,
no,
it's,
it's,

2687
02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:01.390
it's pretty Rad.
I remember the first robot I ever created,

2688
02:35:01.430 --> 02:35:04.090
I back in the day that you had an erector set,

2689
02:35:04.180 --> 02:35:05.410
and I don't know if you remember that.

2690
02:35:05.411 --> 02:35:08.650
It used to be like this yellow case that you would open up and inside were like

2691
02:35:08.651 --> 02:35:12.760
these miscellaneous motors and like metal pieces that you could put together.

2692
02:35:12.761 --> 02:35:16.210
And one of the things that they give you instructions for is how to build a

2693
02:35:16.211 --> 02:35:18.310
robot.
And this robot was just like,
uh,

2694
02:35:18.490 --> 02:35:22.390
I think it had like eyeballs that were light bulbs and it moved and stuff.

2695
02:35:22.391 --> 02:35:24.610
But as a kid and was like,
I built my own robot.

2696
02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:27.670
They were like a lot of eighties robot kits that you could buy.

2697
02:35:27.671 --> 02:35:31.240
And they were like,
look,
it's a robot,
right?
You're going to get a robot.

2698
02:35:31.241 --> 02:35:33.340
And then you get it and you're like,
I don't know,

2699
02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:37.110
<v 4>nerds,
you know,
they have that robot and you're like,
really?</v>

2700
02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:40.070
You remember Napoleon dynamite where the uncle got a time machine?

2701
02:35:40.100 --> 02:35:42.930
He kept writing,
right?
Yes.
It's like that stuff.

2702
02:35:44.650 --> 02:35:47.770
I told a friend and meet me at five,
but I got a text him real quick.

2703
02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:52.240
I'm so sorry.
Oh,
that's old.
We actually,
I almost five minutes.
Oh,
okay.

2704
02:35:52.370 --> 02:35:56.340
Well just really,
oh,
almost oh time.
10 minutes,
man.
Yeah,

2705
02:35:56.770 --> 02:36:00.010
it was a long ass podcast dude.
Um,
listen,

2706
02:36:00.430 --> 02:36:04.280
if anybody wants to get ahold of you,
they can get ahold of you on Twitter.
Um,

2707
02:36:04.330 --> 02:36:06.640
your,
uh,
your Twitter is,
what is it again?

2708
02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:10.690
It's Daniel Wilson PDX Daniel Wilson PDX lays.

2709
02:36:10.770 --> 02:36:12.580
I have to repeat it just in case they didn't hear you,

2710
02:36:12.581 --> 02:36:16.930
even though you were very clear.
Daniel Wilson PDX folks,

2711
02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:21.640
and you can,
uh,
also,
uh,
go to his website,
which is Daniel Wilson,

2712
02:36:21.670 --> 02:36:23.350
Daniel h wilson.com.

2713
02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:28.560
And the book is robot apocalypse cockpit in Robo popularity in Germany.

2714
02:36:30.191 --> 02:36:34.240
It's called robocall lips because the Po means ass.
Oh,
really?

2715
02:36:34.250 --> 02:36:36.360
The German editors were like,
Hey,
uh,

2716
02:36:36.361 --> 02:36:39.680
so we don't really want it to be like robot ass apocalypse.
Yeah,

2717
02:36:39.730 --> 02:36:42.940
that sounds perfect.
That sounds better,
man.
Why don't mind,

2718
02:36:43.350 --> 02:36:47.500
I might have to do a rewrite sensor in Uman.
The fucking,

2719
02:36:47.501 --> 02:36:50.770
the man is trying to keep you from selling books.
That's,
that's fucked up dude.

2720
02:36:51.070 --> 02:36:55.810
Um,
and um,
this,
um,
an amp does the other book,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2721
02:36:55.900 --> 02:36:59.500
It's on kindle or,
and all that stuff right there in bookstores or on Amazon.

2722
02:36:59.501 --> 02:37:03.670
And it's actually on audible.
I got one of those Barnes and noble nooks.

2723
02:37:04.050 --> 02:37:06.760
It's pretty bad ass dude.
I got it when I was in San Francisco.

2724
02:37:06.761 --> 02:37:11.300
I like it when you get a real tablet.
We're talking about,
I liked that too,
man.

2725
02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:14.410
But I like for reading,
you know what I like about it?
That it looks like,

2726
02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:18.800
it looks like print on paper.
It doesn't have that look of like an LCD screen.

2727
02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:22.850
Yeah.
You know,
the way,
uh,
the kindles look,
you know,
Kendall's of the noax,

2728
02:37:22.851 --> 02:37:27.740
they both have that sort of same paper paper look.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2729
02:37:27.741 --> 02:37:30.690
I liked that.
I think it's less,
less eye strain for free,

2730
02:37:30.691 --> 02:37:33.700
but when you can get your shit on that,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everything.

2731
02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:37.520
And what I love about that is on kindle,
if you like highlight something,

2732
02:37:37.521 --> 02:37:40.310
you know,
and the book,
then that stuff can be shared.

2733
02:37:40.530 --> 02:37:44.630
And so I can actually see what people are highlighting in the book and like see

2734
02:37:44.631 --> 02:37:47.330
what they like and if people comment about it.
So let's see.
You know,

2735
02:37:47.780 --> 02:37:49.700
that's some stupid shit.
You know,
how do they do that?

2736
02:37:49.700 --> 02:37:51.620
When they highlight it and share it,
what do they do?

2737
02:37:51.660 --> 02:37:54.710
Well then you have to have your settings to,
to share.
Oh,
that's beautiful.

2738
02:37:54.711 --> 02:37:55.580
What a great idea.

2739
02:37:55.610 --> 02:38:00.050
It's pretty cool as an author to be able to go on to Amazon and it's,

2740
02:38:00.051 --> 02:38:04.610
and like see what people are reading and that's some new stuff and see the exact

2741
02:38:04.611 --> 02:38:07.430
quotes that people responding to standup comic.

2742
02:38:07.431 --> 02:38:10.070
Like sometimes you'll say something and I show him the next night someone will

2743
02:38:10.071 --> 02:38:13.040
quote it and they'll be laughing.
And you,
Oh yeah,
I forgot I even said that.

2744
02:38:13.340 --> 02:38:18.050
You know,
it's,
it becomes,
uh,
these,
uh,
these quoted things.

2745
02:38:18.260 --> 02:38:19.100
When you,
uh,

2746
02:38:19.101 --> 02:38:23.860
when you see your stuff highlighted and you see like the things that people,
uh,

2747
02:38:23.970 --> 02:38:27.560
really enjoy or didn't enjoy,
how much does that affect your next writing?

2748
02:38:27.561 --> 02:38:32.561
Do you do really look a lot at the feedback and try to like see it from their

2749
02:38:32.601 --> 02:38:34.580
point of view?
Oh Man,
I,

2750
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:39.200
it affects my readings cause I'll try to go read when I do a reading I'll try to

2751
02:38:39.201 --> 02:38:43.850
read like the part that people,
like I said,
I think I'm smart,

2752
02:38:44.180 --> 02:38:49.010
right.
Good at writing.
But uh,
so it affects like which excerpts you choose.

2753
02:38:49.810 --> 02:38:52.490
Reading what I'm writing,
man,
I just like I,

2754
02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:55.460
when I'm nerding out and I'm like all super excited,

2755
02:38:55.490 --> 02:38:57.530
then I know I'm doing it right.
Basically.
Yeah.

2756
02:38:57.800 --> 02:38:59.030
Isn't that the coolest thing in the world?

2757
02:38:59.031 --> 02:39:02.750
Like when you're writing and an idea comes into your head and you just following

2758
02:39:02.751 --> 02:39:06.500
it down and it's like building and growing like right before your eyes,

2759
02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:11.390
being able to create something and being able to come up with some shit that

2760
02:39:11.391 --> 02:39:13.810
didn't exist before and then boom,
then all of a sudden it does.
It's a,

2761
02:39:13.811 --> 02:39:18.020
it's such an unbelievably satisfying experience and then it's there and it hangs

2762
02:39:18.021 --> 02:39:20.630
around it.
You got it like and like I did this,

2763
02:39:20.950 --> 02:39:25.840
this is what I did in like 2009 it's right there.
It's a thing I made.
Yeah.

2764
02:39:25.850 --> 02:39:26.960
That's why.
Yeah.
When,

2765
02:39:26.961 --> 02:39:31.220
if you have a job where you're able to create and then also make some kind of

2766
02:39:31.221 --> 02:39:31.881
artifact,

2767
02:39:31.881 --> 02:39:36.530
you know that you have and say I did that New York Times bestselling book and on

2768
02:39:36.531 --> 02:39:39.980
top of that people can continue to buy it.
It's always available.

2769
02:39:39.981 --> 02:39:41.970
They're going to always get it.
If they can get it in hard form,

2770
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:44.090
they can get into the digital form.
They can keep getting it.

2771
02:39:44.570 --> 02:39:47.710
It's pretty curious about this movie is going to do for it.
Oh,

2772
02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:48.980
it's going to blow through the roof.

2773
02:39:49.130 --> 02:39:51.800
If you just only had a few bitches getting raped,

2774
02:39:51.801 --> 02:39:56.210
choked and gags and ball gagged and a mouth fucked,

2775
02:39:56.270 --> 02:39:58.430
you just kind of have them abused a little bit more.

2776
02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:01.760
Do your books go in order at all?
If I'm right by him or no.

2777
02:40:01.761 --> 02:40:06.761
So rub apocalypse in amped are two different theories on this 50 shades of grey

2778
02:40:07.701 --> 02:40:11.690
thing and why women are into getting their mouth spit and stuff like that.

2779
02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:15.180
What does this change?
What is,
what's going on here?
Yeah,
I mean,

2780
02:40:15.181 --> 02:40:17.040
what do you think,
right?
Because,
well,

2781
02:40:17.041 --> 02:40:19.350
it's interesting that it started out as fan fiction,

2782
02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:23.650
but this was Edward and Bella.
You didn't know that.
Oh No,
I did not.

2783
02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:26.060
Book was fan fiction.
Shut the fuck up.

2784
02:40:26.110 --> 02:40:29.520
The leash shades of grey started out with twilight.
Yes,
it had the,

2785
02:40:29.850 --> 02:40:33.720
all they did literally was changed the names of the characters and then they

2786
02:40:33.721 --> 02:40:35.700
published it.
Don is ridiculous.

2787
02:40:36.410 --> 02:40:39.600
That's the most silly thing I've ever heard in my life.
It's the real deal.

2788
02:40:39.750 --> 02:40:44.670
So it was someone who was really into that and they just followed on that tone

2789
02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:48.930
and created like a sexual bondage version of it.
I wonder,

2790
02:40:48.931 --> 02:40:51.630
maybe that's what's the undercurrent,
right?
I mean,

2791
02:40:51.631 --> 02:40:56.550
so it's like twilight has a story,
you know,
and it has all this stuff,

2792
02:40:56.551 --> 02:41:00.920
but there's obviously a deep sexual undercurrent.
It's a love story.
Right?

2793
02:41:01.350 --> 02:41:06.000
And so this lady just went for the Juggler.
She's forget all the bullshit,

2794
02:41:06.430 --> 02:41:09.450
right,
to like fuck vampires.
Okay,
let's say he's a billionaire.

2795
02:41:09.451 --> 02:41:12.510
He's a financial plan pie that it's all just about fucking,
you know,

2796
02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:15.140
maybe that's it.
Maybe if you,
you know,

2797
02:41:15.150 --> 02:41:17.520
it's just humans are not as complicated as we like to think.

2798
02:41:17.521 --> 02:41:19.830
Maybe that's what it's really about.
I certainly think that's the case,

2799
02:41:19.831 --> 02:41:24.570
but I also think that women want to hear shit that's in their voice.

2800
02:41:24.810 --> 02:41:28.770
So like most pornography I think is from the male voice.

2801
02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:34.490
I just bought his book.
Nice.
I still got Ernie Ernie Cline applications.

2802
02:41:34.510 --> 02:41:38.210
Oh yeah.
If you've read that book.
Sure.
I love I'm,
I'm,
I blurbed it,

2803
02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:39.600
my blurbs on that book somewhere.

2804
02:41:40.410 --> 02:41:43.530
Do you think apple will ever shrink that bitch down so it fits in your pocket?

2805
02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:47.240
It does fit in my pocket.
You're like your pants check.
What comes down to brands?

2806
02:41:47.310 --> 02:41:52.000
Apple brand pants.
Can you get some apple pants?
Wait.

2807
02:41:52.340 --> 02:41:53.840
Okay.
If you sit,
if you sit down,

2808
02:41:53.841 --> 02:41:56.420
that was going to break and it's going to cut your Dick in half.
Oh my God.

2809
02:41:56.421 --> 02:41:58.860
It's one man.
It's what

2810
02:42:00.390 --> 02:42:02.120
you will will be one man,
one iPad.

2811
02:42:02.121 --> 02:42:05.960
Don't ever take that out when you're drunk but if you have like a a nice man

2812
02:42:05.961 --> 02:42:08.680
purse,
you can carry that around easily.
You shoot can you know?

2813
02:42:08.681 --> 02:42:11.750
You should know you're going to die.
You should commit to a man purse.

2814
02:42:12.510 --> 02:42:16.910
Commit to a man purse so you're a big proponent of that using that because you

2815
02:42:16.911 --> 02:42:19.910
can get online with it.
You can do photos,
everything.

2816
02:42:19.940 --> 02:42:20.870
It does pretty much everything.

2817
02:42:20.871 --> 02:42:24.860
I got the non sell your one because I have an iPhone that has a hotspot but I

2818
02:42:24.861 --> 02:42:27.890
think more that I'm using the hot spot feature on the iPhone.

2819
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:31.400
I think I would if you were going to get do get the one with the cell phone

2820
02:42:31.401 --> 02:42:34.130
service built into it.
It's just kind of more of a pain in the butt.

2821
02:42:34.131 --> 02:42:36.920
Like oh I gotta turn on my hot spot.
That's what I was thinking.

2822
02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:41.320
I was thinking that we probably better to wait for the other version of it but

2823
02:42:41.380 --> 02:42:46.130
as as compared to the IPADS,
I have both of them definitely.

2824
02:42:46.131 --> 02:42:50.090
I love this one better.
I carry it's enough.
That is what you need,
right?

2825
02:42:50.091 --> 02:42:52.730
It's like what was crazy when we were in Seattle.

2826
02:42:52.730 --> 02:42:55.970
Well and we were streaming from it.
We streamed to Ustream show from it.
Yeah.

2827
02:42:56.690 --> 02:43:00.050
We lost Daniel.
Sorry.
Do you,

2828
02:43:00.110 --> 02:43:02.520
do you give a fuck about this kind of stuff or are you just holding into

2829
02:43:02.530 --> 02:43:07.280
robotics?
I uh,
whatever.
Yeah,
no,
what I'm saying I,
I'm not,

2830
02:43:07.281 --> 02:43:09.360
I don't really collect a lot of gadgets.
No Real,

2831
02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:13.260
I have this thing that is like the Magna doodle,
you know,
where you,
you,

2832
02:43:13.820 --> 02:43:17.500
you use the little magnet thing and you draw on it and that's like the closest

2833
02:43:17.501 --> 02:43:20.230
thing to about two an I pad,
but it's like at my house right now.

2834
02:43:20.940 --> 02:43:25.330
The clown or what's the one?
The client.
It is a totally from like my kid.
Yeah.

2835
02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:30.890
It's pretty bad ass.
Light.
Bright.
Honestly,

2836
02:43:31.210 --> 02:43:34.420
I'm just scared because it changes everything.
Every time you get one,

2837
02:43:34.750 --> 02:43:36.510
you know like already I'm not,
if I,

2838
02:43:36.610 --> 02:43:41.190
if I look at the stupid phone you saw that I forget about everything.

2839
02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:45.310
I'm like a little retarded.
When someone has a new one,
five minutes,

2840
02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:49.600
we're almost done.
If someone has a new one man,
like I'm drawn to it like a baby.

2841
02:43:50.550 --> 02:43:54.460
And that's the other thing.
Little kids love it.
So if you bring it up,

2842
02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:57.260
it's like bringing crack home.
It's May you're done.

2843
02:43:57.261 --> 02:44:00.440
And I'm kind of afraid of how it will affect my kids too cause I just

2844
02:44:00.460 --> 02:44:03.550
educational shows on there and there's educational does games that they can

2845
02:44:03.551 --> 02:44:04.600
count.
They learn how to count

2846
02:44:06.850 --> 02:44:11.410
a certain feline companion enjoys using the IPAD.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2847
02:44:11.411 --> 02:44:14.380
My cat plays with my iPad and pisses all over my couch and that's not a

2848
02:44:14.381 --> 02:44:18.880
euphemism.
I can't play with my iPad.

2849
02:44:18.881 --> 02:44:23.050
And then she pisses all over my couch with a black guy.
A black gentleman

2850
02:44:27.550 --> 02:44:31.700
was name is William [inaudible].

2851
02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:36.420
IPAD was born in the 40 [inaudible] right.

2852
02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:42.070
This is all one pocket play.
It's actually Katt Williams.
Oh Try Williams.

2853
02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:46.710
Okay.
Upside.
No
Gentlemen,

2854
02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:51.100
I think we gave out all the information.
We probably could.
Uh,
Daniel H.

2855
02:44:51.100 --> 02:44:55.960
Wilson PDX on Twitter.
Daniel H.
Wilson.
Oh it's no,
it's Daniel Wilson.

2856
02:44:55.961 --> 02:45:00.250
PDX on quit on Twitter,
not Daniel H.
Wilson.
So Daniel Wilson PDX on Twitter.

2857
02:45:00.251 --> 02:45:03.460
Daniel h wilson.com.
Thanks a lot man.
It's been really fun.

2858
02:45:03.461 --> 02:45:05.480
It was a fun conversation.
Really interesting stuff.

2859
02:45:05.500 --> 02:45:08.770
And if you ever have anything you want to promote,
want to come back,
do it again.

2860
02:45:08.771 --> 02:45:11.050
We'll be happy to have you on.
Dude.
I had a great time.

2861
02:45:11.051 --> 02:45:15.700
Sorry I had to urinate so I had it too.
Once you did it,

2862
02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:20.710
you broke the ice.
But we know it's fucking three hours.

2863
02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:22.370
We don't even take commercial breaks,
you know?

2864
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:25.090
But I think it makes for a better conversation that way.
It's hard to,

2865
02:45:25.570 --> 02:45:28.270
it's hard to take a commercial break and then come back and we'll just pick up

2866
02:45:28.271 --> 02:45:29.890
where you were.
Just seems awkward,
you know?

2867
02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:33.190
So we do it this way and it requires people hold their bladder.

2868
02:45:33.191 --> 02:45:35.750
I keep it together.
I think he did an excellent job though.

2869
02:45:35.751 --> 02:45:39.310
You had a big thing of water.
You lasted like two hours,
let's say.
Pretty strong.

2870
02:45:39.340 --> 02:45:42.280
Thank you guys so much.
You're welcome man.
Thank you in a great time.
And uh,

2871
02:45:42.281 --> 02:45:46.420
one more time.
The,
the two books,
your books are Robo,

2872
02:45:46.421 --> 02:45:50.470
apocalypse and amped.
And those are the ones that you're promoting,
right?

2873
02:45:50.471 --> 02:45:53.110
But you have more than that,
right?
How many books you're off all together.

2874
02:45:53.350 --> 02:45:57.750
Eight go by and bitches go get him on an audible go get.
Oh yeah.

2875
02:45:58.270 --> 02:46:01.030
Do you have them on audible?
Beautiful.

2876
02:46:01.210 --> 02:46:04.690
Go to audible.com and if you go to audible com forward slash Joe,

2877
