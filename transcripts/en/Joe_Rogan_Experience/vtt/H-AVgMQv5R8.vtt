<v Speaker 1>network so they rent time on a sprint </v>
<v Speaker 1>network,</v>

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been getting to,</v>

117
00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:28.101
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out all these other people that </v>

118
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:30.691
<v Speaker 1>share these interests in and really kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what some people would think would be</v>

119
00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:35.761
<v Speaker 1>obscure things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is talks about </v>

120
00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:36.820
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

121
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.690
<v Speaker 1>the Terence Mckenna talks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Timothy leary talks.</v>

122
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.200
<v Speaker 1>It's so rare to find a place where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can find a lot of those.</v>

123
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.570
<v Speaker 1>And in the case of your podcast to </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic salon,</v>

124
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.810
<v Speaker 1>it's the best one I've ever found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I found it,</v>

125
00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I was so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

126
00:06:54.371 --> 00:06:58.390
<v Speaker 1>this guy's got everything you have like </v>
<v Speaker 1>every mckenna recording,</v>

127
00:06:58.391 --> 00:07:01.630
<v Speaker 1>like ever you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these Timothy leary,</v>

128
00:07:01.631 --> 00:07:04.210
<v Speaker 1>recordings and Alan Watts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

129
00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:04.620
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

130
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 1>who don't you have anybody essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's ever said anything weird about </v>

131
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 1>drugs?</v>

132
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have Joe Rogan yet,</v>

133
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.580
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

134
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.120
<v Speaker 1>podcasts I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could go on and we can talk about </v>

135
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.120
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

136
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.350
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You started the podcast intentionally </v>

137
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.350
<v Speaker 3>and mine was just accidental.</v>

138
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was it.</v>

139
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the misconception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't start intentionally at all.</v>

140
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

141
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Now we just turned on a Webcam once </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing it,</v>

142
00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:33.010
<v Speaker 1>like at ustream broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just screwing around just for a oof.</v>

143
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we started the same way then.</v>

144
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 3>How did you get yours on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

145
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of a Geeky guy and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at tech and we're actually up at</v>

146
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.480
<v Speaker 3>a mind states conference and I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>already produced this blanket and rj </v>

147
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.391
<v Speaker 3>talks at burning man and had them up on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the web and little 10 minute increments </v>

148
00:07:51.391 --> 00:07:55.150
<v Speaker 3>to keep the file size down and we're up </v>
<v Speaker 3>at this mind states conference and a guy</v>

149
00:07:55.151 --> 00:07:56.170
<v Speaker 3>comes up to me and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

150
00:07:56.171 --> 00:07:58.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I use all that stuff you have?</v>

151
00:07:58.721 --> 00:07:59.530
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

152
00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:00.220
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

153
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.580
<v Speaker 3>I thought about it too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't have an ipod so I didn't </v>

154
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:05.580
<v Speaker 3>think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

155
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:05.980
<v Speaker 3>you don't need one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do it in your computer.</v>

156
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.130
<v Speaker 3>So I waited a couple months and he never</v>
<v Speaker 3>started his podcast.</v>

157
00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:09.900
<v Speaker 3>And so I got ahold of him.</v>

158
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.140
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you still going to do that?</v>

159
00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:11.680
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

160
00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:12.130
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

161
00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:13.300
<v Speaker 3>if you don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to use them.</v>

162
00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:13.660
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

163
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:15.940
<v Speaker 3>they're yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I made a pie.</v>

164
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.170
<v Speaker 3>I did a podcast of a talk I gave first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I did one that a friend of mine</v>

165
00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:22.270
<v Speaker 3>made of terrence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last one actually,</v>

166
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:24.910
<v Speaker 3>he gave him plenty or next to last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

167
00:08:24.911 --> 00:08:25.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

168
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.450
<v Speaker 3>I did those two and I was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out how the tech worked.</v>

169
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:33.390
<v Speaker 3>And so then I put up my stuff from </v>
<v Speaker 3>blanket and rj and uh,</v>

170
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:38.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was still just playing around with it </v>

171
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.351
<v Speaker 3>and I kind of looked in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 10 people and maybe 20 and 30 </v>

172
00:08:40.351 --> 00:08:40.351
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

173
00:08:40.351 --> 00:08:44.490
<v Speaker 3>downloading it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably my friends and all of a sudden </v>

174
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.560
<v Speaker 3>I get contacted by this Guy Kmo and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>been up to maybe 100 downloads.</v>

175
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.700
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

176
00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:50.320
<v Speaker 3>I love your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

177
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:55.450
<v Speaker 3>these guys over in England doing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dope fiend is doing something and he </v>

178
00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:55.450
<v Speaker 3>likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

179
00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 3>so I started kind of hookup doing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dope fiend.</v>

180
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know about the dope fiend?</v>

181
00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

182
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 3>It's a great podcast to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on the cannabis podcast network and</v>

183
00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 3>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can find it.</v>

184
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 3>A dope fiend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that code at UK and they're a great </v>

185
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.761
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a whole series of podcasts </v>

186
00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:18.550
<v Speaker 3>there to the cannabis network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

187
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

188
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.300
<v Speaker 3>he has some good music shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

189
00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:22.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

190
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

191
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I first found you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

192
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.030
<v Speaker 3>during my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

193
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.080
<v Speaker 3>stoner a bachelor days on news radio for</v>
<v Speaker 3>so and uh,</v>

194
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.380
<v Speaker 3>then I was lifting to lefties lounge </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's one of the podcasts on the dope </v>

195
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:41.091
<v Speaker 3>fiend network and he plays music and </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy and all of a sudden there's some </v>

196
00:09:41.091 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 3>cuts from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

197
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:41.930
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

198
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

199
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:47.451
<v Speaker 3>Joe's got this podcast now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's how I found your podcast </v>

200
00:09:47.451 --> 00:09:47.451
<v Speaker 3>was through theirs.</v>

201
00:09:47.451 --> 00:09:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so cool.</v>

202
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure how I found out about </v>

203
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:52.600
<v Speaker 1>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

204
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.560
<v Speaker 1>it was probably twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone suggesting it online or maybe my</v>

205
00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:55.850
<v Speaker 1>message board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have been,</v>

206
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't really remember who turned me </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto it,</v>

207
00:09:59.121 --> 00:10:04.121
<v Speaker 1>but it was more than one person and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it was probably because like I </v>

208
00:10:04.121 --> 00:10:06.680
<v Speaker 1>would occasionally post like a clip that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

209
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:07.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.000
<v Speaker 1>like on Youtube for like Mckenna lecture</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>

211
00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:13.370
<v Speaker 1>or one of those really cool videos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some people have done.</v>

212
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:18.670
<v Speaker 1>That's one of them are amazing things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the internet is all these user </v>

213
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.001
<v Speaker 1>created videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just posted one today that </v>

214
00:10:22.001 --> 00:10:22.001
<v Speaker 1>someone made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea who did it.</v>

215
00:10:22.001 --> 00:10:24.470
<v Speaker 1>And they did it with things that I said </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a podcast.</v>

216
00:10:24.471 --> 00:10:25.880
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fantastic.</v>

217
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.610
<v Speaker 1>They did a fantastic job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

218
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing where you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 1>you can a thing that you put out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the sudden it gets caught on by </v>

220
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:41.171
<v Speaker 1>these other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they add all these things to </v>

221
00:10:41.171 --> 00:10:41.171
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Music and visuals.</v>

222
00:10:41.171 --> 00:10:44.150
<v Speaker 1>And it becomes even bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some of these Mckenna ones were a,</v>

223
00:10:44.151 --> 00:10:49.151
<v Speaker 1>him giving a lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've put them to visuals and </v>

224
00:10:49.151 --> 00:10:53.110
<v Speaker 1>sounds and they're just amazing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're super inspirational.</v>

225
00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:58.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every week I get links to some graphic </v>

226
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.321
<v Speaker 3>artists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that Sunday I used the clip for your </v>

227
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:03.211
<v Speaker 3>podcast and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just wonderful to see it </v>

228
00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:05.521
<v Speaker 3>because I think the visuals really </v>
<v Speaker 3>enhanced what terrance has to say or </v>

229
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:05.521
<v Speaker 3>anybody say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

230
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:10.260
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you had a lot of people spin off </v>

231
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.871
<v Speaker 3>podcast podcast after listening to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a few have done that with me and </v>

232
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:16.440
<v Speaker 3>some of them hadn't stuck around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like these two guys started a </v>

233
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.120
<v Speaker 3>podcast called black light in the attic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really cool out of Chicago.</v>

234
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:25.110
<v Speaker 3>What they did is they did a 12 part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a youtube video series in how to use </v>

235
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.070
<v Speaker 3>audacity and it's still the best thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>

236
00:11:27.071 --> 00:11:29.740
<v Speaker 3>So what's audacity?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Audacity is a free open source,</v>

237
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.930
<v Speaker 3>a sound sa hardware software.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an audio multitrack.</v>

238
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do lots and lots of stuff with </v>

239
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:39.940
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's free open source.</v>

240
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.110
<v Speaker 3>It's probably a more used in podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 3>than anything.</v>

241
00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

242
00:11:42.071 --> 00:11:44.170
<v Speaker 3>but they did a 12 part youtube thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

243
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:49.180
<v Speaker 3>it's in every once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to learn something new in </v>

244
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:49.180
<v Speaker 3>audacity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to one of those kids podcasts.</v>

245
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:49.180
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

246
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.550
<v Speaker 1>so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you must do everything yourself.</v>

247
00:11:51.551 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Then you must edit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put all the clips together.</v>

248
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

249
00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:57.570
<v Speaker 3>the procedure is I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

250
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listened to a talk first and a lot of,</v>

251
00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

252
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:05.521
<v Speaker 3>there's a question she can't hear so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to cut those out and you've got to </v>

253
00:12:05.521 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 3>boost and adjust the sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I get the sound as best I can and I'm</v>

254
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 3>taking notes at the same time because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>put program notes,</v>

255
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:14.821
<v Speaker 3>noodles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>short quotes and all because Google and </v>

256
00:12:14.821 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 3>Duckduckgo and those other search </v>
<v Speaker 3>engines don't search the audio.</v>

257
00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 3>And so I've made a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

258
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:23.881
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to get like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 quotes of terrance and each one of </v>

259
00:12:23.881 --> 00:12:26.020
<v Speaker 3>his lectures so that they're searchable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then once I have that done,</v>

260
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:31.021
<v Speaker 3>then I write a script where I introduce </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and then I close out and I write the </v>

261
00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:34.720
<v Speaker 3>script out and rehearse it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I read it so.</v>

262
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:35.920
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then of course,</v>

263
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:40.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to cut the pieces together </v>

264
00:12:40.921 --> 00:12:40.921
<v Speaker 3>and add the music and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

265
00:12:40.921 --> 00:12:43.990
<v Speaker 3>turn into MP three file and put it on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rss feed and put it out there.</v>

266
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:45.040
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do the whole thing.</v>

267
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I respect that so much because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this podcast is so easy.</v>

268
00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 1>We don't ever edit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go live.</v>

269
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:55.330
<v Speaker 1>We just let it roll SCO once it's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gone.</v>

270
00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck up.</v>

271
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 1>We fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

272
00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:57.490
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

273
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.990
<v Speaker 1>it's got every bump possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all happening like that.</v>

274
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.690
<v Speaker 3>That's the magic of your podcast because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

275
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.580
<v Speaker 3>I've listened to quite a few of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts.</v>

276
00:13:05.581 --> 00:13:09.420
<v Speaker 3>I listened to the comedians in my wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>listens to your serious interviews,</v>

277
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.450
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're every one of your podcasts.</v>

278
00:13:12.451 --> 00:13:17.451
<v Speaker 3>I've wanted to jump in and talk and I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked to a lot of my friends that </v>

279
00:13:17.451 --> 00:13:17.451
<v Speaker 3>listen to it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

280
00:13:17.451 --> 00:13:17.810
<v Speaker 3>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

281
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.100
<v Speaker 3>he's just like one of us and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk with them.</v>

282
00:13:20.101 --> 00:13:23.010
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the real genius of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this podcast.</v>

283
00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.890
<v Speaker 3>It's just two guys or three or four or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever sitting around talking.</v>

284
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that hilarious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what kind of society who we become </v>

285
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.250
<v Speaker 1>were just a regular conversation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>novel,</v>

286
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.030
<v Speaker 1>regular conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck are they doing?</v>

287
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 1>What are they just talking?</v>

288
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

289
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:43.090
<v Speaker 3>years ago when I was living in Tampa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you on a Saturday night there's guy</v>

290
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:44.560
<v Speaker 3>named,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carroll subtler who did a,</v>

291
00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.660
<v Speaker 3>a chatterbox cafe and we go down from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from 10 till two.</v>

292
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.000
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the,</v>

293
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:56.250
<v Speaker 3>the thing was it was about 12 of us sit </v>
<v Speaker 3>around a table like this and we all </v>

294
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.980
<v Speaker 3>drink and just talk and they could have </v>
<v Speaker 3>collins to and so people could </v>

295
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.680
<v Speaker 3>essentially go to a bar without leaving </v>
<v Speaker 3>their house and you wouldn't have to </v>

296
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:04.680
<v Speaker 3>drive drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the sound effects were like a bar</v>

297
00:14:04.681 --> 00:14:07.660
<v Speaker 3>and all and we'd all assume characters </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sit around and talk.</v>

298
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:09.430
<v Speaker 3>And it was a hugely popular show.</v>

299
00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

300
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.270
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of audio theater,</v>

301
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:19.300
<v Speaker 1>which is basically what podcasts are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a completely new thing to me at </v>

302
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:19.610
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

303
00:14:19.611 --> 00:14:24.611
<v Speaker 1>it kind of existed before because when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a child I listened to audio </v>

304
00:14:24.681 --> 00:14:27.890
<v Speaker 1>recordings on a record on the large </v>
<v Speaker 1>vinyl,</v>

305
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like of course I would listen to standup</v>

306
00:14:30.291 --> 00:14:35.291
<v Speaker 1>comedians and cheech and Chong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines and you just </v>

307
00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.100
<v Speaker 1>sit around and listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the beautiful thing about podcast is</v>

308
00:14:37.101 --> 00:14:39.590
<v Speaker 1>most of the time when people are tuning </v>
<v Speaker 1>into this,</v>

309
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.660
<v Speaker 1>enjoying this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing something else,</v>

310
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:46.300
<v Speaker 1>like you're at the gym or you're driving</v>
<v Speaker 1>your car and commuting to work or school</v>

311
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:48.300
<v Speaker 1>or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're doing something else.</v>

312
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.270
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

313
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 3>and it's like the old radio see grew up </v>
<v Speaker 3>in radio.</v>

314
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 3>We</v>

315
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.440
<v Speaker 4>didn't have a TV until I was in like </v>
<v Speaker 4>sixth or seventh grade.</v>

316
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.160
<v Speaker 4>And so when I'd come home from school in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the afternoon,</v>

317
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.870
<v Speaker 4>my brother and I looked through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>radio listing just like TV guide and you</v>

318
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:06.970
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was fibber mcgee and molly and the </v>

319
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.790
<v Speaker 4>shadow and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my dad and I on Sunday afternoon </v>

320
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:09.680
<v Speaker 4>down the basement would listen to all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these great shows.</v>

321
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.740
<v Speaker 4>We had an episode of a news radio where </v>
<v Speaker 4>Andy Dick became obsessed with fibber </v>

322
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.110
<v Speaker 4>mcgee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Molly,</v>

323
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:19.280
<v Speaker 4>I remember that listening to all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>recordings and laughing and like walking</v>

324
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:24.281
<v Speaker 4>into walls and stuff because he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>laughing so hard and that was the first </v>

325
00:15:24.281 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 4>time I'd ever heard of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you where they lived.</v>

326
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:27.650
<v Speaker 4>Seventy nine wistful vista drive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

327
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.720
<v Speaker 4>I listened to all the February Mcgee and</v>
<v Speaker 4>molly,</v>

328
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.590
<v Speaker 4>that's silly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

329
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 4>it's such an interesting time in our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in our society when the families used to</v>

330
00:15:35.181 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 4>sit around the radio and listen to like </v>
<v Speaker 4>orson wells and those kinds of things.</v>

331
00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:40.790
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all we had,</v>

332
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that uh,</v>

333
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:46.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 71 now so I can go back a little </v>

334
00:15:46.601 --> 00:15:46.601
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

335
00:15:46.601 --> 00:15:50.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel like things have changed </v>

336
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.451
<v Speaker 4>that much because podcasts have sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>turned into the old radio and people </v>

337
00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:52.670
<v Speaker 4>walk around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you said,</v>

338
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:54.290
<v Speaker 4>it's a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not sitting at home,</v>

339
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at radio.</v>

340
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.920
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my case it's far less professional,</v>

341
00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not very unprofessional podcasts,</v>

342
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't listen to any podcasts.</v>

343
00:16:05.571 --> 00:16:07.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if there is such a thing as</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

344
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.670
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

345
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:08.940
<v Speaker 4>there are actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

346
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:14.470
<v Speaker 4>I used to listen to a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 4>American and they had a good 20 minute </v>

347
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.410
<v Speaker 4>one that was a good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I kind of fell away from that.</v>

348
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.060
<v Speaker 4>A nurse at this hospital that I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get this procedure done,</v>

349
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:25.090
<v Speaker 4>recommended radio lab and the first one </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I tuned into was this one about </v>

350
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:31.271
<v Speaker 4>these Kenyan runners from this very </v>
<v Speaker 4>specific village and she was just going </v>

351
00:16:31.271 --> 00:16:34.550
<v Speaker 4>on in depth about it and then like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>hear her describe this intense thing and</v>

352
00:16:34.551 --> 00:16:35.810
<v Speaker 4>then to actually listen to the show.</v>

353
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.370
<v Speaker 4>Like radial labs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really good.</v>

354
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.640
<v Speaker 4>They have like sound effects that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>play while they're giving their talk on </v>

355
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.661
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They bring in people to have interviews </v>

356
00:16:46.661 --> 00:16:47.210
<v Speaker 4>and they sort of interject in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>interview,</v>

357
00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:52.211
<v Speaker 4>like build.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy will be talking and they'll </v>

358
00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:52.580
<v Speaker 4>explain like why this is so significant </v>
<v Speaker 4>and like they'll.</v>

359
00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:57.581
<v Speaker 4>And then let the guy talk more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting like the guy </v>

360
00:16:57.581 --> 00:17:01.001
<v Speaker 4>talks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but instead of interrupting him as he's </v>

361
00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:01.490
<v Speaker 4>talking and he's just sort of edit </v>
<v Speaker 4>things in after the fact.</v>

362
00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:06.491
<v Speaker 4>So they're having an interview with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy and they not just interview him but </v>

363
00:17:06.491 --> 00:17:07.580
<v Speaker 4>also interject in the middle of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's doing,</v>

364
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:12.820
<v Speaker 4>various facts and information that </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually enhance the story and make it </v>

365
00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.010
<v Speaker 4>richer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really well done,</v>

366
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:18.340
<v Speaker 4>and it was all about this one tribe of </v>
<v Speaker 4>runners is just like unbelievably </v>

367
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.481
<v Speaker 4>awesome and it comes to this rite of </v>
<v Speaker 4>passage ritual that they do with </v>

368
00:17:22.481 --> 00:17:25.550
<v Speaker 4>circumcision and I heard you talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that with grant at the same track,</v>

369
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:30.710
<v Speaker 4>so awful terrible stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they became like super immune to the</v>

370
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:35.711
<v Speaker 4>response of pain or or to responding to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pain or super determined or super </v>

371
00:17:36.861 --> 00:17:41.861
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their level of either their level of </v>

372
00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:44.360
<v Speaker 4>pain tolerance or their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>suppress it,</v>

373
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.060
<v Speaker 4>whatever the hell it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they must be converting that pain to</v>

374
00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 4>new kinds of energy of some kind for </v>
<v Speaker 4>their long distance running.</v>

375
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

376
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:56.631
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's also super critical in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their society that you get through this </v>

377
00:17:56.631 --> 00:17:58.260
<v Speaker 1>ritual and if you don't get through this</v>
<v Speaker 1>ritual,</v>

378
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:00.750
<v Speaker 1>you're not thought of as a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

379
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 1>We all have our rituals and there are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot less painful than most places.</v>

380
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:10.450
<v Speaker 1>That one sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's really insane was that this </v>

381
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.331
<v Speaker 1>guy was talking about his sons and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want his sons to go through </v>

382
00:18:14.641 --> 00:18:17.700
<v Speaker 1>what he had to go through and he thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally as a person who did it,</v>

383
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:23.050
<v Speaker 1>that there was other ways to build </v>
<v Speaker 1>character and I thought that was really </v>

384
00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:23.050
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

385
00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:23.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

386
00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a step in what we would call a more</v>

387
00:18:25.541 --> 00:18:26.980
<v Speaker 3>civilized behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

388
00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.080
<v Speaker 3>we'll have to take generations to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>what.</v>

389
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.310
<v Speaker 1>So also love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

390
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.970
<v Speaker 1>when there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you love your children,</v>

391
00:18:33.971 --> 00:18:36.550
<v Speaker 1>you don't want them to go to the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of shit that you went through,</v>

392
00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to make an interesting </v>

393
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:41.640
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

394
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:41.770
<v Speaker 1>You give them bad parenting and drop </v>
<v Speaker 1>them off in a shitty neighborhood.</v>

395
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.520
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want for my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

396
00:18:44.521 --> 00:18:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kid didn't want to grow up like I did</v>

397
00:18:46.931 --> 00:18:48.890
<v Speaker 1>and I had a wonderful childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

398
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:53.910
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're working on now as a </v>

399
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:54.760
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's on purpose or not,</v>

400
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.880
<v Speaker 1>by by you putting out those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts by me trying to have as many </v>

401
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.570
<v Speaker 1>podcasts as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're all working on,</v>

402
00:19:01.571 --> 00:19:06.571
<v Speaker 1>I think is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all looking at this world that </v>

403
00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:08.260
<v Speaker 1>we're living in and going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we have to do things this way?</v>

404
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

405
00:19:09.161 --> 00:19:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Is this really necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more that word gets out,</v>

406
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.680
<v Speaker 1>it's not a violent word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

407
00:19:14.681 --> 00:19:17.140
<v Speaker 1>It's just a realistic word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

408
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:17.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

409
00:19:17.981 --> 00:19:19.240
<v Speaker 1>we're all just going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

410
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

411
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're not trying to run the world,</v>

412
00:19:22.001 --> 00:19:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hog up all the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to steal anybody's natural gas,</v>

413
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.640
<v Speaker 1>but I also don't want to watch you do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

414
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to watch this crazy world </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're living in where it's really </v>

415
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.810
<v Speaker 1>obvious that what things are being done </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not fair.</v>

416
00:19:34.811 --> 00:19:39.811
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you can have a </v>

417
00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:42.961
<v Speaker 1>society the way our society is where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so big and so disconnected and not </v>

418
00:19:43.811 --> 00:19:46.570
<v Speaker 1>have people that are acting in their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>self interest,</v>

419
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.020
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that that's the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>way it can be done.</v>

420
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.630
<v Speaker 1>I think once we become more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected,</v>

421
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.700
<v Speaker 1>and I think podcasts are a big part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

422
00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.120
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics are a big part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet itself,</v>

423
00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.370
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of Psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a big part of that.</v>

424
00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.370
<v Speaker 1>As those things bring people closer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer together,</v>

425
00:20:03.371 --> 00:20:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I just think less of that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors necessary.</v>

426
00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Less of it is justified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have it is unexplained.</v>

427
00:20:10.031 --> 00:20:11.890
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda all out there now.</v>

428
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.380
<v Speaker 1>We understand people way better than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever did.</v>

429
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're realizing that we're all alike.</v>

430
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.910
<v Speaker 3>When you get down to the operator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

431
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.330
<v Speaker 3>below the operating system to machine </v>
<v Speaker 3>code.</v>

432
00:20:21.331 --> 00:20:26.331
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my very closest friends in the </v>

433
00:20:26.331 --> 00:20:26.331
<v Speaker 3>world is Vietnamese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a eight year old orphan time.</v>

434
00:20:26.331 --> 00:20:28.170
<v Speaker 3>I was over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know him then,</v>

435
00:20:28.171 --> 00:20:30.390
<v Speaker 3>but we've become really close over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

436
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.720
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once we got through all the culture and </v>

437
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.500
<v Speaker 3>the politics and the religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just talking about people's stuff,</v>

438
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:42.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and his problems with his wife were the </v>

439
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:42.530
<v Speaker 3>same as I was having with my girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time.</v>

440
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.220
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and on a human level,</v>

441
00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:48.820
<v Speaker 3>we realize how just identical we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter where you go in the world,</v>

442
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are,</v>

443
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.780
<v Speaker 3>are the same except they get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>overlays of culture and religion and </v>

444
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.771
<v Speaker 3>family and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you can break through those </v>

445
00:20:58.771 --> 00:20:59.650
<v Speaker 3>barriers and that's where psychedelics I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think are very helpful.</v>

446
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.330
<v Speaker 3>You'll find out that we're all alike and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can figure out how to get along</v>

447
00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:07.920
<v Speaker 1>both different and alike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But our differences are external.</v>

448
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:08.700
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

449
00:21:08.701 --> 00:21:10.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual human being like what does,</v>

450
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.180
<v Speaker 1>what does the person want out of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

451
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

452
00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160
<v Speaker 1>we want happiness,</v>

453
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

454
00:21:14.751 --> 00:21:16.670
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to get rid of any </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

455
00:21:16.671 --> 00:21:21.671
<v Speaker 3>I think they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What added all the spice and the flavor </v>

456
00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:21.671
<v Speaker 3>to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to see the cultures,</v>

457
00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:23.650
<v Speaker 3>but I think we need to quit fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

458
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.070
<v Speaker 3>we never quit fighting.</v>

459
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also an issue that a lot of </v>

460
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:30.090
<v Speaker 1>cultures evolve around these ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are outdated,</v>

461
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:30.970
<v Speaker 1>antiquated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

462
00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.370
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of religious cultures that</v>

463
00:21:33.371 --> 00:21:35.770
<v Speaker 1>are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a beautiful culture.</v>

464
00:21:35.771 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their artworks fantastic.</v>

465
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.000
<v Speaker 1>They're the way they dress is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>

466
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:45.001
<v Speaker 1>but Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how progressive they are to each </v>

467
00:21:45.001 --> 00:21:45.001
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how they treat women.</v>

468
00:21:45.001 --> 00:21:49.051
<v Speaker 1>Look at Saudi Arabia in 2013 women have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to protest for their right to drive a </v>

469
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:54.241
<v Speaker 1>car like Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look on the way they have to dress </v>

470
00:21:54.241 --> 00:21:54.730
<v Speaker 1>in that heat and they get the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes,</v>

471
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:57.670
<v Speaker 1>not the white ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely insane.</v>

472
00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.710
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's old as fuck.</v>

473
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.740
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was from a time when people didn't </v>

474
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:04.740
<v Speaker 1>know any better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

475
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.300
<v Speaker 1>The idea that your God wants you to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is beyond ridiculous.</v>

476
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:13.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion is basically superstition when </v>

477
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:13.210
<v Speaker 3>you come down to it.</v>

478
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.360
<v Speaker 1>A huge part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get the idea that I get that </v>

479
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:18.640
<v Speaker 1>people need a higher power or believe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a higher power,</v>

480
00:22:18.641 --> 00:22:23.641
<v Speaker 1>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you can't see that there's the </v>

481
00:22:23.641 --> 00:22:25.951
<v Speaker 1>hand of man and something that tells you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should stone homosexuals to </v>

482
00:22:25.951 --> 00:22:27.280
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't see the hand of man in that.</v>

483
00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:29.440
<v Speaker 1>You really think that that's the way God</v>
<v Speaker 1>would handle it.</v>

484
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Why would it God invent homosexuals in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place if you don't think that </v>

485
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:35.080
<v Speaker 1>they're doing that because they're born </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way?</v>

486
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Look there I'm sure have been men who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are heterosexual who are like,</v>

487
00:22:39.221 --> 00:22:42.370
<v Speaker 1>let's see what the fuss is all about and</v>
<v Speaker 1>went over and did some gay shit.</v>

488
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it happened.</v>

489
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with that,</v>

490
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 1>but the reality of being gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever met anybody who's gay,</v>

491
00:22:50.351 --> 00:22:54.910
<v Speaker 1>is that most people who are gay always </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew it from the time they were born.</v>

492
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would God create that?</v>

493
00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.190
<v Speaker 1>What would you got to create someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was born in a way that makes them just </v>

494
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.180
<v Speaker 1>by nature of existing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to stone them to death.</v>

495
00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.590
<v Speaker 1>You should stone them to death.</v>

496
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:06.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

497
00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:09.520
<v Speaker 3>my youngest son is gay and when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>finally came out I said,</v>

498
00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:09.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

499
00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:12.850
<v Speaker 3>I've been talking to your sister about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this for 10 years.</v>

500
00:23:12.851 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

501
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.540
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew I was gay that long too.</v>

502
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.600
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just had to get the courage to come </v>

503
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.161
<v Speaker 3>out and just last January he got married</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Washington DC and it was a,</v>

504
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.530
<v Speaker 3>he was a kind of a big deal at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy Center.</v>

505
00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:31.531
<v Speaker 3>And so it was a big society wedding and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing social event with </v>

506
00:23:31.531 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of people there and people from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the State Department and everywhere.</v>

507
00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:35.910
<v Speaker 3>And Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

508
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:41.220
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could tell the tables that were the </v>

509
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.090
<v Speaker 3>old established straight people who came</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to be polite at first,</v>

510
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:48.390
<v Speaker 3>but it turned into such a wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 3>party and they had the wedding and then </v>

511
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:49.940
<v Speaker 3>a dinner and then the reception all in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same place.</v>

512
00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:52.940
<v Speaker 3>And everybody stayed until the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>closed down.</v>

513
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:55.400
<v Speaker 3>They were having their.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mainly the old people are watching.</v>

514
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:57.080
<v Speaker 3>The young people danced because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

515
00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:58.100
<v Speaker 3>well my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

516
00:23:58.101 --> 00:24:03.101
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my son's husband is a principal dancer </v>

517
00:24:03.101 --> 00:24:03.101
<v Speaker 3>at the Susan Farrell Valet.</v>

518
00:24:03.101 --> 00:24:04.180
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gay Ballet Dancer.</v>

519
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:09.190
<v Speaker 4>This story just doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't think there'd be whether </v>

520
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:11.040
<v Speaker 4>there's one or two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it a funding that there's certain,</v>

521
00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:16.041
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you hear guys an interior </v>

522
00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:16.041
<v Speaker 4>decorator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

523
00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:16.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many straight dudes.</v>

524
00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there are some or they get mad </v>
<v Speaker 4>at me saying this right now,</v>

525
00:24:20.051 --> 00:24:25.051
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know why it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's something about certain </v>

526
00:24:25.051 --> 00:24:25.051
<v Speaker 4>professions</v>

527
00:24:25.051 --> 00:24:26.500
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what you were really,</v>

528
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't look gay or not gay.</v>

529
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.280
<v Speaker 3>But boy is he a hell of a dancer?</v>

530
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

531
00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.760
<v Speaker 4>that's always been the rumor about John </v>
<v Speaker 4>Travolta.</v>

532
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:40.790
<v Speaker 4>He's probably not even gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are excited about Saturday night </v>

533
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.660
<v Speaker 4>fever was still good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was too good.</v>

534
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.870
<v Speaker 4>It was just changed the way people </v>
<v Speaker 4>decided to mate.</v>

535
00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.320
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if mating dance,</v>

536
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.770
<v Speaker 4>if you want to</v>

537
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:52.790
<v Speaker 3>go to a fun wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just go to a same sex marriage because </v>

538
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:52.830
<v Speaker 3>it's new for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something.</v>

539
00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.310
<v Speaker 3>They're really celebrating something for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time.</v>

540
00:24:56.311 --> 00:24:58.110
<v Speaker 3>It's a very joyous occasion.</v>

541
00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.830
<v Speaker 4>They don't feel pressured into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not like you guys have been together for</v>

542
00:25:01.831 --> 00:25:03.690
<v Speaker 4>five years and he hasn't gotten your </v>
<v Speaker 4>ring.</v>

543
00:25:03.691 --> 00:25:04.700
<v Speaker 4>This is bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

544
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.690
<v Speaker 4>You need to let him know that this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>unacceptable.</v>

545
00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:10.550
<v Speaker 4>All Gay guys don't have a girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

546
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.330
<v Speaker 4>They're doing it out of love there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're a wonderful couple.</v>

547
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.170
<v Speaker 4>Where's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where is it legal now?</v>

548
00:25:16.171 --> 00:25:19.620
<v Speaker 4>How many states is gay marriage?</v>
<v Speaker 4>About 15 or something like that.</v>

549
00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.070
<v Speaker 4>It's happening right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Slowly but surely.</v>

550
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See he had just moved to Florida taking </v>

551
00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:28.210
<v Speaker 3>a new job and they'd already had all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these plans,</v>

552
00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:30.410
<v Speaker 3>but he couldn't get married in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they left everything in DC.</v>

553
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.600
<v Speaker 4>15 states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're seeing a legal same sex marriage </v>

554
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:40.670
<v Speaker 4>and then there's also more states were </v>
<v Speaker 4>34 that ban same sex marriage.</v>

555
00:25:42.551 --> 00:25:47.551
<v Speaker 4>There's more than ban it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but recently there's been a federal </v>

556
00:25:47.551 --> 00:25:48.390
<v Speaker 4>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The tax department is going to recognize</v>

557
00:25:48.391 --> 00:25:51.000
<v Speaker 4>it no matter what state they live in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is fascinating though.</v>

558
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:56.150
<v Speaker 4>There's states where it's banned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like they have banned same sex </v>

559
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.500
<v Speaker 4>marriages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>34 of them.</v>

560
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:00.860
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really had to go out of the way there.</v>

561
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.190
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so stupid.</v>

562
00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.660
<v Speaker 4>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to believe.</v>

563
00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:08.690
<v Speaker 4>It's so stupid that people in this day </v>
<v Speaker 4>and age decide what two people can't do </v>

564
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.700
<v Speaker 4>because of their sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if she.</v>

565
00:26:11.701 --> 00:26:13.440
<v Speaker 4>If marriage is legal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

566
00:26:13.441 --> 00:26:16.260
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not sure it should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if marriage is legal,</v>

567
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.180
<v Speaker 4>why shouldn't it be legal for gay </v>
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>

568
00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.360
<v Speaker 4>It's just so sensible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so dumb.</v>

569
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.030
<v Speaker 4>It's such a weird thing to get behind.</v>

570
00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.070
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's your end game here?</v>

571
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:31.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand how you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>behind anybody who would be getting </v>

572
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.920
<v Speaker 4>behind this outside of some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious belief.</v>

573
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.560
<v Speaker 4>You've lost me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you care?</v>

574
00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.230
<v Speaker 4>What do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that somehow know that it's</v>

<v Speaker 4>about why people being gang getting </v>

577
00:26:46.341 --> 00:26:50.151

593
00:27:24.101 --> 00:27:27.420
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe it's still around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I remember when I was a kid,</v>

594
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:32.570
<v Speaker 4>I've told this story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the interest of this particular </v>

595
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:36.711
<v Speaker 4>discussion when I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I was 11 years old and I had </v>

596
00:27:36.711 --> 00:27:39.951
<v Speaker 4>moved from San Francisco to Florida and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of things that I didn't </v>

597
00:27:39.951 --> 00:27:39.951
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>San Francisco.</v>

598
00:27:39.951 --> 00:27:44.610
<v Speaker 4>He was incredibly open minded and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>really remember being very aware of the </v>

599
00:27:45.091 --> 00:27:50.091
<v Speaker 4>difference immediately upon moving to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Florida because I had a friend from Mark</v>

600
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.950
<v Speaker 4>Cuban Friends Name Candy and his Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ca candy.</v>

601
00:27:55.951 --> 00:27:57.480
<v Speaker 4>Escondido or something like that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

602
00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.590
<v Speaker 4>Last name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget his last name,</v>

603
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.890
<v Speaker 4>but his dad was screaming and yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slamming the newspaper on the table.</v>

604
00:28:01.891 --> 00:28:05.880
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like trying to figure out what</v>

605
00:28:05.881 --> 00:28:06.980
<v Speaker 4>was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

606
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:08.270
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

607
00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:09.030
<v Speaker 4>And He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

612
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.970
<v Speaker 4>He was mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was throwing the newspaper down.</v>

613
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.620
<v Speaker 4>I was 11.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Did they kiss?</v>

628
00:28:53.881 --> 00:28:54.300
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>let we show the pictures of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so now they're really cool with it.</v>

630
00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:03.111
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of them the other day told her </v>

<v Speaker 4>is married to a boy,</v>

633
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.920
<v Speaker 4>so it's going to be normal for these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

634
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.070
<v Speaker 4>It should have been normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Long time ago when I was a kid,</v>

635
00:29:11.071 --> 00:29:13.290
<v Speaker 4>I lived in San Francisco next to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>gay couple.</v>

636
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.960
<v Speaker 4>It was a black guy and his boyfriend is </v>
<v Speaker 4>white dude.</v>

637
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:21.230
<v Speaker 4>And my aunt used to go down there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would smoke pot and play bongos </v>

638
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.870
<v Speaker 4>naked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would all get together.</v>

639
00:29:21.871 --> 00:29:23.250
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking seven.</v>

640
00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.330
<v Speaker 4>They would all go next door to the gay </v>
<v Speaker 4>couples house.</v>

641
00:29:27.331 --> 00:29:30.000
<v Speaker 4>It was totally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely normal.</v>

642
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.980
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a black guy,</v>

643
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.050
<v Speaker 4>there's an Asian guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a gay guy.</v>

644
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:35.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like good another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

645
00:29:35.521 --> 00:29:40.521
<v Speaker 4>it's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know what the word nigger </v>

646
00:29:40.521 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 4>meant when I moved to Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked mother and she</v>

647
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.310
<v Speaker 1>got mad at me because she thought I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing games and I said,</v>

648
00:29:45.311 --> 00:29:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean?</v>

649
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Because someone said it at school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she just.</v>

650
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.950
<v Speaker 1>She said it's a derogatory term for </v>
<v Speaker 1>black people.</v>

651
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.690
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

652
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you were,</v>

653
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.820
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven years old?</v>

654
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I was 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eleven is when I first moved to Florida.</v>

655
00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.270
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I couldn't believe it.</v>

656
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.990
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't experienced hardly any racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in San Francisco,</v>

657
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.250
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just the,</v>

658
00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:05.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

659
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:09.460
<v Speaker 1>the age of Utopia had expired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

660
00:30:09.461 --> 00:30:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Which is like the 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the late 19 sixties in San Francisco.</v>

661
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:18.270
<v Speaker 1>But there was still an echo of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding and progressive thinking </v>

662
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:20.450
<v Speaker 1>in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no other place.</v>

663
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a big difference to go from </v>

664
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.400
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco in the seventies to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Gainesville,</v>

665
00:30:27.401 --> 00:30:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

666
00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Which is just back ass retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were feeding the alligators </v>

667
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.250
<v Speaker 1>marshmallows and this fucking lake near </v>
<v Speaker 1>my house.</v>

668
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was ridiculous.</v>

669
00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:39.160
<v Speaker 1>The difference,</v>

670
00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:44.240
<v Speaker 3>I moved from California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Florida and that's where all my </v>

671
00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:44.550
<v Speaker 3>kids live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not fit for human habitation.</v>

672
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:45.760
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't not go back.</v>

673
00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy fucking state.</v>

674
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.730
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived in San Francisco in the late 66,</v>

675
00:30:50.731 --> 00:30:55.731
<v Speaker 3>early [inaudible] 67 and I had just </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten married my now ex wife,</v>

676
00:30:56.131 --> 00:30:59.670
<v Speaker 3>but she was a Texan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>born and raised in Houston.</v>

677
00:30:59.671 --> 00:31:00.930
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

678
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.180
<v Speaker 3>she had a three year old son who's my </v>
<v Speaker 3>son.</v>

679
00:31:03.181 --> 00:31:05.400
<v Speaker 3>He's my oldest son and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

680
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.120
<v Speaker 3>adopted him and he was in the navy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

681
00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.700
<v Speaker 3>we're in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is our first a month living together and</v>

682
00:31:11.701 --> 00:31:13.860
<v Speaker 3>she grew up in the south and called </v>
<v Speaker 3>black people narrows.</v>

683
00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.270
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

684
00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.480
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have more kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just can't have that.</v>

685
00:31:18.481 --> 00:31:19.080
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

686
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.240
<v Speaker 3>that's just what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

687
00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.180
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

688
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:22.470
<v Speaker 3>let's make a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Do that.</v>

689
00:31:22.471 --> 00:31:23.340
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

690
00:31:23.341 --> 00:31:25.980
<v Speaker 3>you're smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want them smoking.</v>

691
00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.520
<v Speaker 3>And that's the day I quit smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she never said nigger again.</v>

692
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Quit smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But our kids are pretty well balanced.</v>

693
00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great story.</v>

694
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

695
00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:42.380
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it just takes one thing to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to quit something as stupid as small</v>

696
00:31:42.381 --> 00:31:44.100
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One realization I had,</v>

697
00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:49.120
<v Speaker 3>I have a really important reason and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't want my kids growing up like </v>

698
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:49.120
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

699
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:49.120
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

700
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.181
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't want them growing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>around someone who smoked cigarettes </v>

701
00:31:53.181 --> 00:31:53.181
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

702
00:31:53.181 --> 00:31:53.181
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

703
00:31:53.181 --> 00:31:55.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing that they did where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they got that through.</v>

704
00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to really look at problems </v>

705
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.500
<v Speaker 1>that we have right now in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big one and there's a big one </v>

706
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:07.020
<v Speaker 1>that all these people who run for office</v>
<v Speaker 1>who get into office,</v>

707
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.420
<v Speaker 1>they're all concerned with the loss of </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

708
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:12.180
<v Speaker 1>They're all concerned with health and </v>
<v Speaker 1>safety.</v>

709
00:32:12.181 --> 00:32:15.690
<v Speaker 1>They're all concerned with environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>pollution.</v>

710
00:32:15.691 --> 00:32:20.691
<v Speaker 1>They're concerned with economic growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are concerned with all these different </v>

711
00:32:20.691 --> 00:32:22.980
<v Speaker 1>things to benefit human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet they never mentioned cigarettes.</v>

712
00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to talk about one of the </v>

713
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:28.890
<v Speaker 1>biggest and most obvious pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence for conspiracy,</v>

714
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:34.370
<v Speaker 1>a conspiracy where half a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion people die every year.</v>

715
00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many fucking people die every year </v>

716
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.850
<v Speaker 1>from cigarettes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 4,000</v>

717
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:41.540
<v Speaker 4>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just in this country.</v>

718
00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:43.250
<v Speaker 4>We would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is worldwide,</v>

719
00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:45.470
<v Speaker 4>but it's got to be something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we find out what the number is.</v>

720
00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:49.070
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's ever died from cannabis and Odi</v>
<v Speaker 4>of cannabis.</v>

721
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 4>It just imagine that there was an issue </v>
<v Speaker 4>where 400,000</v>

722
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:55.280
<v Speaker 4>people died in your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your country a year,</v>

723
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:58.220
<v Speaker 4>$400,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yet no one brings it up ever.</v>

724
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:03.430
<v Speaker 4>That's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so hard to believe that you're </v>

725
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:04.310
<v Speaker 4>not talking about 400,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>lifetime,</v>

726
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:09.430
<v Speaker 4>which is an insane body account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an insane body count for more </v>

727
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 4>than all the wars civil thing about like</v>
<v Speaker 4>19.</v>

728
00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:11.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever the.</v>

729
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:13.460
<v Speaker 4>They found out that cigarettes are bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>

730
00:33:13.461 --> 00:33:16.460
<v Speaker 4>It was the 19 fifties or sixties or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was where they first started</v>

731
00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:16.910
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

732
00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a connection between </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people dying of fucking cancer and</v>

733
00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:22.640
<v Speaker 4>smoking on these burning chemical soaked</v>
<v Speaker 4>rags.</v>

734
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:28.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there might be a connection there that </v>

735
00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:28.220
<v Speaker 4>think about how many people have died </v>
<v Speaker 4>since then.</v>

736
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.480
<v Speaker 4>Millions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

737
00:33:29.481 --> 00:33:30.650
<v Speaker 4>many things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then each,</v>

738
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:34.390
<v Speaker 4>you're an estimated 443,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and other pushing them on,</v>

739
00:33:34.391 --> 00:33:35.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the Asian kids,</v>

740
00:33:35.991 --> 00:33:36.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

741
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.900
<v Speaker 4>they're really pushing cigarettes over </v>
<v Speaker 4>there because it's not growing here.</v>

742
00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:44.000
<v Speaker 4>Put that backups here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says each year an estimated 443,000</v>

743
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:47.360
<v Speaker 4>die prematurely from smoking or exposure</v>
<v Speaker 4>to secondhand smoke,</v>

744
00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:52.361
<v Speaker 4>which is even darker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And another eight point 6 million live </v>

745
00:33:52.361 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 4>with a serious illness caused by </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking.</v>

746
00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:58.900
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Approximately 46 point 6 million US </v>

747
00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.760
<v Speaker 4>adults smoked cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

748
00:34:01.761 --> 00:34:06.761
<v Speaker 4>that's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But both my father and my brother died </v>

749
00:34:06.761 --> 00:34:08.330
<v Speaker 4>from smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an insane number.</v>

750
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.900
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know it was that high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

751
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:15.080
<v Speaker 4>That's like under 4 million a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just.</v>

752
00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:20.110
<v Speaker 4>It's also like knowing that you've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your society has been infiltrated </v>

753
00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.480
<v Speaker 4>by like aliens that are designed to kill</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

754
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.060
<v Speaker 4>If it was aliens that were killing </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and not cigarettes,</v>

755
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.030
<v Speaker 4>we would be terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd feel like we're under attack.</v>

756
00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:30.540
<v Speaker 4>It will be a war and cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

757
00:34:30.541 --> 00:34:33.710
<v Speaker 4>There's these aliens are killing 400,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people every year.</v>

758
00:34:33.711 --> 00:34:37.550
<v Speaker 4>What do we do that making 800 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>people sick as well?</v>

759
00:34:37.551 --> 00:34:38.810
<v Speaker 4>Like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do we do?</v>

760
00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:40.580
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that say,</v>

761
00:34:40.581 --> 00:34:42.980
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to smoke until I'm 45 or 50 or</v>

762
00:34:42.981 --> 00:34:47.981
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My father and my brother both spoke </v>

763
00:34:47.981 --> 00:34:50.740
<v Speaker 4>until they were about 50 and they each </v>
<v Speaker 4>only lived about 10 years after they </v>

764
00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.190
<v Speaker 4>quit smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They both died at 63.</v>

765
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:52.810
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

766
00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all smoking.</v>

767
00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.230
<v Speaker 4>I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

768
00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.540
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's horrible.</v>

769
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.060
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing how many people go for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

770
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.340
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

771
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:04.070
<v Speaker 4>you have to have some kind of really big</v>
<v Speaker 4>motivation because it's.</v>

772
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:06.260
<v Speaker 4>Nicotine is more addicting than heroin.</v>

773
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:08.720
<v Speaker 4>I've heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

774
00:35:08.721 --> 00:35:11.380
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

775
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.820
<v Speaker 4>the heroin addiction is and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody thinks is not 100 percent.</v>

776
00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:17.030
<v Speaker 4>This is closer to only about 30 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good.</v>

777
00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.380
<v Speaker 4>Physically addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

778
00:35:18.381 --> 00:35:19.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's low nicotine's,</v>

779
00:35:19.821 --> 00:35:22.820
<v Speaker 4>but 75 percent and heroines about 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent.</v>

780
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:26.090
<v Speaker 4>We need to find out who those lucky </v>
<v Speaker 4>bitches are that are like 25 percent non</v>

781
00:35:26.091 --> 00:35:29.060
<v Speaker 4>addicted to cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 percent non addicted to heroin.</v>

782
00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.790
<v Speaker 4>Figuring out who those guys are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Check their jeans.</v>

783
00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What an awesome fucking trait to have.</v>

784
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.410
<v Speaker 4>Not get addicted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

785
00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:37.740
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really sad.</v>

786
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:42.770
<v Speaker 4>It's really sad because it's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence that as long as money is </v>

787
00:35:43.051 --> 00:35:48.051
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not looking at people's health </v>

788
00:35:48.051 --> 00:35:48.051
<v Speaker 4>and welfare</v>

789
00:35:48.051 --> 00:35:51.910
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and most of us are addicted to caffeine </v>

790
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:52.660
<v Speaker 3>like it or not know when you do a diet </v>
<v Speaker 3>for Iowasca,</v>

791
00:35:52.661 --> 00:35:57.661
<v Speaker 3>you have to go off caffeine for at least</v>
<v Speaker 3>a week ahead of time as well in our </v>

792
00:35:57.661 --> 00:36:00.580
<v Speaker 3>tradition that I'm involved in or was </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in that caffeine was one of the</v>

793
00:36:00.581 --> 00:36:02.860
<v Speaker 3>things you gave up for at least a week </v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead of time.</v>

794
00:36:02.861 --> 00:36:06.160
<v Speaker 3>And I had to start weaning myself a </v>
<v Speaker 3>month ahead of time.</v>

795
00:36:06.161 --> 00:36:11.161
<v Speaker 3>Just cutting it down and less and less </v>
<v Speaker 3>because when I go cold Turkey on </v>

796
00:36:11.161 --> 00:36:11.800
<v Speaker 3>caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within three days,</v>

797
00:36:11.801 --> 00:36:14.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm up standing up all night with cramps</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my legs.</v>

798
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.500
<v Speaker 3>Not just the headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really at caffeine that takes go cold </v>

799
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.400
<v Speaker 3>Turkey on caffeine for just even if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>only drink two or three cups a day.</v>

800
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 4>Well I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

801
00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:28.180
<v Speaker 4>when I would stay up late writing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would drink a shitload of coffee and </v>

802
00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.300
<v Speaker 4>all I was concerned with was getting the</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing done.</v>

803
00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:34.570
<v Speaker 4>And then I realized one day I woke up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the next morning got out fucking </v>

804
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:37.000
<v Speaker 4>pounding headache and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my head,</v>

805
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:42.010
<v Speaker 4>or then I realized they're just hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a cup of coffee yet and I went no </v>

806
00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:43.040
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I allowed myself to get this hooked</v>

807
00:36:43.041 --> 00:36:44.570
<v Speaker 4>on this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I quit.</v>

808
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:49.930
<v Speaker 4>And then I took like several months off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I started drinking coffee </v>

809
00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.861
<v Speaker 4>conservatively since then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I went without it for quite a while </v>

810
00:36:53.861 --> 00:36:53.861
<v Speaker 4>because it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

811
00:36:53.861 --> 00:36:58.661
<v Speaker 4>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I had a headache from not having </v>

812
00:36:58.661 --> 00:36:58.790
<v Speaker 4>something that didn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's stupid.</v>

813
00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after I had been off,</v>

814
00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:04.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do a week before and the week after </v>

815
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:04.750
<v Speaker 3>and after I'd been off it for two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a half a cup of coffee,</v>

816
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:06.010
<v Speaker 3>lammy buzzing all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

817
00:37:06.011 --> 00:37:11.011
<v Speaker 3>it's a real drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great drug if you only use it </v>

818
00:37:11.011 --> 00:37:11.011
<v Speaker 3>once in a while,</v>

819
00:37:11.011 --> 00:37:11.490
<v Speaker 4>it's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

820
00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:14.120
<v Speaker 4>it's another thing about coffee is it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>

821
00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:19.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to talk about a drug that you </v>

822
00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.251
<v Speaker 4>can just tap into every five steps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the only drug that labor contracts </v>

823
00:37:21.251 --> 00:37:22.040
<v Speaker 4>require.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have a coffee break.</v>

824
00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:23.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting,</v>

825
00:37:23.451 --> 00:37:25.190
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

826
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:25.940
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

827
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:30.970
<v Speaker 4>back in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they used to smoke cigarettes in the </v>

828
00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:30.970
<v Speaker 4>office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

829
00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:30.970
<v Speaker 3>the old days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

830
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.590
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

831
00:37:31.591 --> 00:37:36.591
<v Speaker 3>I guess it was a while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but about 18 years ago is when they </v>

832
00:37:36.591 --> 00:37:36.770
<v Speaker 3>finally got rid of it where I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where.</v>

833
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:40.260
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And rise in 18 years.</v>

834
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:42.330
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't verizon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those Gtd then.</v>

835
00:37:42.331 --> 00:37:43.450
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

836
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.500
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cubicle hell and there was one corner.</v>

837
00:37:46.501 --> 00:37:51.501
<v Speaker 4>They put all the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See all the people in the one corner </v>

838
00:37:51.501 --> 00:37:51.501
<v Speaker 4>there were smokers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

839
00:37:51.501 --> 00:37:51.501
<v Speaker 4>And of course it filled the whole room </v>
<v Speaker 4>any hours.</v>

840
00:37:51.501 --> 00:37:54.690
<v Speaker 4>So you could see this little cloud over </v>
<v Speaker 4>this one area.</v>

841
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.720
<v Speaker 4>What year was it where they did it with </v>
<v Speaker 4>airplanes because I remember the </v>

842
00:37:59.720 --> 00:37:59.990
<v Speaker 4>airplane thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember if I,</v>

843
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.340
<v Speaker 4>I remember a lot of airplane rides and </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking though.</v>

844
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:07.460
<v Speaker 4>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The airplane thing was so weird because </v>

845
00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.221
<v Speaker 4>I had to sit and smoke and a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>times with the only seats that were </v>

846
00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:10.350
<v Speaker 4>available.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the difference between smoking?</v>

847
00:38:10.351 --> 00:38:12.510
<v Speaker 4>It didn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know when you're trying to get a</v>

848
00:38:12.511 --> 00:38:13.920
<v Speaker 4>seat and that's all they have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sorry.</v>

849
00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:14.900
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you a know,</v>

850
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:19.940
<v Speaker 4>but I mean the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The smoke was the same no matter where </v>

851
00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:19.940
<v Speaker 4>you were in the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

852
00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.210
<v Speaker 4>what I felt like and how much filtration</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they even doing?</v>

853
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much can they do?</v>

854
00:38:23.131 --> 00:38:28.131
<v Speaker 4>Where are they getting there for them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there's been some lawsuits by </v>

855
00:38:28.131 --> 00:38:28.131
<v Speaker 4>flight attendants who got cancer from </v>
<v Speaker 4>secondhand smoke.</v>

856
00:38:28.131 --> 00:38:33.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine that the flight </v>

857
00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.671
<v Speaker 4>attendants are smoking in this picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened to our world where people </v>

858
00:38:34.671 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 4>just smoked up a fucking storm like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this?</v>

859
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Well also there's some improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

860
00:38:38.801 --> 00:38:40.630
<v Speaker 1>but what a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

861
00:38:40.631 --> 00:38:45.631
<v Speaker 1>weird habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their habit that kills half a fucking </v>

862
00:38:45.631 --> 00:38:46.390
<v Speaker 1>million people every year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in one country,</v>

863
00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:48.220
<v Speaker 1>country world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the worldwide?</v>

864
00:38:48.221 --> 00:38:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Did we find out what the worldwide </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarette deaths are?</v>

865
00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Let me find out right here because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to know this.</v>

866
00:38:53.161 --> 00:38:54.640
<v Speaker 1>This just doesn't even make sense.</v>

867
00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.440
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think we're still </v>

868
00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:00.440
<v Speaker 3>subsidizing tobacco farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we may be.</v>

869
00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.650
<v Speaker 3>We had been up until very recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

870
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>

871
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we subsidized oil companies.</v>

872
00:39:05.381 --> 00:39:08.020
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about that until Ana </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kasparian told me about it.</v>

873
00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:13.040
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard her talking about that and I'll </v>

874
00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:13.040
<v Speaker 3>tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the oil depletion allowance is.</v>

875
00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:18.031
<v Speaker 3>Part of the reason Kennedy was murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the oil depletion allowance in Texas is </v>

876
00:39:18.031 --> 00:39:18.370
<v Speaker 3>huge.</v>

877
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Tobacco use Kilz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five point 4 million a year.</v>

878
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that one say?</v>

879
00:39:25.381 --> 00:39:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Eight dollars million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$5 million deaths by 20.</v>

880
00:39:28.711 --> 00:39:33.711
<v Speaker 1>30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one I'm looking at is I'm a World </v>

881
00:39:33.711 --> 00:39:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Health Organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the CDC.</v>

882
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Don't know which one's more legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which ones more legit?</v>

883
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:40.420
<v Speaker 1>It was $5 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$5.</v>

884
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Million deaths per year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so many God damn people.</v>

885
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Can you work for that company?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you be that company?</v>

886
00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:47.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

887
00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.470
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the other problem.</v>

888
00:39:49.471 --> 00:39:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro you doing whatever you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

889
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with as long as</v>

890
00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:54.710
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

891
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.040
<v Speaker 3>In harm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody else.</v>

892
00:39:56.041 --> 00:39:56.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

893
00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.370
<v Speaker 3>when my dad died that harmed my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

894
00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Smoking is harming people no matter what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing and that secondhand smoke.</v>

895
00:40:04.561 --> 00:40:06.920
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people get cancer because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>live with a small group.</v>

896
00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.750
<v Speaker 3>There are some studies to say it's even </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse than smoking itself,</v>

897
00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.850
<v Speaker 3>so that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

898
00:40:11.851 --> 00:40:14.100
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in a house with a secondhand </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke.</v>

899
00:40:14.101 --> 00:40:19.101
<v Speaker 3>My Dad was a smoker and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom was a smoker when I was really </v>

900
00:40:19.101 --> 00:40:19.290
<v Speaker 3>young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She gave it up,</v>

901
00:40:19.291 --> 00:40:24.291
<v Speaker 3>I think by the time I was seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a basement workbench and back </v>

902
00:40:24.291 --> 00:40:25.200
<v Speaker 3>then and all the beer was in tall </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottles and uh,</v>

903
00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:30.410
<v Speaker 3>my dad would be down there working in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the basement and my little brother who </v>

904
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.410
<v Speaker 3>was four and a half years younger than </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

905
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:31.850
<v Speaker 3>he had a habit of going around draining </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottles.</v>

906
00:40:31.851 --> 00:40:33.660
<v Speaker 3>And my dad had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well when he,</v>

907
00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:38.720
<v Speaker 3>he left a little bit of beer and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom one for his cigarette thing and </v>

908
00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:38.720
<v Speaker 3>he'd dropped about three or four bullets</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>

909
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:44.120
<v Speaker 3>My brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can still see him spewing his puke as</v>

910
00:40:44.641 --> 00:40:45.780
<v Speaker 3>he ran up the stairs.</v>

911
00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd imagine what that must have tasted </v>

912
00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:53.571
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he drank beer as a </v>

913
00:40:53.571 --> 00:40:53.571
<v Speaker 1>teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a bad tasting.</v>

914
00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.060
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even seem real does doesn't</v>

915
00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:02.120
<v Speaker 1>mean that seems like something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to explain to someone who </v>

916
00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:02.120
<v Speaker 1>didn't understand human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

917
00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:06.680
<v Speaker 1>the expression always used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If an alien came here and was viewing </v>

918
00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.130
<v Speaker 1>our culture and they saw this aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

919
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.980
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you people doing?</v>

920
00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:11.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

921
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 3>I started smoking in freshman year in </v>
<v Speaker 3>high school.</v>

922
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:15.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing everybody had to do.</v>

923
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.830
<v Speaker 1>My sister did as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried it.</v>

924
00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I was a year older than her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried a cigarette.</v>

925
00:41:19.631 --> 00:41:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm was marco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is stupid.</v>

926
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hated it.</v>

927
00:41:22.831 --> 00:41:24.660
<v Speaker 3>It took me a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it,</v>

928
00:41:24.661 --> 00:41:26.180
<v Speaker 3>but I wanted to be in the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

929
00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:27.620
<v Speaker 1>peer pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

930
00:41:27.621 --> 00:41:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Read Ben who is on this show,</v>

931
00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:31.980
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

932
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.850
<v Speaker 1>he's quit a couple of times and he just </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do it.</v>

933
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:36.650
<v Speaker 1>He quits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he gets right back to it.</v>

934
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:41.890
<v Speaker 1>He got sick recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We took off like nine days and going </v>

935
00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:41.890
<v Speaker 1>right back to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

936
00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:43.790
<v Speaker 1>he just gets pulled right back into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even those e-cigarettes,</v>

937
00:41:43.791 --> 00:41:45.790
<v Speaker 1>like he doesn't even use those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

938
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

939
00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how people can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can see all these numbers and not,</v>

940
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.550
<v Speaker 1>not think it applies to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

941
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.570
<v Speaker 1>that's an addiction that's I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a weird one.</v>

942
00:41:56.571 --> 00:41:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Like why would you kill yourself like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

943
00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:01.310
<v Speaker 1>That's the weirdest one ever because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so slow.</v>

944
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:02.960
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's gotta be.</v>

945
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:06.040
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be pretty fast though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's inevitable.</v>

946
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.050
<v Speaker 1>You say slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those people,</v>

947
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:13.120
<v Speaker 1>they feel like shit when they walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>upstairs and stuff like that's not slow </v>

948
00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:16.571
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's like diminishing your </v>

949
00:42:16.571 --> 00:42:16.571
<v Speaker 1>life right now.</v>

950
00:42:16.571 --> 00:42:17.630
<v Speaker 1>What it means to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't go up the stairs fast,</v>

951
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.240
<v Speaker 1>if you're a normal person and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not old,</v>

952
00:42:20.241 --> 00:42:23.120
<v Speaker 1>you're not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not injured and you can't walk up</v>

953
00:42:23.121 --> 00:42:25.160
<v Speaker 1>a flight of stairs without being out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>breath.</v>

954
00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your life is on like real,</v>

955
00:42:27.681 --> 00:42:32.681
<v Speaker 1>like low water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got something wrong and you're </v>

956
00:42:32.681 --> 00:42:32.681
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

957
00:42:32.681 --> 00:42:33.320
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all the energy you have.</v>

958
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:36.470
<v Speaker 1>You're missing energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like something has robbed you of energy.</v>

959
00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you realize it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this new life that you have,</v>

960
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:44.710
<v Speaker 1>this is just your reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like having water in your ears and </v>

961
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.710
<v Speaker 1>then you cleaned the water out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

962
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:46.040
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I can hear like your.</v>

963
00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:49.720
<v Speaker 1>When you pop your ears and coming home </v>
<v Speaker 1>from an airplane ride and you're,</v>

964
00:42:49.721 --> 00:42:54.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel stopped up and you pinch your </v>

965
00:42:54.721 --> 00:42:54.721
<v Speaker 1>nose and then blow on it so the air </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get out.</v>

966
00:42:54.721 --> 00:42:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Your ears pop and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

967
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:56.630
<v Speaker 1>this is what it sounds like.</v>

968
00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:57.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

969
00:42:57.371 --> 00:42:58.490
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my aunt and uncle,</v>

970
00:42:58.491 --> 00:43:03.491
<v Speaker 3>she lived into her nineties but my poor </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncle died a lot younger and they were </v>

971
00:43:03.941 --> 00:43:08.941
<v Speaker 3>both smokers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He finally quit because he had </v>

972
00:43:08.941 --> 00:43:10.950
<v Speaker 3>emphysema.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be sitting there with the oxygen </v>

973
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:12.430
<v Speaker 3>and she'd be smoking right next to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>outlived him by 20 years.</v>

974
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:16.990
<v Speaker 3>Of course she did poisoned them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just what a weird thing.</v>

975
00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People poison each other,</v>

976
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's poison wives.</v>

977
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
<v Speaker 3>There's a Bob newhart stand up or it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of his old things where he'd sit on </v>

978
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.250
<v Speaker 3>the stage and put is that Jamie's?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is making them inflate,</v>

983
00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:36.260
<v Speaker 1>inflate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's.</v>

985
00:43:37.641 --> 00:43:39.230

989
00:43:45.121 --> 00:43:47.460
<v Speaker 3>A difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

990
00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.790
<v Speaker 3>You need to put your wallpaper on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer if you're a smoker.</v>

991
00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Just the color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So horrifying.</v>

992
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:55.650
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not working very well.</v>

993
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:57.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That aren't working well.</v>

994
00:43:59.220 --> 00:43:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

995
00:43:59.611 --> 00:44:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Smart</v>

996
00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.340
<v Speaker 3>people that love cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird.</v>

997
00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is gold Bob newhart routine.</v>

998
00:44:04.681 --> 00:44:06.390
<v Speaker 3>You'd sit in a chair and put a shooter </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

999
00:44:06.391 --> 00:44:08.160
<v Speaker 3>And he was Sir Walter Raleigh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1000
00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:11.430
<v Speaker 3>or he was a guy in England and Sir </v>
<v Speaker 3>Walter Raleigh was calling him,</v>

1001
00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:15.370
<v Speaker 3>telling him about the stuff you sent him</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and he says it's called tobacco and</v>

1002
00:44:15.371 --> 00:44:19.470
<v Speaker 3>and it's a leaf and you light it on fire</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what do you do with it?</v>

1003
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:23.640
<v Speaker 3>It's really a classic non smoking a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

1004
00:44:23.641 --> 00:44:25.450
<v Speaker 3>And that was probably from 1960 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1005
00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.150
<v Speaker 3>Probably the fifties maybe.</v>

1037
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.070
<v Speaker 5>I was just so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Build your coffee.</v>

1038
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:14.710
<v Speaker 5>What coffee was at the drink you make </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of beans and then you know,</v>

1039
00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:29.010
<v Speaker 5>you drink it in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you.</v>

1040
00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1041
00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:44.740
<v Speaker 5>One time I was on the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you can help them with branding lead,</v>

1042
00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:46.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they'll go for the beat.</v>

1043
00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:50.940
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

1044
00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.280
<v Speaker 5>don't call me anymore.</v>

1045
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

1046
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:58.880
<v Speaker 1>From</v>

1047
00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:05.900
<v Speaker 3>I saw it actually on the Ed Sullivan </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

1048
00:48:05.901 --> 00:48:07.850
<v Speaker 3>We used to watch that every Sunday </v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

1049
00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Jackie gleason the Saturday Ed Sullivan </v>
<v Speaker 3>on Sunday.</v>

1050
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating.</v>

1051
00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.520
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1052
00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:17.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the just the way he broke,</v>

1053
00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.540
<v Speaker 1>broke it down was really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>without even bringing up the deaths.</v>

1054
00:48:20.541 --> 00:48:21.870
<v Speaker 1>It's still hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1055
00:48:21.871 --> 00:48:23.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you do that?</v>

1056
00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:28.340
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't state any of the health </v>

1057
00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:28.340
<v Speaker 1>concerns and this was before they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>really known too.</v>

1058
00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that funny?</v>

1059
00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his early sixties,</v>

1060
00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.150
<v Speaker 3>late fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>

1061
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.760
<v Speaker 1>did you ever see the lean narrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo dicaprio movie about,</v>

1062
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:38.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>J Edgar Hoover?</v>

1063
00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen that.</v>

1064
00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:46.360
<v Speaker 1>When j Edgar Hoover was a young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was kind of sickly and so his doctor </v>

1065
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.591
<v Speaker 1>prescribed cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what made him somewhere and </v>

1066
00:48:50.591 --> 00:48:51.860
<v Speaker 1>wanted him to smoke cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We knew as a young man,</v>

1067
00:48:51.861 --> 00:48:56.861
<v Speaker 1>like his mother in the movie is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying to him and I listened to the </v>

1068
00:48:56.861 --> 00:48:59.370
<v Speaker 1>doctorate and smoke those cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1069
00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird</v>

1070
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:02.520
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1071
00:49:02.521 --> 00:49:07.521
<v Speaker 3>that was a peer pressure cultural thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you started at when you're really young </v>

1072
00:49:07.521 --> 00:49:07.521
<v Speaker 3>because other guys were doing or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>movies,</v>

1073
00:49:07.521 --> 00:49:09.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the movies really pushed cigarettes.</v>

1074
00:49:09.151 --> 00:49:10.980
<v Speaker 3>You can't see any of his old black and </v>
<v Speaker 3>white movies.</v>

1075
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:11.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm smoking.</v>

1076
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:12.630
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1077
00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:15.030
<v Speaker 1>And TV shows everybody always smoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>

1078
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:18.500
<v Speaker 1>It was like a part of being cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So newscasters use to smoke,</v>

1079
00:49:18.501 --> 00:49:19.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so weird.</v>

1080
00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:22.430
<v Speaker 1>News casters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

1081
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:26.610
<v Speaker 1>that's the one of the weirdest rungs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>show business is the newscaster.</v>

1082
00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.530
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I look at news casting,</v>

1083
00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's like I'm watching a </v>
<v Speaker 1>silent movie,</v>

1084
00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:36.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like some antiquated form of </v>

1085
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:37.080
<v Speaker 1>entertainment that we don't need </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1086
00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Like the way if you watch an old like </v>
<v Speaker 1>animated or an old.</v>

1087
00:49:42.361 --> 00:49:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm a black and white film where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it has subtitles and like,</v>

1088
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:51.800
<v Speaker 1>like Nosferatu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of fascinating because it's a </v>

1089
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:51.800
<v Speaker 1>time capsule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1090
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.050
<v Speaker 1>you're looking into this time where this</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the relevant form of medium.</v>

1091
00:49:55.051 --> 00:49:56.590
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how the,</v>

1092
00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.910
<v Speaker 1>they got their film out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had to be like this,</v>

1093
00:49:59.911 --> 00:50:01.110
<v Speaker 1>there was no sound.</v>

1094
00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.650
<v Speaker 1>So they would play some music and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there will be a,</v>

1095
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:07.540
<v Speaker 1>like a script and the script would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>red and you know,</v>

1096
00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:09.790
<v Speaker 1>break in between scenes and the screen </v>
<v Speaker 1>would go and be alive.</v>

1097
00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Piano playing and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1098
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:13.620
<v Speaker 1>But if someone tried to do that today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

1099
00:50:13.621 --> 00:50:16.020
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is so stupid.</v>

1100
00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just make a movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why are you doing this?</v>

1101
00:50:18.541 --> 00:50:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Like let them talk like why you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it only written?</v>

1102
00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 1>That's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of what it's like when </v>

1103
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:27.880
<v Speaker 1>you watch a newscast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like why are doing it like this?</v>

1104
00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 1>They</v>

1105
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.780
<v Speaker 4>read the news,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you read the news,</v>

1106
00:50:29.781 --> 00:50:31.790
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you barely cover anything.</v>

1107
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:36.820
<v Speaker 4>You cover these little tiny three minute</v>
<v Speaker 4>chunks on super complex issues where a </v>

1108
00:50:37.131 --> 00:50:39.170
<v Speaker 4>minute of that is telling you what </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna do next.</v>

1109
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.670
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's.</v>

1110
00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:46.260
<v Speaker 4>And then there's just also a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonsense and things that they know that </v>

1111
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.660
<v Speaker 4>people want to listen to and tune in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like whether it's like,</v>

1112
00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:52.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alex Baldwin grabbed a Paparazzi by the </v>

1113
00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:52.680
<v Speaker 4>neck or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like infotainment now.</v>

1114
00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:53.690
<v Speaker 4>Not In.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

1115
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.240
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird that they're still doing it.</v>

1116
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:59.420
<v Speaker 4>It seems like something that they should</v>
<v Speaker 4>have stopped doing a long time ago.</v>

1117
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:04.720
<v Speaker 4>We're come up with a new way to do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I don't feel like you're </v>

1118
00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.841
<v Speaker 4>bullshitting me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anybody who talks like </v>

1119
00:51:07.841 --> 00:51:10.001
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's only one new show I watched and </v>

1120
00:51:10.001 --> 00:51:10.001
<v Speaker 4>that's a John Stewart daily show.</v>

1121
00:51:10.001 --> 00:51:10.570
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a great new share.</v>

1122
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:14.060
<v Speaker 4>The only mean I liked him because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>calls out both people.</v>

1123
00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.980
<v Speaker 4>He's very consistent on his pretty equal</v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity.</v>

1124
00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:20.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean if the Obama administration does </v>
<v Speaker 4>some silly,</v>

1125
00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:22.580
<v Speaker 4>if the Bush administration did something</v>
<v Speaker 4>silly,</v>

1126
00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:23.360
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1127
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:24.580
<v Speaker 4>he's really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll go after he.</v>

1128
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:26.930
<v Speaker 4>He definitely leans left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh sure.</v>

1129
00:51:26.931 --> 00:51:31.931
<v Speaker 4>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll go after Obama just as quickly as </v>

1130
00:51:31.931 --> 00:51:31.931
<v Speaker 4>anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they can't rely on that for news.</v>

1131
00:51:31.931 --> 00:51:36.200
<v Speaker 4>It's more closest I get to watch a new </v>
<v Speaker 4>show me.</v>

1132
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:39.320
<v Speaker 4>It's the Internet by far the Internet in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big leap,</v>

1133
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:44.560
<v Speaker 4>but it then becomes a matter of like if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you ever seen people getting into </v>

1134
00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:48.071
<v Speaker 4>discussion on the Internet and someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>will put up an article from the Daily </v>

1135
00:51:48.071 --> 00:51:52.300
<v Speaker 4>Mail and then they'll go and the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>person arguing with them be like the </v>

1136
00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:52.300
<v Speaker 4>Daily Mail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>

1137
00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:52.910
<v Speaker 4>you believe in fucking link from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Daily Mail.</v>

1138
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.440
<v Speaker 4>And then it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1139
00:51:54.441 --> 00:51:55.160
<v Speaker 4>well what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1140
00:51:55.161 --> 00:52:00.161
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where can I get my God damn information </v>

1141
00:52:00.161 --> 00:52:00.161
<v Speaker 4>from like.</v>

1142
00:52:00.161 --> 00:52:00.161
<v Speaker 4>And it becomes an issue of what's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>source?</v>

1143
00:52:00.161 --> 00:52:01.570
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's,</v>

1144
00:52:01.571 --> 00:52:02.300
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's,</v>

1145
00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:05.270
<v Speaker 4>where's the money behind this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this organization?</v>

1146
00:52:05.271 --> 00:52:08.690
<v Speaker 4>Because these organizations are going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be eventually chest,</v>

1147
00:52:08.691 --> 00:52:13.691
<v Speaker 4>like CBS or NBC or Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna be there's gonna to be </v>

1148
00:52:13.691 --> 00:52:14.990
<v Speaker 4>influences buying them so that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not going to be like,</v>

1149
00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:19.130
<v Speaker 4>this is the raw data that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>collecting from all around the world.</v>

1150
00:52:19.131 --> 00:52:24.131
<v Speaker 4>Here it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also some commercials during the </v>

1151
00:52:24.131 --> 00:52:28.930
<v Speaker 4>peak of the occupied movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spent hundreds of hours watching a </v>

1152
00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:31.190
<v Speaker 4>ustream tv because you were watching the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ra thing taking place.</v>

1153
00:52:31.191 --> 00:52:36.191
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were really interested in your </v>

1154
00:52:36.191 --> 00:52:36.191
<v Speaker 4>podcast was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>During that time you did a lot of social</v>

1155
00:52:36.191 --> 00:52:41.171
<v Speaker 4>commentary where you might not </v>
<v Speaker 4>ordinarily do that and you were talking </v>

1156
00:52:41.171 --> 00:52:42.500
<v Speaker 4>about how important that the occupy </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement was.</v>

1157
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:46.310
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The discussion about the occupy movement</v>

1158
00:52:46.311 --> 00:52:48.530
<v Speaker 4>has dwindled dramatically.</v>

1159
00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:53.590
<v Speaker 4>It has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll tell you the way I look at the </v>

1160
00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:55.721
<v Speaker 4>occupy movement of what we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they had announced in the beginning </v>

1161
00:52:55.721 --> 00:52:55.730
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1162
00:52:55.731 --> 00:53:00.731
<v Speaker 4>we're going to do phase one and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to do is raise awareness </v>

1163
00:53:00.731 --> 00:53:04.250
<v Speaker 4>around the world that there's a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>income distribution problem that we have</v>

1164
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:09.280
<v Speaker 4>one percent 99 percent and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to show that this is true everywhere in </v>

1165
00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:13.241
<v Speaker 4>the world and that we're living in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>police state because the police are </v>

1166
00:53:13.241 --> 00:53:13.330
<v Speaker 4>going to shut us down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's.</v>

1167
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.520
<v Speaker 4>That's our only objective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's phase one.</v>

1168
00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:18.980
<v Speaker 4>If that was put out that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they'd say,</v>

1169
00:53:18.981 --> 00:53:20.180
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a big success.</v>

1170
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:21.740
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the other day,</v>

1171
00:53:21.741 --> 00:53:25.260
<v Speaker 4>there's a thing in the news that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>occupy New York people had $400,000</v>

1172
00:53:25.261 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 4>left in their account</v>

1173
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:31.370
<v Speaker 3>donations and they took that 400,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they bought $15,000,000</v>

1174
00:53:31.381 --> 00:53:36.381
<v Speaker 3>with a credit card debt that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>would run up on medical bills and for </v>

1175
00:53:36.381 --> 00:53:39.681
<v Speaker 3>gave it all and now they're using that </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge that they've learned to do </v>

1176
00:53:39.681 --> 00:53:41.820
<v Speaker 3>videos and stuff to teach people how </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can do that for themselves.</v>

1177
00:53:41.821 --> 00:53:46.821
<v Speaker 3>To buy their credit card debt for </v>
<v Speaker 3>pennies on the dollar instead of what </v>

1178
00:53:46.821 --> 00:53:46.821
<v Speaker 3>they're going after him for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

1179
00:53:46.821 --> 00:53:48.120
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got friends in,</v>

1180
00:53:48.121 --> 00:53:53.121
<v Speaker 3>in uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia and the UK and a couple of </v>

1181
00:53:53.121 --> 00:53:53.190
<v Speaker 3>places here in the states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends I say Internet friends.</v>

1182
00:53:53.191 --> 00:53:57.330
<v Speaker 3>I've never met him in person that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>still very interested or involved,</v>

1183
00:53:57.331 --> 00:54:02.331
<v Speaker 3>I should say in occupy type activities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what we know now is that we're not </v>

1184
00:54:02.881 --> 00:54:05.730
<v Speaker 3>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're all around the world.</v>

1185
00:54:05.731 --> 00:54:07.350
<v Speaker 3>There's people that are thinking like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1186
00:54:07.351 --> 00:54:10.770
<v Speaker 3>So it's more about consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>awakening than a movement,</v>

1187
00:54:10.771 --> 00:54:13.770
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's still a simmering under</v>
<v Speaker 3>the surface.</v>

1188
00:54:13.771 --> 00:54:14.750
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1189
00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:18.240
<v Speaker 3>I've got a lot of bad press obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I was starting to say,</v>

1190
00:54:18.241 --> 00:54:23.241
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent hundreds of hours watching and </v>

1191
00:54:23.241 --> 00:54:23.580
<v Speaker 3>interacting and chat rooms with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and all.</v>

1192
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.110
<v Speaker 3>So I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1193
00:54:25.111 --> 00:54:28.230
<v Speaker 3>I knew a little bit better what was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on then what was coming out in the</v>

1194
00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:30.570
<v Speaker 3>press and stuff like that because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was all slanted.</v>

1195
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:35.930
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people are really on top of </v>

1196
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:36.000
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we do now.</v>

1197
00:54:36.001 --> 00:54:38.820
<v Speaker 3>No one percent 99 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So nothing else,</v>

1198
00:54:38.821 --> 00:54:40.590
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty successful as movement </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

1199
00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1200
00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:44.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty successful as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a like a talking point.</v>

1201
00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:50.010
<v Speaker 1>And it became the talking point because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he used to be talked about like the top </v>

1202
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:50.010
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1203
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Several percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five percent,</v>

1204
00:54:51.201 --> 00:54:56.201
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when it became the one </v>

1205
00:54:56.201 --> 00:54:56.201
<v Speaker 1>percenters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 99 percent,</v>

1206
00:54:56.201 --> 00:54:57.860
<v Speaker 1>then it became a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was like,</v>

1207
00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:58.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1208
00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:03.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's David Graver I think is the one </v>

1209
00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:03.610
<v Speaker 3>that got credit for coming out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1210
00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That becomes a viral idea and people </v>

1211
00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.021
<v Speaker 1>start discussing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that 99 percent of the </v>

1212
00:55:09.021 --> 00:55:11.301
<v Speaker 1>people in this country don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only one percent owns 50 percent of the </v>

1213
00:55:11.301 --> 00:55:11.301
<v Speaker 1>wealth or whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

1214
00:55:11.301 --> 00:55:11.301
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1215
00:55:11.301 --> 00:55:13.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually 300 people own 45.</v>

1216
00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Well that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1217
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.460
<v Speaker 1>those guys are ballers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1218
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:20.500
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I think that.</v>

1219
00:55:20.501 --> 00:55:25.501
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a very optimistic view of the </v>

1220
00:55:25.501 --> 00:55:26.400
<v Speaker 1>human race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1221
00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I think ultimately people want to live a</v>
<v Speaker 1>life that's harmonious and happy.</v>

1222
00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I think if that's true with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's true with me and that's true </v>

1223
00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:37.870
<v Speaker 1>with pretty much everybody that I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be true with all people,</v>

1224
00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:43.050
<v Speaker 1>so it's a matter of spreading that idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the population as quickly as </v>

1225
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:47.011
<v Speaker 1>possible to as many people as possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>and let them understand that the way </v>

1226
00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:50.161
<v Speaker 1>that we've been living our lives for </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades and generation after generation </v>

1227
00:55:50.161 --> 00:55:51.670
<v Speaker 1>is just the momentum of an ignorant </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

1228
00:55:51.671 --> 00:55:56.671
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be that way anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't mean that you can have </v>

1229
00:55:56.671 --> 00:55:59.881
<v Speaker 1>government and it doesn't mean you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have corporations and it doesn't mean </v>

1230
00:55:59.881 --> 00:56:01.120
<v Speaker 1>that you can't have people who have more</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth and other people.</v>

1231
00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:06.120
<v Speaker 1>It just means everything should be done </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly and if you guys are putting laws </v>

1232
00:56:06.851 --> 00:56:09.010
<v Speaker 1>into place that allow you to fuck people</v>
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

1233
00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:14.160
<v Speaker 1>allow you to move your factories to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico and have people work for pennies </v>

1234
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:14.160
<v Speaker 1>on the dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow.</v>

1235
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.270
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit that you're being </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to do.</v>

1236
00:56:16.271 --> 00:56:17.980
<v Speaker 1>As far as like polluting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

1237
00:56:17.981 --> 00:56:22.981
<v Speaker 1>That shouldn't be kosher and there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There should be a way to resolve that </v>

1238
00:56:22.981 --> 00:56:25.900
<v Speaker 1>and the to resolve that is not you spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>money to change the law,</v>

1239
00:56:25.901 --> 00:56:28.150
<v Speaker 1>to make it legal for you to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's horrible.</v>

1240
00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:33.380
<v Speaker 1>The would should be is figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck you can do to make sure that </v>

1241
00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:38.101
<v Speaker 1>you don't pollute the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Structure your loss so that you don't </v>

1242
00:56:38.101 --> 00:56:41.491
<v Speaker 1>rip people off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figure out a way to make it so that </v>

1243
00:56:41.491 --> 00:56:43.860
<v Speaker 1>you're not in control of a giant chunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>of of,</v>

1244
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:48.910
<v Speaker 1>of this river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your factories by the pollution </v>

1245
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.910
<v Speaker 1>that leaks into it.</v>

1246
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Figure out how to make it so that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not poisoning the wells of of people in </v>

1247
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:57.781
<v Speaker 1>town because you're fracking and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling a natural gas out of the ground </v>

1248
00:56:57.781 --> 00:57:02.011
<v Speaker 1>and destroy these people's wells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figure out how to do it without doing </v>

1249
00:57:02.011 --> 00:57:02.011
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you can't do it,</v>

1250
00:57:02.011 --> 00:57:06.181
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't do anything when you put </v>

1251
00:57:06.181 --> 00:57:08.821
<v Speaker 1>money in front of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me like we can still have </v>

1252
00:57:08.821 --> 00:57:12.631
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems to me we can still have </v>

1253
00:57:12.631 --> 00:57:14.851
<v Speaker 1>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just needs to be a moral capitalism </v>

1254
00:57:14.851 --> 00:57:17.931
<v Speaker 1>and ethical capitalism where humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people and just caring about people </v>

1255
00:57:17.931 --> 00:57:19.990
<v Speaker 1>and realizing we're not going to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>here forever.</v>

1256
00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:25.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a fairly short ride to be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice to people and all the money that </v>

1257
00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:30.091
<v Speaker 1>you make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being an asshole and putting people out </v>

1258
00:57:30.091 --> 00:57:30.091
<v Speaker 1>of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna.</v>

1259
00:57:30.091 --> 00:57:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate that money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most likely,</v>

1260
00:57:30.701 --> 00:57:35.701
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a position to put a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people out of work and make a fuck </v>

1261
00:57:35.701 --> 00:57:38.721
<v Speaker 1>load of money and fuck someone over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably already have a lot of </v>

1262
00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:38.721
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1263
00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:40.330
<v Speaker 1>You're already in a sweet spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some weird position of influence,</v>

1264
00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.910
<v Speaker 1>but enjoy what you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking stranger.</v>

1265
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:45.550
<v Speaker 1>He a weird person trying to pollute the </v>
<v Speaker 1>river.</v>

1266
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:49.480
<v Speaker 1>You weird asshole who doesn't care about</v>
<v Speaker 1>polluting someone's wells.</v>

1267
00:57:49.481 --> 00:57:51.730
<v Speaker 1>You should be devastated if that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

1268
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:53.890
<v Speaker 1>You should stop operations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

1269
00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:59.100
<v Speaker 1>because they know they can pull billions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dollars worth of natural resources </v>

1270
00:57:59.100 --> 00:57:59.770
<v Speaker 1>out of the ground by still continuing </v>
<v Speaker 1>these practices.</v>

1271
00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:01.720
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even consider not doing it.</v>

1272
00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:06.780
<v Speaker 1>They just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just keep doing it and they find </v>

1273
00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:09.130
<v Speaker 1>ways to do it where it harms last or it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has less of an environmental impact,</v>

1274
00:58:09.131 --> 00:58:10.240
<v Speaker 1>allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1275
00:58:10.241 --> 00:58:11.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what the numbers are,</v>

1276
00:58:11.681 --> 00:58:16.681
<v Speaker 1>but the raw data shows that they fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up a lot of areas doing this stuff,</v>

1277
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:18.940
<v Speaker 1>but no one's talking about stopping </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

1278
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.270
<v Speaker 1>They're just going for it.</v>

1279
00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:20.870
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1280
00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:25.940
<v Speaker 3>you've hit the nail on the head is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not about regulating things from </v>

1281
00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:29.571
<v Speaker 3>the top down and trying to get people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>change your ways is getting people to </v>

1282
00:58:29.571 --> 00:58:29.780
<v Speaker 3>change themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one,</v>

1283
00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:31.860
<v Speaker 3>a good examples of a corporation is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr.</v>

1284
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:35.520
<v Speaker 3>Bronner's soap company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Bonner as the hemp soap.</v>

1285
00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1286
00:58:36.241 --> 00:58:37.590
<v Speaker 3>They might be hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>

1287
00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has went with the guy,</v>

1288
00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:45.020
<v Speaker 3>I think he's like 25 years old when his </v>
<v Speaker 3>dad died and he had to take over the </v>

1289
00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:45.020
<v Speaker 3>company and didn't really want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>

1290
00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for one of the first things he did,</v>

1291
00:58:46.301 --> 00:58:51.301
<v Speaker 3>it says nobody in the company can make </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than five times the lowest paid </v>

1292
00:58:51.301 --> 00:58:51.680
<v Speaker 3>person in the company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's,</v>

1293
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:53.330
<v Speaker 3>he's got a really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1294
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:57.050
<v Speaker 3>very conscientious conscious company and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read,</v>

1295
00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:02.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of others like that and </v>

1296
00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.951
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be from the bottom up where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they just start doing it and they're </v>

1297
00:59:03.951 --> 00:59:03.951
<v Speaker 3>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's competing in the soap business.</v>

1298
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:06.270
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact if you go to burning man,</v>

1299
00:59:06.271 --> 00:59:08.970
<v Speaker 3>it's the only soap that'll get all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dust off your hands.</v>

1300
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:11.420
<v Speaker 1>If you go to burning man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got other problems.</v>

1301
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody on twitter,</v>

1302
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:15.540
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should get you to go to burning.</v>

1303
00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People keep asking me to go to burning </v>

1304
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.710
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1305
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I meet plenty of dirty hippies in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday life.</v>

1306
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:21.770
<v Speaker 1>There's too many of them there.</v>

1307
00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:22.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1308
00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:24.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't like camping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't enjoy the desert.</v>

1309
00:59:24.551 --> 00:59:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Had to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't stand the heat.</v>

1310
00:59:25.781 --> 00:59:28.660
<v Speaker 3>And I couldn't wait to get back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I stopped going.</v>

1311
00:59:28.661 --> 00:59:30.970
<v Speaker 3>I haven't gone since 2007 now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good move.</v>

1312
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.560
<v Speaker 3>Let's become commercialized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1313
00:59:32.561 --> 00:59:35.200
<v Speaker 3>And this is so expensive and in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1314
00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.230
<v Speaker 3>in your offline for like two months </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards trying to recover.</v>

1315
00:59:38.231 --> 00:59:40.740
<v Speaker 3>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1316
00:59:40.741 --> 00:59:45.741
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the times I went where some of the most </v>

1317
00:59:45.741 --> 00:59:45.741
<v Speaker 3>spectacular time.</v>

1318
00:59:45.741 --> 00:59:45.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously talking shit because I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>never been,</v>

1319
00:59:45.741 --> 00:59:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't want all the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually go and enjoy it.</v>

1320
00:59:47.441 --> 00:59:52.441
<v Speaker 1>Don't think I'm being serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go have a good time and I know that </v>

1321
00:59:52.441 --> 00:59:55.291
<v Speaker 1>most of you are probably cool as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is there's that small </v>

1322
00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:57.520
<v Speaker 1>percentage that's going to be so </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying that I can't go</v>

1323
00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:03.180
<v Speaker 3>know a percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that was kind </v>

1324
01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:03.810
<v Speaker 3>of unique about burning man I thought is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>

1325
01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:09.080
<v Speaker 3>in fact it was the first year we went a </v>
<v Speaker 3>camp across from us was starting in the </v>

1326
01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:13.241
<v Speaker 3>afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some loud music and all and we had a </v>

1327
01:00:13.241 --> 01:00:13.241
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people just sitting around </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>

1328
01:00:13.241 --> 01:00:16.841
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the ladies in our camp </v>
<v Speaker 3>took up a tray full of cold beers and </v>

1329
01:00:16.841 --> 01:00:20.861
<v Speaker 3>popsicles over to him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we bribe you to turn the music off </v>

1330
01:00:20.861 --> 01:00:20.861
<v Speaker 3>for a couple of hours?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Oh sure.</v>

1331
01:00:20.861 --> 01:00:25.391
<v Speaker 3>And they turned it off and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a functioning anarchy is what it </v>

1332
01:00:25.391 --> 01:00:25.391
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1333
01:00:25.391 --> 01:00:25.710
<v Speaker 3>that's very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great.</v>

1334
01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.410
<v Speaker 3>And you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gotten a,</v>

1335
01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.720
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's gotten really big.</v>

1336
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:35.170
<v Speaker 3>But one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the people who I know a was at </v>

1337
01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:38.411
<v Speaker 3>this year's camp and she's been there I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think 19 years in a row and said this </v>

1338
01:00:38.411 --> 01:00:39.720
<v Speaker 3>was the best year she'd ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when I started going,</v>

1339
01:00:39.721 --> 01:00:44.721
<v Speaker 3>it was like 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and it was much more manageable </v>

1340
01:00:44.721 --> 01:00:44.721
<v Speaker 3>than 60 some now.</v>

1341
01:00:44.721 --> 01:00:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Well for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is pretty much almost </v>

1342
01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:49.550
<v Speaker 1>anywhere I go when I run into people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that want to talk about things,</v>

1343
01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:51.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a cool conversation for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

1344
01:00:51.321 --> 01:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>99 percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's always that one percent,</v>

1345
01:00:53.781 --> 01:00:56.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe one out of 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my might be even less than that.</v>

1346
01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Or someone just gives you a brutal ear </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating on the power of crystals and </v>

1347
01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus,</v>

1348
01:01:02.031 --> 01:01:05.330
<v Speaker 1>we stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or someone who they know who's a healer,</v>

1349
01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:06.980
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Christ.</v>

1350
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Someone who they know that's that </v>
<v Speaker 1>channels.</v>

1351
01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:15.281
<v Speaker 1>I tell this guy fucking talking to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a channel or the other day I was </v>

1352
01:01:15.281 --> 01:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please stop by.</v>

1353
01:01:15.411 --> 01:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>They used to call them schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it is,</v>

1354
01:01:18.511 --> 01:01:19.640
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1355
01:01:19.641 --> 01:01:21.830
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not channeling,</v>

1356
01:01:21.831 --> 01:01:23.990
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are channeling,</v>

1357
01:01:23.991 --> 01:01:25.610
<v Speaker 1>let me see it because if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>channeling,</v>

1358
01:01:25.611 --> 01:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>if you'd never channeled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know what's going on there?</v>

1359
01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:30.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>

1360
01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:35.521
<v Speaker 1>It could be a lot of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that that guy might be losing </v>

1361
01:01:35.521 --> 01:01:38.951
<v Speaker 1>his marbles right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be watching an act to be </v>

1362
01:01:38.951 --> 01:01:38.951
<v Speaker 1>watching a crazy person who needs a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of attention.</v>

1363
01:01:38.951 --> 01:01:40.330
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I miss those people at burning man.</v>

1364
01:01:40.331 --> 01:01:43.630
<v Speaker 3>I was into drugs and booze.</v>

1365
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wasn't even at burning man.</v>

1366
01:01:45.381 --> 01:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>This is just a conversation with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

1367
01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:52.181
<v Speaker 1>One of the weird things about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast is so many people have to talk </v>

1368
01:01:52.181 --> 01:01:55.421
<v Speaker 1>to me about something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have this idea that they have to </v>

1369
01:01:55.421 --> 01:01:55.421
<v Speaker 1>tell me and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times it's very interesting,</v>

1370
01:01:55.421 --> 01:02:00.370
<v Speaker 1>but many times it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And many times it's just brutal </v>

1371
01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:00.370
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel like,</v>

1372
01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:04.661
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this friend of mine who believes </v>

1373
01:02:04.661 --> 01:02:05.050
<v Speaker 1>in psychics and he's going on and on </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the psychic who,</v>

1374
01:02:05.051 --> 01:02:10.051
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who told him everything about his life </v>

1375
01:02:10.051 --> 01:02:10.051
<v Speaker 1>and I go everything about your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1376
01:02:10.051 --> 01:02:10.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1377
01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.940
<v Speaker 1>did he tell you any shit you don't know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1378
01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>

1379
01:02:14.841 --> 01:02:15.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that's weird?</v>

1380
01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.020
<v Speaker 1>He goes to and he knew about my </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother.</v>

1381
01:02:18.021 --> 01:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you know about your grandmother?</v>

1382
01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want someone to tell you shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already know?</v>

1383
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever think that maybe you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been manipulated and maybe he structured</v>

1384
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>questions in a way that got you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveal certain information or think that</v>

1385
01:02:30.211 --> 01:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not answering it for him,</v>

1386
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:35.340
<v Speaker 1>but he was leading you in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

1387
01:02:35.341 --> 01:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever think that that might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible?</v>

1388
01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>And he likes pause and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1389
01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>because I never even thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1390
01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should probably think about that.</v>

1391
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people get sucked into these </v>

1392
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.870
<v Speaker 3>things without giving it thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then some of them,</v>

1393
01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.460
<v Speaker 3>the psychedelic grommets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1394
01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:51.360
<v Speaker 3>it's even goofy or people come up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1395
01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:56.361
<v Speaker 3>But at one time at a conference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine had just given his </v>

1396
01:02:56.361 --> 01:03:00.591
<v Speaker 3>presentation and I went up to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to him and he was surrounded </v>

1397
01:03:00.591 --> 01:03:03.711
<v Speaker 3>by a bunch of people and there's this </v>
<v Speaker 3>one girl who was obviously just really </v>

1398
01:03:03.711 --> 01:03:07.190
<v Speaker 3>whacked out on something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had spiked purple hair and she's </v>

1399
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:10.400
<v Speaker 3>piercings everywhere and she couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand still and she's bouncing around </v>

1400
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:10.400
<v Speaker 3>and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1401
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.780
<v Speaker 3>how come people don't approve of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics?</v>

1402
01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:14.250
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1403
01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.930
<v Speaker 3>they're afraid they're going to turn out</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you.</v>

1404
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.280
<v Speaker 3>That is an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1405
01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>It's an issue of potheads too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1406
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them are lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sloppy potheads that just,</v>

1407
01:03:22.931 --> 01:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

1408
01:03:24.071 --> 01:03:29.071
<v Speaker 1>So loathsome to be around that they make</v>
<v Speaker 1>you connect that behavior to marijuana.</v>

1409
01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:34.850
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that marijuana made you lazy </v>

1410
01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:37.171
<v Speaker 1>and I had all these negative things </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to it until I met my friend </v>

1411
01:03:37.171 --> 01:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a smart guy.</v>

1412
01:03:38.591 --> 01:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>He was very articulate and he liked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke pot and talk about all these crazy</v>

1413
01:03:41.711 --> 01:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>things and and like to make his music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was high,</v>

1414
01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make music with you.</v>

1415
01:03:46.481 --> 01:03:48.980
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was something that turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>you into a moron.</v>

1416
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.120
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drew,</v>

1417
01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to get like that.</v>

1418
01:03:51.851 --> 01:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1419
01:03:52.481 --> 01:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1420
01:03:52.781 --> 01:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It enhances your creativity.</v>

1421
01:03:54.641 --> 01:03:59.641
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once I immediately started smoking </v>

1422
01:03:59.641 --> 01:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>pot or once I started smoking pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I immediately started presenting all the</v>

1423
01:04:00.341 --> 01:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>dopey stereotypical pot ads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1424
01:04:02.921 --> 01:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys ruined something.</v>

1425
01:04:04.601 --> 01:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

1426
01:04:06.971 --> 01:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>You ruined the image of something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing by being a knucklehead.</v>

1427
01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:16.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had experienced when I was working </v>

1428
01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:17.680
<v Speaker 3>back in the phone company and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys I worked for was a vice president.</v>

1429
01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:22.740
<v Speaker 3>He was pretty far up there and we worked</v>
<v Speaker 3>really closely together for almost a </v>

1430
01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:23.920
<v Speaker 3>year and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't go into the whole story,</v>

1431
01:04:23.921 --> 01:04:28.060
<v Speaker 3>but after about a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're at dinner one night and he says he</v>

1432
01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:30.970
<v Speaker 3>was making a confession for a reason and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1433
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:32.170
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I smoked pot.</v>

1434
01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.210
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

1435
01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.020
<v Speaker 3>Let's go to my house right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we'd worked together for a year in a</v>

1436
01:04:38.021 --> 01:04:43.021
<v Speaker 3>really high powered environment and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>found out later that he's going up to </v>

1437
01:04:43.021 --> 01:04:44.740
<v Speaker 3>the car two or three times during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>day to have few Tokes,</v>

1438
01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.280
<v Speaker 3>so you can function pretty highly if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what you're doing.</v>

1439
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can definitely function pretty </v>

1440
01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:53.330
<v Speaker 1>highly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you get used to it.</v>

1441
01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:56.480
<v Speaker 1>The way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I describe it as it's like </v>

1442
01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.191
<v Speaker 1>surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watch a guy who's a really good </v>

1443
01:04:58.191 --> 01:04:58.191
<v Speaker 1>surfer or girls are really good surfer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>madigan bride,</v>

1444
01:04:58.191 --> 01:05:00.420
<v Speaker 1>some crazy ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you put me on a surfboard,</v>

1445
01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:04.290
<v Speaker 1>fallen flat on my fucking stupid face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't serve at all.</v>

1446
01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I tried it,</v>

1447
01:05:05.971 --> 01:05:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I would suck at it.</v>

1448
01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.420
<v Speaker 3>I tried it once and I sucked at it.</v>

1449
01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana smoking is like riding a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic wave and there's A.</v>

1450
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:18.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a wave of the substance,</v>

1451
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:23.230
<v Speaker 4>the thc that hits your body and you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>either ride that wave or you can trip </v>

1452
01:05:24.851 --> 01:05:29.851
<v Speaker 4>out on the fact that you're on this wave</v>
<v Speaker 4>and freak out and started getting </v>

1453
01:05:29.851 --> 01:05:33.220
<v Speaker 4>paranoid or going down dark places in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your mind or you know,</v>

1454
01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:35.830
<v Speaker 4>just spiral.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's possible too,</v>

1455
01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.110
<v Speaker 4>but once you get good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>

1456
01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:43.140
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't happen very often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're standing there smoking </v>

1457
01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:43.540
<v Speaker 4>pot longer than I have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's impossible.</v>

1458
01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:46.890
<v Speaker 4>I had my first token 1985.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1459
01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:49.720
<v Speaker 4>I started smoking pot in 2001.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1460
01:05:49.721 --> 01:05:50.440
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1461
01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:51.820
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're another late bloomer.</v>

1462
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.500
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1463
01:05:52.501 --> 01:05:55.540
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was stupid until I was 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>

1464
01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:57.340
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1465
01:05:57.341 --> 01:06:00.220
<v Speaker 4>this is the stupidest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These people are wasting their lives.</v>

1466
01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:02.680
<v Speaker 4>Smoking Pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know how at first.</v>

1467
01:06:02.681 --> 01:06:04.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd been a smoker and you know,</v>

1468
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:05.970
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got this pot and I,</v>

1469
01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:08.440
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't inhaling proper really.</v>

1470
01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:13.580
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I spoke last on my third joint and </v>

1471
01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:17.401
<v Speaker 4>it was like over a period of three or </v>
<v Speaker 4>four weeks and finally I got really all </v>

1472
01:06:17.401 --> 01:06:18.850
<v Speaker 4>of a sudden I figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to inhale.</v>

1473
01:06:18.851 --> 01:06:20.860
<v Speaker 4>And the women that have given me the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes,</v>

1474
01:06:20.861 --> 01:06:23.260
<v Speaker 4>I called her at work or at work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was off and I called her at work.</v>

1475
01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.720
<v Speaker 4>I said it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got stone and she says,</v>

1476
01:06:25.721 --> 01:06:27.560
<v Speaker 4>don't shout,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's Funky,</v>

1477
01:06:27.561 --> 01:06:32.561
<v Speaker 4>but down the laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it took me a while to even learn </v>

1478
01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:32.561
<v Speaker 4>how.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1479
01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:33.370
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that are worried</v>

1480
01:06:33.371 --> 01:06:36.280
<v Speaker 4>about people finding out they smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1481
01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:37.510
<v Speaker 4>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1482
01:06:37.511 --> 01:06:39.700
<v Speaker 4>not out here anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not as much,</v>

1483
01:06:39.701 --> 01:06:43.510
<v Speaker 4>but still in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I've had conversations with people.</v>

1484
01:06:43.511 --> 01:06:44.080
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1485
01:06:44.081 --> 01:06:49.081
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ever face any repercussions because </v>

1486
01:06:49.081 --> 01:06:49.081
<v Speaker 4>you talk about pot.</v>

1487
01:06:49.081 --> 01:06:51.870
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>realistically anybody that would be </v>

1488
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:52.600
<v Speaker 4>upset with me because they found out </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I smoke pot,</v>

1489
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:54.670
<v Speaker 4>I really don't want to talk to them </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>

1490
01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.930
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if they don't like me,</v>

1491
01:06:55.931 --> 01:07:00.931
<v Speaker 4>I probably wouldn't like them anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's such a stupid stance to </v>

1492
01:07:00.931 --> 01:07:04.291
<v Speaker 4>take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just listen to what I have to say </v>

1493
01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:04.291
<v Speaker 4>about it and if it doesn't make sense to</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1494
01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:08.760
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you're upset at me because he </v>

1495
01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:08.760
<v Speaker 4>found out that I smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1496
01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.650
<v Speaker 4>take care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worried about that at one time.</v>

1497
01:07:11.651 --> 01:07:12.400
<v Speaker 4>But finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1498
01:07:12.401 --> 01:07:16.120
<v Speaker 4>I've done the podcast now and I'm pretty</v>
<v Speaker 4>much out of the closet,</v>

1499
01:07:16.121 --> 01:07:21.121
<v Speaker 4>but I still get a little resistance from</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in the family that are unhappy </v>

1500
01:07:21.121 --> 01:07:21.400
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1501
01:07:21.401 --> 01:07:26.401
<v Speaker 4>I've had friends that have had some </v>
<v Speaker 4>serious drug issues and I've also had </v>

1502
01:07:26.401 --> 01:07:30.541
<v Speaker 4>people that I've talked to that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>like real straight edge and one of the </v>

1503
01:07:30.541 --> 01:07:33.451
<v Speaker 4>reason why they were straight edge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like maybe they lost a family member to </v>

1504
01:07:33.451 --> 01:07:36.331
<v Speaker 4>addiction and I've had conversations </v>
<v Speaker 4>with them about it before where I </v>

1505
01:07:36.331 --> 01:07:40.471
<v Speaker 4>totally understand that and I totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>get that mindset and I probably would </v>

1506
01:07:40.471 --> 01:07:44.221
<v Speaker 4>have been in that mindset and myself if </v>
<v Speaker 4>it not for several people that I've met </v>

1507
01:07:44.441 --> 01:07:45.930
<v Speaker 4>in my life because I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd,</v>

1508
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:51.230
<v Speaker 4>I'd lost a friend to heroin and I lost a</v>
<v Speaker 4>friend in high school to here to people </v>

1509
01:07:51.641 --> 01:07:52.060
<v Speaker 4>to heroin.</v>

1510
01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:57.060
<v Speaker 4>Actually that I know more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I lost at least one other ones </v>

1511
01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:01.021
<v Speaker 4>to take pills to like opiate pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I guess he's a that that would be </v>

1512
01:08:01.021 --> 01:08:05.371
<v Speaker 4>considered along the same lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I could get the idea where people </v>

1513
01:08:05.371 --> 01:08:09.841
<v Speaker 4>would be upset at people that smoke pot </v>
<v Speaker 4>or what anything because he would think </v>

1514
01:08:09.841 --> 01:08:09.841
<v Speaker 4>that would connect it to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1515
01:08:09.841 --> 01:08:11.140
<v Speaker 4>losing their family members.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But man,</v>

1516
01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:15.380
<v Speaker 4>it's unfortunate that the word drug is </v>
<v Speaker 4>such a broad term.</v>

1517
01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>

1518
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:21.040
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons I'm doing what</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing is because we it with proper </v>

1519
01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:21.320
<v Speaker 3>drug education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys might still be alive,</v>

1520
01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:22.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we don't educate.</v>

1521
01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:24.430
<v Speaker 3>We just say no instead of k,</v>
<v Speaker 3>n,</v>

1522
01:08:24.431 --> 01:08:25.880
<v Speaker 3>O,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w and uh,</v>

1523
01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:27.020
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1524
01:08:27.021 --> 01:08:32.021
<v Speaker 3>I think that if we can just get a couple</v>
<v Speaker 3>more generations behind us where people </v>

1525
01:08:32.021 --> 01:08:33.470
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not so oppressed by,</v>

1526
01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:33.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1527
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:39.100
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite stories I got from a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kid and listen to the podcast when he </v>

1528
01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:42.080
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just got out of high school.</v>

1529
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:47.110
<v Speaker 3>He's 18.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His father caught him growing mushrooms </v>

1530
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.540
<v Speaker 3>in his closet and turned them into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>police.</v>

1531
01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:52.541
<v Speaker 3>And the kid wound up doing a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 3>of felony and so he came back out of </v>

1532
01:08:52.541 --> 01:08:56.381
<v Speaker 3>jail and he just went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started going to church with them three </v>

1533
01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:59.391
<v Speaker 3>or four times a week and became a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalist Christian again and just </v>

1534
01:08:59.391 --> 01:09:02.411
<v Speaker 3>went through the exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he found the salon and realize </v>

1535
01:09:02.411 --> 01:09:02.411
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1536
01:09:02.411 --> 01:09:04.160
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's other people that do this tune.</v>

1537
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.280
<v Speaker 3>He got himself a fast food job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saved up his money.</v>

1538
01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:10.040
<v Speaker 3>He's out in the west coast working as an</v>
<v Speaker 3>artist right now.</v>

1539
01:09:10.041 --> 01:09:12.980
<v Speaker 3>And so he got out of that oppressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere.</v>

1540
01:09:12.981 --> 01:09:17.981
<v Speaker 3>So that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gate kids tell me they've come out of </v>

1541
01:09:17.981 --> 01:09:19.100
<v Speaker 3>the closet being gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're afraid to tell their parents</v>

1542
01:09:19.101 --> 01:09:20.630
<v Speaker 3>that their psychedelic or they smoke </v>
<v Speaker 3>pot.</v>

1543
01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:22.580
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about that.</v>

1544
01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:23.990
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>

1545
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Did you to have a great smoke pot or </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke pulled joke there,</v>

1546
01:09:27.631 --> 01:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>but don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not worth it.</v>

1547
01:09:29.790 --> 01:09:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Don't go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1548
01:09:30.691 --> 01:09:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a podcast,</v>

1549
01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Daniel for a young man up in San </v>
<v Speaker 3>Francisco,</v>

1550
01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:37.120
<v Speaker 3>Cisco that started the psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>society up there.</v>

1551
01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:40.030
<v Speaker 3>He started just two years ago and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>got 4,000</v>

1552
01:09:40.031 --> 01:09:45.031
<v Speaker 3>members already and stuff and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>young guy,</v>

1553
01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:51.240
<v Speaker 3>mid twenties and he said he went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>college and never smoked pot until he </v>

1554
01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.391
<v Speaker 3>got to college and got into pot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms and now he started the </v>

1555
01:09:54.391 --> 01:09:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Psychedelic Society of San Francisco and</v>
<v Speaker 3>has 4,000</v>

1556
01:09:55.751 --> 01:09:59.220
<v Speaker 3>members and he's a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a advocate and activist and,</v>

1557
01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:00.980
<v Speaker 3>but anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a.</v>

1558
01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:05.360
<v Speaker 3>He did a talk that I podcast called </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out of the psychedelic closet and</v>

1559
01:10:05.361 --> 01:10:07.870
<v Speaker 3>I got a letter in the mail the other day</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a kid that,</v>

1560
01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:08.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1561
01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:10.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he sent a little drawing.</v>

1562
01:10:10.151 --> 01:10:12.250
<v Speaker 3>He did it in the closet with his name on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and he says,</v>

1563
01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:15.040
<v Speaker 3>I just can't come out of it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1564
01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.900
<v Speaker 3>But if I was still in the workaday world</v>
<v Speaker 3>working in the belly of the beast,</v>

1565
01:10:19.901 --> 01:10:20.320
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1566
01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:21.100
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1567
01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.000
<v Speaker 3>now in California or someplace with </v>
<v Speaker 3>medical marijuana,</v>

1568
01:10:24.001 --> 01:10:29.001
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably be honest about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would never talk about </v>

1569
01:10:29.001 --> 01:10:29.001
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics in the corporate world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1570
01:10:29.001 --> 01:10:29.500
<v Speaker 3>that's a quick way to get fired.</v>

1571
01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating that you can't talk </v>

1572
01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:34.640
<v Speaker 1>about an experience that you've had 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

1573
01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll label you as some crazy hippie </v>

1574
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.390
<v Speaker 1>that's trying to clean his act up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1575
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:39.990
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to pretend you're one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

1576
01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Normally you just fucking dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippie doing acid and your lunch break,</v>

1577
01:10:43.381 --> 01:10:43.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1578
01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1579
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:46.460
<v Speaker 3>I missed the hippie thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in the navy then,</v>

1580
01:10:46.461 --> 01:10:48.500
<v Speaker 3>so I'm doing mine at this stage of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1581
01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:50.510
<v Speaker 3>And today you were in the navy and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties?</v>

1582
01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>66 to 70.</v>

1583
01:10:52.611 --> 01:10:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I was in Vietnam and off the coast with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the navy and actually my wife was a navy</v>

1584
01:10:57.171 --> 01:10:59.150
<v Speaker 3>nurse too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're both in the navy then.</v>

1585
01:10:59.190 --> 01:11:00.300
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1586
01:11:00.301 --> 01:11:02.130
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you do back then?</v>

1587
01:11:02.131 --> 01:11:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Was there any uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>substances?</v>

1588
01:11:04.271 --> 01:11:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1589
01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Alcohol and alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots.</v>

1590
01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Lots and lots of alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1591
01:11:08.291 --> 01:11:13.291
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you where I was and the day </v>

1592
01:11:13.291 --> 01:11:13.380
<v Speaker 3>you were born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were born in [inaudible].</v>

1593
01:11:13.381 --> 01:11:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Sixty seven?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1594
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:19.770
<v Speaker 3>I was in the officer's club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had Subic Bay in the Philippines.</v>

1595
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.800
<v Speaker 3>We're on a break from the gumline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason I remember it because I </v>

1596
01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.660
<v Speaker 3>was drinking my first flaming flagging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrating my 25th birthday.</v>

1597
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:30.270
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're born on the same day.</v>

1598
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.720
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that the flaming flag and</v>

1599
01:11:33.721 --> 01:11:38.721
<v Speaker 3>was one of the traditions in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>boardroom and it was a brandy snifter </v>

1600
01:11:38.721 --> 01:11:41.940
<v Speaker 3>and you'd light the brandy on fire and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then yet sip it down with a brand new on</v>

1601
01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:42.510
<v Speaker 3>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1602

1624
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.700
<v Speaker 3>he was very repressive.</v>

1625
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:44.260
<v Speaker 3>Would imagine it'd be very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>

1626
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:46.450
<v Speaker 3>There were no girls there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1627
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:49.140
<v Speaker 3>we had to get up at least three days a </v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

1628
01:12:49.141 --> 01:12:52.680
<v Speaker 3>You had to sign in outside the chapel </v>
<v Speaker 3>between seven and 7:30,</v>

1629
01:12:52.681 --> 01:12:55.720
<v Speaker 3>fully dressed a lights out.</v>

1630
01:12:55.721 --> 01:13:00.721
<v Speaker 3>and lights out was pretty serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't have an electric clock or </v>

1631
01:13:00.721 --> 01:13:01.260
<v Speaker 3>an electric blanket because they cut off</v>
<v Speaker 3>the electricity to your room.</v>

1632
01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:05.130
<v Speaker 3>And I had a classmate kicked out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>school for studying by candle light.</v>

1633
01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:07.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how repressive it was.</v>

1634
01:13:07.261 --> 01:13:12.261
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really a backward place studying </v>

1635
01:13:12.261 --> 01:13:16.281
<v Speaker 3>by candlelight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got You kicked out of school probably </v>

1636
01:13:16.281 --> 01:13:16.281
<v Speaker 3>because he stole the candles from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>grotto or something.</v>

1637
01:13:16.281 --> 01:13:17.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1639
01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:20.030

<v Speaker 3>so I got kicked out of school.</v>

1640
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:21.720
<v Speaker 3>That's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was a financing the thing by selling </v>
<v Speaker 3>ecstasy,</v>

1717
01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:25.960
<v Speaker 3>ecstasy come into play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a,</v>

1718
01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:29.380
<v Speaker 3>I was doing this computer thing and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>close friend of mine,</v>

1719
01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:32.470
<v Speaker 3>a lawyer in Biloxi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he called me one day and he says,</v>

1720
01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:33.760
<v Speaker 3>what do you know about ecstasy?</v>

1721
01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:34.750
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

1722
01:16:34.751 --> 01:16:35.080
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1723
01:16:35.081 --> 01:16:36.080
<v Speaker 3>it's a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1724
01:16:36.081 --> 01:16:36.950
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do drugs.</v>

1725
01:16:36.951 --> 01:16:38.450
<v Speaker 3>And he says it's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1726
01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:43.710
<v Speaker 3>now this isn't Texas and at that time </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting 30 years to life for a </v>

1727
01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:47.161
<v Speaker 3>single joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's no way I touched </v>

1728
01:16:47.161 --> 01:16:47.161
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1729
01:16:47.161 --> 01:16:50.670
<v Speaker 3>and I get to join for one joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1730
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:52.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>

1731
01:16:52.001 --> 01:16:52.870
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is legal.</v>

1732
01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:54.880
<v Speaker 3>And I had a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend of my wife's,</v>

1733
01:16:54.881 --> 01:16:56.350
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a model in town,</v>

1734
01:16:56.351 --> 01:16:59.170
<v Speaker 3>ran with the fast crowd and I met with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her and she fixed me up.</v>

1735
01:16:59.171 --> 01:17:01.480
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I got involved in and uh,</v>

1736
01:17:01.481 --> 01:17:06.481
<v Speaker 3>then my friend wanted some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sent him 50 and I started telling </v>

1737
01:17:06.481 --> 01:17:07.860
<v Speaker 3>friends about it and I became really </v>
<v Speaker 3>evangelical about it.</v>

1738
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:11.460
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty soon I'm buying hundreds and 500,</v>

1739
01:17:11.490 --> 01:17:12.980
<v Speaker 3>600 and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1740
01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.260
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize it at the time.</v>

1741
01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:18.320
<v Speaker 3>The Guy I was buying from was actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>the main man.</v>

1742
01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.810
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big guy that started see ecstasy hit</v>

1743

<v Speaker 3>had been out here in west coast for </v>

1744
01:17:25.811 --> 01:17:28.571
<v Speaker 3>several years with the therapist and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Dallas and the stork club was the </v>

1745
01:17:28.571 --> 01:17:29.750
<v Speaker 3>ground zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1746
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:32.960
<v Speaker 3>the stork club was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stark club was so big.</v>

1747
01:17:32.961 --> 01:17:35.510
<v Speaker 3>Madonna moved to Dallas to be close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that club.</v>

1748
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:39.320
<v Speaker 3>There's a documentary going to be coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>out soon,</v>

1749
01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.330
<v Speaker 3>called the stark project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1750
01:17:41.331 --> 01:17:41.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1751
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:44.190
<v Speaker 3>it was an insane place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really the,</v>

1752
01:17:44.210 --> 01:17:49.210
<v Speaker 3>the genesis of house music before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or even Chicago is called Stark club </v>

1753
01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:50.450
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it,</v>

1754
01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:55.700
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there were bowls of ecstasy on the </v>

1755
01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:55.700
<v Speaker 3>bar where you can go by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1756
01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:59.600
<v Speaker 3>giving 20 bucks and get a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a hit because it was all legal and </v>

1757
01:17:59.600 --> 01:17:59.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1758
01:17:59.600 --> 01:17:59.600
<v Speaker 3>they had chill space.</v>

1759
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.650
<v Speaker 3>It was a crazy place that you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like burning man in a building.</v>

1760
01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.200
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Larry Hagman was a regular there.</v>

1761
01:18:06.201 --> 01:18:06.740
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1762
01:18:06.741 --> 01:18:07.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1763
01:18:07.101 --> 01:18:12.101
<v Speaker 3>in this movie that's coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's quoted as saying he lights up and </v>

1764
01:18:12.101 --> 01:18:12.101
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1765
01:18:12.101 --> 01:18:13.250
<v Speaker 3>it was the greatest party on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

1766
01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:16.100
<v Speaker 3>the only better parties burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's like putting the star club in</v>

1767
01:18:16.101 --> 01:18:19.670
<v Speaker 3>the middle of a desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But some people would get all dressed up</v>

1768
01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:22.850
<v Speaker 3>burning man type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're talking name brand people,</v>

1769
01:18:22.851 --> 01:18:24.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the talking heads and people like that.</v>

1770
01:18:24.961 --> 01:18:29.330
<v Speaker 3>And Madonna even was showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>George W dot been there and uh,</v>

1771
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:34.430
<v Speaker 3>it was just wild and crazy and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>played this house music and they had a </v>

1772
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:36.740
<v Speaker 3>chill space and coed bathrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a wild place.</v>

1773
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:38.090
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1774
01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.370
<v Speaker 3>that's really where ecstasy starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>spreading.</v>

1775
01:18:40.371 --> 01:18:42.700
<v Speaker 3>Now I was selling to all of my friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1776
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:48.130
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of coworkers and everybody and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were really serious about it that I </v>

1777
01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:51.200
<v Speaker 3>would make people read all whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature there was,</v>

1778
01:18:51.201 --> 01:18:52.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't very much.</v>

1779
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:57.490
<v Speaker 3>So there's a speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sasha gave a talk that Rick Doblin had </v>

1780
01:18:57.490 --> 01:18:58.160
<v Speaker 3>given up the international health </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization,</v>

1781
01:18:58.161 --> 01:19:03.161
<v Speaker 3>but not much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we were really serious and I was </v>

1782
01:19:03.161 --> 01:19:05.681
<v Speaker 3>sort of not in the club scene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was getting people together in small </v>

1783
01:19:05.681 --> 01:19:09.041
<v Speaker 3>groups and doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I still have a lot of ex and I was </v>

1784
01:19:09.041 --> 01:19:11.861
<v Speaker 3>getting deep discounts and so I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>using that money to cash flow of my </v>

1785
01:19:11.861 --> 01:19:11.861
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you say Sasha,</v>

1786
01:19:11.861 --> 01:19:15.490
<v Speaker 3>do you mean Sasha shoulder that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks don't know that he talked about?</v>

1787
01:19:15.491 --> 01:19:16.240
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

1788
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:21.250
<v Speaker 3>Sasha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sasha Shogun is the guy that he didn't </v>

1789
01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:24.220
<v Speaker 3>invent Mbma but he a resurrected it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is patented in the early 19 hundreds.</v>

1790
01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.330
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1791
01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.580
<v Speaker 3>resynthesize didn't wrote a paper about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it that,</v>

1792
01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:29.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit the underground,</v>

1793
01:19:29.721 --> 01:19:32.640
<v Speaker 3>but most of what I call the ABC </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemicals are,</v>

1794
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:36.680
<v Speaker 3>came from Sasha Shogun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>noon to cb to see all of those things.</v>

1795
01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see the vice documentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>where Hamilton Morris Interviews Sasha </v>

1796
01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Shogun?</v>

1797
01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I saw that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1798
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:48.430
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the only time I've ever </v>

1799
01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:48.430
<v Speaker 1>said that word in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shogun shogun.</v>

1800
01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:52.481
<v Speaker 1>Sasha Shogun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never said he's one of those names </v>

1801
01:19:52.481 --> 01:19:52.481
<v Speaker 1>that I've read his name 100 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never said it.</v>

1802
01:19:52.481 --> 01:19:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1803
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:58.110
<v Speaker 1>the really interesting vice documentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>where Hamilton Morris went and met with </v>

1804
01:19:58.131 --> 01:20:03.131
<v Speaker 1>them and had a long day with them and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>went over different compounds with them </v>

1805
01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.880
<v Speaker 1>and talked about discoveries and know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he found.</v>

1806
01:20:04.881 --> 01:20:05.240
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1807
01:20:05.490 --> 01:20:08.940
<v Speaker 3>Sasha was a regular at the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>seminars and we'd sit down and,</v>

1808
01:20:08.941 --> 01:20:09.790
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1809
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:11.190
<v Speaker 3>we have a whole bunch of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1810
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.900
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1811
01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:15.090
<v Speaker 3>I've had a few one on one conversations </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them,</v>

1812
01:20:15.091 --> 01:20:16.800
<v Speaker 3>but we always talked about things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the navy.</v>

1813
01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:22.220
<v Speaker 3>He was in the navy in World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the chemists would come on and they </v>

1814
01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:24.060
<v Speaker 3>would start talking ABC Xyz and what are</v>
<v Speaker 3>his acronym books.</v>

1815
01:20:24.061 --> 01:20:29.061
<v Speaker 3>He has these books up p and t calls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then fla means I have known and loved </v>

1816
01:20:29.061 --> 01:20:32.400
<v Speaker 3>and tryptamines I have known and loved </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the two acronyms.</v>

1817
01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:37.620
<v Speaker 3>And the first parts of the book are like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a novel and with the use fictional names</v>

1818
01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:39.390
<v Speaker 3>was about an and Sasha and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

1819
01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:44.690
<v Speaker 3>And then the last half of the book is as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a recipe section and there are literally</v>

1820
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.970
<v Speaker 3>probably over well over a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemicals there.</v>

1821
01:20:48.150 --> 01:20:53.150
<v Speaker 3>And if you look in the index,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones in bold are the ones that are </v>

1822
01:20:53.150 --> 01:20:53.150
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive.</v>

1823
01:20:53.150 --> 01:20:53.150
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1824
01:20:53.150 --> 01:20:57.920
<v Speaker 3>actually before nine slash 11 happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a part of a study group where </v>

1825
01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:01.461
<v Speaker 3>we're kind of working our way through it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and every two weeks we get this little </v>

1826
01:21:01.461 --> 01:21:02.430
<v Speaker 3>powder in the mail and experiment with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and try it.</v>

1827
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:03.520
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1828
01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:08.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine slash 11 came and they started </v>

1829
01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:08.650
<v Speaker 3>sending a smallpox or whatever it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the mail.</v>

1830
01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:09.210
<v Speaker 3>The anthrax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthrax.</v>

1831
01:21:09.211 --> 01:21:09.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1832
01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:14.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this chemist was out of the country and </v>

1833
01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.311
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sending any more powder through </v>

1834
01:21:16.311 --> 01:21:16.440
<v Speaker 3>the US mail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that ended that experiment.</v>

1835
01:21:16.441 --> 01:21:21.441
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of things you're hearing about</v>
<v Speaker 3>now are things that are coming off his </v>

1836
01:21:21.441 --> 01:21:21.441
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1837
01:21:21.441 --> 01:21:22.350
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is,</v>

1838
01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:24.360
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's really declining now.</v>

1839
01:21:24.361 --> 01:21:25.620
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1840
01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:28.200
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he should have gotten a Nobel prize now.</v>

1841
01:21:28.201 --> 01:21:31.580
<v Speaker 3>The way he would do this as he'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd get an idea for a chemical.</v>

1842
01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:32.130
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1843
01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.860
<v Speaker 3>what if I moved this Adam over to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the ring?</v>

1844
01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:40.280
<v Speaker 3>And then he'd synthesize that and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd start out with what he would think </v>

1845
01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:40.280
<v Speaker 3>to be a sub,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1846
01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:44.250
<v Speaker 3>standard dose or real low dose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he'd work his way up over the period</v>

1847
01:21:44.251 --> 01:21:49.251
<v Speaker 3>of a month or so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he did this with like a thousand </v>

1848
01:21:49.251 --> 01:21:51.060
<v Speaker 3>chemicals himself until he finally found</v>
<v Speaker 3>out what the active dose was.</v>

1849
01:21:51.061 --> 01:21:52.920
<v Speaker 3>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a group of people,</v>

1850
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:58.790
<v Speaker 3>which I've met several of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only one or two of them still </v>

1851
01:21:58.790 --> 01:22:01.431
<v Speaker 3>alive actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're all in their sixties and </v>

1852
01:22:01.431 --> 01:22:01.431
<v Speaker 3>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're.</v>

1853
01:22:01.431 --> 01:22:05.951
<v Speaker 3>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the ones that are talked about </v>

1854
01:22:05.951 --> 01:22:07.611
<v Speaker 3>in the front part of the book and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the back part where he synthesizes </v>

1855
01:22:07.611 --> 01:22:10.671
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all these comments of what </v>

1856
01:22:10.671 --> 01:22:14.160
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took them and I've seen the original </v>

1857
01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:14.160
<v Speaker 3>documents for these comments for each </v>
<v Speaker 3>paragraph.</v>

1858
01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.810
<v Speaker 3>There's like 16 pages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>single spaced,</v>

1859
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:20.830
<v Speaker 3>typed A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this was in depth research that </v>

1860
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:22.500
<v Speaker 3>they did for a number of years over </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of compounds</v>

1861
01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:27.570
<v Speaker 4>she imagined being friends with that guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>while this was all going on every day.</v>

1862
01:22:27.611 --> 01:22:32.611
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to the center of the </v>

1863
01:22:32.611 --> 01:22:32.611
<v Speaker 4>university.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a godly man.</v>

1864
01:22:32.611 --> 01:22:33.850
<v Speaker 4>I did that yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you guys take a day off</v>

1865
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:35.160
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll tell you what,</v>

1866
01:22:35.190 --> 01:22:37.590
<v Speaker 3>if you sat down and talked with them </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you know he's,</v>

1867
01:22:37.591 --> 01:22:39.690
<v Speaker 3>he's declining mentally a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's blind now.</v>

1868
01:22:39.691 --> 01:22:43.680
<v Speaker 3>But if you sat down and talked with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would think that he'd been your next</v>

1869
01:22:43.681 --> 01:22:44.780
<v Speaker 3>door neighbor growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1870
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:46.820
<v Speaker 3>he could talk to you about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's.</v>

1871
01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:49.380
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the hat is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>happiest people I know.</v>

1872
01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:52.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure he's probably never been filled</v>
<v Speaker 4>it up now,</v>

1873
01:22:52.491 --> 01:22:54.270
<v Speaker 4>but he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a serious scientists,</v>

1874
01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:57.350
<v Speaker 4>a very serious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just nothing wrong with that as well,</v>

1875
01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:59.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the idea of being a serious scientist</v>

1876
01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:02.760
<v Speaker 4>and not experimenting with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness being mutually.</v>

1877
01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:05.680
<v Speaker 3>You might be able to find a picture of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sasha and lab.</v>

1878
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:11.010
<v Speaker 3>His lab was an old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a potting shed out behind his house is </v>

1879
01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:13.300
<v Speaker 3>still there and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've now bottled up everything.</v>

1880
01:23:13.301 --> 01:23:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Anyone get to the Smithsonian or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1881
01:23:15.101 --> 01:23:17.320
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at it and you say,</v>

1882
01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:18.120
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1883
01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:20.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a mad scientist place.</v>

1884
01:23:20.530 --> 01:23:21.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's it.</v>

1885
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:25.270
<v Speaker 3>All this stuff came out of just such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>small little shed.</v>

1886
01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:30.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hamilton Morris actually went in the </v>

1887
01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:30.560
<v Speaker 4>shed viewing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1888
01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:30.720
<v Speaker 4>that's it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1889
01:23:30.721 --> 01:23:35.340
<v Speaker 4>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is a leaky old potting shed.</v>

1890
01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.310
<v Speaker 4>That's what your shed looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you'd done drugs a million times,</v>

1891
01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:44.020
<v Speaker 4>just starts looking like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that guy has done every drug </v>

1892
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:44.020
<v Speaker 4>there is a million times over.</v>

1893
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:44.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1894
01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:49.330
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't like pot that I put out a </v>

1895
01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:52.421
<v Speaker 3>podcast once worked area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He and his wife were talking and he's </v>

1896
01:23:52.421 --> 01:23:53.450
<v Speaker 3>talking about this one experience that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had and he says,</v>

1897
01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:54.350
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was awesome.</v>

1898
01:23:54.351 --> 01:23:59.351
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we stopped time and we actually stopped </v>

1899
01:23:59.351 --> 01:23:59.351
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

1900
01:23:59.351 --> 01:23:59.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why we started that clock </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

1901
01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:00.200
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1902
01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:01.430
<v Speaker 3>you chickened out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1903
01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:03.200
<v Speaker 3>what were we on that time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

1904
01:24:03.201 --> 01:24:05.840
<v Speaker 3>brownies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but normally,</v>

1905
01:24:05.841 --> 01:24:06.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1906
01:24:06.321 --> 01:24:07.430
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't like pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

1907
01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:12.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know probably about 25 percent of the </v>

1908
01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:12.480
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic people just don't get along </v>
<v Speaker 3>with pot.</v>

1909
01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.910
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the number one concern?</v>

1910
01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:15.500
<v Speaker 3>Or if they don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

1911
01:24:15.501 --> 01:24:20.501
<v Speaker 3>they don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just I wonder if it's the self examined </v>

1912
01:24:20.501 --> 01:24:20.501
<v Speaker 3>atory aspects of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1913
01:24:20.501 --> 01:24:23.190
<v Speaker 3>some of these chemicals get pretty self </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanatory inventory.</v>

1914
01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:24.470
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Acid.</v>

1915
01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1916
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:26.930
<v Speaker 4>Mushrooms for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1917
01:24:26.931 --> 01:24:27.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

1918
01:24:27.651 --> 01:24:30.050
<v Speaker 4>there's a real abrasive quality to </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating pot.</v>

1919
01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.400
<v Speaker 4>It was an abrasive self examined Tory </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that a lot of people find very </v>

1920
01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:39.131
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable and you've got to really </v>
<v Speaker 4>practice with each dose until you get </v>

1921
01:24:39.131 --> 01:24:39.260
<v Speaker 4>the right amount to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1922
01:24:39.261 --> 01:24:44.261
<v Speaker 4>you do and you don't really don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're getting a cookie from </v>

1923
01:24:44.261 --> 01:24:46.100
<v Speaker 4>somebody unless you've been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if you made them yourself,</v>

1924
01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:48.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to like test out east batch and</v>

1925
01:24:48.651 --> 01:24:53.651
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this is a strong batch or this is </v>

1926
01:24:53.651 --> 01:24:53.651
<v Speaker 4>not a strong writer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one,</v>

1927
01:24:53.651 --> 01:24:53.651
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1928
01:24:53.651 --> 01:24:56.360
<v Speaker 3>Well we had a friend who had a going </v>
<v Speaker 3>away party last night.</v>

<v Speaker 3>made some brownies and they said don't </v>

1931

<v Speaker 3>eat more than a quarter of one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she got there late famous last words</v>

1932
01:25:06.170 --> 01:25:11.170

<v Speaker 3>That was on a Saturday night and the </v>

1933
01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:13.730
<v Speaker 3>following Tuesday she was still too soon</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go to work.</v>

1934
01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an excuse.</v>

1935
01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:18.740
<v Speaker 3>So Lazy Bitch didn't want to go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

1936
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:21.950
<v Speaker 3>I got stone one time that it lasted over</v>
<v Speaker 3>24 hours.</v>

1937
01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:27.970
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had a friend that was just making </v>

1938
01:25:27.970 --> 01:25:27.970
<v Speaker 3>this delta nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just pure.</v>

1939
01:25:27.970 --> 01:25:31.430
<v Speaker 3>They take over a pound of Hash and it go</v>
<v Speaker 3>down to like one gram,</v>

1940
01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:36.520
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was in these little bottles and </v>

1941
01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:37.730
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to take it out with a pinhead</v>
<v Speaker 3>and titrate it with you.</v>

1942
01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could smoke it or you could titrate </v>

1943
01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:42.730
<v Speaker 3>it into alcohol?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1944
01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:42.730
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1945
01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:45.110
<v Speaker 3>it's all stuck in the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottle and it wasn't coming out.</v>

1946
01:25:45.111 --> 01:25:47.300
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well microwave it just a little bit.</v>

1947
01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.700
<v Speaker 3>And I was doing five seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five seconds,</v>

1948
01:25:49.701 --> 01:25:54.701
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went to 11 seconds and it shot out </v>

1949
01:25:54.701 --> 01:25:55.550
<v Speaker 3>like a volcano and I had it on a piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>of paper,</v>

1950
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:58.290
<v Speaker 3>paper towel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was living in Florida then.</v>

1951
01:25:58.291 --> 01:25:58.930
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1952
01:25:58.931 --> 01:26:00.920
<v Speaker 3>the woman who's now my wife was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

1953
01:26:00.921 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>And anyhow I took the towel in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to waste it.</v>

1954
01:26:04.011 --> 01:26:05.570
<v Speaker 3>So I ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swallowed it.</v>

1955
01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.310
<v Speaker 3>You ate the whole towel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1956
01:26:07.311 --> 01:26:09.920
<v Speaker 3>it was just a little part of the tile </v>
<v Speaker 3>that had the pot on.</v>

1957
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:13.670
<v Speaker 3>And then I called her and I told her </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I did and she said,</v>

1958
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:15.680
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that tall has chlorine.</v>

1959
01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.980
<v Speaker 3>And she wasn't worried about the pot and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a nurse with a master's in health,</v>

1960
01:26:18.981 --> 01:26:20.750
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I took her advice seriously.</v>

1961
01:26:20.751 --> 01:26:23.660
<v Speaker 3>She said all that chlorine and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the towel.</v>

1962
01:26:23.661 --> 01:26:28.661
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't have eaten the towel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course by then I'm starting to </v>

1963
01:26:28.661 --> 01:26:28.990
<v Speaker 3>get kind of panicky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I took some pepto Basey,</v>

1964
01:26:29.090 --> 01:26:32.120
<v Speaker 3>which kind of activated the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was stoned for good.</v>

1965
01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:34.310
<v Speaker 3>Forty eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forty eight hours.</v>

1966
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:39.550
<v Speaker 3>I was functional after 24,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't tell.</v>

1967
01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:40.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could tell I was still high.</v>

1968
01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:43.730
<v Speaker 3>It's very uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not fun.</v>

1969
01:26:44.110 --> 01:26:46.290
<v Speaker 4>So this person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your friend was,</v>

1970
01:26:46.291 --> 01:26:48.970
<v Speaker 4>was high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she said until Tuesday.</v>

1971
01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:51.370
<v Speaker 4>What Day did she started on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saturday night.</v>

1972
01:26:51.371 --> 01:26:53.290
<v Speaker 4>Late.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Sunday,</v>

1973
01:26:53.290 --> 01:26:54.120
<v Speaker 4>Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then Tuesday she,</v>

1974
01:26:54.670 --> 01:26:59.670
<v Speaker 4>she went to work Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she said she was not feeling too </v>

1975
01:26:59.670 --> 01:26:59.670
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my goodness.</v>

1976
01:26:59.670 --> 01:26:59.670
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to do that.</v>

1977
01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:01.900
<v Speaker 4>It seems so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh it is.</v>

1978
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:04.630
<v Speaker 4>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Both of those were accidents,</v>

1979
01:27:04.631 --> 01:27:06.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's only when you eat it,</v>

1980
01:27:07.330 --> 01:27:09.070
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1981
01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:09.940
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1982
01:27:09.941 --> 01:27:14.941
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't kill anybody unless you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something really stupid while you're in </v>

1983
01:27:14.941 --> 01:27:17.641
<v Speaker 4>that state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It won't be the drug that kills you </v>

1984
01:27:17.641 --> 01:27:17.641
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1985
01:27:17.641 --> 01:27:17.641
<v Speaker 4>it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be.</v>

1986
01:27:17.641 --> 01:27:17.990
<v Speaker 4>If you're really stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1987
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't overdose,</v>

1988
01:27:19.091 --> 01:27:21.190
<v Speaker 4>you can't overdose on can overdose for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1989
01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:21.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1990
01:27:21.941 --> 01:27:26.941
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those things where should </v>

1991
01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:26.941
<v Speaker 4>you be able to go to the hardware store </v>
<v Speaker 4>and buy a saw?</v>

1992
01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:26.980
<v Speaker 4>I say you sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1993
01:27:27.250 --> 01:27:29.620
<v Speaker 4>But if enough people cut their hands off</v>
<v Speaker 4>with saws.</v>

1994
01:27:29.621 --> 01:27:31.360
<v Speaker 4>Well we have like protests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1995
01:27:31.361 --> 01:27:33.370
<v Speaker 4>make it so that it's very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a solid.</v>

1996
01:27:33.371 --> 01:27:37.210
<v Speaker 4>You have to get a license to get a saw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He should wear a sign saying I'm stupid.</v>

1997
01:27:37.211 --> 01:27:40.270
<v Speaker 4>I used to solve when I'm stoned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the same argument really can be used</v>

1998
01:27:40.271 --> 01:27:41.730
<v Speaker 4>about firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>etc.</v>

1999
01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.080
<v Speaker 4>The fact that people use them against </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people,</v>

2000
01:27:44.081 --> 01:27:46.630
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that if you have a firearm </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's dangerous.</v>

2001
01:27:46.631 --> 01:27:51.631
<v Speaker 4>Like is iT,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it really dangerous if you know what </v>

2002
01:27:51.631 --> 01:27:54.121
<v Speaker 4>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like you can control a lot of </v>

2003
01:27:54.121 --> 01:27:54.820
<v Speaker 4>what's dangerous and not dangerous about</v>
<v Speaker 4>a firearm and then because,</v>

2004
01:27:54.821 --> 01:27:59.821
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad people can have guns and bad things </v>

2005
01:27:59.821 --> 01:27:59.821
<v Speaker 4>can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is true,</v>

2006
01:27:59.821 --> 01:27:59.920
<v Speaker 4>but does that mean that good people </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't have them?</v>

2007
01:27:59.921 --> 01:28:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Like that seems to be a weird sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 4>argument.</v>

2008
01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:02.870
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2009
01:28:02.871 --> 01:28:04.130
<v Speaker 3>I was trained with guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2010
01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:09.220
<v Speaker 3>I went hunting with my dad and in high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school the marine corps had a gun club </v>

2011
01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:14.081
<v Speaker 3>that we joined in and we'd go out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot a 30 caliber machine guns and </v>

2012
01:28:14.081 --> 01:28:15.560
<v Speaker 3>browning automatics and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we learned gun safety.</v>

2013
01:28:15.561 --> 01:28:16.850
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we learned a lot about it.</v>

2014
01:28:17.150 --> 01:28:17.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

2015
01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:22.880
<v Speaker 4>people are just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a very detached society and I </v>

2016
01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:26.741
<v Speaker 4>have a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No names will be named who gets mad at </v>

2017
01:28:26.741 --> 01:28:28.490
<v Speaker 4>ugg boots because they're made out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sheep skin.</v>

2018
01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:31.610
<v Speaker 4>He thinks that's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they take these sheets and they skin</v>

2019
01:28:31.611 --> 01:28:32.870
<v Speaker 4>them and they make boots out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2020
01:28:32.871 --> 01:28:35.540
<v Speaker 4>why the fuck would you wear that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But meanwhile he eats meat.</v>

2021
01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:39.620
<v Speaker 4>Here's his fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Has leather seats.</v>

2022
01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.040
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it,</v>

2023
01:28:41.041 --> 01:28:42.710
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so bizarre.</v>

2024
01:28:42.711 --> 01:28:47.711
<v Speaker 4>It's not even vegetarian like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is the draw the line at the </v>

2025
01:28:47.711 --> 01:28:50.340
<v Speaker 4>sheepskin boots like this is fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to using the sheepskin like,</v>

2026
01:28:51.130 --> 01:28:52.220
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're</v>

2027
01:28:52.230 --> 01:28:54.210
<v Speaker 3>getting in hunting now and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2028
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:58.290
<v Speaker 3>you're talk about deer hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's calling a herd if somebody's</v>

2029
01:28:58.460 --> 01:28:59.730
<v Speaker 3>going to die in the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyhow.</v>

2030
01:28:59.731 --> 01:29:02.120
<v Speaker 3>And why not you them rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolf eat</v>

2031
01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:02.800
<v Speaker 4>him or something?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2032
01:29:02.890 --> 01:29:04.500
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not mean dear.</v>

2033
01:29:04.501 --> 01:29:05.880
<v Speaker 4>Don't live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They die.</v>

2034
01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.880
<v Speaker 4>They don't last very long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either freeze to death.</v>

2035
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:11.190
<v Speaker 4>That happens a lot to the place where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>went,</v>

2036
01:29:11.191 --> 01:29:16.191
<v Speaker 4>Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they freeze a lot or they get killed by </v>

2037
01:29:16.191 --> 01:29:16.191
<v Speaker 4>predators,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they never reach old.</v>

2038
01:29:16.191 --> 01:29:18.120
<v Speaker 4>Age just doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no oLd age for a deer,</v>

2039
01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:20.170
<v Speaker 4>and if you live in some place that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>deer,</v>

2040
01:29:20.171 --> 01:29:22.170
<v Speaker 4>is there a problem or deer are a </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>

2041
01:29:23.130 --> 01:29:28.130
<v Speaker 4>you want to shoot him if he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you're not against hunting </v>

2042
01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:29.400
<v Speaker 4>because they couldn't be a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't think of them as rats.</v>

2043
01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Erad is just an animal and an animal </v>
<v Speaker 4>that has infiltrated entire cities and </v>

2044
01:29:34.951 --> 01:29:38.010
<v Speaker 4>entire population areas where they know </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are.</v>

2045
01:29:38.011 --> 01:29:43.011
<v Speaker 4>They know there's a food source and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've infiltrated the deer the exact </v>

2046
01:29:43.011 --> 01:29:43.011
<v Speaker 4>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that,</v>

2047
01:29:43.011 --> 01:29:43.440
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2048
01:29:43.441 --> 01:29:44.160
<v Speaker 4>it's all our fault.</v>

2049
01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:46.290
<v Speaker 4>We came to where the deer are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

2050
01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:51.380
<v Speaker 4>there's more deer today than there was </v>
<v Speaker 4>in 1492 when columbus didn't land here.</v>

2051
01:29:52.210 --> 01:29:57.210
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's more deer today than they've </v>

2052
01:29:57.210 --> 01:29:59.871
<v Speaker 4>been ever ever in the recorded history </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this country and that's just because </v>

2053
01:29:59.871 --> 01:30:04.611
<v Speaker 4>of land management and because also </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's very few predators and so the </v>

2054
01:30:04.611 --> 01:30:08.601
<v Speaker 4>only way they get killed as by people </v>
<v Speaker 4>killing them and there's a lot of areas </v>

2055
01:30:08.601 --> 01:30:11.661
<v Speaker 4>where there's just too much space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't kill them all like go through </v>

2056
01:30:11.661 --> 01:30:12.090
<v Speaker 4>like rural Pennsylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My god,</v>

2057
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:13.740
<v Speaker 4>they're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Upstate New York.</v>

2058
01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:14.860
<v Speaker 4>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many?</v>

2059
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:16.860
<v Speaker 4>We lived out in long island for a while </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing a house,</v>

2060
01:30:16.861 --> 01:30:18.850
<v Speaker 4>sitting job and they were all over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>

2061
01:30:18.851 --> 01:30:20.010
<v Speaker 4>all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There.</v>

2062
01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:23.310
<v Speaker 4>They literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oregon has a serious problem.</v>

2063
01:30:23.311 --> 01:30:25.080
<v Speaker 4>You know when people don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2064
01:30:25.081 --> 01:30:26.580
<v Speaker 4>what would be the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is,</v>

2065
01:30:26.581 --> 01:30:31.581
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>car accidents have a huge amount of </v>

2066
01:30:31.581 --> 01:30:34.311
<v Speaker 4>people get in car accidents with deer </v>
<v Speaker 4>and deer can go through your windshield </v>

2067
01:30:34.311 --> 01:30:34.311
<v Speaker 4>and kill you.</v>

2068
01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.730
<v Speaker 4>The whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The antlers can.</v>

2069
01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.800
<v Speaker 4>They've killed people before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just once.</v>

2070
01:30:37.801 --> 01:30:42.801
<v Speaker 4>It's happened many times and god forbid </v>
<v Speaker 4>you live in an area that has fucking </v>

2071
01:30:42.801 --> 01:30:45.260
<v Speaker 4>moose because that will kill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That will land on you.</v>

2072
01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.860
<v Speaker 4>A lot of pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would just gear though.</v>

2073
01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:49.120
<v Speaker 4>Yes they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever hear that funny?</v>

2074
01:30:49.170 --> 01:30:51.420
<v Speaker 4>Nine slash 11 call with the guy that hit</v>
<v Speaker 4>a deer,</v>

2075
01:30:51.421 --> 01:30:53.250
<v Speaker 4>put it in his back seat and then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>deer bit him,</v>

2076
01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:59.040
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he escaped who's in a phone booth and </v>

2077
01:30:59.040 --> 01:30:59.580
<v Speaker 4>the dog had smelled blood and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>kept him in the phone booth.</v>

2078
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:02.030
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a whole areas phone call.</v>

2079
01:31:02.031 --> 01:31:02.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2080
01:31:02.851 --> 01:31:07.851
<v Speaker 4>I never heard that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I did hear the one where the cops </v>

2081
01:31:07.851 --> 01:31:11.120
<v Speaker 4>took someone's pot and made pot brownies</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they called the cops on </v>

2082
01:31:12.091 --> 01:31:17.091
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were saying they're dying and he </v>

2083
01:31:17.091 --> 01:31:17.091
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you please hurry up?</v>

2084
01:31:17.091 --> 01:31:20.690
<v Speaker 4>Time's going really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really slow as someone who's been there </v>

2085
01:31:21.451 --> 01:31:23.280
<v Speaker 4>before and has it been like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2086
01:31:23.281 --> 01:31:25.260
<v Speaker 4>like way too high on a cookie going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

2087
01:31:25.261 --> 01:31:28.260
<v Speaker 4>I fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what it must have been like.</v>

2088
01:31:28.261 --> 01:31:29.940
<v Speaker 4>And there is proof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes you stupid.</v>

2089
01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:33.430
<v Speaker 4>can twists your reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2090
01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:35.370
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They knew.</v>

2091
01:31:35.530 --> 01:31:37.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they knew what they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting into.</v>

2092
01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:43.010
<v Speaker 4>People that don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually kind of ironic because if </v>

2093
01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:43.560
<v Speaker 4>you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2094
01:31:43.561 --> 01:31:45.660
<v Speaker 4>the idea behind it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2095
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:52.650
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think they understand that </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you keep something illegal,</v>

2096
01:31:52.710 --> 01:31:55.020
<v Speaker 4>you restrict the information that gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>out when he's tricked,</v>

2097
01:31:55.021 --> 01:31:56.910
<v Speaker 4>the information that gets out a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>misinformation,</v>

2098
01:31:56.911 --> 01:32:00.550
<v Speaker 4>gets out a lot of confusion and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually is worse for people.</v>

2099
01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:04.480
<v Speaker 4>That's where this eating pot comes into </v>
<v Speaker 4>place because they don't understand that</v>

2100
01:32:04.481 --> 01:32:09.481
<v Speaker 4>when you eat pot it gets processed by </v>
<v Speaker 4>your liver and it produces something </v>

2101
01:32:09.481 --> 01:32:14.131
<v Speaker 4>called 11 hydroxy metabolite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is four to five times more </v>

2102
01:32:14.131 --> 01:32:14.131
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive than thc.</v>

2103
01:32:14.131 --> 01:32:18.600
<v Speaker 4>It's a completely different psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience and so they eat it and they </v>

2104
01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:22.081
<v Speaker 4>think someone poisoned them or they </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that someone laced in laced it as </v>

2105
01:32:22.081 --> 01:32:23.710
<v Speaker 4>I've heard laced a bunch of times like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just laced man,</v>

2106
01:32:23.711 --> 01:32:25.550
<v Speaker 4>so lays this because they're freaking </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2107
01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:25.920
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2108
01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.940
<v Speaker 4>we're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They haven't been done before.</v>

2109
01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:30.820
<v Speaker 4>I've never been that stone before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm having an overdose.</v>

2110
01:32:30.821 --> 01:32:31.480
<v Speaker 4>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife,</v>

2111
01:32:31.481 --> 01:32:33.460
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pot.</v>

2112
01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:35.740
<v Speaker 4>You'd be the first ever buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2113
01:32:35.741 --> 01:32:40.741
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other thing about eating it is we </v>

2114
01:32:40.741 --> 01:32:40.741
<v Speaker 4>all have such a different metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2115
01:32:40.741 --> 01:32:41.860
<v Speaker 4>some people start coming out in an hour </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a half,</v>

2116
01:32:41.861 --> 01:32:46.861
<v Speaker 4>two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me it takes almost three and a half </v>

2117
01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:49.291
<v Speaker 4>hours to come on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have to be careful in that time </v>

2118
01:32:49.291 --> 01:32:52.231
<v Speaker 4>and not lose your patients and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it didn't have enough and then you </v>

2119
01:32:52.231 --> 01:32:54.310
<v Speaker 4>eat another part and then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much and it doesn't really.</v>

2120
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.960
<v Speaker 4>It depends on many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

2121
01:32:55.961 --> 01:33:00.961
<v Speaker 4>many factors and that's another issue </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the illegality of it is you're not </v>

2122
01:33:00.961 --> 01:33:02.290
<v Speaker 4>getting the same sort of standardized </v>
<v Speaker 4>doses you get.</v>

2123
01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:07.440
<v Speaker 4>If you ordered tylenol or you were to </v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamin c capsule or something like </v>

2124
01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:07.440
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting this,</v>

2125
01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:12.150
<v Speaker 4>you're getting weirdness and unless you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know the guy who makes the product that </v>

2126
01:33:12.150 --> 01:33:13.090
<v Speaker 4>you use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just guessing it's not worth it.</v>

2127
01:33:13.091 --> 01:33:18.091
<v Speaker 4>Stay sober.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't show your pants where there's a </v>

2128
01:33:18.091 --> 01:33:20.461
<v Speaker 4>lot of really in depth research going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>with cannabis oils and things like that </v>

2129
01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:24.931
<v Speaker 4>that we know one scientist that's doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>some amazing things with it and working </v>

2130
01:33:24.931 --> 01:33:25.330
<v Speaker 4>with cancer patients and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2131
01:33:25.331 --> 01:33:30.331
<v Speaker 4>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so much information about being </v>

2132
01:33:30.331 --> 01:33:31.570
<v Speaker 4>an anti aging and anticancer and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about intensive studies,</v>

2133
01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:36.630
<v Speaker 4>thousands of them that show all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits of it and that's not even </v>

2134
01:33:36.630 --> 01:33:38.800
<v Speaker 4>mentioning the hemp benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is even more important really when</v>

2135
01:33:38.801 --> 01:33:40.930
<v Speaker 4>you think about the forest and what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hemp could do.</v>

2136
01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2137
01:33:42.251 --> 01:33:46.120
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird time where we have all this</v>

2138
01:33:46.121 --> 01:33:50.530
<v Speaker 4>information about what could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>beneficial for our society,</v>

2139
01:33:50.531 --> 01:33:54.220
<v Speaker 4>how much money could be generated by </v>
<v Speaker 4>having legal cannabis,</v>

2140
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:59.550
<v Speaker 4>how much tax dollars will be generated </v>
<v Speaker 4>just in sales tax alone was pretty </v>

2141
01:33:59.550 --> 01:34:01.540
<v Speaker 4>substantial and that these transactions </v>
<v Speaker 4>are still going on today.</v>

2142
01:34:01.541 --> 01:34:02.190
<v Speaker 4>They're going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2143
01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:05.610
<v Speaker 4>there might be an increase in pot use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If pot were made illegal,</v>

2144
01:34:05.611 --> 01:34:10.611
<v Speaker 4>they probably would be an increase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reality is if you just got what </v>

2145
01:34:10.901 --> 01:34:13.390
<v Speaker 4>we have today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what people are doing,</v>

2146
01:34:13.391 --> 01:34:16.140
<v Speaker 4>where people are doing it illegally and </v>
<v Speaker 4>made it legal,</v>

2147
01:34:16.170 --> 01:34:21.170
<v Speaker 4>you would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The states and the cities would get a </v>

2148
01:34:21.170 --> 01:34:21.170
<v Speaker 4>tremendous amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But see,</v>

2149
01:34:21.170 --> 01:34:22.480
<v Speaker 4>they're getting money through the war </v>
<v Speaker 4>and drugs.</v>

2150
01:34:22.481 --> 01:34:27.481
<v Speaker 4>I'd only found out recently three </v>
<v Speaker 4>quarters of all the arrests are pot </v>

2151
01:34:27.481 --> 01:34:31.260
<v Speaker 4>possession.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Primarily three quarters and so three </v>

2152
01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:33.721
<v Speaker 4>quarters of all the money that's gone </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the war on drugs and think of all </v>

2153
01:34:33.721 --> 01:34:33.730
<v Speaker 4>the drug testing goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not testing for lsd.</v>

2154
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:37.000
<v Speaker 4>They're testing for pot and it's a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>industry.</v>

2155
01:34:37.001 --> 01:34:38.770
<v Speaker 4>The prison industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>such a big industry.</v>

2156
01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:41.090
<v Speaker 4>That's why they're fighting it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>in guard union.</v>

2157
01:34:41.091 --> 01:34:41.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2158
01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:46.980
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I heard prison guard unions lobby </v>

2159
01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:46.980
<v Speaker 4>against making drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal drugs,</v>

2160
01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:51.961
<v Speaker 4>legal rather partnership for drug free </v>
<v Speaker 4>America and I think that's a seagram's </v>

2161
01:34:51.961 --> 01:34:55.591
<v Speaker 4>and a few other liquor companies are the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ones who fund that used to be </v>

2162
01:34:55.591 --> 01:34:57.130
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceutical company probably there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a big part of it as well.</v>

2163
01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 4>I was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

2164
01:34:58.130 --> 01:34:59.720
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceuticals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>

2165
01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.900
<v Speaker 1>tobacco and pharmaceutical companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the.</v>

2166
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:06.950
<v Speaker 1>The primary drug pushers or again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I described it was the them </v>

2167
01:35:07.101 --> 01:35:12.101
<v Speaker 1>doing commercials against paul was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hookers doing commercials against </v>

2168
01:35:12.101 --> 01:35:12.101
<v Speaker 1>strippers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2169
01:35:12.101 --> 01:35:13.620
<v Speaker 1>that's a good analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>

2170
01:35:13.630 --> 01:35:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so stupid.</v>

2171
01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:20.140
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how can you have a partnership for </v>

2172
01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:22.160
<v Speaker 1>a drug free America that's sponsored by </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs like drugs?</v>

2173
01:35:22.161 --> 01:35:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Give them millions dot not just a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of bucks,</v>

2174
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:25.520
<v Speaker 1>not just drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A look,</v>

2175
01:35:25.521 --> 01:35:29.060
<v Speaker 1>I like what you're doing about pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We disagree about alcohol and tobacco.</v>

2176
01:35:29.061 --> 01:35:30.950
<v Speaker 1>I think they're awesome products and </v>
<v Speaker 1>great from humanity,</v>

2177
01:35:31.190 --> 01:35:34.020
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to send you some money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol and tobacco are given drugs,</v>

2178
01:35:34.021 --> 01:35:35.960
<v Speaker 1>a bad name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just so ridiculous.</v>

2179
01:35:35.961 --> 01:35:37.700
<v Speaker 1>We're just a weird time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in a really,</v>

2180
01:35:37.701 --> 01:35:40.460
<v Speaker 1>really weird time in human history where</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2181
01:35:40.461 --> 01:35:45.461
<v Speaker 1>we have so much information and yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much contradictory behavior </v>

2182
01:35:45.461 --> 01:35:45.590
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

2183
01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Contradictory to the evidence that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

2184
01:35:47.661 --> 01:35:52.661
<v Speaker 1>Contradictory to logic or contradictory </v>
<v Speaker 1>to reason like why are you arresting </v>

2185
01:35:52.661 --> 01:35:55.670
<v Speaker 1>somebody for a plant ever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does anybody get hurt by this?</v>

2186
01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Didn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>STop.</v>

2187
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:59.600
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when you were a cop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For who?</v>

2188
01:35:59.601 --> 01:36:04.601
<v Speaker 1>For the corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to be a cop to protect </v>

2189
01:36:04.601 --> 01:36:07.061
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enforced the law and protect the people </v>

2190
01:36:07.061 --> 01:36:07.061
<v Speaker 1>and the law should protect the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is what?</v>

2191
01:36:07.061 --> 01:36:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Cops are only supposed to enforce the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

2192
01:36:07.701 --> 01:36:12.701
<v Speaker 1>They're not here to protect people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will the laws that don't protect people </v>

2193
01:36:12.701 --> 01:36:16.001
<v Speaker 1>are fucking stupid and you don't protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>people by locking them in jail because </v>

2194
01:36:16.001 --> 01:36:16.001
<v Speaker 1>they have plants on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just dumb.</v>

2195
01:36:16.001 --> 01:36:17.760
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've got other shit to do,</v>

2196
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:18.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a good,</v>

2197
01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:22.290
<v Speaker 3>good place to put up the item about jury</v>
<v Speaker 3>nullification.</v>

2198
01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:22.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2199
01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:28.550
<v Speaker 3>people don't realize this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it used to be part of the judge's </v>

2200
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:31.950
<v Speaker 3>instruction to the jury that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't find this law appropriate,</v>

2201
01:36:31.951 --> 01:36:35.250
<v Speaker 3>you can find the person not guilty and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know.</v>

2202
01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:40.330
<v Speaker 3>They keep that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if you hand out a literature or a </v>

2203
01:36:40.330 --> 01:36:40.330
<v Speaker 3>piece of literature about that at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>courthouse,</v>

2204
01:36:40.330 --> 01:36:41.070
<v Speaker 3>you'll get arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They won't let you say it,</v>

2205
01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.590
<v Speaker 3>but it's still the law jury </v>
<v Speaker 3>nullification.</v>

2206
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:46.080
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've actually been in one case where</v>

2207
01:36:46.081 --> 01:36:51.081
<v Speaker 3>I did this as a juror that in fact if </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm ever on any kind of a pot case,</v>

2208
01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:52.770
<v Speaker 3>unless there was violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2209
01:36:52.771 --> 01:36:57.771
<v Speaker 3>that'll look different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it's just a simple possession </v>

2210
01:36:57.771 --> 01:36:57.990
<v Speaker 3>case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what the facts are and what</v>

2211
01:36:57.991 --> 01:37:02.991
<v Speaker 3>the judge says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can still say not guilty and there </v>

2212
01:37:02.991 --> 01:37:02.991
<v Speaker 3>is nothing that can be done about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2213
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:06.000
<v Speaker 3>And people need to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a big jury nullification,</v>

2214
01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:08.210
<v Speaker 3>a movement on the web you can find out </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2215
01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:11.130
<v Speaker 3>But it's hard to get your head around </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

2216
01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.190
<v Speaker 3>people hear the judge's instruction and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

2217
01:37:13.191 --> 01:37:14.280
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to find them guilty.</v>

2218
01:37:14.490 --> 01:37:14.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh you don't?</v>

2219
01:37:16.050 --> 01:37:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should all be legal.</v>

2220
01:37:18.570 --> 01:37:21.810
<v Speaker 1>It's really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should hire people to study it.</v>

2221
01:37:22.050 --> 01:37:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Use the government funds that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally spend on law enforcement.</v>

2222
01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Use those in a better way to hire people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to study what are the actual effects of </v>

2223
01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:36.411
<v Speaker 1>this stuff and inform people not by </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis of your prejudice in one way or </v>

2224
01:37:37.531 --> 01:37:39.900
<v Speaker 1>another or what your biased opinion </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be one way,</v>

2225
01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:42.030
<v Speaker 1>but the actual facts like here's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts.</v>

2226
01:37:42.210 --> 01:37:47.210
<v Speaker 1>It might fuck up your memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like when you get high messes </v>

2227
01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:48.270
<v Speaker 1>with your short term memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might get tongue tied,</v>

2228
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:50.300
<v Speaker 1>might get locked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you know how to do here,</v>

2229
01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:52.770
<v Speaker 1>here's the negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the current smoking.</v>

2230
01:37:52.771 --> 01:37:57.771
<v Speaker 1>Something in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not the best thing for eating </v>

2231
01:37:57.771 --> 01:37:57.771
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might freak the fuck out.</v>

2232
01:37:57.771 --> 01:37:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Jump off a building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean eating is a little scary.</v>

2233
01:37:59.521 --> 01:38:01.080
<v Speaker 1>You could have some nightmares.</v>

2234
01:38:01.110 --> 01:38:02.790
<v Speaker 1>You have to know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show people what it is.</v>

2235
01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaporizer,</v>

2236
01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:05.660
<v Speaker 1>probably a really good move as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>health wise,</v>

2237
01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:07.800
<v Speaker 1>probably the safest bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what happens,</v>

2238
01:38:07.890 --> 01:38:12.890
<v Speaker 1>here's what a good dose is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what happens when you have half </v>

2239
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:12.890
<v Speaker 1>that dose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what happens.</v>

2240
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:13.860
<v Speaker 1>If you have a quarter of that dose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock yourself out,</v>

2241
01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:16.080
<v Speaker 1>do what you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one's going to die and that would</v>

2242
01:38:16.081 --> 01:38:20.610
<v Speaker 1>be that simple and then start taxing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit out of it and my goodness,</v>

2243
01:38:20.611 --> 01:38:23.220
<v Speaker 1>would we have money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wouLd have money for everything if we</v>

2244
01:38:23.221 --> 01:38:26.280
<v Speaker 1>started making marijuana legal and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a high tax shit.</v>

2245
01:38:26.281 --> 01:38:31.281
<v Speaker 1>Let's make the tax 10 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 percent in Colorado in denver or </v>

2246
01:38:31.281 --> 01:38:31.290
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Colorado.</v>

2247
01:38:31.291 --> 01:38:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Colorado is always on the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're always ahead of everybody there.</v>

2248
01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:39.680
<v Speaker 1>They're animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're living up there with bears and </v>

2249
01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:39.680
<v Speaker 1>shit at that altitude.</v>

2250
01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:40.680
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the oppression of which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is awesome.</v>

2251
01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:44.070
<v Speaker 1>That's just an awesome state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says all around awesome.</v>

2252
01:38:44.071 --> 01:38:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Colorado's one of my all time favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>

2253
01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:51.230
<v Speaker 1>You lived there for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That 25 percent a smart move because I </v>

2254
01:38:51.230 --> 01:38:54.681
<v Speaker 1>don't mind paying if I have to pay four </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks for a joint or whatever it is and </v>

2255
01:38:54.681 --> 01:38:57.861
<v Speaker 1>I'm paying a dollar know I don't mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's probably gonna be less </v>

2256
01:38:57.861 --> 01:39:00.930
<v Speaker 1>expensive than the black market and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be fine.</v>

2257
01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Like look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana's not that expensive.</v>

2258
01:39:03.091 --> 01:39:06.090
<v Speaker 1>When you think about what alcohol costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to a bar and try to have a few</v>

2259
01:39:06.091 --> 01:39:08.960
<v Speaker 1>drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look if you grow your own cheapest,</v>

2260
01:39:08.970 --> 01:39:10.710
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you buy it,</v>

2261
01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:13.560
<v Speaker 1>it's really not that expensive for how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much you use.</v>

2262
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:18.830
<v Speaker 3>You use a vaporizer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get about three or four to one </v>

2263
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.830
<v Speaker 3>on thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2264
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ANd look in comparison to so many other </v>

2265
01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:23.590
<v Speaker 1>things that are really expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of silly to talk about it.</v>

2266
01:39:23.591 --> 01:39:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's now,</v>

2267
01:39:24.801 --> 01:39:26.750
<v Speaker 1>whIle it's fairly illegal,</v>

2268
01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:32.040
<v Speaker 3>no pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see that the war on drugs is </v>

2269
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:32.040
<v Speaker 3>making money off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psychedelics?</v>

2270
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.610
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because they're afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might start your thinking,</v>

2271
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:34.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>

2272
01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:36.490
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used mgma,</v>

2273
01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:41.820
<v Speaker 3>I was an irish catholic republican </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyer and afterwards I was still irish</v>

2274
01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:46.130
<v Speaker 1>and everything else went away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2275
01:39:46.131 --> 01:39:48.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long did that transition take?</v>

2276
01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Was it from the first hit you took?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You knew something was up.</v>

2277
01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:56.680
<v Speaker 3>I think it took from the night that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>ingested it until the next morning </v>

2278
01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:59.900
<v Speaker 3>sometime and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden I realized a whole.</v>

2279
01:39:59.930 --> 01:40:03.380
<v Speaker 3>I just had a real awakening and I felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I did when I was a young boy,</v>

2280
01:40:03.381 --> 01:40:04.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've had,</v>

2281
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:10.270
<v Speaker 3>I've helped a lot of people on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>first trips and almost invariably they </v>

2282
01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:10.270
<v Speaker 3>say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2283
01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:14.741
<v Speaker 3>I felt like this before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you don't go crazy or anything </v>

2284
01:40:14.741 --> 01:40:16.570
<v Speaker 3>and it's really not a psychedelic and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you,</v>

2285
01:40:16.630 --> 01:40:19.340
<v Speaker 3>it's a gentle way to get in and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>good for therapy.</v>

2286
01:40:19.341 --> 01:40:20.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>michael and annie,</v>

2287
01:40:20.661 --> 01:40:21.860
<v Speaker 3>mid offer in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2288
01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:26.920
<v Speaker 3>in South Carolina are now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think entering the second phase of an </v>

2289
01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:26.920
<v Speaker 3>mdm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a test,</v>

2290
01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.110
<v Speaker 3>but he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first phase one was uh,</v>

2291
01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:30.000
<v Speaker 3>treating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2292
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:33.180
<v Speaker 3>rape victims with serious ptsd and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a,</v>

2293
01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:36.250
<v Speaker 3>an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an amazing amount of recovery.</v>

2294
01:40:36.250 --> 01:40:41.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm actual recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One woman hadn't left the house in 15 </v>

2295
01:40:41.250 --> 01:40:42.200
<v Speaker 3>years and now she's got a job and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think something like that.</v>

2296
01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:47.560
<v Speaker 3>But the pentagon has now approved this </v>
<v Speaker 3>study for post dramatic stress disorder </v>

2297
01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:48.140
<v Speaker 3>and they're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2298
01:40:48.170 --> 01:40:52.010
<v Speaker 3>some other studies with the pentagon </v>
<v Speaker 3>because ptsd is such a huge problem.</v>

2299
01:40:52.370 --> 01:40:55.930
<v Speaker 3>And mtma see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's why the drug coMpanies don't want</v>

2300
01:40:55.931 --> 01:40:58.000
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What michael and annie do,</v>

2301
01:40:58.001 --> 01:41:03.001
<v Speaker 3>I think they only do maybe two sessions </v>
<v Speaker 3>with mtma is psychol,</v>

2302
01:41:03.610 --> 01:41:08.110
<v Speaker 3>psychiatrist assisted and guided and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>psyChoanalysts or um,</v>

2303
01:41:08.370 --> 01:41:10.690
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not that high a level,</v>

2304
01:41:10.691 --> 01:41:13.450
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of counseling goes on with</v>

2305
01:41:13.451 --> 01:41:18.451
<v Speaker 3>it and see when you take him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dmh lowers so many barriers that you and</v>

2306
01:41:18.521 --> 01:41:22.550
<v Speaker 3>your therapist can really talk honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have had like spec.</v>

2307
01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:25.150
<v Speaker 3>The phase one study is just to prove it </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't kill somebody.</v>

2308
01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.850
<v Speaker 3>And still they had some amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>recoveries.</v>

2309
01:41:27.850 --> 01:41:32.850
<v Speaker 3>And now phase two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to do the extended therapy </v>

2310
01:41:32.850 --> 01:41:32.850
<v Speaker 3>with the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But see,</v>

2311
01:41:32.850 --> 01:41:36.250
<v Speaker 3>the drug companies don't like it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you only need one or two pills ever.</v>

2312
01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:38.500
<v Speaker 3>Then you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't keep taking it.</v>

2313
01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:40.660
<v Speaker 3>They want things that they can keep you </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking.</v>

2314
01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:46.200
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because it seems like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be able to make some money </v>

2315
01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:46.560
<v Speaker 3>using that stuff if you get an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2316
01:41:46.570 --> 01:41:47.980
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be abuse with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2317
01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:50.910
<v Speaker 3>there's abuse with mdm may for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ravers,</v>

2318
01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:55.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are dying because they get </v>

2319
01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:55.960
<v Speaker 3>dehydrated in dance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most of us,</v>

2320
01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:57.160
<v Speaker 3>because it's adulterated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2321
01:41:57.161 --> 01:42:00.220
<v Speaker 3>it's not pure mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what do they cut it with?</v>

2322
01:42:00.970 --> 01:42:01.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2323
01:42:02.230 --> 01:42:06.370
<v Speaker 3>I think all kinds of things and it could</v>
<v Speaker 3>just be impurities in their processes.</v>

2324
01:42:06.371 --> 01:42:08.460
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably some sort of,</v>

2325
01:42:08.461 --> 01:42:08.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2326
01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:13.800
<v Speaker 3>it is an infection and so they probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>cut it with a little speed so you can </v>

2327
01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:13.800
<v Speaker 3>feel something.</v>

2328
01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:14.200
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2329
01:42:14.201 --> 01:42:16.970
<v Speaker 3>originally back in the early days when </v>
<v Speaker 3>we were getting it,</v>

2330
01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:19.570
<v Speaker 3>it was either in cap form and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in powder,</v>

2331
01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:22.270
<v Speaker 3>but it was pure mtma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course we,</v>

2332
01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:25.060
<v Speaker 3>we knew the source and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But today,</v>

2333
01:42:25.061 --> 01:42:30.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to be a group called dance </v>

2334
01:42:30.061 --> 01:42:30.061
<v Speaker 3>safe and I don't think they're active </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore because they were the government</v>

2335
01:42:30.061 --> 01:42:32.890
<v Speaker 3>shutting them down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were doing free drug testing at</v>

2336
01:42:32.891 --> 01:42:34.020
<v Speaker 3>raves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2337
01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:36.610
<v Speaker 3>to tell you if you have pure mdm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut that down,</v>

2338
01:42:36.611 --> 01:42:41.611
<v Speaker 3>that's so rude and short sighted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thought it was encouraging drug </v>

2339
01:42:41.611 --> 01:42:42.520
<v Speaker 3>use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but instead it was saving lives,</v>

2340
01:42:42.521 --> 01:42:43.770
<v Speaker 3>saving lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could you,</v>

2341
01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:48.820
<v Speaker 3>that's such an illogical stance to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>how you should never put something in </v>

2342
01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:49.930
<v Speaker 3>your mouth that you got from somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know.</v>

2343
01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:51.490
<v Speaker 3>That's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good thing to say,</v>

2344
01:42:51.491 --> 01:42:53.890
<v Speaker 3>except if you want to put your penis in </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's mouth,</v>

2345
01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:55.480
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you barely know them.</v>

2346
01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:57.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never had anybody any stranger than</v>

2347
01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:03.780
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always gotten to know him at least </v>

2348
01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:06.661
<v Speaker 3>for a half hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that it's going to </v>

2349
01:43:06.661 --> 01:43:06.661
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It always leaves that day.</v>

2350
01:43:06.661 --> 01:43:06.661
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2351
01:43:06.661 --> 01:43:08.800
<v Speaker 3>I'll go along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're on ecstasy.</v>

2352
01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you know in dallas,</v>

2353
01:43:12.970 --> 01:43:14.320
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of our customers,</v>

2354
01:43:14.321 --> 01:43:19.321
<v Speaker 3>there were some swinger clubs in dallas </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we would sell it to these cluBs </v>

2355
01:43:19.321 --> 01:43:23.880
<v Speaker 3>because you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have an erection for hours on </v>

2356
01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:26.471
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't come and so the swinger's </v>

2357
01:43:26.471 --> 01:43:26.471
<v Speaker 3>clubs loved it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people,</v>

2358
01:43:26.471 --> 01:43:28.900
<v Speaker 3>I come out here to the west coast and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the word is,</v>

2359
01:43:28.930 --> 01:43:33.930
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have a third day let </v>

2360
01:43:33.930 --> 01:43:35.560
<v Speaker 3>down hangover and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can't have sex on it.</v>

2361
01:43:35.561 --> 01:43:38.860
<v Speaker 3>And I thought wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a completely different story.</v>

2362
01:43:38.861 --> 01:43:42.070
<v Speaker 3>and everybody bought into it out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in dallas it was a totally different</v>

2363
01:43:42.071 --> 01:43:44.170
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody was having that third second,</v>

2364
01:43:44.171 --> 01:43:49.171
<v Speaker 3>third day blahs or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in dallas you were getting pure mtma </v>

2365
01:43:49.171 --> 01:43:49.660
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here they're getting this.</v>

2366
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if places getting it</v>

2367
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:53.890
<v Speaker 4>pure unless you really doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2368
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:55.410
<v Speaker 4>know the chemist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was a veteran.</v>

2369
01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:56.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

2370
01:43:56.471 --> 01:43:59.480
<v Speaker 4>it was definitely pure and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was legal at that time.</v>

2371
01:43:59.481 --> 01:44:01.070
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason to cut it and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2372
01:44:01.071 --> 01:44:06.071
<v Speaker 4>it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember when five meo dmt was </v>

2373
01:44:06.071 --> 01:44:09.041
<v Speaker 4>legal and you could buy it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll buy like a coffee cup filled with </v>

2374
01:44:09.050 --> 01:44:12.860
<v Speaker 4>online and get the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like $30.</v>

2375
01:44:12.861 --> 01:44:15.200
<v Speaker 4>I know some people that have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I heard.</v>

2376
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:16.010
<v Speaker 4>I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2377
01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:18.980
<v Speaker 4>I heard you know things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

2378
01:44:18.981 --> 01:44:23.981
<v Speaker 4>What was still legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like salvia is legal in a lot of places </v>

2379
01:44:23.981 --> 01:44:23.981
<v Speaker 4>still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2380
01:44:23.981 --> 01:44:26.090
<v Speaker 4>And then they have this Bath salts issue</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really nutty.</v>

2381
01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:28.730
<v Speaker 4>They'd take a compound like crystal man </v>
<v Speaker 4>fade.</v>

2382
01:44:28.731 --> 01:44:31.910
<v Speaker 4>They alter it so it becomes a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>new compound.</v>

2383
01:44:31.911 --> 01:44:36.911
<v Speaker 4>It's not categorized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they say not for human consumption </v>

2384
01:44:36.911 --> 01:44:40.871
<v Speaker 4>so that it's bath salts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everybody knows you're supposed to </v>

2385
01:44:40.871 --> 01:44:43.631
<v Speaker 4>smoke it because it's like crack or meth</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever the hell it is and they </v>

2386
01:44:43.631 --> 01:44:43.631
<v Speaker 4>can't do anything about it.</v>

2387
01:44:43.631 --> 01:44:46.160
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that there's been something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a.</v>

2388
01:44:46.670 --> 01:44:48.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to use the number because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have it in front of me,</v>

2389
01:44:48.651 --> 01:44:53.651
<v Speaker 4>but close to maybe 70 new compounds that</v>
<v Speaker 4>have been introduced in england this </v>

2390
01:44:53.651 --> 01:44:54.440
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

2391
01:44:54.441 --> 01:44:57.960
<v Speaker 4>england knows how to party well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Worldwide is probably higher.</v>

2392
01:44:57.961 --> 01:45:00.730
<v Speaker 4>It might only be 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might have been 70 last year in 2010,</v>

2393

<v Speaker 4>I love england.</v>

2407
01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:29.540
<v Speaker 4>I liked the people there as audience </v>
<v Speaker 4>members.</v>

2408
01:45:29.541 --> 01:45:34.541
<v Speaker 4>They're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are some of the best audience members </v>

2409
01:45:34.541 --> 01:45:34.541
<v Speaker 4>you ever get?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're polite.</v>

<v Speaker 4>TheY listened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get things.</v>

2411
01:45:34.581 --> 01:45:35.900
<v Speaker 4>They understand where you're going and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

2412
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:36.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know they,</v>

2413
01:45:36.871 --> 01:45:37.640
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're sharp.</v>

2414
01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:38.990
<v Speaker 4>They know what's goIng on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2415
01:45:38.991 --> 01:45:41.000
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is.</v>

2416
01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:41.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it.</v>

2417
01:45:41.690 --> 01:45:44.240
<v Speaker 4>Are they more educated in the school </v>
<v Speaker 4>systems?</v>

2418
01:45:44.241 --> 01:45:48.140
<v Speaker 4>Definitely better that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even not the Private schools,</v>

2419
01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:51.980
<v Speaker 4>but public schools or even better than.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one thing that irks me,</v>

2420
01:45:51.981 --> 01:45:56.981
<v Speaker 4>the most advanced society is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's such a minimal amount of </v>

2421
01:45:57.501 --> 01:46:00.300
<v Speaker 4>finances that are dedicated towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>school systems.</v>

2422
01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:05.860
<v Speaker 4>The minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're always trying to cut the school </v>

2423
01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:05.860
<v Speaker 4>budget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was cutting things.</v>

2424
01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:08.780
<v Speaker 4>They should be pouring money into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>public education system,</v>

2425
01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:13.840
<v Speaker 4>pouring money into community centers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pouring money into anything that </v>

2426
01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:17.771
<v Speaker 4>benefits young people in there cutting </v>
<v Speaker 4>and things like music and art and the </v>

2427
01:46:17.771 --> 01:46:19.580
<v Speaker 4>grand sports cutting wrestling and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of places,</v>

2428
01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:20.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

2429
01:46:20.570 --> 01:46:25.570
<v Speaker 4>It makes me sick because people need </v>
<v Speaker 4>these things and it's greedy old people </v>

2430
01:46:25.611 --> 01:46:27.520
<v Speaker 4>that had these things in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a younger.</v>

2431
01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:30.500
<v Speaker 4>They're designed deciding that these are</v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that should be cut.</v>

2432
01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:34.190
<v Speaker 4>Those things should be uncut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A bowl that should be like,</v>

2433
01:46:34.191 --> 01:46:35.570
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's your budget.</v>

2434
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:38.930
<v Speaker 4>You need to spend a $100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million dollars on the school systems.</v>

2435
01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:41.060
<v Speaker 4>After that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do whatever the fuck you want as</v>

2436
01:46:41.061 --> 01:46:42.880
<v Speaker 4>far as cleaning the streets up and doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that,</v>

2437
01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:48.100
<v Speaker 4>but number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to do this because this is </v>

2438
01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:48.100
<v Speaker 4>what's going to take care of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll go along with that.</v>

2439
01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 4>This is what's going to make the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that</v>

2440
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.940
<v Speaker 1>are babies become cool adults have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get that right.</v>

2441
01:46:54.150 --> 01:46:56.610
<v Speaker 1>The whole society scrapped the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>

2442
01:46:56.650 --> 01:46:59.970
<v Speaker 1>gone a whole generation that has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure it out for themselves and there's</v>

2443
01:46:59.971 --> 01:47:04.971
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that attitude of pull yourself up by </v>

2444
01:47:04.971 --> 01:47:04.971
<v Speaker 1>your own bootstraps and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured it out.</v>

2445
01:47:04.971 --> 01:47:06.570
<v Speaker 1>You should figure it out too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like man,</v>

2446
01:47:06.571 --> 01:47:11.571
<v Speaker 1>if you did figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should know how god damn hard </v>

2447
01:47:11.571 --> 01:47:13.080
<v Speaker 1>it is to figure out and you should also </v>
<v Speaker 1>know this is not the only way to do it.</v>

2448
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:18.350
<v Speaker 1>This is a silly way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To have unmotivated teachers that get </v>

2449
01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:18.510
<v Speaker 1>paid $25,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

2450
01:47:18.511 --> 01:47:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you feed yourself?</v>

2451
01:47:20.041 --> 01:47:25.041
<v Speaker 1>How can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you expect these people who </v>

2452
01:47:25.041 --> 01:47:27.321
<v Speaker 1>you're entrusting to educate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>children to be motivated when they can </v>

2453
01:47:27.321 --> 01:47:27.321
<v Speaker 1>barely eat?</v>

2454
01:47:27.321 --> 01:47:27.680
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2455
01:47:27.681 --> 01:47:32.681
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of our best teachers are just so </v>

2456
01:47:32.681 --> 01:47:33.090
<v Speaker 3>amazing because they're working in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inner city voluntarily.</v>

2457
01:47:33.091 --> 01:47:35.240
<v Speaker 3>They could go other places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them junior college and all,</v>

2458
01:47:35.241 --> 01:47:40.241
<v Speaker 3>but they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have one friend who worked in the </v>

2459
01:47:40.241 --> 01:47:40.380
<v Speaker 3>inner city in san francisco for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another one here in la,</v>

2460
01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:43.010
<v Speaker 3>and they were amazing men and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2461
01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:44.820
<v Speaker 3>they did it because they wanted to help </v>
<v Speaker 3>these kids.</v>

2462
01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a beautiful notion and it's </v>

2463
01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:51.811
<v Speaker 1>beautiful when you meet people like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's beautiful that they still </v>

2464
01:47:51.811 --> 01:47:54.271
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just sad that corporations have </v>

2465
01:47:54.271 --> 01:47:58.231
<v Speaker 1>controlled the political process to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where when a person gets into </v>

2466
01:47:58.231 --> 01:47:59.050
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a person becomes president,</v>

2467
01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:03.070
<v Speaker 1>they they need never have a chance to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real overhaul.</v>

2468
01:48:03.250 --> 01:48:06.070
<v Speaker 1>you never really are like the one person</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's in control.</v>

2469
01:48:06.071 --> 01:48:09.700
<v Speaker 1>You have a million people that you owe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that got you into that position that you</v>

2470
01:48:09.701 --> 01:48:14.701
<v Speaker 1>have to pay back or do their bidding or </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet their interests before you do </v>

2471
01:48:15.341 --> 01:48:16.080
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2472
01:48:16.210 --> 01:48:17.930
<v Speaker 1>and so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you know.</v>

2473
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:19.930
<v Speaker 1>That's where all these different laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from.</v>

2474
01:48:19.931 --> 01:48:22.270
<v Speaker 1>They're so confusing and don't make any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to people.</v>

2475
01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:26.470
<v Speaker 1>We've got to figure out a way to govern </v>
<v Speaker 1>people by actually governing people.</v>

2476
01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:29.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like we accept that there's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be so much,</v>

2477
01:48:30.730 --> 01:48:35.730
<v Speaker 1>so much bullshit and so much corruption </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so much thievery and so many slanted</v>

2478
01:48:36.431 --> 01:48:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Ideas.</v>

2479
01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:42.120
<v Speaker 1>We just accept that there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of that because it's </v>

2480
01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:42.880
<v Speaker 1>always been that way and if you looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that,</v>

2481
01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:44.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked at a lot of the decisions that</v>

2482
01:48:44.861 --> 01:48:47.590
<v Speaker 1>get made at the highest levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and like who they benefit.</v>

2483
01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:50.110
<v Speaker 1>You would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could never happen.</v>

2484
01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:53.470
<v Speaker 1>This could never happen if we all had </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right attitude.</v>

2485
01:48:53.650 --> 01:48:55.840
<v Speaker 1>This caN only happen when money gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

2486
01:48:55.841 --> 01:49:00.841
<v Speaker 1>This can only happen when someone puts </v>
<v Speaker 1>money ahead of humanity and that's like </v>

2487
01:49:00.841 --> 01:49:05.430
<v Speaker 1>the real core part of our society that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up his education.</v>

2488
01:49:06.250 --> 01:49:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just in the small sense of teaching </v>

2489
01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:11.250
<v Speaker 1>people that don't know how to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to read,</v>

2490
01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:13.990
<v Speaker 1>but teaching people who are brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to think about life.</v>

2491
01:49:14.050 --> 01:49:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just how to count and how to,</v>

2492
01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:21.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculate the dates of fossils that you </v>

2493
01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:24.991
<v Speaker 1>find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how to think about humans and how </v>

2494
01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:28.081
<v Speaker 1>they engage with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to look at this temporary existence </v>

2495
01:49:28.081 --> 01:49:28.690
<v Speaker 1>in a correct way.</v>

2496
01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:29.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2497
01:49:29.201 --> 01:49:33.370
<v Speaker 3>corporations set a lot of the agenda for</v>
<v Speaker 3>schools as far as the curriculum,</v>

2498
01:49:33.371 --> 01:49:37.870
<v Speaker 3>things like that because they're looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to to get passive little cubicle workers</v>

2499
01:49:37.871 --> 01:49:41.370
<v Speaker 3>and see that was one of the lessons that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the power elite learned to the sixties.</v>

2500
01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:46.380
<v Speaker 3>So it was all these young kids got </v>
<v Speaker 3>educated because your parents got </v>

2501
01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:47.490
<v Speaker 3>educated from the gi bill and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2502
01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:48.030
<v Speaker 3>now</v>

2503
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:53.040
<v Speaker 4>we're educating these kids and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting too smart for Us and I think </v>

2504
01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:53.230
<v Speaker 4>they intentionally been dumbing down the</v>
<v Speaker 4>school system.</v>

2505
01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:55.500
<v Speaker 4>How do they do that though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just by underfunding.</v>

2506
01:49:55.770 --> 01:49:57.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at Texas a,</v>

2507
01:49:57.290 --> 01:50:02.290
<v Speaker 4>the school books in Texas are teaching </v>
<v Speaker 4>creationism and they're trying to get </v>

2508
01:50:02.290 --> 01:50:02.290
<v Speaker 4>evolution out of the textbooks </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely.</v>

2509
01:50:02.290 --> 01:50:07.170
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you don't think that that's because </v>

2510
01:50:07.170 --> 01:50:07.170
<v Speaker 4>they're dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2511
01:50:07.170 --> 01:50:07.170
<v Speaker 4>They're just there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their religion.</v>

2512
01:50:07.170 --> 01:50:07.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

2513
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:10.480
<v Speaker 4>not that they're dumb dumbs down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people though,</v>

2514
01:50:10.590 --> 01:50:11.980
<v Speaker 4>but I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me rephrase that.</v>

2515
01:50:11.981 --> 01:50:16.981
<v Speaker 4>You don't think that they're doing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're trying to make people </v>

2516
01:50:16.981 --> 01:50:19.561
<v Speaker 4>dumb there are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are people using those people to </v>

2517
01:50:19.561 --> 01:50:19.561
<v Speaker 4>do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

2518
01:50:19.561 --> 01:50:23.340
<v Speaker 4>I think the corporations want people who</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't really thinking out of the box </v>

2519
01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:26.791
<v Speaker 4>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can get those from the elite </v>

2520
01:50:26.791 --> 01:50:28.711
<v Speaker 4>private schools,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but isn't there like always going to be </v>

2521
01:50:28.711 --> 01:50:31.621
<v Speaker 4>like a large base of fundamental people </v>
<v Speaker 4>in places like Texas that they could </v>

2522
01:50:31.621 --> 01:50:32.750
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they could capitalize on by,</v>

2523
01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:37.940
<v Speaker 4>by leaning in as far as like their </v>
<v Speaker 4>decision making towards them because </v>

2524
01:50:38.651 --> 01:50:40.840
<v Speaker 4>they know that that's going to aid them </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get into office.</v>

2525
01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:41.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeaH,</v>

2526
01:50:41.951 --> 01:50:44.260
<v Speaker 4>and of course I'm pretty cynical about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2527
01:50:44.261 --> 01:50:47.470
<v Speaker 4>I think the voting is pretty rigged </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyhow with electronic voting,</v>

2528
01:50:47.471 --> 01:50:51.250
<v Speaker 4>but a while there certainly has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>shown in textually sexist.</v>

2529
01:50:51.251 --> 01:50:52.540
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I practice law in Texas,</v>

2530
01:50:52.541 --> 01:50:56.480
<v Speaker 4>lived there for awhile and it's a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bible time kind.</v>

2531
01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:58.020
<v Speaker 4>A very fundamentalist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

2532
01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:04.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was doing some jokes last time I was </v>

2533
01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:04.100
<v Speaker 4>in houston,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friends.</v>

2534
01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:04.810
<v Speaker 4>So this girl walked to the bathroom and </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

2535
01:51:04.811 --> 01:51:07.340
<v Speaker 4>if he talks about jesus one more time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are out of here,</v>

2536
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:14.310
<v Speaker 4>barely talked about jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then that be throw out a title of a </v>

2537
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.510
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>caesar's messiah,</v>

2538
01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:18.580
<v Speaker 4>a book that's out that talks about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>jesus jesus actually being fictional.</v>

2539
01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:20.080
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty interesting book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2540
01:51:20.081 --> 01:51:22.900
<v Speaker 4>I read a thing about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just like something to drink.</v>

2541
01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:23.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got it here.</v>

2542
01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:28.800
<v Speaker 4>You got some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want some coffee to keep me awake </v>

2543
01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:28.800
<v Speaker 4>all day?</v>

2544
01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:28.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how dare you.</v>

2545
01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:29.440
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You tolD me already.</v>

2546
01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:31.040
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2547
01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:31.610
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2548
01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:36.620
<v Speaker 4>I read a summary of that online or they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were talking about this new study that </v>

2549
01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:40.741
<v Speaker 4>said that jesus may have been created </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they found new documents that </v>

2550
01:51:40.741 --> 01:51:43.540
<v Speaker 4>suggest he was either way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>

2551
01:51:43.690 --> 01:51:46.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if jesus was real or if </v>
<v Speaker 4>jesus was artificial.</v>

2552
01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:52.020
<v Speaker 4>My point is it doesn't make sense that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he died and came back to life three days</v>

2553
01:51:52.031 --> 01:51:55.270
<v Speaker 4>later and as long as you believe that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a problem,</v>

2554
01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:58.450
<v Speaker 4>we've got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a disconnect in communication.</v>

2555
01:51:58.750 --> 01:52:01.750
<v Speaker 4>We have a why would that be real?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have that.</v>

2556
01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:03.100
<v Speaker 4>We have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2557
01:52:03.101 --> 01:52:05.080
<v Speaker 4>What happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He turned water into wine.</v>

2558
01:52:05.230 --> 01:52:08.110
<v Speaker 4>Were you there when this happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know how dumb people are?</v>

2559
01:52:08.111 --> 01:52:13.111
<v Speaker 4>Do you know how much people lie you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you imagine what that must've been </v>

2560
01:52:13.111 --> 01:52:16.381
<v Speaker 4>like back when people couldn't even </v>
<v Speaker 4>write shit down and it was 50 years </v>

2561
01:52:16.381 --> 01:52:18.130
<v Speaker 4>after the so called event that somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote it down for the first time?</v>

2562
01:52:18.131 --> 01:52:20.170
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the way later than that,</v>

2563
01:52:20.171 --> 01:52:25.171
<v Speaker 4>that constantine and a bunch of bishops </v>
<v Speaker 4>decided what goes in the book and what </v>

2564
01:52:25.171 --> 01:52:25.171
<v Speaker 4>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2565
01:52:25.290 --> 01:52:26.830
<v Speaker 4>You know when they wrote the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>testament,</v>

2566
01:52:26.831 --> 01:52:28.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy jesus.</v>

2567
01:52:28.191 --> 01:52:33.191
<v Speaker 4>Like they left stuff out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They added stuff that there's so many </v>

2568
01:52:33.191 --> 01:52:34.660
<v Speaker 4>different people's fingerprints on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just nonsense,</v>

2569
01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:37.060
<v Speaker 4>but it's about control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't control the people,</v>

2570
01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:42.240
<v Speaker 4>but the idea also that this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely not saying that there's no </v>

2571
01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:46.261
<v Speaker 4>god if you've done psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you've realized after a certain </v>

2572
01:52:46.261 --> 01:52:46.280
<v Speaker 4>amount of those</v>

2573
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:51.460
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote breakthrough experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you realize that you have no </v>

2574
01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:52.910
<v Speaker 1>idea what's going on in this other </v>
<v Speaker 1>realm.</v>

2575
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Whatever these other realms are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're individually different,</v>

2576
01:52:57.111 --> 01:53:02.111
<v Speaker 1>whether they're all connected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're just frequencies on a </v>

2577
01:53:02.111 --> 01:53:02.111
<v Speaker 1>dial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's five meo,</v>

2578
01:53:02.111 --> 01:53:04.060
<v Speaker 1>whether it's dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's psilocybin,</v>

2579
01:53:04.130 --> 01:53:09.130
<v Speaker 1>whatever these realms are that you enter</v>
<v Speaker 1>into there is so fantastic and special </v>

2580
01:53:09.741 --> 01:53:14.741
<v Speaker 1>and strange and beyond description that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of god does not seem nearly as </v>

2581
01:53:16.670 --> 01:53:18.380
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous once you've had them.</v>

2582
01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:23.520
<v Speaker 3>I there's a video of me out there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>interview they did where I told the </v>

2583
01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:27.070
<v Speaker 3>stories about x hitting the street in </v>
<v Speaker 3>dallas and I mentioned about the fact </v>

2584
01:53:27.070 --> 01:53:29.240
<v Speaker 3>that when I got to two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one point in my life in Florida,</v>

2585
01:53:29.570 --> 01:53:32.510
<v Speaker 3>I decided I was going to be an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really wanted to get rid of everything</v>

2586
01:53:32.810 --> 01:53:35.180
<v Speaker 3>and so I was trying really hard to be an</v>
<v Speaker 3>atheist,</v>

2587
01:53:35.181 --> 01:53:38.750
<v Speaker 3>but I had this friend lived on the edge </v>
<v Speaker 3>of town with a farm and he get mushrooms</v>

2588
01:53:38.751 --> 01:53:42.350
<v Speaker 3>from the cow patties in his colleague </v>
<v Speaker 3>halyard and bring them into me.</v>

2589
01:53:42.351 --> 01:53:47.351
<v Speaker 3>So I'd be an atheist during the week and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'd eat these mushrooms and </v>

2590
01:53:47.351 --> 01:53:51.101
<v Speaker 3>saturday you can't be an atheist with </v>
<v Speaker 3>five grams of dried mushrooms in your </v>

2591
01:53:51.101 --> 01:53:51.101
<v Speaker 3>stomach.</v>

2592
01:53:51.101 --> 01:53:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be sure.</v>

2593
01:53:52.270 --> 01:53:57.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the real problem is that you </v>

2594
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:58.711
<v Speaker 1>can't be sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my problem with religion is that </v>

2595
01:53:58.711 --> 01:53:59.710
<v Speaker 1>when people are sure about something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've never seen,</v>

2596
01:53:59.711 --> 01:54:01.990
<v Speaker 1>never experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sure because you read it.</v>

2597
01:54:02.260 --> 01:54:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because someone told it to you?</v>

2598
01:54:04.361 --> 01:54:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's your tradition,</v>

2599
01:54:06.190 --> 01:54:08.260
<v Speaker 1>like you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me why.</v>

2600
01:54:08.261 --> 01:54:13.261
<v Speaker 1>You're sure if you're sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's some demonstratable </v>

2601
01:54:13.261 --> 01:54:13.261
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2602
01:54:13.261 --> 01:54:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're sure just because you're </v>

2603
01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:19.171
<v Speaker 1>sure that god wants you to throw rocks </v>
<v Speaker 1>at homosexuals because you saw that </v>

2604
01:54:19.171 --> 01:54:19.171
<v Speaker 1>written down somewhere like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2605
01:54:19.171 --> 01:54:21.790
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would he tell us now why?</v>

2606
01:54:21.791 --> 01:54:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come god only tells one person like,</v>

2607
01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:29.060
<v Speaker 1>doesn't god know that game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The game of telephone doesn't know that </v>

2608
01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:29.200
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must know that that games,</v>

2609
01:54:29.201 --> 01:54:31.150
<v Speaker 1>he made everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to know that game sucks.</v>

2610
01:54:31.330 --> 01:54:34.200
<v Speaker 1>So why would you tell one person like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few thousand years right now?</v>

2611
01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you tell us all the time</v>

2612
01:54:36.020 --> 01:54:37.760
<v Speaker 3>when someBody asked me if I believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>

2613
01:54:37.761 --> 01:54:38.690
<v Speaker 3>I just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2614
01:54:38.691 --> 01:54:43.691
<v Speaker 3>define what you mean by the word god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we really never get much past that </v>

2615
01:54:43.691 --> 01:54:45.410
<v Speaker 3>because people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few people say,</v>

2616
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:48.170
<v Speaker 3>old man with a long white beard sitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a throne.</v>

2617
01:54:48.230 --> 01:54:48.590
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2618
01:54:48.591 --> 01:54:49.400
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in that.</v>

2619
01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:51.060
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I differ from you.</v>

2620
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2621
01:54:52.351 --> 01:54:57.351
<v Speaker 1>Because of the shit I've seen on </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms or way weirder than a guy </v>

2622
01:54:57.351 --> 01:54:57.570
<v Speaker 1>living in the clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2623
01:54:57.571 --> 01:55:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I've seen tHings on dmt that made a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the clouds with a harp and a bunch of</v>

2624
01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:03.660
<v Speaker 1>people around him with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with bird wings.</v>

2625
01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:04.520
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't even.</v>

2626
01:55:04.850 --> 01:55:05.200
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2627
01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:08.210
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying I'm just,</v>

2628
01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:09.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the old,</v>

2629
01:55:09.141 --> 01:55:12.100
<v Speaker 3>the catholic image of the guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>throne with the white beard.</v>

2630
01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:17.360
<v Speaker 1>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why because life is so stupid </v>

2631
01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:21.201
<v Speaker 1>and contradictory and weird and humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>are so bizarre and so hypocritical and </v>

2632
01:55:21.841 --> 01:55:26.841
<v Speaker 1>so strange and self destructive in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ax collectively make no sense to the </v>

2633
01:55:26.841 --> 01:55:31.431
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet we all feel helpless in the </v>

2634
01:55:31.431 --> 01:55:33.420
<v Speaker 1>momentum of the united species and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

2635
01:55:33.421 --> 01:55:38.421
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the polluting the ocean of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking up of the ozone layer and </v>

2636
01:55:38.421 --> 01:55:42.320
<v Speaker 1>shit flying around in space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slamming into each other because we've </v>

2637
01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:42.320
<v Speaker 1>got so many things floating around above</v>
<v Speaker 1>our earth.</v>

2638
01:55:42.570 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 1>WHatever is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

2639
01:55:44.050 --> 01:55:48.510
<v Speaker 1>It's so bizarre and contradictory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy that it aLmost seems like the work</v>

2640
01:55:48.511 --> 01:55:51.720
<v Speaker 1>of a madman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It almost seems like the work of a god,</v>

2641
01:55:51.721 --> 01:55:56.250
<v Speaker 1>like just one crazy motherfucker that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to control this planet.</v>

2642
01:55:56.300 --> 01:55:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe acid trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just crazy asshoLe.</v>

2643
01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:01.200
<v Speaker 1>He's like anybody else that gets into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position of power.</v>

2644
01:56:01.201 --> 01:56:03.290
<v Speaker 1>He gets his fucking head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets bIg.</v>

2645
01:56:03.291 --> 01:56:05.310
<v Speaker 1>It gets crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He starts ordering people around,</v>

2646
01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:07.710
<v Speaker 1>started doing nutty shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you eat that apple,</v>

2647
01:56:07.711 --> 01:56:09.000
<v Speaker 1>everyone's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2648
01:56:09.001 --> 01:56:10.050
<v Speaker 1>I said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did it.</v>

2649
01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:15.080
<v Speaker 1>So over done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all of humanity forever has to </v>

2650
01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:15.080
<v Speaker 1>suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2651
01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2652
01:56:15.771 --> 01:56:16.840
<v Speaker 1>I said so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2653
01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:21.150
<v Speaker 1>and the only way to fix that is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta get a guy who his son to sacrifice</v>

2654
01:56:21.151 --> 01:56:23.040
<v Speaker 1>his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

2655
01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:25.480
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2656
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:28.210
<v Speaker 4>we get all wrapped up in the affairs of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>

2657
01:56:28.230 --> 01:56:33.230
<v Speaker 4>but you've had an intense dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wake up and the only last for a few </v>

2658
01:56:33.230 --> 01:56:34.990
<v Speaker 4>moments you can't hold on to some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these dreams.</v>

2659
01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:37.990
<v Speaker 4>I have a feeling that when we die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be just like that.</v>

2660
01:56:37.991 --> 01:56:38.830
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>god,</v>

2661
01:56:38.831 --> 01:56:39.360
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2662
01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:43.780
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I was on a planet earth or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something I can't remember.</v>

2663
01:56:44.050 --> 01:56:46.630
<v Speaker 4>And you don't remember a damn thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>about all this stuff we went through.</v>

2664
01:56:46.810 --> 01:56:48.150
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2665
01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.750
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's thoughts we don't know.</v>

2666
01:56:49.810 --> 01:56:54.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you live an infinite life that's </v>

2667
01:56:54.810 --> 01:56:56.791
<v Speaker 4>interconnected one life to another and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the reasons why you meet </v>

2668
01:56:56.791 --> 01:57:00.271
<v Speaker 4>someone and they're an old soul or you </v>
<v Speaker 4>meet someone and they're particularly </v>

2669
01:57:00.271 --> 01:57:00.271
<v Speaker 4>fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2670
01:57:00.271 --> 01:57:00.840
<v Speaker 4>why is this guy particularly fortunate?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2671
01:57:00.930 --> 01:57:05.930
<v Speaker 4>Why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are people drawn to them initially </v>

2672
01:57:05.930 --> 01:57:07.921
<v Speaker 4>from the get go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe this is things that they figured </v>

2673
01:57:07.921 --> 01:57:08.770
<v Speaker 4>out in past existences that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>calculating in this existence.</v>

2674
01:57:09.070 --> 01:57:12.190
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you have a certain amount of work </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can do in this existence,</v>

2675
01:57:12.191 --> 01:57:17.191
<v Speaker 4>but you're basically still riding on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>momentum of fucking and ian have </v>

2676
01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:21.180
<v Speaker 4>different lives that you've lived over </v>
<v Speaker 4>and over and over again.</v>

2677
01:57:21.190 --> 01:57:24.970
<v Speaker 4>One of the things we can do in this life</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I don't know or they're not,</v>

2678
01:57:24.971 --> 01:57:27.850
<v Speaker 4>we can do it in another life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as with a human body,</v>

2679
01:57:28.210 --> 01:57:32.590
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of physical pleasure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can experience and I think that part</v>

2680
01:57:32.591 --> 01:57:37.591
<v Speaker 4>of what we should be doing here is </v>
<v Speaker 4>having some physical pleasure and not </v>

2681
01:57:37.591 --> 01:57:38.550
<v Speaker 4>just getting into the spiritual world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like someone's starting a cult.</v>

2682
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:40.720
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know how you do it.</v>

2683
01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:46.500
<v Speaker 4>I know I used psychedelic people think </v>
<v Speaker 4>or a commune or maybe like a new,</v>

2684
01:57:47.741 --> 01:57:49.900
<v Speaker 4>a new situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now actually,</v>

2685
01:57:49.901 --> 01:57:52.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm assuming it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I seldom leave my k.</v>

2686
01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:55.210
<v Speaker 4>You seem like a very personable guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2687
01:57:55.211 --> 01:58:00.211
<v Speaker 4>I can be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I save it all up for a rare </v>

2688
01:58:00.211 --> 01:58:00.211
<v Speaker 4>occasion.</v>

2689
01:58:00.211 --> 01:58:02.750
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're personable in small doses that,</v>

2690
01:58:03.330 --> 01:58:04.300
<v Speaker 1>that's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

2691
01:58:04.301 --> 01:58:06.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a reality to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

2692
01:58:06.221 --> 01:58:08.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overwhelming amounts of people.</v>

2693
01:58:08.981 --> 01:58:10.630
<v Speaker 1>If you're around overwhelming amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2694
01:58:10.631 --> 01:58:12.350
<v Speaker 1>you can be like overstimulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2695
01:58:12.351 --> 01:58:17.351
<v Speaker 1>Some people believe that the result of </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in cities and living in high </v>

2696
01:58:17.351 --> 01:58:19.450
<v Speaker 1>population areas is like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this same thing that you're experiencing</v>

2697
01:58:19.451 --> 01:58:21.070
<v Speaker 1>when you see people getting into road </v>
<v Speaker 1>rage,</v>

2698
01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:26.090
<v Speaker 1>the same thing that you're experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 1>when people see people fly off the </v>

2699
01:58:26.090 --> 01:58:27.160
<v Speaker 1>handle at counter help or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like they're just overwhelmed.</v>

2700
01:58:27.190 --> 01:58:31.030
<v Speaker 1>There's just too much stimulation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just need to sit by yourself,</v>

2701
01:58:31.031 --> 01:58:32.470
<v Speaker 1>watch a little tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read a book,</v>

2702
01:58:32.471 --> 01:58:34.690
<v Speaker 1>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to be out in nature,</v>

2703
01:58:34.691 --> 01:58:37.160
<v Speaker 1>going for a walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't feel anything or hear anything.</v>

2704
01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Just see squirrels and a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>little kids,</v>

2705
01:58:39.461 --> 01:58:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

2706
01:58:41.310 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 1>We just don't</v>

2707
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:47.070
<v Speaker 4>feel like we need that because we're so </v>
<v Speaker 4>trapped in this momentum of </v>

2708
01:58:47.070 --> 01:58:47.830
<v Speaker 4>accomplishment is constantly pushing </v>
<v Speaker 4>forward,</v>

2709
01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:51.460
<v Speaker 4>but not realizing that we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't stay here forever.</v>

2710
01:58:51.461 --> 01:58:56.461
<v Speaker 4>You only get a certaIn amount of times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've quit doing conferences and </v>

2711
01:58:56.461 --> 01:58:58.330
<v Speaker 4>workshops because afterwards people come</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and they asked me all these questions</v>

2712
01:58:58.331 --> 01:59:03.331
<v Speaker 4>that are so deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really quite understand the </v>

2713
01:59:03.331 --> 01:59:03.331
<v Speaker 4>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2714
01:59:03.331 --> 01:59:04.000
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a carnival barker,</v>

2715
01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:09.060
<v Speaker 4>that's my role,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the actions in the tent and you're </v>

2716
01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:09.760
<v Speaker 4>in the center,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ring yourself in the main tent,</v>

2717
01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:12.670
<v Speaker 4>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to point to a lot of things and I</v>

2718
01:59:12.671 --> 01:59:17.671
<v Speaker 4>go broad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't go very deep and so I can't </v>

2719
01:59:17.671 --> 01:59:18.460
<v Speaker 4>answer questions and these people want </v>
<v Speaker 4>me to solve their life problems.</v>

2720
01:59:18.461 --> 01:59:20.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't even understand what they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>asking me,</v>

2721
01:59:20.051 --> 01:59:22.260
<v Speaker 4>so I've just quit making appearances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2722
01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:24.790
<v Speaker 4>there's always gonna be people that want</v>
<v Speaker 4>you to figure it out for them.</v>

2723
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:30.000
<v Speaker 4>There's always going to be people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't just want to discuss things that </v>

2724
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:30.000
<v Speaker 4>people have said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is absolutely fascinating,</v>

2725
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:34.501
<v Speaker 4>but they want you to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very selfish point of view and </v>

2726
01:59:34.501 --> 01:59:36.310
<v Speaker 4>it's very common and I'm just not up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2727
01:59:36.311 --> 01:59:38.860
<v Speaker 4>That's not what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody has quite honestly</v>

2728
01:59:38.861 --> 01:59:43.861
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and especially if you go up to them and </v>

2729
01:59:43.861 --> 01:59:43.861
<v Speaker 4>ask them for advice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2730
01:59:43.861 --> 01:59:43.861
<v Speaker 4>I need your advice like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2731
01:59:43.861 --> 01:59:46.990
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you need to do is you need to look</v>

<v Speaker 4>you should sign a legal contract where </v>

2742
02:00:12.121 --> 02:00:12.121

<v Speaker 4>you're gonna get mad at me.</v>

2745
02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Like I've people like I'm thinking about</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's where you go first.</v>

2749
02:00:23.710 --> 02:00:28.710
<v Speaker 4>Go to arrowhead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that you would be able to tell </v>

2750
02:00:28.710 --> 02:00:31.381
<v Speaker 4>someone what to do or not to do or what </v>
<v Speaker 4>did like you're asking too many weird </v>

2751
02:00:31.381 --> 02:00:35.431
<v Speaker 4>questions which we should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should be doing is figuring it out </v>

2752
02:00:35.431 --> 02:00:38.791
<v Speaker 4>for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big part of life and then </v>

2753
02:00:38.791 --> 02:00:38.791
<v Speaker 4>surrounding yourself with people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you meet,</v>

2754
02:00:38.791 --> 02:00:40.570
<v Speaker 4>that you become friends with and you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>share.</v>

2755
02:00:40.570 --> 02:00:41.970
<v Speaker 4>I have some history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2756
02:00:42.010 --> 02:00:45.700
<v Speaker 4>You can't just run up to lorenzo and ask</v>
<v Speaker 4>them to solve your problems.</v>

2757
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.000
<v Speaker 4>You shit in order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got a friend up crew in houston </v>

2758
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.361
<v Speaker 4>who's a lawyer friend of mine and </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually we were in the navy together </v>

2759
02:00:54.361 --> 02:00:54.910
<v Speaker 4>too and he has a big brass plaque on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>front of his desk that says,</v>

2760
02:00:55.150 --> 02:01:00.150
<v Speaker 4>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather not get involved so you know </v>

2761
02:01:00.150 --> 02:01:01.570
<v Speaker 4>you're going to pay top dollar with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2762
02:01:01.571 --> 02:01:06.571
<v Speaker 4>there's people that just want to drag </v>
<v Speaker 4>you into their world and you don't want </v>

2763
02:01:06.571 --> 02:01:07.240
<v Speaker 4>to be in their world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

2764
02:01:07.241 --> 02:01:09.320
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you heard your own bridge.</v>

2765
02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:12.130
<v Speaker 4>New people helped you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you sure about that?</v>

2766
02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:17.400
<v Speaker 4>Because there's definitely wasn't this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't running up to people and </v>

2767
02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:17.730
<v Speaker 4>telling them the fixed my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2768
02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:22.210
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of that going on out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and unfortunately it all goes down</v>

2769
02:01:22.211 --> 02:01:27.211
<v Speaker 4>to the same issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People that haven't been explained how </v>

2770
02:01:27.211 --> 02:01:30.961
<v Speaker 4>to think too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they haven't been instructed on what's </v>

2771
02:01:30.961 --> 02:01:31.560
<v Speaker 4>the most productive way to think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the best way to men?</v>

2772
02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:35.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean by things like form your </v>
<v Speaker 4>own opinions or creatively or anything.</v>

2773
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:37.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean manage your consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the debate?</v>

2774
02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 4>What best way to how you look</v>

2775
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:45.130
<v Speaker 1>at yourself in relation to the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you and if you're being too </v>

2776
02:01:45.130 --> 02:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>goddamn needy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ruining it for everybody.</v>

2777
02:01:46.830 --> 02:01:47.950
<v Speaker 1>If it's always about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2778
02:01:47.951 --> 02:01:48.290
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2779
02:01:48.291 --> 02:01:48.830
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mimi,</v>

2780
02:01:48.831 --> 02:01:49.460
<v Speaker 1>mimi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mimi,</v>

2781
02:01:49.461 --> 02:01:49.970
<v Speaker 1>mimi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2782
02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:55.060
<v Speaker 1>That might be while you're in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation in the first place because </v>

2783
02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:57.551
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to fucking help you and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one's helped you up to now because </v>

2784
02:01:57.551 --> 02:01:57.551
<v Speaker 1>you're exhausting</v>

2785
02:01:57.551 --> 02:01:58.950
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to be on the motivational speaker</v>

2786
02:01:59.250 --> 02:02:02.190
<v Speaker 3>circuit for awhile and we had all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>pat things.</v>

2787
02:02:02.191 --> 02:02:07.191
<v Speaker 3>When you're pointing at somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got three fingers pointing back </v>

2788
02:02:07.191 --> 02:02:09.800
<v Speaker 3>at yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one is you can walk through a </v>

2789
02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:13.071
<v Speaker 3>room full of people laying on the floor </v>
<v Speaker 3>and give your hand each one and help </v>

2790
02:02:13.071 --> 02:02:16.611
<v Speaker 3>them to their feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you let one of them climb on your </v>

2791
02:02:16.611 --> 02:02:16.611
<v Speaker 3>back and you're going to be down on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>floor with them,</v>

2792
02:02:16.611 --> 02:02:17.370
<v Speaker 3>and so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're saying.</v>

2793
02:02:17.371 --> 02:02:22.371
<v Speaker 3>Don't get involved in helping people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just tell them what you can help </v>

2794
02:02:22.371 --> 02:02:25.731
<v Speaker 3>them with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some ideas that they got to work on </v>

2795
02:02:25.731 --> 02:02:25.731
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't solve them.</v>

2796
02:02:25.731 --> 02:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I don't get involved with </v>

2797
02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>helping people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

2798
02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>People have to realize that taking their</v>
<v Speaker 1>version on,</v>

2799
02:02:30.670 --> 02:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you as an individual have your own </v>

2800
02:02:35.670 --> 02:02:36.490
<v Speaker 1>unique burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to learn things,</v>

2801
02:02:36.491 --> 02:02:38.920
<v Speaker 1>if you want to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've got to start doing research.</v>

2802
02:02:38.921 --> 02:02:40.710
<v Speaker 1>You got to start reading books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to start communicating,</v>

2803
02:02:40.750 --> 02:02:42.640
<v Speaker 1>but going up to someone like you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

2804
02:02:42.641 --> 02:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need you to fix my life.</v>

2805
02:02:44.070 --> 02:02:44.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I do?</v>

2806
02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know what the fuck you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except I barely know what the fuck I do.</v>

2807
02:02:49.010 --> 02:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>

2808
02:02:50.141 --> 02:02:55.141
<v Speaker 1>you gotta find somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other problem is that what I've </v>

2809
02:02:55.141 --> 02:02:56.050
<v Speaker 1>found is that people who are needy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never recover.</v>

2810
02:02:56.290 --> 02:02:57.850
<v Speaker 1>If you keep them in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god dammit,</v>

2811
02:02:57.851 --> 02:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>they're needy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten years later,</v>

2812
02:02:59.470 --> 02:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2813
02:02:59.981 --> 02:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>we've gotten 10 years and you're still </v>
<v Speaker 1>at god damn wreck.</v>

2814
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

2815
02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why have you not figured this out yet?</v>

2816
02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>You asked me for advice 10 goddamn years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

2817
02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>we spent a lot of time talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and now 10 years later you're doing</v>

2818
02:03:11.951 --> 02:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

2819
02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>You're sucking me into a world of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

2820
02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>You're just trapping me like a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>vortex</v>

2821
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:23.830
<v Speaker 3>and being honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's probably the best thing you </v>

2822
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.830
<v Speaker 3>can do for now</v>

2823

<v Speaker 1>than they hate you and talk shit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>you online under fake names.</v>

2824
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:25.740
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>

2825
02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>they get fake accounts and It just turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>it off.</v>

2826
02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2827

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is beautiful when everybody's </v>

2828
02:03:35.130 --> 02:03:35.160
<v Speaker 1>trying to do their part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but life becomes a real pain in the ass,</v>

2829
02:03:35.161 --> 02:03:36.920
<v Speaker 1>but no one wants to do the dishes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2830
02:03:37.330 --> 02:03:42.330
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you live in a house with a bunch of </v>

2831
02:03:42.330 --> 02:03:42.330
<v Speaker 1>people and no one does the dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes that,</v>

2832
02:03:42.330 --> 02:03:42.330
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are we doing?</v>

<v Speaker 1>You get into that kind of nonsense,</v>

2837
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>but then you get a shitty communication </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

2838
02:03:53.561 --> 02:03:55.820
<v Speaker 1>You got a shitty commune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a shitty culture.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just goes downhill from there.</v>

2840
02:03:57.070 --> 02:04:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a real issue is a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue is that there's too many people </v>

2841

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that that's who they become.</v>

2844

<v Speaker 1>People like,</v>

2861
02:04:47.581 --> 02:04:52.581
<v Speaker 4>going from there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this the only way today and </v>

2862
02:04:52.581 --> 02:04:55.191
<v Speaker 4>there's ways they can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got youtube and places they can </v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2864
02:04:55.191 --> 02:04:59.140
<v Speaker 4>and that's the only issue that I ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>have in communicating with people is </v>

2865
02:04:59.140 --> 02:04:59.350
<v Speaker 4>sometimes people get exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you to read this script.</v>

2866
02:04:59.351 --> 02:05:01.500
<v Speaker 4>Do you know how long that takes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know you,</v>

2867
02:05:01.501 --> 02:05:03.270
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to read your script.</v>

2868
02:05:03.271 --> 02:05:08.271
<v Speaker 4>People want me to read their books all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time and I've got books I need to </v>

2869
02:05:08.271 --> 02:05:08.271
<v Speaker 4>read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's flattering,</v>

2870
02:05:08.271 --> 02:05:08.271
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

2871
02:05:08.330 --> 02:05:10.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would never do that.</v>

2872
02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:12.360
<v Speaker 4>I would never send someone a book and </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2873
02:05:12.361 --> 02:05:14.100
<v Speaker 4>I want you to read this and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>critique it for me.</v>

2874
02:05:14.100 --> 02:05:16.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that needy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a needy thing.</v>

2875
02:05:16.050 --> 02:05:19.470
<v Speaker 4>The other reason I don't do it besides </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time is first of all,</v>

2876
02:05:19.471 --> 02:05:20.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure I know what they're talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

2877
02:05:20.850 --> 02:05:23.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure I know the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then what if I don't like it?</v>

2878
02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:25.830
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to just say,</v>

2879
02:05:25.831 --> 02:05:26.940
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this really sucks.</v>

2880
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:32.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard that happen before people </v>

2881
02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.441
<v Speaker 4>have sent me stand up before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>review this and then get back to me </v>

2882
02:05:33.441 --> 02:05:33.441
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2883
02:05:33.441 --> 02:05:33.870
<v Speaker 4>christ son,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2884
02:05:33.871 --> 02:05:34.540
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2885
02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:37.770
<v Speaker 4>I thought during my bachelor stoner days</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to stand up,</v>

2886
02:05:37.771 --> 02:05:39.780
<v Speaker 4>but the time you're doing news radio </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2887
02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:41.690
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was really funny.</v>

2888
02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:45.190
<v Speaker 4>I worked for weeks and weeks to get like</v>
<v Speaker 4>five minutes.</v>

2889
02:05:45.191 --> 02:05:48.180
<v Speaker 4>So you're in your fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

2890
02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:53.200
<v Speaker 4>Days and your fifth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't even get my girlfriend to laugh</v>

2891
02:05:53.201 --> 02:05:55.080
<v Speaker 4>at more than one or two of the jokes and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

2892
02:05:55.081 --> 02:06:00.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no way I'm going to an open mic </v>

2893
02:06:00.081 --> 02:06:00.081
<v Speaker 4>with this is that I need a new </v>
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend.</v>

2894
02:06:00.081 --> 02:06:00.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that happened to it,</v>

2895
02:06:00.811 --> 02:06:03.120
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't her fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't her fault,</v>

2896
02:06:03.121 --> 02:06:06.720
<v Speaker 4>but that's hard work to do that I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really admire you guys.</v>

2897
02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:11.490
<v Speaker 4>It's hard work when it's not going well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when it's hard work.</v>

2898
02:06:11.491 --> 02:06:14.460
<v Speaker 4>It's hard work when you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>come up with new material that it's hard</v>

2899
02:06:14.461 --> 02:06:16.450
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when it's working it's not hard.</v>

2900
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.980
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2901
02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:22.100
<v Speaker 4>although I love music,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always think comedy is just a step </v>

2902
02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:24.360
<v Speaker 4>above because laughing actually can heal</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and so I've,</v>

2903
02:06:24.490 --> 02:06:29.490
<v Speaker 4>I've learned more comedians through your</v>
<v Speaker 4>show and one time I heard you say </v>

2904

<v Speaker 4>you thought joey diaz was the funniest </v>

<v Speaker 1>too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like that.</v>

3071
02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:53.660
<v Speaker 1>And yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean yours is a very specifically pro </v>

3072
02:13:53.660 --> 02:13:53.660
<v Speaker 1>drug to.</v>

3073
02:13:53.660 --> 02:13:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a real issue for sponsors.</v>

3074
02:13:56.190 --> 02:13:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean every now and then art bell would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have mckenna on.</v>

3075
02:13:58.921 --> 02:14:03.921
<v Speaker 1>They would discuss the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been the stoned ape theory and what </v>

3076
02:14:03.921 --> 02:14:03.921
<v Speaker 1>happened and it would be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>

3077
02:14:03.921 --> 02:14:08.451
<v Speaker 1>but the amount of just raw information </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over again talking </v>

3078
02:14:09.601 --> 02:14:13.320
<v Speaker 1>about talking in a positive way about </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences.</v>

3079
02:14:13.321 --> 02:14:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Like there's never been anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>your show.</v>

3080
02:14:15.690 --> 02:14:17.140
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3081
02:14:17.150 --> 02:14:20.370
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't talk about doing the drugs as</v>

3082
02:14:20.370 --> 02:14:22.950
<v Speaker 1>much as about what they think about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts that come back.</v>

3083
02:14:22.951 --> 02:14:27.951
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show really it would be called </v>

3084
02:14:27.951 --> 02:14:27.951
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3085
02:14:27.951 --> 02:14:29.340
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine having hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of young people listening to a</v>

3086
02:14:29.341 --> 02:14:31.890
<v Speaker 1>philosophy podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the category it's in.</v>

3087
02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:33.720
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you stop and think about it,</v>

3088
02:14:33.721 --> 02:14:38.721
<v Speaker 1>like most philosophical people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you call yourself a philosopher </v>

3089
02:14:38.721 --> 02:14:39.110
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there blowhards yeah,</v>

3090
02:14:39.210 --> 02:14:44.040
<v Speaker 1>know there are people who pontificate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and philosophy without the drugs sucks.</v>

3091
02:14:44.550 --> 02:14:48.720
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often overbearing,</v>

3092
02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:52.180
<v Speaker 1>often self centered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often not self aware,</v>

3093
02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:55.530
<v Speaker 1>not objective and introspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's missing an element.</v>

3094
02:14:55.770 --> 02:15:00.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that without control of the </v>

3095
02:15:00.770 --> 02:15:01.580
<v Speaker 1>ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very good.</v>

3096
02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Difficult to get philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3097
02:15:03.450 --> 02:15:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to have unique ideas</v>

3098
02:15:07.691 --> 02:15:12.470
<v Speaker 1>that are that express like the the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3099
02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:17.820
<v Speaker 1>the way that people want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone wants to express a profound</v>

3100
02:15:18.461 --> 02:15:22.570
<v Speaker 1>thought to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone wants to express some sort of</v>

3101
02:15:22.571 --> 02:15:24.610
<v Speaker 1>a life changing idea that they've come </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon,</v>

3102
02:15:24.611 --> 02:15:29.611
<v Speaker 1>realize themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to do that </v>

3103
02:15:29.611 --> 02:15:29.611
<v Speaker 1>sincerely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3104
02:15:29.650 --> 02:15:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Without coming off like a blowhard and </v>
<v Speaker 1>an asshole.</v>

3105
02:15:31.991 --> 02:15:36.991
<v Speaker 1>there's something about expressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in ways that it seems like when</v>

3106
02:15:37.361 --> 02:15:39.520
<v Speaker 1>people were trying to make profound </v>
<v Speaker 1>statements,</v>

3107
02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:41.740
<v Speaker 1>they're not just trying to make profound</v>
<v Speaker 1>statements.</v>

3108
02:15:41.741 --> 02:15:46.741
<v Speaker 1>They're also trying to sound awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're also trying to impress people </v>

3109
02:15:46.741 --> 02:15:48.690
<v Speaker 1>with their capturing of the english </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and their,</v>

3110
02:15:48.930 --> 02:15:53.930
<v Speaker 1>their use of prose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when someone like says something </v>

3111
02:15:54.251 --> 02:15:56.860
<v Speaker 1>like mckenna or someone says something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3112
02:15:56.910 --> 02:16:01.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's been a million people </v>

3113
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.910
<v Speaker 1>that have said brilliant things.</v>

3114
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Alan watts is another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3115
02:16:02.081 --> 02:16:07.081
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've said something that just really </v>

3116
02:16:07.081 --> 02:16:09.391
<v Speaker 1>rings true in an honest and unique way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit more than psych than,</v>

3117
02:16:11.650 --> 02:16:16.650
<v Speaker 1>than just philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit more than just </v>

3118
02:16:16.650 --> 02:16:19.291
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a combination of the two that </v>

3119
02:16:19.291 --> 02:16:20.710
<v Speaker 1>sparks a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

3120
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:25.950
<v Speaker 1>It sparks thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a seed of an idea that </v>

3121
02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:28.660
<v Speaker 1>gets planted and when you hear it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you watch it,</v>

3122
02:16:28.661 --> 02:16:32.140
<v Speaker 1>which is one the beautiful things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these user created youtube videos.</v>

3123
02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:35.950
<v Speaker 1>They're so visually stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They draw you in in that form as well.</v>

3124
02:16:36.130 --> 02:16:39.310
<v Speaker 1>The music they attached to them and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual words themselves.</v>

3125
02:16:39.311 --> 02:16:44.311
<v Speaker 1>It's like the combinAtion of them is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining and captivating and </v>

3126
02:16:44.311 --> 02:16:46.490
<v Speaker 1>inspiring that it becomes something way </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger than just philosophy,</v>

3127
02:16:46.491 --> 02:16:48.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes philosophy.</v>

3128
02:16:48.191 --> 02:16:53.191
<v Speaker 1>That's affective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes philosophy that may actually </v>

3129
02:16:53.191 --> 02:16:53.191
<v Speaker 1>change the way you think.</v>

3130
02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:58.500
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to go to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy class and then change your </v>

3131
02:16:58.500 --> 02:16:58.500
<v Speaker 1>way of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3132
02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:03.720
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's boring and dull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes they just talk too much </v>

3133
02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:07.690
<v Speaker 1>and they don't see anything interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a big part of what people </v>

3134
02:17:07.690 --> 02:17:10.720
<v Speaker 1>like when they like podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a guy like joey diaz per se,</v>

3135
02:17:10.721 --> 02:17:14.380
<v Speaker 1>or a guy like duncan trussell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're entertained people.</v>

3136
02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:17.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that they're saying cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3137
02:17:17.410 --> 02:17:22.410
<v Speaker 1>They're entertaining people and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not entertaining and you're just </v>

3138
02:17:22.410 --> 02:17:22.900
<v Speaker 1>saying shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it wrong,</v>

3139
02:17:23.410 --> 02:17:26.680
<v Speaker 1>you're missing a big percentage of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes people listen to you.</v>

3140
02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:29.170
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and retain it and retain it.</v>

3141
02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is the medium of the </v>

3142
02:17:34.620 --> 02:17:35.950
<v Speaker 1>fireside chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that that's where it came from.</v>

3143
02:17:36.100 --> 02:17:40.360
<v Speaker 1>One person would know or several people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would share stories,</v>

3144
02:17:40.361 --> 02:17:42.490
<v Speaker 1>but when you learned how to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly,</v>

3145
02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:47.240
<v Speaker 1>it became exciting for the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>do are engaged in it and it became a,</v>

3146
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:52.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an educational experience as well as an </v>

3147
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:52.270
<v Speaker 1>entertaining experience.</v>

3148
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the way we started doing mtma in </v>

3149
02:17:56.210 --> 02:17:58.911
<v Speaker 3>dallas back in the eighties is is either</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple or maybe three couples at most </v>

3150
02:17:58.911 --> 02:18:01.770
<v Speaker 3>and we'd all take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd get together with our spouse or our</v>

3151
02:18:01.890 --> 02:18:06.890
<v Speaker 3>significant other for awhile and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd get together in the last several </v>

3152
02:18:06.890 --> 02:18:07.590
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd just be talking and it would be,</v>

3153
02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:12.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophical life changing and I </v>

3154
02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:13.290
<v Speaker 3>noticed you're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see it lowers your bear.</v>

3155
02:18:13.291 --> 02:18:18.291
<v Speaker 3>It's like like lowering your fear </v>
<v Speaker 3>barrier where you can say something to </v>

3156
02:18:18.291 --> 02:18:19.500
<v Speaker 3>somebody and know you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt their feelings and so you,</v>

3157
02:18:19.770 --> 02:18:24.770
<v Speaker 3>the truth serum comes out and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to your friends and your spouse or </v>

3158
02:18:24.770 --> 02:18:25.170
<v Speaker 3>whatever and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3159
02:18:25.171 --> 02:18:26.640
<v Speaker 3>this has been bothering me lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3160
02:18:26.641 --> 02:18:27.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought maybe you know,</v>

3161
02:18:27.991 --> 02:18:32.220
<v Speaker 3>it's really a healing proposition that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do for yourselves and each other.</v>

3162
02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3163
02:18:32.930 --> 02:18:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with a friend when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I did ecstasy with him where he's asking</v>

3164
02:18:37.011 --> 02:18:39.290
<v Speaker 1>me why wouldn't lend them money to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>his business?</v>

3165
02:18:40.410 --> 02:18:45.410
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ordinarily I would have avoided that </v>

3166
02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:45.410
<v Speaker 3>conversation like the plague because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to stay.</v>

3167
02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:47.580
<v Speaker 3>Your friend can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't do that difference.</v>

3168
02:18:47.581 --> 02:18:48.900
<v Speaker 3>It never works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a bank.</v>

3169
02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Banks are there for a reason and nobody </v>

3170
02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:54.360
<v Speaker 1>ever pays a friend's back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3171
02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:54.360
<v Speaker 1>they just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3172
02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:55.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say nobody maybe.</v>

3173
02:18:55.290 --> 02:18:57.870
<v Speaker 1>But when somebody borrows 25 grand from </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3174
02:18:57.900 --> 02:18:59.130
<v Speaker 1>most likely that shit's gone.</v>

3175
02:18:59.620 --> 02:19:01.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I started my computer company,</v>

3176
02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:04.400
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was my mentor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he loaned me a loan.</v>

3177
02:19:04.410 --> 02:19:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Did he loaned me some money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to get home and have it took.</v>

3178
02:19:09.350 --> 02:19:10.960
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3179
02:19:10.961 --> 02:19:15.961
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he loaned me some money to start the </v>

3180
02:19:15.961 --> 02:19:17.611
<v Speaker 3>business and then years later before I </v>
<v Speaker 3>paid him back about half of it and then </v>

3181
02:19:17.611 --> 02:19:21.121
<v Speaker 3>we went upside down and I was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>upset about it and it wasn't a lot of </v>

3182
02:19:21.121 --> 02:19:22.870
<v Speaker 3>money on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About $7,000</v>

3183
02:19:22.871 --> 02:19:23.920
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot to me.</v>

3184
02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:26.230
<v Speaker 3>And I was lamenting the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3185
02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:28.340
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't pay him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would eventually he says no.</v>

3186
02:19:28.341 --> 02:19:29.730
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

3187
02:19:29.731 --> 02:19:31.700
<v Speaker 3>he had a big tugboat business now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

3188
02:19:31.701 --> 02:19:34.250
<v Speaker 3>when I started this business 25 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

3189
02:19:34.670 --> 02:19:38.530
<v Speaker 3>my wife's father in law or father loaned</v>
<v Speaker 3>me the money and uh,</v>

3190
02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:41.150
<v Speaker 3>that business went broke in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two others went broke in.</v>

3191
02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:43.760
<v Speaker 3>He died before I could pay them back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's his money.</v>

3192
02:19:43.761 --> 02:19:46.340
<v Speaker 3>You've got to find somebody to pay that </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you in the future.</v>

3193
02:19:46.341 --> 02:19:47.210
<v Speaker 3>But now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3194
02:19:47.211 --> 02:19:49.220
<v Speaker 3>that's a very cool guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

3195
02:19:49.221 --> 02:19:49.910
<v Speaker 3>he was amazing guy.</v>

3196
02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:54.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a very cool guy and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool that you wanted to pay him back </v>

3197
02:19:54.940 --> 02:19:54.940
<v Speaker 1>early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You making attempts to pay them back.</v>

3198
02:19:54.940 --> 02:19:55.910
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal though.</v>

3199
02:19:56.090 --> 02:20:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I've had several friends that have lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendships because they somebody money </v>

3200
02:20:02.300 --> 02:20:05.720
<v Speaker 1>and this one friend boy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it drove him crazy.</v>

3201
02:20:05.721 --> 02:20:10.721
<v Speaker 1>Like he would talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this guy would come over his house </v>

3202
02:20:10.721 --> 02:20:14.381
<v Speaker 1>and this guy would hang out with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and think I would never bring up the </v>

3203
02:20:14.381 --> 02:20:14.381
<v Speaker 1>fact that he owed them all this money </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3204
02:20:14.381 --> 02:20:16.460
<v Speaker 1>and it would drive them crazy and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

3205
02:20:16.461 --> 02:20:18.090
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pay you when I can pay it.</v>

3206
02:20:18.770 --> 02:20:21.550
<v Speaker 1>But he would find out the guy just </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought a new this or that.</v>

3207
02:20:21.580 --> 02:20:22.900
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's this?</v>

3208
02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:26.300
<v Speaker 1>And so it became like a big part of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

3209
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:31.630
<v Speaker 1>It became like this thing is this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a friend and he didn't want to </v>

3210
02:20:31.630 --> 02:20:32.810
<v Speaker 1>lose his friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he realized that the friendship was.</v>

3211
02:20:32.810 --> 02:20:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Now all of a sudden there's like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative thing where it was constantly </v>

3212
02:20:37.810 --> 02:20:37.810
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3213
02:20:37.810 --> 02:20:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I fucking pulled out money out of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>

3214
02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I lent it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no intentions of puking,</v>

3215
02:20:41.861 --> 02:20:45.410
<v Speaker 1>pain me back because I don't do anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't threaten you.</v>

3216
02:20:45.411 --> 02:20:47.990
<v Speaker 1>I can't repossess your car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do anything that a bank can do.</v>

3217
02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:52.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating thing when you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that just.</v>

3218
02:20:52.430 --> 02:20:57.430
<v Speaker 1>They don't go all the way with stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they promise things they don't </v>

3219
02:20:57.430 --> 02:21:02.171
<v Speaker 1>follow through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get an idea in their head and then </v>

3220
02:21:02.171 --> 02:21:02.171
<v Speaker 1>they just fucking shut down and never </v>
<v Speaker 1>finish it.</v>

3221
02:21:02.171 --> 02:21:02.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3222
02:21:02.661 --> 02:21:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start this business and </v>
<v Speaker 1>within,</v>

3223
02:21:04.341 --> 02:21:09.341
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Within six months I'm going to pay you </v>

3224
02:21:09.341 --> 02:21:09.830
<v Speaker 1>back with 25 percent interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to lose.</v>

3225
02:21:10.100 --> 02:21:11.630
<v Speaker 1>and then six months later what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3226
02:21:11.631 --> 02:21:12.610
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to believe this.</v>

3227
02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:14.810
<v Speaker 1>He got fucked bar manufacturer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and that.</v>

3228
02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:16.520
<v Speaker 1>So I'm out of business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you want to do.</v>

3229
02:21:16.850 --> 02:21:18.800
<v Speaker 1>What do I want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You owe me a lot of money,</v>

3230
02:21:18.801 --> 02:21:19.760
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey look,</v>

3231
02:21:19.761 --> 02:21:21.130

<v Speaker 1>This would be.</v>

3232
02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a loss like,</v>

3233
02:21:23.060 --> 02:21:26.110
<v Speaker 1>oh jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you go right.</v>

3234
02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:27.200

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3235
02:21:27.201 --> 02:21:30.320
<v Speaker 1>it happens over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people out there.</v>

3236
02:21:30.321 --> 02:21:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Just like when you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that need people to help them,</v>

3237
02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:34.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people coming up to you,</v>

3238
02:21:34.971 --> 02:21:35.690

<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

3240
02:21:37.071 --> 02:21:40.220
<v Speaker 1>you just gotta let me some money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's other ways you know there's</v>

3241
02:21:40.221 --> 02:21:45.221
<v Speaker 1>other ways a guarantee you the best way </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not borrowing money from your </v>

3242
02:21:45.221 --> 02:21:49.301
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be a better way than </v>

3243
02:21:49.301 --> 02:21:51.011
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to figure out how to get some </v>

3244
02:21:51.011 --> 02:21:52.871
<v Speaker 1>of that fucking money on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we're in a totally closed </v>

3245
02:21:52.871 --> 02:21:53.780
<v Speaker 1>system or it's impossible to get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may bE difficult,</v>

3246
02:21:53.781 --> 02:21:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other people have figured it out.</v>

3247
02:21:56.930 --> 02:21:58.670
<v Speaker 1>It might be possible for you to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>

3248
02:21:58.671 --> 02:22:01.310
<v Speaker 1>This is not like something like holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>your breath under water for an hour.</v>

3249
02:22:01.490 --> 02:22:03.510
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3250
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:04.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

<v Speaker 3>clown fish make me laugh.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Make me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The worst thing is when you're doing an </v>

3259

<v Speaker 1>interview and like I feel like do a </v>

<v Speaker 4>It's gross.</v>

3266
02:22:36.571 --> 02:22:39.390
<v Speaker 4>It's like just inept,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inept interviewing.</v>

3267
02:22:39.470 --> 02:22:44.470
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend that was a drummer and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>are in an after hours club down and </v>

3268
02:22:44.470 --> 02:22:48.321
<v Speaker 3>kima,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas and my mentor actually got him a </v>

3269
02:22:48.321 --> 02:22:50.150
<v Speaker 3>wanting to play the drums in this band </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't want to,</v>

3270
02:22:50.151 --> 02:22:51.790
<v Speaker 3>he didn't want to and he's in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3271
02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:53.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And finally my,</v>

3272
02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:58.720
<v Speaker 3>my friend bribes the band,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gives them some money and tim gets on </v>

3273
02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:02.621
<v Speaker 3>the drums and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's just kind of playing a little </v>

3274
02:23:02.621 --> 02:23:02.621
<v Speaker 3>bit and all of a sudden the guitarist </v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

3275
02:23:02.621 --> 02:23:02.621
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take it.</v>

3276
02:23:02.810 --> 02:23:04.640
<v Speaker 4>And he hits the drum one time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bang.</v>

3277
02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:06.410
<v Speaker 4>He gets up and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd take it back now.</v>

3278
02:23:08.050 --> 02:23:10.220
<v Speaker 4>That was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3279
02:23:11.930 --> 02:23:13.280
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

3280
02:23:13.281 --> 02:23:18.281
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things about psychedelics </v>

3281
02:23:18.281 --> 02:23:18.740
<v Speaker 4>that really aids people is they get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>chance to see how annoying they can be.</v>

3282
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.950
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3283
02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:25.000
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've met people that have changed a lot </v>

3284
02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.690
<v Speaker 4>of their behavior and have apologized to</v>
<v Speaker 4>friends and stuff or being an asshole or</v>

3285
02:23:26.691 --> 02:23:29.150
<v Speaker 4>doing whatever just because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic trips.</v>

3286
02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:31.310
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't trip with anybody anymore.</v>

3287
02:23:31.740 --> 02:23:32.480
<v Speaker 4>You do it by yourself.</v>

3288

<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had so many and I don't do hardly </v>

3289

02:23:50.001 --> 02:23:50.001
<v Speaker 3>couple of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that can fix you when you do</v>

3297
02:23:50.001 --> 02:23:50.001
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I lost,</v>

3298
02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:51.740
<v Speaker 3>can fix anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3299
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:53.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a huge wire and it's,</v>

3300
02:23:53.411 --> 02:23:54.900
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a miracle,</v>

3301
02:23:55.060 --> 02:24:00.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has changed my life more than </v>

3302
02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:00.060
<v Speaker 3>anything else I've ever done.</v>

3303
02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:00.670
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty awesome.</v>

3304
02:24:00.671 --> 02:24:01.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is pretty awesome,</v>

3305
02:24:01.871 --> 02:24:06.871
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's another thing that we've pretty </v>

3306
02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:06.871
<v Speaker 4>sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it was here,</v>

3307
02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:06.871
<v Speaker 4>it was legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had iowasca centers,</v>

3308
02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:06.871
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3309
02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:07.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3310
02:24:07.831 --> 02:24:08.440
<v Speaker 3>iT's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3311
02:24:08.460 --> 02:24:13.460
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a weird state because it is </v>

3312
02:24:13.460 --> 02:24:13.460
<v Speaker 3>legal with some of the churches now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3313
02:24:13.460 --> 02:24:13.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3314
02:24:13.780 --> 02:24:14.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took me,</v>

3315
02:24:14.531 --> 02:24:19.531
<v Speaker 3>I was actively searching for it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>about 10 years until all of a sudden I </v>

3316
02:24:19.531 --> 02:24:19.720
<v Speaker 3>found it and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3317
02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:23.920
<v Speaker 3>that's happened to so many people when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't find it until you're ready for</v>

3318
02:24:23.921 --> 02:24:25.910
<v Speaker 3>it and then it finds you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3319
02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:26.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had,</v>

3320
02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:27.820
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3321
02:24:27.821 --> 02:24:30.820
<v Speaker 3>a lot of amazing experiences on some </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult ones,</v>

3322
02:24:30.821 --> 02:24:33.810
<v Speaker 3>but that all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all in all there,</v>

3323
02:24:33.850 --> 02:24:38.850
<v Speaker 3>it gives me more positive feeling about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this life and any other potential life </v>

3324
02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:40.390
<v Speaker 3>than I've ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

3325
02:24:40.660 --> 02:24:42.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's very earth centered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3326
02:24:42.281 --> 02:24:47.281
<v Speaker 3>I heard you talking to graham hancock </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how everybody gets ecological on </v>

3327
02:24:47.281 --> 02:24:48.610
<v Speaker 3>it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas acid is more mechanical,</v>

3328
02:24:48.650 --> 02:24:53.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do all kinds of problems and </v>

3329
02:24:53.650 --> 02:24:53.650
<v Speaker 3>code and stuff like that.</v>

3330
02:24:53.650 --> 02:24:56.380
<v Speaker 3>And mushrooms are pretty mystical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I will ask us earth centered,</v>

3331
02:24:56.381 --> 02:24:56.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3332
02:24:56.780 --> 02:25:00.970
<v Speaker 3>it's an earth spirit that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing were engaged with and uh,</v>

3333
02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:04.000
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be a frightening and scary,</v>

3334
02:25:04.001 --> 02:25:06.400
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing things that happened to me.</v>

3335
02:25:06.401 --> 02:25:09.070
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried not to think too much about what</v>

3336
02:25:09.071 --> 02:25:14.071
<v Speaker 3>happens after death because I'm close </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to find out sooner than I want </v>

3337
02:25:14.071 --> 02:25:14.080
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

3338
02:25:14.130 --> 02:25:15.430
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and at times I,</v>

3339
02:25:15.431 --> 02:25:16.660
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3340
02:25:16.661 --> 02:25:21.661
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And other times I say there's something </v>

3341
02:25:21.661 --> 02:25:21.661
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3342
02:25:21.661 --> 02:25:22.630
<v Speaker 3>as it happened four days after my mother</v>
<v Speaker 3>died,</v>

3343
02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:27.990
<v Speaker 3>I had an iowasca experience with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>circle that I've been with for quite </v>

3344
02:25:27.990 --> 02:25:31.780
<v Speaker 3>awhile and I didn't tell anybody that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that my mother had just died before the </v>

3345
02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:37.080
<v Speaker 3>ceremony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't tell I didn't want bum people </v>

3346
02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:37.180
<v Speaker 3>out or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And occasionally the ios carol will call</v>

3347
02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:39.760
<v Speaker 3>individual people up to the front for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>healing or something.</v>

3348
02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:44.760
<v Speaker 3>And this night he happened to call me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I go up to the front and it was </v>

3349
02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:44.760
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3350
02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:47.070
<v Speaker 3>my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually saw the,</v>

3351
02:25:47.370 --> 02:25:52.370
<v Speaker 3>an image,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a huge image of my mother floating over </v>

3352
02:25:52.370 --> 02:25:52.370
<v Speaker 3>us that then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3353
02:25:52.370 --> 02:25:52.450
<v Speaker 3>the next morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3354
02:25:52.500 --> 02:25:57.500
<v Speaker 3>we all stay in the same room and sleep </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the floor at night and the next </v>

3355
02:25:57.500 --> 02:26:00.031
<v Speaker 3>morning we have breakfast together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we go around the circle and </v>

3356
02:26:00.031 --> 02:26:00.031
<v Speaker 3>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's three different people said,</v>

3357
02:26:00.031 --> 02:26:03.100
<v Speaker 3>who was that spirit that appeared over </v>
<v Speaker 3>your head when you're up there?</v>

3358
02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:05.710
<v Speaker 3>And that just really freaked me out </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I thought,</v>

3359
02:26:05.711 --> 02:26:10.711
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm imagining it and I'm making up my </v>

3360
02:26:10.711 --> 02:26:12.220
<v Speaker 3>head or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three other people synced in some regArd</v>

3361
02:26:12.221 --> 02:26:14.200
<v Speaker 3>that there was a spirit there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

3362
02:26:14.201 --> 02:26:15.280
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was my mother.</v>

3363
02:26:15.281 --> 02:26:15.970
<v Speaker 3>She just died.</v>

3364
02:26:16.390 --> 02:26:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible that it's also both?</v>

3365
02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:20.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be,</v>

3366
02:26:20.391 --> 02:26:20.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3367
02:26:20.770 --> 02:26:23.420
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could have projected it into the,</v>

3368
02:26:23.421 --> 02:26:23.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3369
02:26:23.870 --> 02:26:25.220
<v Speaker 3>there's no question about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3370
02:26:25.260 --> 02:26:28.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm open ended on it.</v>

3371
02:26:28.431 --> 02:26:32.210
<v Speaker 3>So all I know is that was a very moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience for me.</v>

3372
02:26:32.390 --> 02:26:34.730
<v Speaker 3>And then other people saw something </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

3373
02:26:34.731 --> 02:26:38.300
<v Speaker 3>Now maybe they were just feeling the </v>
<v Speaker 3>vibration of what I was going through</v>

3374
02:26:38.610 --> 02:26:39.640
<v Speaker 1>for wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3375
02:26:39.780 --> 02:26:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3376
02:26:41.941 --> 02:26:46.941
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand exactly what's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on when you're having any sort of a </v>

3377
02:26:46.941 --> 02:26:50.280
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine that if you are both</v>

3378
02:26:50.281 --> 02:26:55.281
<v Speaker 1>in the same mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you and the person who was also </v>

3379
02:26:55.281 --> 02:26:58.911
<v Speaker 1>on [inaudible] in the room and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>all in the same sort of psychedelic </v>

3380
02:26:58.911 --> 02:27:03.051
<v Speaker 1>mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be some sort of an </v>

3381
02:27:03.051 --> 02:27:05.061
<v Speaker 1>exchange of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of information that's coming from your </v>

3382
02:27:05.061 --> 02:27:05.130
<v Speaker 1>head to their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3383
02:27:05.131 --> 02:27:07.640
<v Speaker 1>that's why they wanted to call it </v>
<v Speaker 1>telepathy to let the thing.</v>

3384
02:27:07.641 --> 02:27:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3385
02:27:08.131 --> 02:27:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Before they discovered that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>already named and was called harming.</v>

3386
02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:16.270
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend that had some really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really demonstrable,</v>

3387
02:27:16.271 --> 02:27:18.370
<v Speaker 3>a experiment like that that happened to </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

3388
02:27:18.371 --> 02:27:23.371
<v Speaker 3>And so he and another person who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking the same thing at the same </v>

3389
02:27:23.371 --> 02:27:23.640
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having the same vision,</v>

3390
02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:24.670
<v Speaker 3>what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it wasn't,</v>

3391
02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:26.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had uh,</v>

3392
02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:31.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one guy is on one corner of the </v>

3393
02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:33.511
<v Speaker 3>room and he's thinking he was having </v>
<v Speaker 3>some ufo experience where there was a </v>

3394
02:27:33.511 --> 02:27:34.190
<v Speaker 3>spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3395
02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:35.190
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3396
02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:40.260
<v Speaker 3>he was thinking about getting on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>spaceship and just as he's thinking at </v>

3397
02:27:40.260 --> 02:27:40.260
<v Speaker 3>the guy on the other side of the room </v>
<v Speaker 3>and says,</v>

3398
02:27:40.260 --> 02:27:45.120
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't forget there's only room for 10 </v>

3399
02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:45.700
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're opposite sides of the room,</v>

3400
02:27:45.701 --> 02:27:46.150
<v Speaker 3>quiet</v>

3401
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:51.150
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard people have really like a </v>

3402
02:27:51.150 --> 02:27:53.140
<v Speaker 1>unique visuals that everyone in the room</v>
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

3403
02:27:53.380 --> 02:27:58.380
<v Speaker 1>And I alWays wonder if maybe you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>conjure up something with your </v>

3404
02:27:58.380 --> 02:27:59.230
<v Speaker 1>imagination or with your focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ideas.</v>

3405
02:27:59.410 --> 02:28:01.990
<v Speaker 1>You can conjure up sort of a psychic </v>
<v Speaker 1>image in your mind.</v>

3406
02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:04.600
<v Speaker 1>And because everyone's tuned into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

3407
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:07.820
<v Speaker 1>they see it in their hallucinogenic </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination as well.</v>

3408
02:28:07.821 --> 02:28:09.310
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

3409
02:28:09.311 --> 02:28:09.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3410
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.910
<v Speaker 3>And yet on the most intense experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever had,</v>

3411
02:28:13.660 --> 02:28:18.660
<v Speaker 3>I was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never had an experience is </v>

3412
02:28:18.660 --> 02:28:18.660
<v Speaker 3>transformative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is this An osca.</v>

3413
02:28:18.660 --> 02:28:20.770
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can't even quite describe it,</v>

3414
02:28:20.771 --> 02:28:25.771
<v Speaker 3>but I was shocked the next morning that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world had ended and everybody </v>

3415
02:28:25.771 --> 02:28:30.430
<v Speaker 3>experienced this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody in the room was even close to </v>

3416
02:28:30.430 --> 02:28:31.820
<v Speaker 3>this and I'd had the most transformative</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience of my life.</v>

3417
02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:34.360
<v Speaker 3>And to them it was just another night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3418
02:28:34.361 --> 02:28:35.150
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3419
02:28:35.151 --> 02:28:37.040
<v Speaker 3>that's the weirdest thing about doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>dmt,</v>

3420
02:28:37.041 --> 02:28:39.860
<v Speaker 3>that you're sitting on a couch and </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside your house,</v>

3421
02:28:39.861 --> 02:28:42.050
<v Speaker 3>nothing's changed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but inside your head,</v>

3422
02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:47.120
<v Speaker 3>a whirlwind of possibilities have opened</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've all of a sudden seeing a </v>

3423
02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:48.920
<v Speaker 3>world that couldn't possibly have ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>existed,</v>

3424
02:28:48.921 --> 02:28:51.170
<v Speaker 3>even in your imagination just a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes before,</v>

3425
02:28:51.470 --> 02:28:54.050
<v Speaker 3>even in your imagination as a strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement.</v>

3426
02:28:54.051 --> 02:28:57.260
<v Speaker 3>But it's absolutely true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you do dmt,</v>

3427
02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:59.810
<v Speaker 3>if you've never done it and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakthrough experience,</v>

3428
02:28:59.870 --> 02:29:02.930
<v Speaker 3>the one thing that everybody always says</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3429
02:29:02.931 --> 02:29:04.310
<v Speaker 3>I never saw that coming.</v>

3430
02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never would have imagined that that was </v>

3431
02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:09.640
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3432
02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:09.640
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3433
02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:09.980
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the things that do happen,</v>

3434
02:29:09.981 --> 02:29:13.370
<v Speaker 3>but whether they're happening in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>head or somewhere else,</v>

3435
02:29:13.371 --> 02:29:16.900
<v Speaker 3>it's just hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they're both are both iowasca,</v>

3436
02:29:16.901 --> 02:29:17.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3437
02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:20.990
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of what happens is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>your intention is going in.</v>

3438
02:29:21.050 --> 02:29:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3439
02:29:22.370 --> 02:29:27.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had had one x one experience where I </v>

3440
02:29:27.370 --> 02:29:27.370
<v Speaker 3>want to get rid of my fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was really,</v>

3441
02:29:27.370 --> 02:29:29.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't watch the fear factor because</v>

3442
02:29:29.661 --> 02:29:34.190
<v Speaker 3>it was just so made me fearful a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a wimp,</v>

3443
02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:36.940
<v Speaker 3>ya know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm making the wine.</v>

3444
02:29:38.060 --> 02:29:43.060
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I deCided that that was the night I </v>

3445
02:29:43.060 --> 02:29:43.060
<v Speaker 3>want to get rid of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3446
02:29:43.060 --> 02:29:45.810
<v Speaker 3>you fast watching fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you decided you want to deny Alaska.</v>

3447
02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:46.970
<v Speaker 3>It was my intention that night.</v>

3448
02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:48.420
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't fear factor.</v>

3449
02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:51.150
<v Speaker 3>I'd never go on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3450
02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:52.800
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

3451
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:53.450
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3452
02:29:53.540 --> 02:29:58.540
<v Speaker 3>you fast the day before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'd been fasting since around eight </v>

3453
02:29:58.540 --> 02:29:59.090
<v Speaker 3>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only had a few sips of water.</v>

3454
02:29:59.091 --> 02:30:02.570
<v Speaker 3>So there's nothing in my stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you purge,</v>

3455
02:30:02.571 --> 02:30:03.890
<v Speaker 3>you vomit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes you don't.</v>

3456
02:30:03.891 --> 02:30:06.230
<v Speaker 3>The first half dozen times I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not vomit.</v>

3457
02:30:06.650 --> 02:30:08.320
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you get disappointed too.</v>

3458
02:30:08.321 --> 02:30:09.980
<v Speaker 3>Once you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you get into the purging,</v>

3459
02:30:09.981 --> 02:30:13.340
<v Speaker 3>then you realize it's like being inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fireworks display.</v>

3460
02:30:13.341 --> 02:30:15.200
<v Speaker 3>It's really spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>sounds gross.</v>

3461
02:30:15.201 --> 02:30:16.910
<v Speaker 3>But really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so as you throwing up,</v>

3462
02:30:16.911 --> 02:30:17.780
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3463
02:30:17.790 --> 02:30:18.670
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3464
02:30:18.671 --> 02:30:21.710
<v Speaker 3>it just amps the whole experience up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's close to an orgasm.</v>

3465
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:26.150
<v Speaker 3>Not real close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's that that's what it'll bring to</v>

3466
02:30:26.151 --> 02:30:28.290
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyhow,</v>

3467
02:30:28.291 --> 02:30:29.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sit there and,</v>

3468
02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:32.120
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden a little voice will </v>
<v Speaker 3>come into your head and said,</v>

3469
02:30:32.270 --> 02:30:36.230
<v Speaker 3>grab your bucket because you sit with an</v>
<v Speaker 3>empty bucket and I can grab your bucket.</v>

3470
02:30:36.410 --> 02:30:41.410
<v Speaker 3>And whenever I hear that little voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grabbed my bucket because I know I'm </v>

3471
02:30:41.410 --> 02:30:44.460
<v Speaker 3>excited to throw up the first few times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but after awhile I got into it and it </v>

3472
02:30:47.031 --> 02:30:49.400
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab your bucket and said,</v>

3473
02:30:49.401 --> 02:30:54.401
<v Speaker 3>we're getting rid of your fear tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I've started purging and purging </v>

3474
02:30:54.401 --> 02:30:56.390
<v Speaker 3>and purging and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh wow.</v>

3475
02:30:56.391 --> 02:30:58.130
<v Speaker 3>I finally goT rid of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

3476
02:30:58.131 --> 02:31:03.110
<v Speaker 3>you got more to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I purged for 45 minutes and the next</v>

3477
02:31:03.111 --> 02:31:07.190
<v Speaker 3>morning I go to empty the bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple inches of black crap in</v>

3478
02:31:07.191 --> 02:31:08.180
<v Speaker 3>this bucket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3479
02:31:08.181 --> 02:31:10.400
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't have hardly anything in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>stomach.</v>

3480
02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:15.680
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and according to the way the shamans </v>

3481
02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:15.680
<v Speaker 3>speak is your psychic energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're purging.</v>

3482
02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:20.160
<v Speaker 3>And so I really had a visual pouring my </v>
<v Speaker 3>fear down the toilet in the morning.</v>

3483
02:31:20.310 --> 02:31:25.310
<v Speaker 4>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would've saved that shit and sanitary </v>

3484
02:31:25.310 --> 02:31:27.030
<v Speaker 4>lab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you imagine the isolated a new </v>

3485
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:27.030
<v Speaker 4>compounds?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never thought of that.</v>

3486
02:31:28.380 --> 02:31:33.380
<v Speaker 4>That fear is actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something exists in your body can be </v>

3487
02:31:33.380 --> 02:31:33.380
<v Speaker 4>removed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's.</v>

3488
02:31:33.380 --> 02:31:34.220
<v Speaker 4>I wish I'd thought of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what lab,</v>

3489
02:31:34.221 --> 02:31:35.380
<v Speaker 4>but send it to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it?</v>

3490
02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:36.900
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we'll find out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just like spaghetti.</v>

3491
02:31:37.450 --> 02:31:40.790
<v Speaker 4>You have some old spaghetti ingestion is</v>
<v Speaker 4>not fear.</v>

3492
02:31:40.890 --> 02:31:43.150
<v Speaker 4>During the years when you were smoking </v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes.</v>

3493
02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:47.310
<v Speaker 4>Left some stuff on the walls of some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some cigarette graffiti.</v>

3494
02:31:47.850 --> 02:31:52.850
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should have taken pictures of it or </v>

3495
02:31:52.850 --> 02:31:52.850
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3496
02:31:52.850 --> 02:31:52.850
<v Speaker 4>you know at the time you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 4>think of those things.</v>

3497
02:31:53.310 --> 02:31:54.980
<v Speaker 4>Could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible that it was just all like</v>

3498
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.920
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He drank.</v>

3499
02:31:55.921 --> 02:31:59.490
<v Speaker 4>He drank too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He only drink a little shot.</v>

3500
02:31:59.500 --> 02:32:00.960
<v Speaker 4>A little shot glass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3501
02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:04.310
<v Speaker 4>So how was it two inches of liquid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was in it was just.</v>

3502
02:32:04.940 --> 02:32:05.350
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

3503
02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:10.520
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was not real thick and it was just </v>

3504
02:32:10.520 --> 02:32:10.520
<v Speaker 3>bile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it looked black.</v>

3505
02:32:10.520 --> 02:32:12.370
<v Speaker 1>What it smelled like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puke.</v>

3506
02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Puke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3507
02:32:13.480 --> 02:32:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

3508
02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:18.050
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should've taken a picture of that.</v>

3509
02:32:18.051 --> 02:32:21.140
<v Speaker 4>That sounds like pretty intense stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then once it was,</v>

3510
02:32:21.220 --> 02:32:24.130
<v Speaker 4>is it possible you were still high when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you saw two inches of a.</v>

3511
02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:29.230
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was awesome.</v>

3512
02:32:32.710 --> 02:32:33.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

3513
02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:34.710
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take,</v>

3514
02:32:34.750 --> 02:32:36.340
<v Speaker 3>you drink it about eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>8:00</v>

3515
02:32:36.341 --> 02:32:37.660
<v Speaker 3>at night or so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3516
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:40.420
<v Speaker 3>And then by two in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three in the morning,</v>

3517
02:32:40.421 --> 02:32:43.240
<v Speaker 3>you're your most of the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to base,</v>

3518
02:32:43.241 --> 02:32:45.040
<v Speaker 3>back to baseline and sometimes say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

3519
02:32:45.041 --> 02:32:46.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm back to baseline and you find you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't stand up,</v>

3520
02:32:47.320 --> 02:32:49.960
<v Speaker 3>but then you sleep on the floor there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and get up in the morning.</v>

3521
02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:55.320
<v Speaker 3>By the next morning you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pretty much back to baseline as </v>

3522
02:32:55.320 --> 02:32:58.411
<v Speaker 3>far as the chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're still in the thrall of the </v>

3523
02:32:58.411 --> 02:32:58.411
<v Speaker 3>thing and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3524
02:32:58.411 --> 02:32:58.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3525
02:32:58.411 --> 02:33:00.330
<v Speaker 3>you're somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

3526
02:33:00.370 --> 02:33:02.040
<v Speaker 3>it might've been two millimeters,</v>

3527
02:33:04.130 --> 02:33:05.490
<v Speaker 4>but either way there was something in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

3528
02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:07.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to change my memory of it </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

3529
02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:09.540
<v Speaker 4>That's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just hang onto it.</v>

3530
02:33:09.570 --> 02:33:14.460
<v Speaker 4>That's how jesus got started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Write it down in about a year.</v>

3531
02:33:14.670 --> 02:33:16.620
<v Speaker 4>he lasted for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell it to a bunch of people.</v>

3532
02:33:16.621 --> 02:33:19.470
<v Speaker 4>Let it get crazier and crazier every </v>
<v Speaker 4>time you tell it that a few years later,</v>

3533
02:33:19.471 --> 02:33:21.870
<v Speaker 4>write it down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but write it down in like metaphors,</v>

3534
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:22.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3535
02:33:22.610 --> 02:33:24.870
<v Speaker 4>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>latin and parables and you know,</v>

3536
02:33:25.640 --> 02:33:29.520
<v Speaker 4>because I speak very well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a guy in a,</v>

3537
02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:33.320
<v Speaker 1>there's a scholar in jerusalem that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3538
02:33:33.660 --> 02:33:36.270
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Israel who wants to,</v>

3539
02:33:36.271 --> 02:33:37.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3540
02:33:37.621 --> 02:33:42.621
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to push the idea that moses </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on psychedelics when he found the </v>

3541
02:33:42.621 --> 02:33:45.840
<v Speaker 1>tablets and that the burning bush was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the acacia bush,</v>

3542
02:33:46.020 --> 02:33:48.510
<v Speaker 1>which is rich and dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's burning.</v>

3543
02:33:48.511 --> 02:33:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Like in burning the bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he saw god.</v>

3544
02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:55.460
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to say that this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What this meant was they burned the </v>

3545
02:33:55.460 --> 02:33:55.680
<v Speaker 1>contents of this plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just getting many,</v>

3546
02:33:55.681 --> 02:33:56.190
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

3547
02:33:56.191 --> 02:34:00.120
<v Speaker 1>many translations from ancient hebrew to</v>
<v Speaker 1>latin to greek.</v>

3548
02:34:00.330 --> 02:34:02.190
<v Speaker 1>The fact that to this day in ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>hebrew,</v>

3549
02:34:02.191 --> 02:34:05.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of dispute about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>things mean in the first place.</v>

3550
02:34:05.261 --> 02:34:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Like for folks who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient hebrew didn't have,</v>

3551
02:34:08.641 --> 02:34:11.400
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so letters doubled his numbers.</v>

3552
02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:14.190
<v Speaker 1>So the letter a was also the number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3553
02:34:14.310 --> 02:34:19.310
<v Speaker 1>So words had numerical value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the word and the word god have the </v>

3554
02:34:19.310 --> 02:34:19.870
<v Speaker 1>same numerical value.</v>

3555
02:34:19.870 --> 02:34:24.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a really strange system that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost the context of all these magical </v>

3556
02:34:25.301 --> 02:34:28.930
<v Speaker 1>sort of definitions of things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptions of things because there was</v>

3557
02:34:28.931 --> 02:34:33.640
<v Speaker 1>a mathematical qualities to these words </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we went to this to this day we.</v>

3558
02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:38.680
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a unique way of looking at </v>

3559
02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:38.680
<v Speaker 1>things in comparison to how we look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>things today.</v>

3560
02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:42.751
<v Speaker 1>We look at words and then we look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics is being completely </v>

3561
02:34:42.751 --> 02:34:45.511
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had it all kind of combined </v>

3562
02:34:45.511 --> 02:34:46.870
<v Speaker 1>together in some sort of a weird ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>language that doesn't exist anymore.</v>

3563
02:34:46.990 --> 02:34:51.990
<v Speaker 1>So when people try to translate it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you go from that to latin and greek</v>

3564
02:34:52.901 --> 02:34:55.860
<v Speaker 1>and it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all weird now.</v>

3565
02:34:55.880 --> 02:34:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when these guys are trying to go back</v>

3566
02:34:58.991 --> 02:35:00.670
<v Speaker 1>and look at these original descriptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

3567
02:35:00.671 --> 02:35:05.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one burning bush might very well be the </v>

3568
02:35:05.671 --> 02:35:05.671
<v Speaker 1>acacia bushes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

3569
02:35:05.671 --> 02:35:07.930
<v Speaker 1>It's prominent in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they had figured out a way to get</v>

3570
02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:12.990
<v Speaker 1>dmt from this bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had figured out a way to do some </v>

3571
02:35:12.990 --> 02:35:12.990
<v Speaker 1>kind of a process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And extracted,</v>

3572
02:35:13.060 --> 02:35:18.060
<v Speaker 1>that could be how they described it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things that mark </v>

3573
02:35:18.060 --> 02:35:18.060
<v Speaker 1>john,</v>
<v Speaker 1>margo allegro,</v>

3574
02:35:18.060 --> 02:35:22.801
<v Speaker 1>it said about the bible when they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied the dead sea scrolls and he </v>

3575
02:35:22.801 --> 02:35:24.130
<v Speaker 1>wrote that book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sacred mushroom in the cross.</v>

3576
02:35:24.430 --> 02:35:29.430
<v Speaker 1>He was saying that they were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hide these things from the romans when </v>

3577
02:35:29.430 --> 02:35:33.571
<v Speaker 1>they were capturing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were originally writing these </v>

3578
02:35:33.571 --> 02:35:35.551
<v Speaker 1>things down and what they really were </v>
<v Speaker 1>were descriptions of psychedelic </v>

3579
02:35:35.551 --> 02:35:39.751
<v Speaker 1>mushroom consumption and of fertility </v>
<v Speaker 1>cults that they hit all these stories </v>

3580
02:35:40.661 --> 02:35:44.140
<v Speaker 1>and in parables because they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the information,</v>

3581
02:35:44.141 --> 02:35:46.290
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't want other people to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to access it.</v>

3582
02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:51.840
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard you mentioned that book we have </v>

3583
02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:51.840
<v Speaker 3>before and you said you got an old </v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>

3584
02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:55.461
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a couple of young urban health </v>

3585
02:35:55.461 --> 02:35:55.461
<v Speaker 3>republished it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's still a bit.</v>

3586
02:35:55.461 --> 02:35:55.461
<v Speaker 3>You can get it on amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3587
02:35:55.461 --> 02:35:56.110
<v Speaker 3>It's very cool to</v>

3588
02:35:56.240 --> 02:35:56.860
<v Speaker 1>done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3589
02:35:56.861 --> 02:35:59.050
<v Speaker 1>you can get it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I bought it,</v>

3590
02:35:59.051 --> 02:36:02.770
<v Speaker 1>I bought it many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years ago because of jack herer yon</v>

3591
02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:07.800
<v Speaker 1>introduced me to jack hair and jack </v>
<v Speaker 1>herer was working on a book with this </v>

3592
02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:12.690
<v Speaker 1>other guy who turned out to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pedophile like wind up murdered in jail </v>

3593
02:36:12.690 --> 02:36:13.390
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really crazy stuff,</v>

3594
02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:18.720
<v Speaker 1>but they were working on this book about</v>
<v Speaker 1>santa claus and the connection between a</v>

3595
02:36:18.820 --> 02:36:23.820
<v Speaker 1>santa claus and the amanita miscarry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A mushroom and the crank have read all </v>

3596
02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:23.820
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>

3597
02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was basically all his work and then</v>

3598
02:36:24.551 --> 02:36:29.551
<v Speaker 1>it was the connection between psilocybin</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and religious experiences and </v>

3599
02:36:29.551 --> 02:36:33.600
<v Speaker 1>jack had all these old images like </v>
<v Speaker 1>really old images of ancient paintings </v>

3600
02:36:34.180 --> 02:36:39.170
<v Speaker 1>that showed naked people dancing under </v>
<v Speaker 1>this translucent mushroom and that there</v>

3601
02:36:39.171 --> 02:36:44.171
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was their way of describing being </v>

3602
02:36:44.171 --> 02:36:46.651
<v Speaker 1>under the excess and then he showed me </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different religious religious </v>

3603
02:36:47.681 --> 02:36:52.681
<v Speaker 1>institutions and buildings and places </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had mushroom shaped doorways and </v>

3604
02:36:52.681 --> 02:36:54.730
<v Speaker 1>had mushroom iconography and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms all over the place.</v>

3605
02:36:54.731 --> 02:36:59.731
<v Speaker 1>So you didn't even think of with </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms like the way a cardinals ca </v>

3606
02:36:59.731 --> 02:37:03.780
<v Speaker 1>outfit is red and white and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>like saying like signifies the ancient </v>

3607
02:37:05.230 --> 02:37:10.230
<v Speaker 1>images of halos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen the ancient images of halos </v>

3608
02:37:10.230 --> 02:37:12.580
<v Speaker 1>is a mushroom cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is a mushroom cap.</v>

3609
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a lot of those old images in </v>

3610
02:37:18.190 --> 02:37:20.320
<v Speaker 3>the first century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The so called christian churches had a </v>

3611
02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:20.320
<v Speaker 3>lot of mushrooms.</v>

3612
02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They art.</v>

3613
02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:25.520
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hulu thing floating or above their </v>

3614
02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:28.221
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have this thing behind them which </v>

3615
02:37:28.221 --> 02:37:28.221
<v Speaker 1>showed this mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3616
02:37:28.221 --> 02:37:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean with literally all the lines </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the app,</v>

3617
02:37:30.810 --> 02:37:32.370
<v Speaker 1>pull it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull up images if you can.</v>

3618
02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:36.660
<v Speaker 1>There's an article where I linked to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a santa claus was a mushroom.</v>

3619
02:37:37.180 --> 02:37:41.010
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote it in like 2007 from my website.</v>

3620
02:37:41.011 --> 02:37:45.780
<v Speaker 1>It's on joe rogan.net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I put in it a bunch of photographs.</v>

3621
02:37:46.020 --> 02:37:50.520
<v Speaker 1>A couple of them have ancient people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had mushroom caps for,</v>

3622
02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:51.680
<v Speaker 1>for their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their,</v>

3623
02:37:51.690 --> 02:37:52.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their.</v>

3624
02:37:52.970 --> 02:37:57.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only about the last few thousand </v>

3625
02:37:57.970 --> 02:37:58.730
<v Speaker 3>years that this has been suppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was pretty active psychodelic,</v>

3626
02:37:58.731 --> 02:38:00.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the ancient time.</v>

3627
02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:04.160
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that this is all true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sounds like nonsense.</v>

3628
02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:06.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sounds like some flat earth shit,</v>

3629
02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:08.700
<v Speaker 1>like when you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know any better and you're,</v>

3630
02:38:08.701 --> 02:38:10.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're listening to you and I talk about</v>

3631
02:38:10.881 --> 02:38:13.040
<v Speaker 1>this quite a bit in one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's well documented.</v>

3632
02:38:13.730 --> 02:38:18.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of documentation about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of information that shows </v>

3633
02:38:18.730 --> 02:38:19.860
<v Speaker 1>that there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3634
02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:22.030
<v Speaker 1>not just the christian religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but many,</v>

3635
02:38:22.031 --> 02:38:22.550
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

3636
02:38:22.551 --> 02:38:24.830
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many religions were aware of psychedelic</v>

3637
02:38:24.831 --> 02:38:27.900
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's going to pull up this.</v>

3638
02:38:28.460 --> 02:38:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Did you find it yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3639
02:38:31.340 --> 02:38:32.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3640
02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:32.810
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3641
02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:37.840
<v Speaker 1>the images that Jack Harris showed me </v>
<v Speaker 1>were really unique and I haven't been </v>

3642
02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:39.770
<v Speaker 1>able to locate him since he was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of a book before he had a stroke.</v>

3643
02:38:39.890 --> 02:38:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a shame.</v>

3644
02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really sad.</v>

3645
02:38:41.991 --> 02:38:44.870
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him and then he had a,</v>

3646
02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:47.600
<v Speaker 1>he had a stroke and then he had a second</v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke as well.</v>

3647
02:38:47.601 --> 02:38:50.450
<v Speaker 1>I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe after the first one he was,</v>

3648
02:38:50.451 --> 02:38:52.430
<v Speaker 1>because he was having difficulty talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

3649
02:38:52.610 --> 02:38:55.680
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't as bad and then apparently</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad one,</v>

3650
02:38:56.140 --> 02:38:59.150
<v Speaker 1>but they were in the middle of creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>this book and his,</v>

3651
02:38:59.470 --> 02:39:00.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3652
02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:02.150
<v Speaker 1>his story was fascinating because jack </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair,</v>

3653
02:39:02.151 --> 02:39:07.151
<v Speaker 1>like you was a republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a goldwater republican as you </v>

3654
02:39:07.151 --> 02:39:08.750
<v Speaker 1>described it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he got divorced and met a girl</v>

3655
02:39:10.690 --> 02:39:11.740
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Opened up,</v>

3656
02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:12.230
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

3657
02:39:12.231 --> 02:39:12.740
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

3658
02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:13.420
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3659
02:39:13.450 --> 02:39:18.450
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the ufo thing may be a dmt </v>
<v Speaker 3>released about 10 or 12 years ago.</v>

3660
02:39:18.791 --> 02:39:23.791
<v Speaker 3>I corresponded with quit whitney driver </v>
<v Speaker 3>because in one of his books he had said </v>

3661
02:39:23.791 --> 02:39:25.360
<v Speaker 3>something that to me sounded just like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dmt trip.</v>

3662
02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:26.890
<v Speaker 3>And he allowed his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3663
02:39:26.891 --> 02:39:29.560
<v Speaker 3>that might be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then about a year or so later,</v>

3664
02:39:29.561 --> 02:39:33.360
<v Speaker 3>he did a radio show with a straussman </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you were in his movie,</v>

3665
02:39:33.370 --> 02:39:35.230
<v Speaker 3>a spirit molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3666
02:39:35.231 --> 02:39:35.890
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3667
02:39:36.060 --> 02:39:37.960
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two agreed that this could,</v>

3668
02:39:38.190 --> 02:39:42.970
<v Speaker 3>some of the abduction experiences could </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a spontaneous release of dmt.</v>

3669
02:39:43.340 --> 02:39:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense to me why,</v>

3670
02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:50.080
<v Speaker 1>when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are all these experiences where </v>

3671
02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:50.880
<v Speaker 1>people are getting abducted all </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in the middle of the night and</v>

3672
02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:55.920
<v Speaker 1>that's when your brain is producing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most dmt allegedly mean they know for a </v>

3673
02:39:55.920 --> 02:40:00.131
<v Speaker 1>fact now that's been proven by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cottonwood research work that </v>

3674
02:40:00.131 --> 02:40:00.680
<v Speaker 1>strassman's done cottonwood research </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation.</v>

3675
02:40:00.980 --> 02:40:03.980
<v Speaker 1>They've found dmt and a live rats pineal</v>
<v Speaker 1>gland.</v>

3676
02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:09.580
<v Speaker 1>They found that regional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they know for a fact that the pineal </v>

3677
02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:09.580
<v Speaker 1>gland is a source of.</v>

3678
02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:13.840
<v Speaker 3>That's the first I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A real research because it has been </v>

3679
02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:14.000
<v Speaker 3>speculated on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but had really turned it</v>

3680
02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:14.670
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3681
02:40:14.671 --> 02:40:15.460
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3682
02:40:15.540 --> 02:40:20.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll pull up the article because it's </v>

3683
02:40:20.540 --> 02:40:20.640
<v Speaker 1>pretty interesting found and live rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland.</v>

3684
02:40:21.220 --> 02:40:26.220
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's one thing that they've </v>

3685
02:40:26.220 --> 02:40:26.250
<v Speaker 1>always pointed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of anecdotal evidence,</v>

3686
02:40:26.730 --> 02:40:31.730
<v Speaker 1>especially the ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancient religious work of the third </v>

3687
02:40:31.730 --> 02:40:33.470
<v Speaker 1>eye itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol of mysticism,</v>

3688
02:40:33.660 --> 02:40:37.530
<v Speaker 1>much like the mushroom cap being the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the halo why,</v>

3689
02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:39.370
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're just now getting back and,</v>

3690
02:40:39.371 --> 02:40:44.371
<v Speaker 3>and unfortunately we've lost so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that humans had at one time </v>

3691
02:40:44.371 --> 02:40:49.021
<v Speaker 3>about these substances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think part of the transition that </v>

3692
02:40:49.021 --> 02:40:49.021
<v Speaker 3>took place was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3693
02:40:49.021 --> 02:40:51.510
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rights of looses a were,</v>

3694
02:40:51.570 --> 02:40:54.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many thousands of people went through</v>

3695
02:40:54.011 --> 02:40:55.840
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That lasted for a couple thousand Years.</v>

3696
02:40:55.841 --> 02:41:00.841
<v Speaker 3>But in about 300 bc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the state took over control of the </v>

3697
02:41:00.841 --> 02:41:02.350
<v Speaker 3>rights and once the government took over</v>
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>

3698
02:41:02.680 --> 02:41:03.580
<v Speaker 3>things changed.</v>

3699
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:08.000
<v Speaker 1>This is the article on the cottonwood </v>
<v Speaker 1>research.org</v>

3700
02:41:08.001 --> 02:41:13.001
<v Speaker 1>website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is strassman's foundation says </v>

3701
02:41:13.001 --> 02:41:16.151
<v Speaker 1>we're excited to announce the acceptance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of for publication of a paper </v>

3702
02:41:16.151 --> 02:41:18.650
<v Speaker 1>documenting the presence of dmt and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland of live rodents.</v>

3703
02:41:18.651 --> 02:41:23.651
<v Speaker 1>The paperwork will appear in the journal</v>
<v Speaker 1>biomedical chromatography and describes </v>

3704
02:41:26.721 --> 02:41:29.770
<v Speaker 1>experiments that took place in dr joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>schmo bore.</v>

3705
02:41:29.771 --> 02:41:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy is a weird name.</v>

3706
02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:33.500
<v Speaker 1>B o r g I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>g I,</v>

3707
02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:38.120
<v Speaker 1>j I g I n,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b o r j I g I n.</v>

3708
02:41:38.150 --> 02:41:41.930
<v Speaker 1>How do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or does aj and a g together.</v>

3709
02:41:41.931 --> 02:41:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you trying to do to people?</v>

3710
02:41:44.270 --> 02:41:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck would you put aj and a g </v>
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>

3711
02:41:46.221 --> 02:41:47.600
<v Speaker 1>One of the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You greedy bitch.</v>

3712
02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:50.600
<v Speaker 1>They're both sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that saying?</v>

3713
02:41:50.900 --> 02:41:55.310
<v Speaker 1>See those images you see the one mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is about as clear as day.</v>

3714
02:41:55.340 --> 02:41:57.680
<v Speaker 1>That's the bottom of a goddamn machines </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the spores will come.</v>

3715
02:41:57.840 --> 02:41:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one.</v>

3716
02:41:58.311 --> 02:42:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Don't go to youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one on my website.</v>

3717
02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you google it?</v>

3718
02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck happened.</v>

3719
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:09.860
<v Speaker 3>So have you ever seen a machine elf or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>self transforming basketball?</v>

3720
02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:11.420
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't either.</v>

3721
02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:16.480
<v Speaker 3>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I finally figured out those self </v>

3722
02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:19.190
<v Speaker 3>transforming basketballs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured out I'm seeing the same thing,</v>

3723
02:42:19.191 --> 02:42:21.500
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't call it that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd call it something else.</v>

3724
02:42:22.700 --> 02:42:23.490
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

3725
02:42:23.570 --> 02:42:28.570
<v Speaker 3>that's why I never described what I see </v>
<v Speaker 3>because then you plant that seed in </v>

3726
02:42:28.570 --> 02:42:31.691
<v Speaker 3>somebody's head and terrence did Plant </v>
<v Speaker 3>the seed of the self transforming </v>

3727
02:42:31.691 --> 02:42:34.160
<v Speaker 3>machine elves and the basketball's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>jeweled basketballs.</v>

3728
02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:37.190
<v Speaker 3>And I think that if you get rid of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>

3729
02:42:37.191 --> 02:42:39.980
<v Speaker 3>those labels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see things that you could say,</v>

3730
02:42:39.981 --> 02:42:41.030
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could say that,</v>

3731
02:42:41.031 --> 02:42:45.140
<v Speaker 3>but I'd rather say this about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people get disappointed when</v>

3732
02:42:45.141 --> 02:42:48.680
<v Speaker 3>they smoked dmt and they don't see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine elves in the basketballs.</v>

3733
02:42:49.290 --> 02:42:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means.</v>

3734
02:42:51.330 --> 02:42:54.130
<v Speaker 1>The machine elves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basketballs on this stuff is,</v>

3735
02:42:54.131 --> 02:42:59.131
<v Speaker 1>is my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my website down or some point that it </v>

3736
02:42:59.131 --> 02:42:59.850
<v Speaker 1>was linking back to the new podcast side</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason.</v>

3737
02:43:00.750 --> 02:43:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the links are bad.</v>

3738
02:43:01.981 --> 02:43:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No way.</v>

3739
02:43:04.021 --> 02:43:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>HM.</v>

3740
02:43:06.420 --> 02:43:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I found it in two seconds.</v>

3741
02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:10.440
<v Speaker 1>If you Go to wordpress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can still find it.</v>

3742
02:43:10.441 --> 02:43:13.750
<v Speaker 1>But the images there I found that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any images flow was looking for.</v>

3743
02:43:13.751 --> 02:43:16.180
<v Speaker 1>So I've got to get these guys to fix my </v>
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>

3744
02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:19.960
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit that although that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be up there with photographs none</v>

3745
02:43:19.961 --> 02:43:22.150
<v Speaker 1>up there and none of it's up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh great.</v>

3746
02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Not that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least somewhere else.</v>

3747
02:43:24.250 --> 02:43:25.850
<v Speaker 1>How dare they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3748
02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:31.200
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's probably pretty obvious</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you're dealing with people that </v>

3749
02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:34.951
<v Speaker 1>lived a long time ago and we know for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that these substances existed a </v>

3750
02:43:34.951 --> 02:43:35.080
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been here forever.</v>

3751
02:43:35.380 --> 02:43:37.600
<v Speaker 1>So people would have found them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have ate them.</v>

3752
02:43:37.630 --> 02:43:42.630
<v Speaker 1>They were freaked out and they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have told everybody or try to tell </v>

3753
02:43:42.630 --> 02:43:44.290
<v Speaker 1>people that they cared about or just </v>
<v Speaker 1>information just like we do.</v>

3754
02:43:44.730 --> 02:43:46.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's withoUt a doubt,</v>

3755
02:43:46.961 --> 02:43:51.961
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be like one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful things that can happeN to a </v>

3756
02:43:51.961 --> 02:43:51.961
<v Speaker 1>person outside of dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3757
02:43:51.961 --> 02:43:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Outside of having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having children dying,</v>

3758
02:43:53.980 --> 02:43:55.510
<v Speaker 1>losing a loved one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have You.</v>

3759
02:43:55.810 --> 02:44:00.810
<v Speaker 1>One of the most powerful things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences that you can have is a </v>

3760
02:44:00.810 --> 02:44:00.810
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

3761
02:44:00.810 --> 02:44:01.840
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be missed whether you never</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a second one or not.</v>

3762
02:44:01.841 --> 02:44:02.890
<v Speaker 3>You should at least have one.</v>

3763
02:44:03.150 --> 02:44:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

3764
02:44:04.010 --> 02:44:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just amazing that it's illegal </v>

3765
02:44:09.010 --> 02:44:10.791
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that they've been able to </v>

3766
02:44:10.791 --> 02:44:12.120
<v Speaker 1>hold on this long with everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know now about what is legal.</v>

3767
02:44:12.210 --> 02:44:13.800
<v Speaker 1>We talked about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cIgarettes,</v>

3768
02:44:15.010 --> 02:44:16.320
<v Speaker 1>cremini,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you trying to do?</v>

3769
02:44:16.380 --> 02:44:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Trying to keep everybody week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3770
02:44:19.260 --> 02:44:21.070
<v Speaker 1>if I was inclined to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

3771
02:44:21.090 --> 02:44:26.090
<v Speaker 1>There's the evidence right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was inclined to believe tHat they </v>

3772
02:44:26.090 --> 02:44:26.090
<v Speaker 1>are trying to keep people stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weak,</v>

3773
02:44:26.110 --> 02:44:29.270
<v Speaker 3>I buy into terrence's a theory that </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody's in charge.</v>

3774
02:44:29.300 --> 02:44:31.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of competing groups that</v>

3775
02:44:31.490 --> 02:44:36.490
<v Speaker 3>have a lot of power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not any one of them is in charge of </v>

3776
02:44:36.490 --> 02:44:39.281
<v Speaker 3>calling the shots and most of them are </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty stupid people that we think some </v>

3777
02:44:39.281 --> 02:44:40.880
<v Speaker 3>of these people are maybe smart because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have money or something.</v>

3778
02:44:40.881 --> 02:44:44.510
<v Speaker 3>Most of them inherited it or they got it</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a derivatives trader or something,</v>

3779
02:44:44.511 --> 02:44:49.190
<v Speaker 3>but most people in congress and politics</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no matter who you meet,</v>

3780
02:44:49.260 --> 02:44:51.010
<v Speaker 3>you know there's like you and I were all</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3781
02:44:51.130 --> 02:44:56.130
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them have experience in these </v>

3782
02:44:56.130 --> 02:44:58.301
<v Speaker 3>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we shouldn't give them all this </v>

3783
02:44:58.301 --> 02:44:58.301
<v Speaker 3>credence of being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Knowing all.</v>

3784
02:44:58.301 --> 02:44:59.260
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live a life that's.</v>

3785
02:44:59.310 --> 02:45:04.310
<v Speaker 1>That's the momentum of what they've done</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past and what their ancestors </v>

3786
02:45:04.310 --> 02:45:07.591
<v Speaker 1>have done and how they've gotten to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>position because of their family name </v>

3787
02:45:07.591 --> 02:45:10.321
<v Speaker 1>and the business that they grew up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in what happened and it's just a </v>

3788
02:45:10.321 --> 02:45:11.080
<v Speaker 1>momentous thing and once the family </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls a certain amount,</v>

3789
02:45:11.081 --> 02:45:16.081
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the world bank or whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's whatever the fuck you get all your </v>

3790
02:45:16.081 --> 02:45:16.081
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3791
02:45:16.081 --> 02:45:19.720
<v Speaker 1>your family owns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once someone has that kind of power and </v>

3792
02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:19.720
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not very,</v>

3793
02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:22.960
<v Speaker 1>it's not very likely that they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be willing to let that go</v>

3794
02:45:23.230 --> 02:45:25.240
<v Speaker 3>and they bring their children up in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>same moment,</v>

3795
02:45:25.370 --> 02:45:30.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to private schools are </v>

3796
02:45:30.370 --> 02:45:30.720
<v Speaker 3>meeting the same friends who are from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same kinds of families and so it's,</v>

3797
02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:32.440
<v Speaker 3>it's a inbreeding kind of thing.</v>

3798
02:45:32.470 --> 02:45:34.120
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the problems with </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>

3799
02:45:34.121 --> 02:45:39.121
<v Speaker 1>but I also think it's one of the ins and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the yang of life and one of the reasons </v>

3800
02:45:39.121 --> 02:45:42.541
<v Speaker 1>why there's so much motivation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to get things together today </v>

3801
02:45:42.541 --> 02:45:44.830
<v Speaker 1>because we see so much evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption and the hypocrisy.</v>

3802
02:45:44.831 --> 02:45:46.570
<v Speaker 1>We see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we get motivated.</v>

3803
02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:48.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the internet's changed everything.</v>

3804
02:45:48.450 --> 02:45:51.260
<v Speaker 3>We can see things without going through </v>
<v Speaker 3>a corporate sense or not to.</v>

3805
02:45:52.270 --> 02:45:54.230
<v Speaker 1>That's never happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

3806
02:45:54.250 --> 02:45:56.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think people are way more informed</v>
<v Speaker 1>now because of the,</v>

3807
02:45:56.430 --> 02:45:56.940
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3808
02:45:56.940 --> 02:45:58.590
<v Speaker 3>the internet's changed all the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3809
02:45:58.591 --> 02:46:00.030
<v Speaker 3>if the internet was around in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties,</v>

3810
02:46:00.031 --> 02:46:01.290
<v Speaker 3>there would have been a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>outcome.</v>

3811
02:46:01.350 --> 02:46:01.760
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3812
02:46:02.130 --> 02:46:07.130
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that what's going on now is </v>

3813
02:46:07.130 --> 02:46:07.130
<v Speaker 3>gonna make the sixties look like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fifties,</v>

3814
02:46:07.130 --> 02:46:07.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing.</v>

3815
02:46:07.680 --> 02:46:11.810
<v Speaker 3>I think slowly but surely people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>waking up to the idea that we aren't the</v>

3816
02:46:11.811 --> 02:46:14.380
<v Speaker 3>same people that we were in 1994.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3817
02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:20.020
<v Speaker 3>seven years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no iphone that has changed a </v>

3818
02:46:20.020 --> 02:46:20.020
<v Speaker 3>lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3819
02:46:20.020 --> 02:46:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Apps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3820
02:46:21.140 --> 02:46:26.000
<v Speaker 3>twitter and facebook and all that jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the ability to get like,</v>

3821
02:46:26.001 --> 02:46:28.170
<v Speaker 3>I love twitter because I get link sent </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me like,</v>

3822
02:46:28.490 --> 02:46:31.130
<v Speaker 3>check out this new scientific findings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this new discovery,</v>

3823
02:46:31.131 --> 02:46:32.720
<v Speaker 3>check out this video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is amazing.</v>

3824
02:46:32.721 --> 02:46:35.240
<v Speaker 3>This guy made this and look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

3825
02:46:35.270 --> 02:46:40.270
<v Speaker 3>the amount of interesting information </v>
<v Speaker 3>that comes to you directly on your </v>

3826
02:46:40.270 --> 02:46:42.110
<v Speaker 3>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a daily basis is pretty staggering.</v>

3827
02:46:42.690 --> 02:46:47.690
<v Speaker 3>When we were first trying to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>internet going and the phone companies </v>

3828
02:46:47.690 --> 02:46:47.690
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3829
02:46:47.690 --> 02:46:49.430
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't a lot of acceptance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody,</v>

3830
02:46:49.431 --> 02:46:51.950
<v Speaker 3>the banks wouldn't talk to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government wouldn't talk to us.</v>

3831
02:46:51.951 --> 02:46:54.810
<v Speaker 3>But our company bought bbn which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3832
02:46:54.980 --> 02:46:58.550
<v Speaker 3>built the original routers and have </v>
<v Speaker 3>control about a third of the backbone.</v>

3833
02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:00.680
<v Speaker 3>And we were watching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3834
02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:01.190
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3835
02:47:01.191 --> 02:47:04.010
<v Speaker 3>there's already a million people </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected to the internet.</v>

3836
02:47:04.430 --> 02:47:05.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 2 million now.</v>

3837
02:47:05.781 --> 02:47:09.800
<v Speaker 3>There's $5 million and we're comparing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with how fast phones a rolled out.</v>

3838
02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:12.830
<v Speaker 3>And it was just several orders of </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnitude faster.</v>

3839
02:47:13.070 --> 02:47:16.900
<v Speaker 3>But to get to where we are today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody 10 years ago would</v>

3840
02:47:16.901 --> 02:47:19.700
<v Speaker 3>have predicted to have a billion people </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected already.</v>

3841
02:47:19.790 --> 02:47:22.910
<v Speaker 3>Nobody saw it coming and nobody knows </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going to be here in 10 years.</v>

3842
02:47:23.350 --> 02:47:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3843
02:47:23.900 --> 02:47:26.630
<v Speaker 3>it'd be crazy to try to predict it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna be way weirder,</v>

3844
02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:27.700
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3845
02:47:27.750 --> 02:47:30.760
<v Speaker 3>and the iphone and the ipad and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wireless,</v>

3846
02:47:30.761 --> 02:47:33.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when I was in the business,</v>

3847
02:47:33.350 --> 02:47:35.720
<v Speaker 3>I was at the dinner afterwards we get </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

3848
02:47:35.790 --> 02:47:39.770
<v Speaker 3>I was representing the phone company so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd take me out to wine and dine me.</v>

3849
02:47:39.771 --> 02:47:44.771
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to this one guy who's the </v>

3850
02:47:44.771 --> 02:47:47.210
<v Speaker 3>president of a new combination of </v>
<v Speaker 3>netflix and netscape and a son,</v>

3851
02:47:47.270 --> 02:47:50.600
<v Speaker 3>they form an alliance and their senior </v>
<v Speaker 3>vice president was saying,</v>

3852
02:47:51.020 --> 02:47:56.020
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to start doing more research </v>

3853
02:47:56.020 --> 02:47:56.020
<v Speaker 3>and development in wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was before why,</v>

3854
02:47:56.020 --> 02:48:00.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was essentially no wireless and </v>

3855
02:48:00.721 --> 02:48:00.721
<v Speaker 3>this is the only like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3856
02:48:00.721 --> 02:48:00.980
<v Speaker 3>14 years ago or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

3857
02:48:01.010 --> 02:48:01.860
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wireless,</v>

3858
02:48:01.870 --> 02:48:04.880
<v Speaker 3>that's not gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says we're putting all of our r and d</v>

3859
02:48:04.881 --> 02:48:07.970
<v Speaker 3>money into it because we're all living </v>
<v Speaker 3>up in the hills over san jose.</v>

3860
02:48:08.180 --> 02:48:13.180
<v Speaker 3>And there was no internet connectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the time we retire we want high </v>

3861
02:48:13.180 --> 02:48:17.441
<v Speaker 3>speed wireless internet in their home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a lot of the motivation for </v>

3862
02:48:17.441 --> 02:48:17.441
<v Speaker 3>dol.</v>

3863
02:48:17.441 --> 02:48:19.100
<v Speaker 3>That's interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>personal interest in,</v>

3864
02:48:19.340 --> 02:48:24.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things people don't want to </v>

3865
02:48:24.340 --> 02:48:26.531
<v Speaker 3>talk about about the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but since we were running part of the </v>

3866
02:48:26.531 --> 02:48:29.951
<v Speaker 3>backbone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could go to watch it through the </v>

3867
02:48:29.951 --> 02:48:30.620
<v Speaker 3>network,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the knock and watch them,</v>

3868
02:48:31.060 --> 02:48:36.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>manage the traffic on the backbone of </v>

3869
02:48:36.060 --> 02:48:36.920
<v Speaker 3>the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was in an a week day,</v>

3870
02:48:37.010 --> 02:48:38.750
<v Speaker 3>around 3:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>or 4:00,</v>

3871
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:43.850
<v Speaker 3>a big spike would hit of usage on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>east coast.</v>

3872
02:48:44.980 --> 02:48:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Here's me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as the time would go four or five by</v>

3873
02:48:49.041 --> 02:48:54.041
<v Speaker 3>6:00,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the east coast spike would go down and </v>

3874
02:48:54.041 --> 02:48:54.320
<v Speaker 3>the midwest would be up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it was like a pig going through</v>

3875
02:48:54.321 --> 02:48:59.321
<v Speaker 3>a python and it was young kids coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>home from school before their parents </v>

3876
02:48:59.321 --> 02:49:03.020
<v Speaker 3>where they're downloading porn without </v>
<v Speaker 3>porn.</v>

3877
02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:08.030
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the phone companies wouldn't put all </v>

3878
02:49:08.030 --> 02:49:08.100
<v Speaker 3>that money into the backbone because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge business,</v>

3879
02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:10.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not always works though.</v>

3880
02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:14.520
<v Speaker 4>That's how the video recorder videotape </v>
<v Speaker 4>came out,</v>

3881
02:49:14.521 --> 02:49:16.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because people go to watch porn at home.</v>

3882
02:49:16.340 --> 02:49:17.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vhs,</v>

3887
02:49:27.810 --> 02:49:30.400
<v Speaker 4>The quality was better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was better.</v>

3888
02:49:30.580 --> 02:49:33.060
<v Speaker 4>You got to go with whatever the mass </v>
<v Speaker 4>produced thing is.</v>

3889
02:49:33.150 --> 02:49:38.150
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember those things that used </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have to go through to look at the </v>

3890

<v Speaker 4>porn?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You still have to go through beads or a </v>

3891

<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the doors and you go in a little cubby </v>

<v Speaker 4>hole or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>To have to go through so doors in order </v>

3894
02:49:47.970 --> 02:49:50.091
<v Speaker 4>to answer the warrants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then in the afternoon she could see </v>

3895
02:49:50.091 --> 02:49:50.730
<v Speaker 4>the cars from all the salesmen's cars </v>
<v Speaker 4>are parked out there,</v>

3896
02:49:50.731 --> 02:49:51.000
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

3897
02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:53.760
<v Speaker 4>And people just look at you so squirrely</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3898
02:49:53.800 --> 02:49:56.970
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I'm in this place.</v>

3899
02:49:56.971 --> 02:49:59.820
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't sit down on the seat.</v>

3900
02:50:00.730 --> 02:50:02.700
<v Speaker 4>The people were interesting like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

3901
02:50:02.701 --> 02:50:07.701
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't want you to know that they </v>

3902
02:50:07.701 --> 02:50:09.201
<v Speaker 4>like sex or like masturbating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they want to pretend like they </v>

3903
02:50:11.671 --> 02:50:12.890
<v Speaker 4>never do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

3904
02:50:12.900 --> 02:50:17.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fascinating aspect of us were so </v>

3905
02:50:17.900 --> 02:50:20.841
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that humans have always </v>

3906
02:50:20.841 --> 02:50:20.841
<v Speaker 4>been that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3907
02:50:20.841 --> 02:50:20.841
<v Speaker 4>I think really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3908
02:50:20.841 --> 02:50:20.920
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3909
02:50:21.090 --> 02:50:23.100
<v Speaker 4>the last 2000 years had been pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>repressive.</v>

3910
02:50:23.390 --> 02:50:28.390
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity largely I think organized </v>

3911
02:50:28.561 --> 02:50:29.080
<v Speaker 4>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3912
02:50:29.420 --> 02:50:34.420
<v Speaker 4>the sex thing was weird because we know </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of sex going on in the </v>

3913
02:50:34.420 --> 02:50:34.770
<v Speaker 4>clergy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3914
02:50:34.771 --> 02:50:36.000
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3915
02:50:36.001 --> 02:50:37.890
<v Speaker 4>the boy boy sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>etc.</v>

3916
02:50:37.920 --> 02:50:39.900
<v Speaker 4>But I think it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3917
02:50:39.901 --> 02:50:42.330
<v Speaker 4>you read about the borgia pope's and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that,</v>

3918
02:50:42.331 --> 02:50:47.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the higher elevations of the church </v>

3919
02:50:47.331 --> 02:50:48.180
<v Speaker 4>have always been big involved in sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they'd been telling the people no,</v>

3920
02:50:48.181 --> 02:50:48.690
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3921
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:53.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they used to have sex like popes and </v>

3922
02:50:53.870 --> 02:50:53.870
<v Speaker 4>priests and bishops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These to have sex with women.</v>

3923
02:50:53.900 --> 02:50:55.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>used to be like totally normal that they</v>

3924
02:50:55.681 --> 02:50:56.770
<v Speaker 4>had kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the pope's.</v>

3925
02:50:56.820 --> 02:50:57.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they had,</v>

3926
02:50:57.840 --> 02:51:01.080
<v Speaker 4>they were getting so much pussy guts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so out of control.</v>

3927
02:51:01.410 --> 02:51:02.160
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the pope,</v>

3928
02:51:02.190 --> 02:51:03.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's going to say no,</v>

3929
02:51:03.090 --> 02:51:05.160
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So people go and you know what,</v>

3930
02:51:05.220 --> 02:51:06.090
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

3931
02:51:06.360 --> 02:51:11.360
<v Speaker 4>You can't have sex anymore unless you </v>
<v Speaker 4>become a priest and join our little </v>

3932
02:51:11.401 --> 02:51:12.450
<v Speaker 4>group here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3933
02:51:12.630 --> 02:51:15.870
<v Speaker 4>but even then there wasn't even an </v>
<v Speaker 4>undercover sex with kids.</v>

3934
02:51:15.930 --> 02:51:20.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how the idea that an undercover </v>

3935
02:51:20.930 --> 02:51:24.141
<v Speaker 4>group of kid fuckers could run a </v>
<v Speaker 4>gigantic cult that would encapture like </v>

3936
02:51:25.710 --> 02:51:30.710
<v Speaker 4>a billion people worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That 2013 is in one of the most </v>

3937
02:51:30.721 --> 02:51:33.200
<v Speaker 4>incredible facts about our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our reality.</v>

3938
02:51:33.201 --> 02:51:34.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3939
02:51:34.291 --> 02:51:35.010
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

3940
02:51:35.011 --> 02:51:37.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was raised catholic and a altar boy.</v>

3941
02:51:37.530 --> 02:51:40.480
<v Speaker 4>I served mass all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all through four years of college even.</v>

3942
02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:42.390
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you ever get touched?</v>

3943
02:51:42.960 --> 02:51:44.280
<v Speaker 4>Never once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never will.</v>

3944
02:51:44.281 --> 02:51:49.281
<v Speaker 4>Never approached,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never touched nobody often just </v>

3945
02:51:49.281 --> 02:51:49.860
<v Speaker 4>cigarette or it's not a thing for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>drink.</v>

3946
02:51:50.100 --> 02:51:55.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those four years I was an altar boy </v>

3947
02:51:55.100 --> 02:51:57.171
<v Speaker 4>in college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never went to communion because I </v>

3948
02:51:57.171 --> 02:51:57.171
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't go to confession because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't want to tell him I masturbated,</v>

3949
02:51:58.060 --> 02:51:59.960
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3950
02:52:00.090 --> 02:52:02.400
<v Speaker 4>during all that time I was never once </v>
<v Speaker 4>approach.</v>

3951
02:52:02.401 --> 02:52:05.980
<v Speaker 4>But a guy he became a priest was a close</v>
<v Speaker 4>friend of mine when</v>

3952
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:07.750
<v Speaker 3>he was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to boy scout camp together.</v>

3953
02:52:07.751 --> 02:52:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Now he turned out to be a pedophile </v>
<v Speaker 3>priest,</v>

3954
02:52:10.301 --> 02:52:12.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a real tragedy for the family.</v>

3955
02:52:12.431 --> 02:52:13.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we knew all of these and</v>

3956
02:52:14.030 --> 02:52:19.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you think that that happens just </v>

3957
02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:20.561
<v Speaker 1>because of repression that someone has </v>
<v Speaker 1>an access to know sex and then when they</v>

3958
02:52:21.131 --> 02:52:23.780
<v Speaker 1>were on kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just almost are overwhelmed.</v>

3959
02:52:23.890 --> 02:52:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

3960
02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:29.840
<v Speaker 3>You know how you are when you're 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years old and it's all you think about </v>

3961
02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:29.840
<v Speaker 3>and if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're repressed,</v>

3962
02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:31.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe go wherever the first option is.</v>

3963
02:52:31.860 --> 02:52:36.860
<v Speaker 3>And the opportunity is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think he was actually </v>

3964
02:52:36.860 --> 02:52:40.260
<v Speaker 3>molested as a child because he and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>went through the same priests and </v>

3965
02:52:40.260 --> 02:52:43.060
<v Speaker 3>everything and I'm pretty sure he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>molested a.</v>

3966
02:52:43.240 --> 02:52:45.010
<v Speaker 3>This happened to him after he got to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>seminary.</v>

3967
02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's horrible.</v>

3968
02:52:46.560 --> 02:52:47.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3969
02:52:47.790 --> 02:52:52.790
<v Speaker 1>it's even more horrible if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the actual act of making someone </v>

3970
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:56.641
<v Speaker 1>celibate sorta perpetrates this turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in some ways towards having sex </v>

3971
02:52:56.951 --> 02:53:00.460
<v Speaker 1>with almost basically anybody that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>celibacy is going to go away eventually.</v>

3972
02:53:00.580 --> 02:53:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't been here only a few hundred </v>

3973
02:53:05.580 --> 02:53:06.360
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>

3974
02:53:07.150 --> 02:53:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3975
02:53:07.991 --> 02:53:12.991
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that peOple have done that </v>

3976
02:53:12.991 --> 02:53:14.060
<v Speaker 1>throughout time is also another </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing fact of,</v>

3977
02:53:14.080 --> 02:53:19.080
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of civilization when you find out about </v>

3978
02:53:19.080 --> 02:53:20.710
<v Speaker 1>socrates and they had sex with young </v>
<v Speaker 1>boys on a regular basis</v>

3979
02:53:21.860 --> 02:53:26.860
<v Speaker 3>in some countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that we had a friend who told us </v>

3980
02:53:26.860 --> 02:53:29.871
<v Speaker 3>some real what I considered horror </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories that they considered serving </v>

3981
02:53:29.871 --> 02:53:29.871
<v Speaker 3>normal behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3982
02:53:29.910 --> 02:53:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had friends who've gone to </v>

3983
02:53:34.910 --> 02:53:36.411
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what they call man loved </v>

3984
02:53:36.411 --> 02:53:38.520
<v Speaker 1>thursdays are a boy loved thursdays or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know how much is true now.</v>

3985
02:53:38.521 --> 02:53:43.521
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know the idea that people have </v>

3986
02:53:43.521 --> 02:53:45.650
<v Speaker 1>sex with young boys for pleasure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women for procreation.</v>

3987
02:53:45.651 --> 02:53:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that this is practice has been.</v>

3988
02:53:49.440 --> 02:53:51.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't get my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get my head around that.</v>

3989
02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully the internet will expose that </v>

3990
02:53:56.720 --> 02:53:56.720
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3991
02:53:56.720 --> 02:53:56.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3992
02:53:56.720 --> 02:54:00.230
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what it would take to </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychically clean us up of all our weird</v>

3993
02:54:00.930 --> 02:54:05.930
<v Speaker 1>patterns that were caught up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrapped in regular and frequent </v>

3994
02:54:05.930 --> 02:54:09.711
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences that could help </v>
<v Speaker 1>and also communication and the </v>

3995
02:54:09.711 --> 02:54:09.711
<v Speaker 1>communication in a way.</v>

3996
02:54:10.370 --> 02:54:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex.</v>

3997
02:54:10.791 --> 02:54:12.750
<v Speaker 3>Lubricate communications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>CertainlY.</v>

3998
02:54:12.950 --> 02:54:17.950
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of things that you can't </v>

3999
02:54:17.950 --> 02:54:19.541
<v Speaker 3>even put words around and so you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and you start trying to do art </v>

4000
02:54:19.541 --> 02:54:22.811
<v Speaker 3>or music or some way to do that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>let's communicate and get a new </v>

4001
02:54:22.811 --> 02:54:22.811
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looking at what all alex grey is done.</v>

4002
02:54:22.811 --> 02:54:23.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4003
02:54:23.790 --> 02:54:27.200
<v Speaker 3>in getting that message out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're right,</v>

4004
02:54:27.250 --> 02:54:27.700
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

4005
02:54:27.770 --> 02:54:30.290
<v Speaker 3>we're local.</v>
<v Speaker 3>how far we've come in our lifetime.</v>

4006
02:54:30.890 --> 02:54:35.890
<v Speaker 3>We're nowhere near where I want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've been in new orleans when I had </v>

4007
02:54:35.890 --> 02:54:38.270
<v Speaker 3>to look white drinking fountain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black drinking fountain,</v>

4008
02:54:38.271 --> 02:54:40.310
<v Speaker 3>where to sit on the street car and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

4009
02:54:40.311 --> 02:54:42.770
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that segregation is still here,</v>

4010
02:54:43.460 --> 02:54:47.300
<v Speaker 3>but it's not nearly as bad as it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not quite as sanctioned as it was.</v>

4011
02:54:47.301 --> 02:54:48.680
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4012
02:54:48.770 --> 02:54:53.770
<v Speaker 3>women's rights are a little bit little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit better and my son was able to get </v>

4013
02:54:53.770 --> 02:54:54.440
<v Speaker 3>married to the man he loved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4014
02:54:54.441 --> 02:54:59.441
<v Speaker 3>so we are making some social progress </v>
<v Speaker 3>and probably making a lot more in a </v>

4015
02:54:59.481 --> 02:55:01.720
<v Speaker 3>short period of time than we realize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4016
02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:06.620
<v Speaker 1>that's where the exponential growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>really kicks in is in social progress.</v>

4017
02:55:06.621 --> 02:55:07.330
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4018
02:55:07.460 --> 02:55:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made fun of a lot of like really </v>

4019
02:55:12.460 --> 02:55:14.681
<v Speaker 1>heavy duty lefties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are like ultra progressive </v>

4020
02:55:14.681 --> 02:55:18.551
<v Speaker 1>to the point of being ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I kind of appreciate the effort </v>

4021
02:55:18.551 --> 02:55:20.390
<v Speaker 1>because this powerful strong effort for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

4022
02:55:20.690 --> 02:55:22.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten in trouble for saying that I</v>

4023
02:55:22.191 --> 02:55:27.191
<v Speaker 1>don't think a transgender man we came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman should be able to fight and </v>

4024
02:55:27.191 --> 02:55:30.941
<v Speaker 1>women's mma it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point is from the safety of the </v>

4025
02:55:30.941 --> 02:55:34.260
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people have defended transgender </v>

4026
02:55:34.260 --> 02:55:38.171
<v Speaker 1>people because of the fact that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically stand up for someone they </v>

4027
02:55:38.171 --> 02:55:39.650
<v Speaker 1>feel like is being oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I appreciate that.</v>

4028
02:55:39.651 --> 02:55:44.651
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate the idea behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I appreciate the sentiment </v>

4029
02:55:44.651 --> 02:55:48.071
<v Speaker 1>behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's fascinating as a </v>

4030
02:55:48.071 --> 02:55:48.440
<v Speaker 1>culture that there are people that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you repress gay rights,</v>

4031
02:55:48.441 --> 02:55:50.390
<v Speaker 1>they will go after you and they will.</v>

4032
02:55:50.810 --> 02:55:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's misguided or not.</v>

4033
02:55:53.871 --> 02:55:58.871
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times it is when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to certain aspects of progressive </v>

4034
02:55:58.871 --> 02:56:02.891
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that heavy duty lefty behavior </v>

4035
02:56:02.891 --> 02:56:06.521
<v Speaker 1>exists and exists in like big groups and</v>
<v Speaker 1>big organized groups I think is very </v>

4036
02:56:06.681 --> 02:56:11.681
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very important because it </v>

4037
02:56:11.681 --> 02:56:14.021
<v Speaker 1>balances out the heavy duty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right end right wing and right leaning </v>

4038
02:56:14.021 --> 02:56:17.300
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all those things eventually with</v>

4039
02:56:17.301 --> 02:56:21.590
<v Speaker 1>education and with the undeniable truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the internet presents,</v>

4040
02:56:21.770 --> 02:56:26.770
<v Speaker 1>we'll find some sort of a comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>medium of truth were really self </v>

4041
02:56:26.770 --> 02:56:27.470
<v Speaker 1>aggrandizement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>douchey behavior.</v>

4042
02:56:27.471 --> 02:56:30.080
<v Speaker 1>No laughed is just as gross as self </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggrandizement,</v>

4043
02:56:30.110 --> 02:56:35.110
<v Speaker 1>douchey behavior on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people realize that compassion does </v>

4044
02:56:35.110 --> 02:56:36.750
<v Speaker 1>not have to have an ideology attached to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4045
02:56:36.770 --> 02:56:38.870
<v Speaker 1>It should be a part of how human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave.</v>

4046
02:56:39.300 --> 02:56:41.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a rep republican,</v>

4047
02:56:41.031 --> 02:56:44.000
<v Speaker 3>I was not a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very misinformed.</v>

4048
02:56:44.030 --> 02:56:44.790
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4049
02:56:44.870 --> 02:56:47.420
<v Speaker 3>and I came up from the poor side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>street,</v>

4050
02:56:47.421 --> 02:56:52.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad didn't have a car when I was </v>

4051
02:56:52.421 --> 02:56:52.421
<v Speaker 3>growing up and stuff and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4052
02:56:52.421 --> 02:56:52.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made a lot of money.</v>

4053
02:56:52.421 --> 02:56:52.910
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh this is great.</v>

4054
02:56:52.911 --> 02:56:54.770
<v Speaker 3>I did this on my own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't,</v>

4055
02:56:54.800 --> 02:56:55.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4056
02:56:55.640 --> 02:57:00.640
<v Speaker 3>I've decided that an until everybody has</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same advantages as a white college </v>

4057
02:57:01.491 --> 02:57:06.491
<v Speaker 3>educated american male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not allowed to complain that it's </v>

4058
02:57:06.491 --> 02:57:06.491
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even then it's not,</v>

4059
02:57:06.491 --> 02:57:07.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had.</v>

4060
02:57:07.581 --> 02:57:09.200
<v Speaker 3>So even though we didn't have money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

4061
02:57:09.260 --> 02:57:11.060
<v Speaker 3>I had so many advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4062
02:57:11.190 --> 02:57:12.960
<v Speaker 1>we're running out of time here.</v>
