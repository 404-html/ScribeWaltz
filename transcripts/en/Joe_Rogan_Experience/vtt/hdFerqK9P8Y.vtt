6
00:00:07.511 --> 00:00:08.344
<v Speaker 1>back into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No good.</v>

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:11.734
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

9
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.690
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:15.560
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

11
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to put that picture up </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

12
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.950
<v Speaker 1>That was a great picture though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

13
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.420
<v Speaker 1>you chilling on the couch at seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yellow Jersey.</v>

14
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.690
<v Speaker 2>He's on your wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

15
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I got a note for that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

16
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get nuked no matter what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

17
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

18
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.600
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look,</v>

19
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're up and uh,</v>

20
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.790
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm proud of him.</v>

21
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.680
<v Speaker 2>I really am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm proud of.</v>

22
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that as weird as it is,</v>

23
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:40.664
<v Speaker 2>and as strange as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's just a line through those </v>

24
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 2>years as if they did not happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

25
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.943
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

26
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 2>I was paid to do a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

27
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.300
<v Speaker 2>As messy as the job was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever I was paid to do it.</v>

28
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 2>And I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

29
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.623
<v Speaker 2>and I wanted to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to capture those memories for </v>

30
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 2>myself and for my teammates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can't,</v>

31
00:00:58.191 --> 00:00:59.024
<v Speaker 2>nobody can take those away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still hold those memories it to </v>

32
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

33
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.161
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

34
00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:06.080
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's had a complicated ending.</v>

35
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:07.060
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

36
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still view those as victories and I </v>

37
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:11.180
<v Speaker 2>still view those memories as good</v>

38
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>carrying around the lie and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrogated and questioned.</v>

39
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>And it was that the hardest part about </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

40
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

41
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 2>I was only interrogated there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>questioned with the press and,</v>

42
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 2>and even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

43
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

44
00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:31.400
<v Speaker 2>if it would have been in this day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>age with,</v>

45
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.253
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with twitter and facebook and social </v>

46
00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 2>media and it would've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would've been a thousand times worse.</v>

47
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.253
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>

48
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

49
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.980
<v Speaker 2>this was in the late nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

50
00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:44.050
<v Speaker 2>think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a long time ago.</v>

51
00:01:44.051 --> 00:01:44.884
<v Speaker 2>And so the level of scrutiny while it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was high wasn't nearly as high as it </v>

52
00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:50.440
<v Speaker 2>would have been today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

53
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.560
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

54
00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:55.270
<v Speaker 2>once you dig in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

55
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:56.410
<v Speaker 2>with these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with these guys,</v>

56
00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:57.310
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're stuck.</v>

57
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.713
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

58
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 1>once you finally came clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

59
00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:04.240
<v Speaker 1>obviously there was a lot of blowback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was there also a relief?</v>

60
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

61
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.810
<v Speaker 2>not immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not immediately.</v>

62
00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:11.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

63
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:11.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

64
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.560
<v Speaker 2>I get asked that a lot and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

65
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

66
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.400
<v Speaker 2>people expect me to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

67
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just this,</v>

68
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.940
<v Speaker 2>it was just this huge relief off your </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders when you,</v>

69
00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.250
<v Speaker 2>when you talk to oprah or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever you did,</v>

70
00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:25.084
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can now move forward and live </v>

71
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.350
<v Speaker 2>the life of an honest man and et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

72
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.530
<v Speaker 2>But it's taken me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just sum it up.</v>

73
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting here today,</v>

74
00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:34.384
<v Speaker 2>having this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would much prefer to have this </v>

75
00:02:36.191 --> 00:02:40.360
<v Speaker 2>conversation than the one where I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have lied to your fucking face 15 times,</v>

76
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd much rather talk like this.</v>

77
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:45.790
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a relief.</v>

78
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

79
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

80
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not like I walked out of sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Oprah and was like,</v>

81
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.480
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel amazing.</v>

82
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.780
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't asked weapon.</v>

83
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so was it like there with Oprah?</v>

84
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 2>She's asking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's drilling you,</v>

85
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 2>asking you questions about that start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She came out,</v>

86
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 2>she came out hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes or no,</v>

87
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.940
<v Speaker 2>yes or no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes or no other.</v>

88
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 2>She did a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did a great job.</v>

89
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 2>I thought she did a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was very compelling.</v>

90
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.993
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the way she structured the </v>

91
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:19.010
<v Speaker 2>beginning part of the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

92
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that on television.</v>

93
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 2>You want to capture people and keep them</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

94
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 2>You kind of have to approach it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

95
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.803
<v Speaker 2>I thought she did a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that it wasn't well </v>

96
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 2>received and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in what way?</v>

97
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 2>You mean people didn't like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards in that way?</v>

98
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 2>I think there's two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

99
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:40.024
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't emotionally ready to do that </v>

100
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 2>interview.</v>

101
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

102
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't in a place where I think that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit today where it's,</v>

103
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

104
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.133
<v Speaker 2>it is a position of contrition and </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding the tremendous sense of </v>

105
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 2>betrayal that's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my perception of that today is much</v>

106
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 2>sharper than it was three years ago when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sat with her,</v>

107
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 2>the feds and other lawsuits forced my </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

108
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.644
<v Speaker 2>I had to sit there with that because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew I was going to be sitting with her </v>

109
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:09.604
<v Speaker 2>or with you or with Tom Brokaw or I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be sitting with a government </v>

110
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 2>lawyer being deposed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being videoed and being leaked.</v>

111
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

112
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:19.054
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find the place that I'd </v>

113
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:21.004
<v Speaker 2>rather sit down and talk about this as </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to a grainy video that the </v>

114
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 2>government leaks to the world and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>your coming out party.</v>

115
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 2>So I did that.</v>

116
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 2>But the thing about Oprah is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is aside from me just not being ready at</v>

117
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 2>the time to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.233
<v Speaker 2>people sensed that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most importantly for the diehard </v>

119
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 2>cycling fans and sports fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say enough.</v>

120
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 2>You didn't name names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't.</v>

121
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 2>You didn't call anybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't detailed enough.</v>

122
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 2>You're holding back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're protecting people.</v>

123
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.603
<v Speaker 2>That's what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very small percentage of the </v>

124
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 2>population for the majority of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

125
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Those first five minutes was way too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much information.</v>

126
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck did I just hear?</v>

127
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Like blood bags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hipo,</v>

128
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 2>testosterone transfusions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheating.</v>

129
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 2>It was way too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had people that were at one camp,</v>

130
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.480
<v Speaker 2>a smaller camp said he didn't say </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

131
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.230
<v Speaker 2>He's holding back here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other campus,</v>

132
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 2>like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's more than I needed to hear.</v>

133
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.610
<v Speaker 2>And so everybody was pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

134
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they would think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>too much.</v>

135
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

136
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that logic because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is reality or a grandma in Duluth.</v>

137
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

138
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.653
<v Speaker 2>and you and you support it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cancer survivor clause isn't real </v>

139
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 2>and you hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

140
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

141
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like anything about this.</v>

142
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

143
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 2>so I see because they were also </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporting lives drawn.</v>

144
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Also supporting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the story,</v>

145
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 2>how much of an effect did it have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost immediately on your foundation or</v>

146
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.223
<v Speaker 2>a donor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I was asked to leave the before </v>

147
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now I haven't been back.</v>

148
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know and I'm not,</v>

149
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 2>and I don't ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it still around?</v>

150
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

151
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 2>but it must have taken a devastating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

152
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean it takes a hit in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously in terms of fundraising,</v>

153
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.550
<v Speaker 2>which directly leads to its,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

154
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.393
<v Speaker 2>its effectiveness in terms of helping </v>
<v Speaker 2>create change for cancer survivors were </v>

155
00:06:20.501 --> 00:06:21.334
<v Speaker 2>all around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to raise money in order to do </v>

156
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

157
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 2>staff layoffs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

158
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you name it.</v>

159
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

160
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:35.291
<v Speaker 2>I don't have specifics because once I </v>
<v Speaker 2>left the board and left the organization</v>

161
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.850
<v Speaker 2>and they legally changed the name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

162
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.243
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
