00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.320
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>

<v Speaker 1>thank you very much man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate you coming on here.</v>

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>It was very cool talking to you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil and even though it was a very </v>

4
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.751
<v Speaker 1>short conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot and I got very fired up </v>

5
00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:11.751
<v Speaker 1>about this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome,</v>

6
00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great to be here.</v>

7
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:18.561
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thank you for all the stuff you've </v>

9
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:20.511
<v Speaker 1>done it for folks who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the guy who essentially took down</v>

10
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Lance Armstrong or at least made the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case or solidify.</v>

11
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you describe it?</v>

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was involved in the </v>

13
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

14
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a case run by the Department of </v>

15
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Justice out of Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one of the case agents on it,</v>

16
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.711
<v Speaker 1>so I was associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that's creepy </v>

17
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 1>about it is that the government was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going after bike riders.</v>

18
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you think that they've got some</v>

19
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>really important shit to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that bothered a lot of </v>

20
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.031
<v Speaker 1>people about the baseball thing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>barry bonds and with mark mcgwire and </v>

21
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>all that Sammy Sosa stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

22
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>why is that the fucking congress </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved?</v>

23
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>And it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on one hand these were laws that,</v>

26
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the agencies I was with was,</v>

27
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>we're tasked to investigate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance,</v>

29
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I was on a personal level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at the message that was being </v>

31
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>sent to youth not only this country but </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world and that it,</v>

32
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>it became a fact that in the mid to late</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>

33
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>steroid use was so pervasive in sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kids are smart these days.</v>

34
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.110
<v Speaker 1>You on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what's going on,</v>

35
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>that it really did see it trickling down</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kids,</v>

36
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in high school.</v>

37
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>And at some point if you wanted to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sport far enough,</v>

38
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>you ultimately had to make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision,</v>

39
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I want to keep going?</v>

40
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:44.601
<v Speaker 1>And if I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna have to make a decision </v>

41
00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:44.601
<v Speaker 1>whether or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:44.601
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

43
00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

44
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:46.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

45
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I think about the number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations that probably happened </v>

46
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>around dinner table between parents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids because of these cases,</v>

47
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>got to be in the hundreds of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>if not millions.</v>

48
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.070
<v Speaker 1>And that alone right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I think would justify the resources that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were spent defendants in those cases </v>

50
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.011
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always overblown in terms of the </v>

51
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:13.971
<v Speaker 1>research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the resources that the government did </v>

52
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:13.971
<v Speaker 1>spend doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>you heard often the barry bonds case was</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 slash $55,000,000</v>

54
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really wasn't,</v>

55
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>in that case involved not steroid use </v>
<v Speaker 1>but lying in front of a grand jury.</v>

57
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.670
<v Speaker 1>So it transcended spare steroid use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about lying and telling the truth</v>

58
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:34.671
<v Speaker 1>and misusing the justice system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had agents all across the country </v>

59
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>on non-steroid related cases come up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and say,</v>

60
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks,</v>

61
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>thanks for that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we can use as a,</v>

62
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.420
<v Speaker 1>as an example when we go out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview witnesses or witnesses come </v>

63
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>before a grand jury that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

64
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>you need to tell the truth and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look what can happen.</v>

65
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government went after barry bonds or</v>

66
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:55.641
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will go after you and when that </v>

67
00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:58.371
<v Speaker 1>truth starts being told like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the are legal justice system starts </v>

68
00:02:58.371 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it doesn't,</v>

69
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>it breaks down.</v>

70
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't $55,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much was actually spent around,</v>

71
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>

72
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.770
<v Speaker 2>A 49,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 9:50,</v>

73
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even close.</v>

74
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Some media outlet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

75
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.710
<v Speaker 2>did a freedom of information request </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the US Attorney's office in San </v>

76
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Francisco who prosecuted the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was after the case was done.</v>

77
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 2>So they put the dollar figures together </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the trial costs and not,</v>

78
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily,</v>

79
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire investigation.</v>

80
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 2>But the trial itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was less than $100,000.</v>

81
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:33.121
<v Speaker 2>And the comment was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus is the most cost efficient high </v>

82
00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 2>profile trial that's probably ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

83
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a full account of all the</v>

84
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 2>money that was spent trying to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>them down.</v>

85
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

86
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 2>this wasn't trying to bring anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

87
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 2>This was a situation where he went </v>
<v Speaker 2>before grand jury,</v>

88
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't tell the truth.</v>

89
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his grand jury transcript,</v>

90
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.330
<v Speaker 2>ironically enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was leaked by the BALCO BALCO attorneys,</v>

91
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 2>defense attorneys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the public all of a sudden got to</v>

92
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 2>read exactly what he said in there.</v>

93
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was obvious that he at least was </v>

94
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.030
<v Speaker 2>obstructing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not outright,</v>

95
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.740
<v Speaker 2>not telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

96
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 2>and so I think the Justice Department </v>
<v Speaker 2>was faced with,</v>

97
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.730
<v Speaker 2>what do we do now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of message are we sending if </v>

98
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 2>we don't prosecute this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sends a message that,</v>

99
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far transcends steroid use in sports.</v>

100
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 2>There's thousands of witnesses every day</v>
<v Speaker 2>that appeared before grand juries.</v>

101
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>So it was almost a necessity to have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

102
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.640
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't about steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was about steroids because the </v>

103
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 2>only reason why he was there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>questioning him about steroids.</v>

104
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:40.171
<v Speaker 2>So it essentially was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not a lot of people feel like </v>

105
00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:43.141
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to like organized crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like didn't they bust Al Capone on tax </v>

106
00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:46.381
<v Speaker 2>evasion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how a lot of people get </v>

107
00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:48.241
<v Speaker 2>caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get caught lying while they're in </v>

108
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:48.241
<v Speaker 2>the middle of committing a crime.</v>

109
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 2>But it's really about the original </v>
<v Speaker 2>crime,</v>

110
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

111
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

112
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 2>that's why he was brought in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

113
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 2>when he was brought in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was made very clear that,</v>

114
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to tell us,</v>

115
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.790
<v Speaker 2>accusing you for using steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was given immunity,</v>

116
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 2>actually show them that long as you tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth,</v>

117
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 2>you're not targeting this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just a witness.</v>

118
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:07.711
<v Speaker 2>So tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was never convicted for using </v>

119
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:10.891
<v Speaker 2>steroids and wasn't he off the hook even</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as the investigation goes,</v>

120
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 2>like he never did any time and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>even penalized.</v>

121
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:21.061
<v Speaker 2>Like how was he penalize other than </v>
<v Speaker 2>having to go through trials and spend a </v>

122
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:21.061
<v Speaker 2>lot of money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

123
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

124
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 2>after he was convicted in the jury </v>
<v Speaker 2>trial,</v>

125
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 2>the judge sentenced under house arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

126
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 2>but I tell you that he's got a sweet </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

127
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not really that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you can watch TV when you're in the </v>

128
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.960
<v Speaker 2>house arrest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can,</v>

129
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems a little ridiculous.</v>

130
00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:37.060
<v Speaker 2>I like being at home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you,</v>

131
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:42.061
<v Speaker 2>even in a situation like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell people all the time and being </v>

132
00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:46.111
<v Speaker 2>under investigation to begin with going </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a public trial with know </v>

133
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 2>potentially embarrassing things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

134
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 2>That's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

135
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.570
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was standing with the ultimate </v>

136
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 2>sentence was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the most embarrassing thing was that</v>

137
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 2>he did what everybody knew he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was take steroids to get bigger.</v>

138
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was the most embarrassing </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing about it all right.</v>

139
00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:06.861
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like maybe there's some more </v>

140
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:08.621
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was an ex girlfriends that were </v>

141
00:06:08.621 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 2>called it went on the stand in his ass.</v>

142
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.280
<v Speaker 2>He got the thing that people have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with is that there's like legit </v>

143
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 2>problems in the world and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing people for hitting a ball with a</v>

144
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:21.330
<v Speaker 2>stick better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

145
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 2>like baseball is boring as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the best part about baseball is when</v>

146
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 2>they hit home runs and people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

147
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:32.081
<v Speaker 2>well these guys are doing something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes them hit more home runs and it </v>

148
00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:36.101
<v Speaker 2>turns out that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved science and chemicals and we </v>

149
00:06:36.101 --> 00:06:39.341
<v Speaker 2>don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to come down on these </v>

150
00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:39.341
<v Speaker 2>people and we're going to spend a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>taxpayers money.</v>

151
00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:43.371
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to bring these people before </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress and Joe Biden's going to get </v>

152
00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:46.001
<v Speaker 2>all goofy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how a lot of people felt about </v>

153
00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:46.001
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

154
00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:49.631
<v Speaker 2>I think anytime you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could spend resources on something </v>

155
00:06:49.631 --> 00:06:52.451
<v Speaker 2>that's going to directly affect the </v>
<v Speaker 2>youth of society and sending them a </v>

156
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 2>message about what is right and what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

157
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having grown up in a,</v>

158
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 2>in a sporting household myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three daughters,</v>

159
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:03.650
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

160
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:08.651
<v Speaker 2>played sports growing up and I look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of what I went through and what my </v>

161
00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:12.701
<v Speaker 2>daughters have gone through in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>life's lessons that you learn in sports </v>

162
00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 2>that transcends sports and learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work under pressure,</v>

163
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 2>how to work as a team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to individually succeed.</v>

164
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 2>There's so many great lessons to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned,</v>

165
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 2>health aspects of being healthy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>working out.</v>

166
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.440
<v Speaker 2>All the sudden you introduce into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>equation,</v>

167
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking the law,</v>

168
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.130
<v Speaker 2>breaking the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's,</v>

169
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ethics to look at surrounding it.</v>

170
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 2>And number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:40.700
<v Speaker 2>ultimately there can be risks and health</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences with using these things,</v>

172
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're young doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

173
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

174
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:48.791
<v Speaker 2>going back to the message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's sent to our kids and </v>

175
00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:53.561
<v Speaker 2>two parents with where I think society </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going back then with the pervasive </v>

176
00:07:53.561 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 2>use of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of drugs in sports.</v>

177
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a positive one that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to benefit people positively.</v>

178
00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 2>And I think it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did have an impact.</v>

179
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 2>The landscape has changed in the last 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>or 15 years.</v>

180
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:09.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're definitely right about </v>

181
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:09.401
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is,</v>

182
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:11.620
<v Speaker 2>that's the most compelling aspect of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as the argument for chasing it </v>

183
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 2>down is if kids are growing up and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid says,</v>

184
00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

185
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.060
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a professional baseball </v>
<v Speaker 2>player.</v>

186
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 2>How many people are going to tell that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>

187
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:23.981
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta take steroids if you want to </v>

188
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:23.981
<v Speaker 2>get into a good college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to get it,</v>

189
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 2>you know a bunch of recruiters looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at you,</v>

190
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.050
<v Speaker 2>you got to start making some noise right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

191
00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 2>And the way to do it is this stuff right</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

192
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Score that stuff in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of conversations I had with </v>

193
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 2>young athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball players,</v>

194
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:40.841
<v Speaker 2>definitely cyclists where they talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that moment that all their life </v>

195
00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:41.210
<v Speaker 2>growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

196
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:46.211
<v Speaker 2>they aspired to be a professional and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they got to a certain point in </v>

197
00:08:46.211 --> 00:08:46.211
<v Speaker 2>baseball it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

198
00:08:46.211 --> 00:08:49.640
<v Speaker 2>minor league,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe triple a and cycling it was,</v>

199
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.840
<v Speaker 2>hey about to get signed onto a protein </v>
<v Speaker 2>going over to Europe and realizing,</v>

200
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go any further.</v>

201
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing what's going on around me </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

202
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to make that decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have had.</v>

203
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:06.470
<v Speaker 2>I can't even count the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes I've had sitting across the </v>

204
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.131
<v Speaker 2>table from me recounting those days when</v>
<v Speaker 2>those decisions were made that were </v>

205
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 2>bawling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like little babies.</v>

206
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:16.551
<v Speaker 2>Talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of it was guilt in </v>

207
00:09:16.551 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 2>terms of the decision that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately did made,</v>

208
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 2>but just the pressure of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of coming to that moment either given up</v>

209
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:23.310
<v Speaker 2>your lifelong dream or hey kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to go further,</v>

210
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 2>this is what you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in some instances,</v>

211
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda rebuffing that and not doing it.</v>

212
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Then after year realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

213
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:33.570
<v Speaker 2>I really do need to do this or I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>go any further.</v>

214
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of those stories told to me,</v>

215
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is really crazy that sports like </v>

216
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 2>professional cycling especially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this</v>

217
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:46.380
<v Speaker 3>when I saw you in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I had a buddy that was a </v>

218
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.321
<v Speaker 3>professional cycler for awhile and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>told me this was long before the Lance </v>

219
00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.950
<v Speaker 3>Armstrong stuff went down before he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught.</v>

220
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.470
<v Speaker 3>He said they're all doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

221
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.960
<v Speaker 3>you can't compete at that high level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

222
00:09:55.961 --> 00:10:00.961
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the doctor that he talked to said </v>

223
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Speaker 3>you could make an argument that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually more dangerous to compete in </v>

224
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.810
<v Speaker 3>that sport without the drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I said,</v>

225
00:10:04.811 --> 00:10:09.811
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of a fucking sport is this </v>

226
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:09.811
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

227
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:11.971
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then after you and I had this </v>

228
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:15.181
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started looking into the Tour de </v>

229
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:15.820
<v Speaker 3>France Times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We spoke about this briefly in Brazil,</v>

230
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.280
<v Speaker 3>that the guy who was winning the Tour de</v>
<v Speaker 3>France,</v>

231
00:10:18.281 --> 00:10:22.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what his name is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was breaking records that were set by</v>

232
00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:26.080
<v Speaker 3>guys that were on drugs and we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out how the fuck that's</v>

233
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.740
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

234
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pit suspicious</v>

235
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:34.370
<v Speaker 3>a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these are hyper human levels of </v>

236
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 3>performance and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's beating guys that we know where the</v>

237
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:40.560
<v Speaker 3>elite of the elite were also on </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids.</v>

238
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.970
<v Speaker 3>We're also on EPO.</v>

239
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cycling,</v>

240
00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:50.311
<v Speaker 2>I think we talked about this in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>level of sophistication versus all the </v>

241
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:51.250
<v Speaker 2>sports that I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her drug use was prevalent,</v>

242
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.280
<v Speaker 2>was by far at the top where they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>investing in machines to bring along </v>

243
00:10:56.981 --> 00:11:01.981
<v Speaker 2>with them as they were competing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>traveling to to test their blood every </v>

244
00:11:01.981 --> 00:11:04.510
<v Speaker 2>night to make sure that their levels </v>
<v Speaker 2>were within reason.</v>

245
00:11:04.511 --> 00:11:09.511
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't pop on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a drug test or a biological passport </v>

246
00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:10.220
<v Speaker 2>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

247
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.790
<v Speaker 2>biological passport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not mistaken.</v>

248
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:18.090
<v Speaker 2>What that means is like say if we test </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and we get your levels that we can </v>

249
00:11:18.131 --> 00:11:21.520
<v Speaker 2>test you on a regular basis and you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stay within a consistent range.</v>

250
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Is that the idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

251
00:11:22.721 --> 00:11:27.721
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's something we're using in our </v>

252
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:27.721
<v Speaker 2>UFC program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

253
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:29.230
<v Speaker 2>the more tests you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better you're able to read it,</v>

254
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:34.360
<v Speaker 2>but over a longitudinal study of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood and urine markers,</v>

255
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.350
<v Speaker 2>a science and studies have shown you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have normal variances,</v>

256
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each human being will have a normal </v>

257
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.120
<v Speaker 2>variants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that factor in with </v>

258
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.520
<v Speaker 2>overtraining and a lot of these athletes</v>
<v Speaker 2>are overtrained and that's a consistent </v>

259
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.360
<v Speaker 2>aspect of mma camps as a guys are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>really breaking themselves down,</v>

260
00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 2>doing two and a days wrestling</v>

261
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.520
<v Speaker 1>strength and conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing.</v>

262
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 1>It's just sometimes you see these guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone levels,</v>

263
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.470
<v Speaker 1>they come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just racked and their mid camp.</v>

264
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely,</v>

265
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a scientist,</v>

266
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:07.120
<v Speaker 1>but in talking to the scientists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>read these,</v>

267
00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:12.121
<v Speaker 1>they take that into consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the overtraining you attend to </v>

268
00:12:12.121 --> 00:12:14.560
<v Speaker 1>see some of those variances on the lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>side and that may be normal,</v>

269
00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:19.561
<v Speaker 1>but when they're reading these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know these biological passports and </v>

270
00:12:19.561 --> 00:12:24.181
<v Speaker 1>you see some way on the lower side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden you see way one on </v>

271
00:12:24.181 --> 00:12:27.931
<v Speaker 1>the higher side then begins to raise </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions about what's going on.</v>

272
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:33.181
<v Speaker 1>Now a lot of times the biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>passport will just lead to more </v>

273
00:12:33.181 --> 00:12:35.590
<v Speaker 1>intelligent testing or targeted testing </v>
<v Speaker 1>may not necessarily be,</v>

274
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:37.510
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person's definitely using,</v>

275
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:42.511
<v Speaker 1>but based on these variances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something may be suspiciously going on </v>

276
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's test this,</v>

277
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.370
<v Speaker 1>this guy or girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know more hone in on suspicions like</v>

278
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:48.610
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

279
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.820
<v Speaker 1>And really the most accurate tests or </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood tests is that the case blood are </v>

280
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 1>the most accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

281
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the other thing you were telling</v>

282
00:12:57.011 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 1>me about were in Brazil I thought was </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>

283
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:04.171
<v Speaker 1>was that there there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new type of testosterone that </v>

284
00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:05.440
<v Speaker 1>they are making testosterone from Yams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

285
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That now they're doing it through </v>

286
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:10.830
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

287
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:10.830
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

288
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:10.830
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

289
00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:15.831
<v Speaker 1>one of the most accurate test now to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>is called the carbon isotope ratio test </v>

290
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:21.060
<v Speaker 1>and what that's able to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate between natural </v>

291
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.511
<v Speaker 1>testosterone which all men and women </v>
<v Speaker 1>have in their body and foreign </v>

292
00:13:24.511 --> 00:13:27.610
<v Speaker 1>testosterone because there's a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon atom in that testosterone because</v>

293
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 1>it's made from a plant instead of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

294
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's now,</v>

295
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.700
<v Speaker 1>at least in research supply companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's approved for use,</v>

296
00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:41.701
<v Speaker 1>but there's animal based testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>floating around which has the potential </v>

297
00:13:41.701 --> 00:13:46.231
<v Speaker 1>to possibly defeat a carbon isotope </v>
<v Speaker 1>ratio test because it has the same </v>

298
00:13:46.231 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 1>carbon atom as natural testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

299
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Is there any hesitation and talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about these things because you worry </v>

300
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.430
<v Speaker 1>that you might educate cheaters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

301
00:13:54.431 --> 00:13:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

302
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always found that,</v>

303
00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:02.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your credibility rises when you're </v>

304
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.420
<v Speaker 1>forthright about what's going on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because on the other side of things,</v>

305
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

306
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.270
<v Speaker 1>the sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

307
00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:09.850
<v Speaker 1>looking at these things and always </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up with new tests.</v>

308
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I think something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fact.</v>

309
00:14:11.251 --> 00:14:12.740
<v Speaker 1>I just read it today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

310
00:14:12.741 --> 00:14:15.860
<v Speaker 1>and we do this in our program as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>

311
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:20.880
<v Speaker 1>there was in cycling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will freeze samples both urine and </v>

312
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.691
<v Speaker 1>blood and keep them for years at a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cycling just recently went back and </v>

313
00:14:24.691 --> 00:14:29.401
<v Speaker 1>retested some of the frozen urine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood from a few years ago for a new </v>

314
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:35.821
<v Speaker 1>drug with shade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just develop a test for and they were </v>

315
00:14:35.821 --> 00:14:37.060
<v Speaker 1>able to catch a guy from a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago that had used it.</v>

316
00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do that in UFC as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if,</v>

317
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new drug out there that,</v>

318
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>

319
00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:49.051
<v Speaker 1>chemists are saying there's no test for </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially a couple of years down the </v>

320
00:14:49.051 --> 00:14:53.131
<v Speaker 1>line when there is a test for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have the ability to go back and </v>

321
00:14:53.131 --> 00:14:53.131
<v Speaker 1>that now maybe that</v>

322
00:14:53.131 --> 00:14:55.790
<v Speaker 2>athletes no longer with the UFC are no </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer competing at all anymore,</v>

323
00:14:55.791 --> 00:15:00.791
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still reputation and legacy at </v>

324
00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:00.791
<v Speaker 2>stake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

325
00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:02.300
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the UFC is going to have like a giant</v>

326
00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 2>meat locker filled with old blood and p </v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratories will have that.</v>

327
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

328
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:10.760
<v Speaker 2>that's fascinating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But doesn't that.</v>

329
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a chain of evidence issue with </v>

330
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.101
<v Speaker 2>that isn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which just sitting around in some sort </v>

331
00:15:18.101 --> 00:15:18.101
<v Speaker 2>of a lab somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

332
00:15:18.101 --> 00:15:22.720
<v Speaker 2>There'll be secure freezers where there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a chain of custody that goes along </v>

333
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.071
<v Speaker 2>with each sample.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So outside that freezer will be guard </v>

334
00:15:27.071 --> 00:15:30.251
<v Speaker 2>this paperwork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No water laboratories are very secure </v>

335
00:15:30.251 --> 00:15:30.580
<v Speaker 2>laboratories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

336
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to get in than before.</v>

337
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.780
<v Speaker 2>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're signing off your life to get in </v>

338
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:37.780
<v Speaker 2>one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

339
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.300
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

340
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:42.200
<v Speaker 2>the chain of custody will be good going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on indefinitely on those things.</v>

341
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so far as you know,</v>

342
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:49.091
<v Speaker 2>this hasn't been approved where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't used this animal based </v>

343
00:15:49.091 --> 00:15:50.060
<v Speaker 2>testosterone yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's being used now.</v>

344
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.310
<v Speaker 2>You believe it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

345
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also like wasn't an Alex </v>

346
00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Rodriguez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that who it was that was using a slow</v>

347
00:15:56.991 --> 00:15:59.720
<v Speaker 2>or quick release?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Testosterone was,</v>

348
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.010
<v Speaker 2>gets out of your system very quickly as </v>
<v Speaker 2>short lifespan or short half life?</v>

349
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the deal with that stuff?</v>

350
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.610
<v Speaker 2>It's just fast acting flax clearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone.</v>

351
00:16:08.611 --> 00:16:09.650
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

352
00:16:09.651 --> 00:16:14.651
<v Speaker 2>the landscape on how drugs are used as </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed over the last several years is </v>

353
00:16:14.651 --> 00:16:14.651
<v Speaker 2>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

354
00:16:14.651 --> 00:16:18.500
<v Speaker 2>got more accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea is you could take this,</v>

355
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:20.830
<v Speaker 2>I think he was taking like gummies or </v>
<v Speaker 2>lozenges,</v>

356
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it at night and by morning time,</v>

357
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the testosterone could be clear your </v>

358
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.211
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you take it while you're sleeping to </v>

359
00:16:31.211 --> 00:16:31.211
<v Speaker 2>help you recover.</v>

360
00:16:31.211 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

361
00:16:31.851 --> 00:16:34.670
<v Speaker 2>I think you see more along the lines of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called microdosing.</v>

362
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.280
<v Speaker 2>So small amounts where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

363
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

364
00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:41.600
<v Speaker 2>talking more of recovery versus building</v>
<v Speaker 2>up massive muscles,</v>

365
00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:44.300
<v Speaker 2>which you saw maybe in the mid to late </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>

366
00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:47.450
<v Speaker 2>you saw these cartoonish figures out </v>
<v Speaker 2>least on a baseball field.</v>

367
00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:52.451
<v Speaker 2>I think now it's evolved a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>more where there's less amounts using </v>

368
00:16:52.451 --> 00:16:55.910
<v Speaker 2>more for recovery benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now a guy like Jose Conseco,</v>

369
00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.300
<v Speaker 2>how much damage did he do when that guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>or positive,</v>

370
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on how you're looking at it,</v>

371
00:17:00.711 --> 00:17:04.180
<v Speaker 2>when that guy came out with that book </v>
<v Speaker 2>and explained what he did,</v>

372
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.140
<v Speaker 2>what everybody he knew did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

373
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.660
<v Speaker 2>how illuminating was that to guys like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

374
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you talked before about </v>

375
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:14.260
<v Speaker 2>congressional hearings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his,</v>

376
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:14.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his book came out of the time when,</v>

377
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:20.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the balco case was kind of in the media </v>

378
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.331
<v Speaker 2>and it probably caused those </v>
<v Speaker 2>congressional hearings where Congress </v>

379
00:17:22.331 --> 00:17:23.800
<v Speaker 2>called baseball to the table and bud </v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

380
00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:28.700
<v Speaker 2>and you look now 10 years later and </v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball is completely done a one 80.</v>

381
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.310
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lead sports in terms of,</v>

382
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:32.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping program,</v>

383
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:35.720
<v Speaker 2>professional sports here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well before our program came along.</v>

384
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

385
00:17:37.101 --> 00:17:37.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

386
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:40.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're testing program is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is pretty good.</v>

387
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.510
<v Speaker 2>And compared to 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they,</v>

388
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.140
<v Speaker 2>do the athletes look different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't follow baseball,</v>

389
00:17:45.141 --> 00:17:47.120
<v Speaker 2>but are they smaller guys now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

390
00:17:47.121 --> 00:17:48.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you see,</v>

391
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mark Mcguire's</v>

392
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 3>or the Jose Conseco Osers as prevalent </v>
<v Speaker 3>as you did back then.</v>

393
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:57.180
<v Speaker 3>Definitely look at the statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean those,</v>

394
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.390
<v Speaker 3>those don't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not seeing 50,</v>

395
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 3>60,</v>
<v Speaker 3>70 home runs anymore.</v>

396
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:03.280
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

397
00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm torn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm torn on that because I think </v>

398
00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.031
<v Speaker 3>baseball socks and this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only cool thing about it is when a </v>

399
00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:14.241
<v Speaker 3>guy wax a ball and sends it flying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree with you on the message </v>

400
00:18:14.241 --> 00:18:18.261
<v Speaker 3>that sends young people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a difference between </v>

401
00:18:18.261 --> 00:18:21.531
<v Speaker 3>that though and fighting and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between that and fighting </v>

402
00:18:21.531 --> 00:18:23.400
<v Speaker 3>clearly in my eyes is that when you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking something and you're fighting,</v>

403
00:18:23.401 --> 00:18:28.401
<v Speaker 3>you can do more damage to an opponent </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you kind of force your opponent to </v>

404
00:18:28.401 --> 00:18:30.840
<v Speaker 3>also do something if he wants to be on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>level playing field.</v>

405
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:36.260
<v Speaker 3>If we had a sport where it was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything goes like the pride days now </v>

406
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.050
<v Speaker 3>obviously we do.</v>

407
00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is speculation and anecdotal</v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence and and just people witness </v>

408
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.800
<v Speaker 3>accounts from people that were there </v>
<v Speaker 3>like in any.</v>

409
00:18:44.801 --> 00:18:49.801
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's been on my podcast before and </v>

410
00:18:49.801 --> 00:18:51.741
<v Speaker 3>talked about the pride contracts which </v>
<v Speaker 3>openly stated we will not test you for </v>

411
00:18:51.741 --> 00:18:55.701
<v Speaker 3>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was in the contract and my own </v>

412
00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:59.361
<v Speaker 3>experiences with friends who went over </v>
<v Speaker 3>there were there were telling them like </v>

413
00:18:59.361 --> 00:18:59.730
<v Speaker 3>you should take steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

414
00:18:59.731 --> 00:19:01.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a buddy that would normally fight</v>

415
00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 3>at 170 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could even get down to 1:55.</v>

416
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.480
<v Speaker 3>They were telling them to do steroids </v>
<v Speaker 3>and get up to one 85.</v>

417
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:07.770
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

418
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.970
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

419
00:19:08.971 --> 00:19:13.971
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't believe it when he came back</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Japan going do they told me to do </v>

420
00:19:13.971 --> 00:19:16.881
<v Speaker 3>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the wild west of the </v>

421
00:19:16.881 --> 00:19:20.691
<v Speaker 3>performance enhancing era where it </v>
<v Speaker 3>seemed like a giant percentage of the </v>

422
00:19:20.691 --> 00:19:20.820
<v Speaker 3>people were on something.</v>

423
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Speaker 3>The difference being that when you're on</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

424
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.850
<v Speaker 3>if you're on EPO and testosterone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>human growth hormone,</v>

425
00:19:26.851 --> 00:19:29.130
<v Speaker 3>all this thing and you're inside of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ring or cage,</v>

426
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:34.430
<v Speaker 3>you can do more damage to your opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can possibly land strikes that you </v>

427
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:38.661
<v Speaker 3>would not be able to land and some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those strikes may or may not have a </v>

428
00:19:38.661 --> 00:19:41.250
<v Speaker 3>permanent effect on your opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in a lot of people's eyes it's a much</v>

429
00:19:41.251 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 3>more dire and serious consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then baseball,</v>

430
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.040
<v Speaker 3>were you just hitting a ball with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>stick?</v>

431
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.680
<v Speaker 3>So in a lot of people's eyes and in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes,</v>

432
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.160
<v Speaker 3>I think it's amazing that the UFC has </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken this chance and done what they're </v>

433
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.670
<v Speaker 3>doing because they really didn't have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do this.</v>

434
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.310
<v Speaker 3>What they did is bringing a guy like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>a board,</v>

435
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.740
<v Speaker 3>you know I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to a lot of trainers nail.</v>

436
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.630
<v Speaker 3>They raised their eyebrows and shook </v>
<v Speaker 3>their heads like,</v>

437
00:20:03.631 --> 00:20:05.760
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit's going to be different now because</v>

438
00:20:05.761 --> 00:20:07.140
<v Speaker 3>they realized that this is.</v>

439
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real big commitment to try to clean up</v>

440
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.000
<v Speaker 3>MMA and a commitment that quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>

441
00:20:15.001 --> 00:20:20.001
<v Speaker 3>they really didn't have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could have stuck with the Nevada </v>

442
00:20:20.001 --> 00:20:20.460
<v Speaker 3>state athletic commission protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The urine tests after fights,</v>

443
00:20:20.461 --> 00:20:25.461
<v Speaker 3>the occasional blood tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they wanted to do random tests on </v>

444
00:20:25.461 --> 00:20:28.941
<v Speaker 3>people they were suspicious of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a lot of people's eyes those </v>

445
00:20:28.941 --> 00:20:30.680
<v Speaker 3>tests were more of an intelligence test </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they wore have,</v>

446
00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:35.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real honest to goodness anti-doping </v>

447
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:35.970
<v Speaker 3>effort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

448
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.820
<v Speaker 3>I'd agree with everything you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

449
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:38.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm often asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

450
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:44.710
<v Speaker 3>do you think steroid use in mma or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC is way off the chart compared to </v>

451
00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 3>other sports?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my answer is I don't know yet.</v>

452
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've seen very pervasive use in </v>
<v Speaker 1>other sports.</v>

453
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:55.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's unique to mma or UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is unique is what you just talked </v>

454
00:20:56.021 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the importance of it and that this isn't</v>

455
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:02.830
<v Speaker 1>hitting a ball over the fence with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick.</v>

456
00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:07.831
<v Speaker 1>This is two human beings getting into an</v>
<v Speaker 1>octagon and trying to get the other to </v>

457
00:21:07.831 --> 00:21:09.700
<v Speaker 1>submit by inflicting pain and hurting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

458
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.070
<v Speaker 1>And when you give someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

459
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:17.130
<v Speaker 1>an unfair and an artificially enhanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage over that other person,</v>

460
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.860
<v Speaker 1>a man in terms of it just not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

461
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.560
<v Speaker 1>It's at a whole new level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

462
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Dana and Lorenzo from the minute,</v>

463
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:33.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had conversations with them before </v>

464
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.580
<v Speaker 1>coming over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumped fully on to this and I think </v>

465
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:35.950
<v Speaker 1>everybody realizes that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

466
00:21:35.951 --> 00:21:39.130
<v Speaker 1>from a business standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially short term this,</v>

467
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.370
<v Speaker 1>this could hurt the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

468
00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.930
<v Speaker 1>in terms of longterm and short term </v>
<v Speaker 1>health and safety of their fighters,</v>

469
00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:49.090
<v Speaker 1>which I'm telling you these guys are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>board with.</v>

470
00:21:49.091 --> 00:21:52.180
<v Speaker 1>They care about their athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

471
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean this speaks volumes of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

472
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a big turnaround</v>

473
00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.460
<v Speaker 3>also from just a few years ago where </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone replacement therapy was </v>

474
00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.180
<v Speaker 3>sanctioned by the Nevada state athletic </v>
<v Speaker 3>commission.</v>

475
00:22:03.181 --> 00:22:05.400
<v Speaker 3>That was a big issue that you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting.</v>

476
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no need to mention names,</v>

477
00:22:07.321 --> 00:22:10.290
<v Speaker 3>but I know a guy who was in his twenties</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is on trt.</v>

478
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.790
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

479
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:17.030
<v Speaker 3>If you're on testosterone replacement </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're in your twenties and you're </v>

480
00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:20.691
<v Speaker 3>competing in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be competing in mma if </v>

481
00:22:20.691 --> 00:22:23.330
<v Speaker 3>you've got a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're at such a low level of </v>

482
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.241
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the things that when I was </v>

483
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.890
<v Speaker 3>trying to sort it out and make sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it all,</v>

484
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:34.130
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I found most </v>
<v Speaker 3>disturbing was my conversation with my </v>

485
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:37.071
<v Speaker 3>friend Dr Mark Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a famous for his work with </v>

486
00:22:37.071 --> 00:22:40.371
<v Speaker 3>traumatic brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of soldiers that have come back </v>

487
00:22:40.371 --> 00:22:43.341
<v Speaker 3>from getting blown up by an ids and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>the impact that it has on the pituitary </v>

488
00:22:43.341 --> 00:22:48.021
<v Speaker 3>gland and how a lot of these guys have </v>
<v Speaker 3>very low testosterone because of the </v>

489
00:22:48.021 --> 00:22:50.490
<v Speaker 3>impacts that they've taken and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty adamant about it.</v>

490
00:22:50.491 --> 00:22:52.620
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have to take testosterone because</v>

491
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:54.390
<v Speaker 3>you've been getting hit in the head too </v>
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>

492
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.150
<v Speaker 3>that the answer is not take </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>

493
00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.000
<v Speaker 3>The answer is don't get hit in the head </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore like you.</v>

494
00:23:00.001 --> 00:23:05.001
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be like putting a patch on</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and then getting right back into </v>

495
00:23:05.001 --> 00:23:09.711
<v Speaker 3>the octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you are forced to take testosterone </v>

496
00:23:09.711 --> 00:23:10.740
<v Speaker 3>because of the head injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be competing anymore.</v>

497
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

498
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe how naive people were </v>

499
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.220
<v Speaker 1>just a few years back to to allow that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

500
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:19.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

501
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.830
<v Speaker 1>How did it happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think just,</v>

502
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not being an educated,</v>

503
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:24.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

504
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.990
<v Speaker 1>just not around it enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't look into,</v>

505
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things as hard as they should have as my</v>

506
00:23:29.511 --> 00:23:30.320
<v Speaker 1>guest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

507
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>

508
00:23:32.211 --> 00:23:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was never approved by the Olympics.</v>

509
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.750
<v Speaker 1>The Olympic Committee never approved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>

510
00:23:35.751 --> 00:23:40.751
<v Speaker 1>They did not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the history of therapeutic </v>

511
00:23:40.751 --> 00:23:42.040
<v Speaker 1>use exemption on the London or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

512
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.600
<v Speaker 1>there's maybe one and I think it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>

513
00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone</v>

514
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.420
<v Speaker 2>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure,</v>

515
00:23:47.421 --> 00:23:52.421
<v Speaker 2>but say sailing that lost their </v>
<v Speaker 2>testicles to testicular cancer and </v>

516
00:23:52.421 --> 00:23:54.950
<v Speaker 2>almost got to that level versus someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

517
00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>urine test would show low testosterone </v>

518
00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.071
<v Speaker 2>on one or two occasions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which my understanding was alleged was </v>

519
00:24:03.071 --> 00:24:06.611
<v Speaker 2>being required for trt back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which not only that is easy to </v>

520
00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:10.811
<v Speaker 2>manipulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all they have to do is just be </v>

521
00:24:10.811 --> 00:24:13.091
<v Speaker 2>tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like literally all they have to do is </v>

522
00:24:13.091 --> 00:24:13.880
<v Speaker 2>workout really hard to a crazy workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay up all night,</v>

523
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.670
<v Speaker 2>piss on in a bottle in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

524
00:24:16.671 --> 00:24:19.310
<v Speaker 2>this poor guy got the testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a 90 year old man.</v>

525
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:24.700
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile they're manipulating it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also it's a sign of steroid abuse </v>

526
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.250
<v Speaker 2>because if you have taken steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've wrecked your endocrine system and</v>

527
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:33.251
<v Speaker 2>then you go in there and you take these </v>
<v Speaker 2>tests and it shows that you're into </v>

528
00:24:33.251 --> 00:24:33.251
<v Speaker 2>consistent direct and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

529
00:24:33.251 --> 00:24:33.950
<v Speaker 2>you need some steroids to fix that.</v>

530
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:39.400
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the protocol and this was a </v>

531
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.750
<v Speaker 2>just a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were dealing with several athletes </v>

532
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.571
<v Speaker 2>that were competing at the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of MMA and they were Jews to the </v>

533
00:24:46.571 --> 00:24:46.571
<v Speaker 2>tits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

534
00:24:46.571 --> 00:24:49.450
<v Speaker 2>And it's a good thing we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about being in the past because that,</v>

535
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not happening going forward.</v>

536
00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Our program does have a therapeutic use </v>
<v Speaker 2>exemption,</v>

537
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:59.120
<v Speaker 2>a possibility for athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So athletes can apply for certain </v>

538
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.641
<v Speaker 2>medicines that maybe our band that an </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent group that you saw to puts </v>

539
00:25:03.641 --> 00:25:08.521
<v Speaker 2>together a physicians and scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>will look at to determine if there </v>

540
00:25:08.521 --> 00:25:09.530
<v Speaker 2>really isn't a medical need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what would that be?</v>

541
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Testosterone replacement theory will not</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a therapy will not be one of those </v>

542
00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.960
<v Speaker 2>like adderall adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone recently,</v>

543
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:24.010
<v Speaker 2>one of our fighters has some type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease where they need medicine </v>

544
00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:25.720
<v Speaker 2>administered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Niv,</v>

545
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:30.730
<v Speaker 2>every month and ivy as we'll probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to talking about here is a </v>

546
00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.300
<v Speaker 2>prohibited method under our system.</v>

547
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.580
<v Speaker 2>So they would apply for a cue saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

548
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm using this ivy because I'd need this</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug for this disease I have,</v>

549
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.890
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

550
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:45.040
<v Speaker 2>give me approval to use it and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>board will look at it and determine </v>

551
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.850
<v Speaker 2>whether or not that's needed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one athlete.</v>

552
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this athlete needs at once a month.</v>

553
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.380
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you do that,</v>

554
00:25:51.381 --> 00:25:56.030
<v Speaker 2>would you test them when they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that drug?</v>

555
00:25:56.031 --> 00:26:01.031
<v Speaker 2>Whatever they need and then make sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they haven't been using an IV bag </v>

556
00:26:01.031 --> 00:26:01.031
<v Speaker 2>then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

557
00:26:01.031 --> 00:26:02.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a difficult one to how you saw it</v>

558
00:26:02.391 --> 00:26:03.560
<v Speaker 2>is going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

559
00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:08.561
<v Speaker 2>I think they would go along with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal testing protocol and that </v>

560
00:26:08.561 --> 00:26:09.350
<v Speaker 2>individual and whether or not it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

561
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.320
<v Speaker 2>hit that individual when they were using</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ivy or not.</v>

562
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:17.350
<v Speaker 2>If evidence of an ivy usage did come up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they would go back and this could </v>

563
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:20.330
<v Speaker 2>apply to any drug that is granted for </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic use exemption.</v>

564
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.420
<v Speaker 2>They then go back and look at that file </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that athlete and say,</v>

565
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:28.421
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like that athletes use Nivea all </v>

566
00:26:28.421 --> 00:26:29.540
<v Speaker 2>he was approved to use one under a </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic use exemption.</v>

567
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Are you at liberty to say what the drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they have to take a.</v>

568
00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

569
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now what is the,</v>

570
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:40.690
<v Speaker 2>what's the reason why they can't use an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ivs to mask possible performance </v>

571
00:26:40.791 --> 00:26:43.490
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the primary reason.</v>

572
00:26:43.491 --> 00:26:44.590
<v Speaker 2>And I saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

573
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 2>we talked a little bit ago about cycling</v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

574
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:48.000
<v Speaker 2>I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

575
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.120
<v Speaker 2>front and center in cycling and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were using ivs of sailing solution </v>

576
00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.100
<v Speaker 2>to manipulate their biological passport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to manipulate their blood level </v>

577
00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:02.841
<v Speaker 2>readings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were being used to determine if </v>

578
00:27:02.841 --> 00:27:02.841
<v Speaker 2>they were blood doping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

579
00:27:02.841 --> 00:27:04.890
<v Speaker 2>it could also be used to flush the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

580
00:27:04.891 --> 00:27:07.350
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it dilutes blood in urine so that,</v>

581
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:12.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural steroid steroid profiles are </v>

582
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.960
<v Speaker 2>very hard to read after you've taken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

583
00:27:12.961 --> 00:27:13.950
<v Speaker 2>an ivy bag.</v>

584
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's the primary reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

585
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I think water also prohibits them for </v>
<v Speaker 2>some health reasons.</v>

586
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are many.</v>

587
00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

588
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.260
<v Speaker 2>we can talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we're going to talk about it </v>

589
00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.151
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those were on many different levels </v>

590
00:27:29.151 --> 00:27:29.151
<v Speaker 2>of health reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think primarily,</v>

591
00:27:29.151 --> 00:27:29.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

592
00:27:29.341 --> 00:27:31.240
<v Speaker 2>when an IV is administered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

593
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.380
<v Speaker 2>and I've talked to too many athletes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have had this happen,</v>

594
00:27:34.381 --> 00:27:36.960
<v Speaker 2>especially close to a competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

595
00:27:36.961 --> 00:27:41.961
<v Speaker 2>there's a possibility of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of blown out of vain or having clotting </v>

596
00:27:41.961 --> 00:27:42.300
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

597
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:45.270
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible] taken out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the idea is to rehydrate,</v>

598
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.550
<v Speaker 2>it's much safer to do it orally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There could be some issues with,</v>

599
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:54.360
<v Speaker 2>with ivy administration and a Dema,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so swelling,</v>

600
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:59.420
<v Speaker 2>so we're cells will not be able to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>rid of fluid because they've got too </v>

601
00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.400
<v Speaker 2>much too quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

602
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.750
<v Speaker 2>I have heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have heard of that being an issue with</v>

603
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:07.470
<v Speaker 2>ivy replacement and I think that was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue with at least one UFC fighter.</v>

604
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

605
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

606
00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:15.531
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could put a name to this story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know someone did have an issue </v>

607
00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:19.600
<v Speaker 2>with legal use of it back when it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>approved where they got a Dema.</v>

608
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

609
00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

610
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:26.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know of any current fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to a few retired fighters </v>

611
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:27.270
<v Speaker 2>who told me about problems that they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

612
00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:30.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to interrupt,</v>

613
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:35.361
<v Speaker 2>but the concern that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have is that a lot of these guys are </v>

614
00:28:35.361 --> 00:28:39.591
<v Speaker 2>cutting a tremendous amount of weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of them more than 20 pounds </v>

615
00:28:39.591 --> 00:28:44.090
<v Speaker 2>that cut that the day of the weigh ins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weigh in looking like a skeleton </v>

616
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:47.811
<v Speaker 2>and then 24 hours later they're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to engage in the most ferocious form of </v>

617
00:28:47.811 --> 00:28:52.220
<v Speaker 2>unarmed combat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know of what would these guys </v>

618
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.430
<v Speaker 2>normally would do is rehydrate with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ivy.</v>

619
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.480
<v Speaker 2>They would go and they would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>several bags of liquid put into their </v>

620
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.150
<v Speaker 2>body and then they would just blow up </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a balloon,</v>

621
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.270
<v Speaker 2>come back in 24 hours later and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>see them the next day.</v>

622
00:29:03.271 --> 00:29:04.740
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same person.</v>

623
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.020
<v Speaker 2>They look so much bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean some guys,</v>

624
00:29:07.021 --> 00:29:12.021
<v Speaker 2>it was just freakish to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would see them rehydrated and you'd </v>

625
00:29:12.021 --> 00:29:12.021
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

626
00:29:12.021 --> 00:29:13.410
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did this guy do this?</v>

627
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:19.010
<v Speaker 2>They can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they have to drink the water and </v>

628
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:20.700
<v Speaker 2>what are the issues with drinking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water and how hard is it going to be for</v>

629
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:23.340
<v Speaker 2>these extreme weight cutting guys to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rehydrate?</v>

630
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

631
00:29:24.331 --> 00:29:26.220
<v Speaker 2>there there's many issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>

632
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:31.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies show that orally rehydrating is </v>

633
00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.390
<v Speaker 2>better for you if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're mildly dehydrated.</v>

634
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.440
<v Speaker 2>But what studies are they done by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gatorade?</v>

635
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Who Does these studies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

636
00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American</v>

637
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:47.680
<v Speaker 1>meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they're real American trainers </v>

638
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.150
<v Speaker 1>association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Sports Medicine Journal.</v>

639
00:29:49.151 --> 00:29:51.430
<v Speaker 1>There's many of them out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

640
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.310
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two things that they,</v>

641
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.700
<v Speaker 1>that they show consistently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

642
00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

643
00:29:56.501 --> 00:30:00.100
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously safer to put something </v>
<v Speaker 1>through your mouth and you put it in the</v>

644
00:30:00.101 --> 00:30:02.080
<v Speaker 1>needle in your vein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

645
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:07.230
<v Speaker 1>number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought was interesting is your </v>

646
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.690
<v Speaker 1>perceived rate of exertion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how hard do you feel you're working </v>

647
00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:14.640
<v Speaker 1>after rehydrating orally is less than if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you rehydrate Viv.</v>

648
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:16.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

649
00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:17.890
<v Speaker 1>the message we're trying to get out is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

650
00:30:17.891 --> 00:30:21.010
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you rehydrate orally properly,</v>

651
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:26.370
<v Speaker 1>UFC fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that next day you're going to feel a </v>

652
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:26.370
<v Speaker 1>whole lot better when you're exerting </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

653
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:29.020
<v Speaker 1>And multiple studies have showed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

654
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:34.590
<v Speaker 1>now that's mild dehydration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme dehydration,</v>

655
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:39.410
<v Speaker 1>the studies do show that ivs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

656
00:30:39.411 --> 00:30:43.750
<v Speaker 1>You probably should go to a hospital and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get one if you're extremely dehydrated,</v>

657
00:30:43.751 --> 00:30:46.510
<v Speaker 1>that oral rehydration is not going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it for you.</v>

658
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.300
<v Speaker 1>And in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

659
00:30:48.301 --> 00:30:53.301
<v Speaker 1>in Wada's prohibited method policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an exception to ivs where if </v>

660
00:30:53.301 --> 00:30:57.940
<v Speaker 1>you are administered to a hospital </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting and given an ivy,</v>

661
00:30:57.941 --> 00:31:02.941
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need a therapeutic use </v>

662
00:31:02.941 --> 00:31:04.831
<v Speaker 1>exemption under our policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to notify Usada the </v>

663
00:31:04.831 --> 00:31:08.731
<v Speaker 1>problem or the catch 22 there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you need to notify the </v>

664
00:31:08.731 --> 00:31:12.451
<v Speaker 1>commission where you're fighting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were administered to a hospital the </v>

665
00:31:12.451 --> 00:31:15.700
<v Speaker 1>day before your fight and they wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>let me not going to let you fight.</v>

666
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what it all comes down to,</v>

667
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is our guys and girls need to get </v>

668
00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.761
<v Speaker 1>smarter about those weight cuts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>should not be excessively dehydrating </v>

669
00:31:26.761 --> 00:31:29.320
<v Speaker 1>themselves the day before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you one more thing.</v>

670
00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:32.850
<v Speaker 1>These studies are in their infancy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

671
00:31:32.851 --> 00:31:37.851
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists and physicians about this,</v>

672
00:31:38.051 --> 00:31:43.051
<v Speaker 1>but right now rehydration studies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that in 24 hours if you're </v>

673
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.970
<v Speaker 1>dehydrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

674
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:51.360
<v Speaker 1>you're likely not gonna fully rehydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be orally or ivy in 24 hours,</v>

675
00:31:52.601 --> 00:31:57.601
<v Speaker 1>it's probably going to take more like 48</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours and the last thing to fully </v>

676
00:31:58.721 --> 00:32:01.480
<v Speaker 1>rehydrate is going to be the blood brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>barrier,</v>

677
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:06.250
<v Speaker 1>so that fluid around the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain that's protecting it from hard</v>

678
00:32:06.251 --> 00:32:06.820
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>

679
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:12.480
<v Speaker 1>There's some science out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows that may take 72 hours to fully </v>

680
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.120
<v Speaker 1>recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

681
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.290
<v Speaker 1>So I mean really throw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

682
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:20.470
<v Speaker 1>the ivy thing out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even with Ivy Rehydration,</v>

683
00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:25.150
<v Speaker 1>you're still putting yourself in serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger 24 hours later if you're severely</v>

684
00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.470
<v Speaker 1>dehydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

685
00:32:26.471 --> 00:32:30.650
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about this because your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job as the VP of a.</v>

686
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.180
<v Speaker 1>What is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance and what does the health and</v>

687
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:38.260
<v Speaker 1>health and performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about zero way to stop weight </v>

688
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 1>cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

689
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:45.100
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideally what we should do is match </v>

690
00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.161
<v Speaker 3>people up that are the same size and </v>
<v Speaker 3>have them compete against other elite </v>

691
00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:53.981
<v Speaker 3>athletes that are the same size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget about all the way cutting </v>

692
00:32:53.981 --> 00:32:53.981
<v Speaker 3>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just.</v>

693
00:32:53.981 --> 00:32:53.981
<v Speaker 3>What do you wait?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wait one 80.</v>

694
00:32:53.981 --> 00:32:55.430
<v Speaker 3>That's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're at your optimum,</v>

695
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 3>you should be fighting guys that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>also won 80.</v>

696
00:32:57.261 --> 00:32:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Let's find out who the best 180 pound </v>
<v Speaker 3>person is.</v>

697
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.290
<v Speaker 3>There's a real problem in the UFC with </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight classes there.</v>

698
00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.370
<v Speaker 3>There's a giant jump in between them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one 85 and then there's two.</v>

699
00:33:07.371 --> 00:33:12.371
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five of you stand at 185 pound man next </v>

700
00:33:12.371 --> 00:33:15.491
<v Speaker 3>to a 205 pound man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with 2016 ounce t-bones </v>

701
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:20.590
<v Speaker 3>that's pushing that 205 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just think about the amount of mass and </v>

702
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:24.671
<v Speaker 3>power that you can generate with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of weight they have.</v>

703
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 3>That extra 20 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's significant.</v>

704
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.200
<v Speaker 3>The amount of more power that they could</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly generate,</v>

705
00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:31.490
<v Speaker 3>the amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

706
00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.720
<v Speaker 3>just the ability to pick you up when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they maybe couldn't if they were just 20</v>

707
00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:38.630
<v Speaker 3>pounds less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ability to push out of a lock,</v>

708
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:40.520
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to break out of a submission,</v>

709
00:33:40.521 --> 00:33:42.230
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to break out of a clench.</v>

710
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:46.010
<v Speaker 3>That's significant and when you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>these big giant gaps,</v>

711
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.150
<v Speaker 3>it's encouraging people to make these </v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme weight cuts because they want to</v>

712
00:33:50.151 --> 00:33:51.290
<v Speaker 3>be the big guy in the division.</v>

713
00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you with all of that.</v>

714
00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully Viv ban and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of those statistics I was quoting </v>

715
00:33:59.951 --> 00:34:02.980
<v Speaker 1>earlier in those studies will have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on things and,</v>

716
00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.420
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cause,</v>

717
00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:06.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our athletes,</v>

718
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trainers support to take a look at that.</v>

719
00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you examples of ncaa </v>

720
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.131
<v Speaker 1>wrestling in the late nineties had an </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with a bad issue with weight </v>

721
00:34:17.131 --> 00:34:19.000
<v Speaker 1>cutting and last three wrestlers in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

722
00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:22.090
<v Speaker 1>two Saunas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plastic suits,</v>

723
00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.590
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say last they die,</v>

724
00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:24.240
<v Speaker 1>they died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

725
00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:29.730
<v Speaker 1>A NCA went to the extreme and band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's most weight cutting practices.</v>

726
00:34:31.001 --> 00:34:34.300
<v Speaker 1>They banned plastic suits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saunas,</v>

727
00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.730
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

728
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:42.090
<v Speaker 1>they adapted and became much more safer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Ivy ban went into effect after water</v>

729
00:34:43.211 --> 00:34:45.010
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 2012.</v>

730
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:49.390
<v Speaker 1>And that effected severely Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing in Olympic wrestling.</v>

731
00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:51.670
<v Speaker 1>We're doing weight cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

732
00:34:51.671 --> 00:34:54.040
<v Speaker 1>similar to what an amazing experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

733
00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:59.130
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those sports have much smaller weight </v>

734
00:34:59.130 --> 00:34:59.130
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

735
00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that every 10 pounds,</v>

736
00:35:00.941 --> 00:35:01.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

737
00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I mean,</v>

738
00:35:02.711 --> 00:35:07.711
<v Speaker 1>but there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think initially kind of similar to </v>

739
00:35:07.711 --> 00:35:07.711
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Lot,</v>

740
00:35:07.711 --> 00:35:09.190
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pushback from the athletes </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

741
00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't fair,</v>

742
00:35:10.331 --> 00:35:12.100
<v Speaker 1>this isn't right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be unsafe,</v>

743
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.160
<v Speaker 1>adapted pretty quickly and it's become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing of the past here.</v>

744
00:35:15.161 --> 00:35:17.150
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

745
00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.420
<v Speaker 1>in terms of what we're going and where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going,</v>

746
00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly just trying to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponge and absorb,</v>

747
00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>

748
00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:26.260
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine,</v>

749
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:30.400
<v Speaker 1>pass it along to our fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass it along internally with UFC.</v>

750
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

751
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see where it goes.</v>

752
00:35:33.311 --> 00:35:34.480
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said earlier,</v>

753
00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:38.340
<v Speaker 1>my position and I think the position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership is always</v>

754
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 2>with a health and safety of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters,</v>

755
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:41.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the forefront.</v>

756
00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it'd be an issue that,</v>

757
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personally I'll definitely always be </v>

758
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.861
<v Speaker 2>looking at have you had the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them whether or not there will be </v>

759
00:35:51.861 --> 00:35:56.211
<v Speaker 2>additional weight classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't talked about that </v>

760
00:35:56.211 --> 00:35:56.211
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

761
00:35:56.211 --> 00:35:59.871
<v Speaker 2>have talked about what this issue of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ib band's gonna mean and some of the </v>

762
00:35:59.871 --> 00:36:02.640
<v Speaker 2>statistics and stories that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing about weight cutting,</v>

763
00:36:02.641 --> 00:36:07.641
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely sharing that with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with everybody that I think that's </v>

764
00:36:07.641 --> 00:36:10.940
<v Speaker 2>hugely important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there has to be some sort of an </v>

765
00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.611
<v Speaker 2>option for these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for someone who's like say Chris </v>

766
00:36:13.611 --> 00:36:13.611
<v Speaker 2>Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weidman's a big guy,</v>

767
00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:18.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very to the fact that he makes one </v>

768
00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:21.111
<v Speaker 2>85 is shocking enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him when he cut weight on a short </v>

769
00:36:21.111 --> 00:36:23.760
<v Speaker 2>notice to make one 85 for Damien Maia </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he looked like death.</v>

770
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:28.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was on death's door when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>weighed in and then the next day went </v>

771
00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:32.331
<v Speaker 2>out and won just by sheer toughness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>will and skill and just the fact that </v>

772
00:36:32.331 --> 00:36:34.860
<v Speaker 2>he's that Kinda guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

773
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:37.350
<v Speaker 2>that's because he cut a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

774
00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:40.290
<v Speaker 2>that's how he made that weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then then he fought the next day and</v>

775
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:43.260
<v Speaker 2>he was definitely depleted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could see in his performance.</v>

776
00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he won a decision against my,</v>

777
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy look sluggish.</v>

778
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:49.350
<v Speaker 2>And you just push through just through </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheer toughness.</v>

779
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.480
<v Speaker 2>A guy like him was the champ at one 85.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If all of a sudden weight cutting starts</v>

780
00:36:54.481 --> 00:36:56.130
<v Speaker 2>getting banned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's walking around.</v>

781
00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to guess at least 20 pounds </v>

782
00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:01.300
<v Speaker 2>heavier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least.</v>

783
00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.100
<v Speaker 2>What does a guy like that too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the champion.</v>

784
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.520
<v Speaker 2>If he can't make the one 85 weight class</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

785
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:06.630
<v Speaker 2>So you just move up to two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

786
00:37:06.631 --> 00:37:07.740
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

787
00:37:07.741 --> 00:37:09.720
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting tough question.</v>

788
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:10.890
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

789
00:37:10.891 --> 00:37:14.220
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the toughest guys and girls on</v>

790
00:37:14.221 --> 00:37:18.810
<v Speaker 2>the planet and just able to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves through unhuman,</v>

791
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:24.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain and suffering both in the ring and </v>

792
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:24.480
<v Speaker 2>I think through the weight cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

793
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:24.960
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

794
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:27.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer to that right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now other than,</v>

795
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>educate and share as much information.</v>

796
00:37:31.201 --> 00:37:34.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big believer and throwing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>million rules at people.</v>

797
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:37.380
<v Speaker 2>I think you take things one step at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

798
00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the [inaudible] band does,</v>

799
00:37:39.901 --> 00:37:44.901
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of what the education that we're </v>

800
00:37:44.901 --> 00:37:45.780
<v Speaker 2>providing our athletes does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

801
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:48.900
<v Speaker 2>all was reevaluated month to month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>year to year.</v>

802
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.320
<v Speaker 2>I just think that there should be some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of an option for these guys.</v>

803
00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that they have a 20 pound </v>

804
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:00.560
<v Speaker 2>weight jumped between one 85 and two.</v>

805
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a big one is two.</v>

806
00:38:01.981 --> 00:38:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

807
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:05.550
<v Speaker 2>two to 65.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is fucking crazy.</v>

808
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:10.910
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of guys that are small </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweights or just dehydrated light </v>

809
00:38:11.041 --> 00:38:14.730
<v Speaker 2>heavyweights and they have to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do about something like that.</v>

810
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
<v Speaker 2>I really think the UFC needs many more </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight classes and they've resisted </v>

811
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.120
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think it waters the sport down like</v>

812
00:38:21.121 --> 00:38:26.121
<v Speaker 2>it does with boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it creates more champions </v>

813
00:38:26.121 --> 00:38:29.511
<v Speaker 2>and more champions creates the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of more champion versus </v>

814
00:38:29.511 --> 00:38:30.840
<v Speaker 2>champion fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that these,</v>

815
00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:34.080
<v Speaker 2>these gaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to institute this no ivy</v>

816
00:38:34.081 --> 00:38:36.760
<v Speaker 2>thing and you're going to change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole system of weight cutting,</v>

817
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.680
<v Speaker 2>it got to give these people some </v>
<v Speaker 2>options.</v>

818
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see where it goes.</v>

819
00:38:40.661 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

820
00:38:41.711 --> 00:38:44.110
<v Speaker 2>other than the ivs being used to defeat </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug tests,</v>

821
00:38:44.111 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 2>which is in my past experience a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue for me that,</v>

822
00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:49.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm learning on a day to day basis.</v>

823
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:49.780
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

824
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.020
<v Speaker 2>what about athletes and camp?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they allowed to use an Ivn camp?</v>

825
00:38:53.021 --> 00:38:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Like what if they have a particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal day in the Hot Sun?</v>

826
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:58.720
<v Speaker 2>They go run up hills and they come back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and their doctor says,</v>

827
00:38:58.721 --> 00:39:00.670
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really fucking dehydrated.</v>

828
00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:05.050
<v Speaker 2>We would like to get an IV bag in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can they call you guys up and say,</v>

829
00:39:05.051 --> 00:39:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an athlete that,</v>

830
00:39:06.521 --> 00:39:08.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just did a two a day and didn't know,</v>

831
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:12.700
<v Speaker 2>did hill sprints and we would really </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to get this kid in ivy again,</v>

832
00:39:12.701 --> 00:39:15.010
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a hospital administration setting.</v>

833
00:39:15.011 --> 00:39:17.350
<v Speaker 2>They can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't even need to notify us.</v>

834
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.340
<v Speaker 2>That may be an instance where they would</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do it because then they wouldn't</v>

835
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:22.480
<v Speaker 2>have to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

836
00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.370
<v Speaker 2>the commission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

837
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:29.550
<v Speaker 2>if there was no fight coming up soon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wouldn't that be something that </v>

838
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.550
<v Speaker 2>could potentially manipulate?</v>

839
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.970
<v Speaker 2>It could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

840
00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.180
<v Speaker 2>they could manipulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

841
00:39:32.181 --> 00:39:33.760
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their blood levels,</v>

842
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:34.930
<v Speaker 2>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

843
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.040
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a balancing act.</v>

844
00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:39.370
<v Speaker 2>If somebody is really truly that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dehydrated and needs one,</v>

845
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:44.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it can be used to manipulate a </v>

846
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:47.730
<v Speaker 2>blood test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's for their health and safety </v>

847
00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:47.730
<v Speaker 2>because there are so severely </v>
<v Speaker 2>dehydrated,</v>

848
00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:52.111
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the policy is made to so as not to stop </v>

849
00:39:52.111 --> 00:39:52.240
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

850
00:39:52.241 --> 00:39:53.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy Foster,</v>

851
00:39:53.681 --> 00:39:55.930
<v Speaker 2>who's the head of the California State </v>
<v Speaker 2>Athletic Commission,</v>

852
00:39:55.931 --> 00:39:58.120
<v Speaker 2>has done a fantastic job here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

853
00:39:58.121 --> 00:40:03.121
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of this guy and he's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressively going after drug doping and</v>

854
00:40:03.611 --> 00:40:06.160
<v Speaker 2>tested a lot of people on the UFC card </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

855
00:40:06.161 --> 00:40:08.100
<v Speaker 2>I believe he tested everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

856
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.620
<v Speaker 2>and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who got popped,</v>

857
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.630
<v Speaker 2>I think they gave him a three year </v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

858
00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:15.640
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's extreme.</v>

859
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is sending a big,</v>

860
00:40:17.231 --> 00:40:22.231
<v Speaker 2>big message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that's the kind of </v>

861
00:40:22.231 --> 00:40:22.231
<v Speaker 2>stuff that has to be done?</v>

862
00:40:22.231 --> 00:40:25.690
<v Speaker 2>Like it has to be so extreme that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to have a few sacrificial lambs,</v>

863
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:27.430
<v Speaker 2>were the rest of the athletes have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

864
00:40:27.431 --> 00:40:29.110
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my fucking career.</v>

865
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to really compete,</v>

866
00:40:30.701 --> 00:40:32.380
<v Speaker 2>this is the way you're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

867
00:40:32.381 --> 00:40:34.420
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't take any chances because we're</v>

868
00:40:34.421 --> 00:40:39.421
<v Speaker 2>not talking about nine months anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not that bad for fighter </v>

869
00:40:39.421 --> 00:40:40.300
<v Speaker 2>because the reality is they're not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight more than once every six months</v>

870
00:40:40.301 --> 00:40:41.140
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they get,</v>

871
00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:43.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at an elite level.</v>

872
00:40:43.151 --> 00:40:47.140
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare that a guy like say a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vito Belfort fights more than once every</v>

873
00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:50.170
<v Speaker 2>six months at the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might fight three times a year.</v>

874
00:40:50.171 --> 00:40:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the guy takes a few extra months off.</v>

875
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three years.</v>

876
00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:56.560
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of the end of your career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

877
00:40:56.561 --> 00:40:57.700
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you 100 percent.</v>

878
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:02.700
<v Speaker 2>There needs to be the deterrent effect </v>
<v Speaker 2>upfront and that's one of the reasons I </v>

879
00:41:02.921 --> 00:41:07.000
<v Speaker 2>think our policy is so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's our policy first time is too,</v>

880
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:12.030
<v Speaker 2>but if there's aggravating circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that would be quantified as say </v>

881
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:15.811
<v Speaker 2>somebody was found to take a steroid and</v>
<v Speaker 2>did an ivy bag just before the test and </v>

882
00:41:16.091 --> 00:41:21.091
<v Speaker 2>we found out about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be an aggravating </v>

883
00:41:21.091 --> 00:41:21.091
<v Speaker 2>circumstance and possibility of four </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

884
00:41:21.091 --> 00:41:21.770
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

885
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.790
<v Speaker 2>as we get out and educate our fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

886
00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:24.640
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

887
00:41:24.641 --> 00:41:26.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk about those terms and I asked who</v>

888
00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:30.550
<v Speaker 2>thinks to definitely for is a career </v>
<v Speaker 2>ender.</v>

889
00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Most of them heads bobbing up and down </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean unless you're on the</v>

890
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:36.290
<v Speaker 1>absolute top of the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

891
00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.650
<v Speaker 1>food chain for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for years as you're done long past.</v>

892
00:41:39.651 --> 00:41:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you get popped at 34,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you come back,</v>

893
00:41:42.741 --> 00:41:44.920
<v Speaker 1>you 38,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

894
00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:46.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not.</v>

895
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it does happen,</v>

896
00:41:47.511 --> 00:41:51.870
<v Speaker 1>you'll be severely diminished and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>likelihood of you being mean,</v>

897
00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.540
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be off the sauce now </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

898
00:41:53.541 --> 00:41:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Like you were probably doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>so your,</v>

899
00:41:55.351 --> 00:41:57.090
<v Speaker 1>your system has to recover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

900
00:41:57.091 --> 00:42:02.091
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's also the mental aspect for </v>

901
00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:04.631
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of these fighters that </v>

902
00:42:04.631 --> 00:42:07.091
<v Speaker 1>were fighting enhanced for most of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>career and they have this mental </v>

903
00:42:08.241 --> 00:42:13.241
<v Speaker 1>advantage of fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance where they know they're juiced </v>

904
00:42:13.241 --> 00:42:13.241
<v Speaker 1>up and it gives them all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>

905
00:42:13.241 --> 00:42:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden you take that away </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just don't seem to be the same </v>

906
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.710
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

907
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

908
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:18.650
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting on the mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>side of things,</v>

909
00:42:18.651 --> 00:42:19.690
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

910
00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.550
<v Speaker 1>I learned this kind throughout my </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous career.</v>

911
00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:27.551
<v Speaker 1>Talking to athletes is the mental effort</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it takes to use drugs when you're </v>

912
00:42:28.911 --> 00:42:33.911
<v Speaker 1>under a good solid anti-doping system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many athletes say,</v>

913
00:42:34.281 --> 00:42:39.281
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the performance benefits I was </v>

914
00:42:39.281 --> 00:42:39.770
<v Speaker 1>getting from these drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely felt stronger.</v>

915
00:42:39.771 --> 00:42:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Could go longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it took to figure out what drugs to</v>

916
00:42:44.271 --> 00:42:49.271
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long they were going to clear my </v>

917
00:42:49.271 --> 00:42:50.891
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry after I took a drug was shit or </v>

918
00:42:50.891 --> 00:42:50.891
<v Speaker 1>the tests is going to come tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

919
00:42:50.891 --> 00:42:55.480
<v Speaker 1>That mental burden for a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes far outweighed the physical </v>

920
00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.830
<v Speaker 1>enhancement they were getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

921
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.170
<v Speaker 1>As an endless amount of stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine?</v>

922
00:43:00.171 --> 00:43:01.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our policy,</v>

923
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:06.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be tested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to be tested 365 days a </v>

924
00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:06.730
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

925
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:12.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an athlete who would choose to use </v>

926
00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:12.250
<v Speaker 1>something that night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that athlete use something.</v>

927
00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine like listening for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doorbell or that warnock all night long?</v>

928
00:43:15.741 --> 00:43:18.230
<v Speaker 1>All morning long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some athletes I talked to that</v>

929
00:43:18.231 --> 00:43:23.231
<v Speaker 1>had surveillance systems up where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would literally at night after taking a </v>

930
00:43:23.231 --> 00:43:25.430
<v Speaker 1>dose be looking at their television </v>
<v Speaker 1>screens and shit's coming down.</v>

931
00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:30.830
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A huge mental tasks and they can't hide </v>

932
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:31.040
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

933
00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:36.041
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you could just go to palm </v>
<v Speaker 1>beach and take a hotel room and camp </v>

934
00:43:36.041 --> 00:43:39.911
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to like let the UFC know where </v>

935
00:43:39.911 --> 00:43:39.911
<v Speaker 1>you are all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

936
00:43:39.911 --> 00:43:43.451
<v Speaker 1>so we have a whereabouts program and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that requires our athletes on a </v>

937
00:43:43.461 --> 00:43:47.270
<v Speaker 1>quarterly basis to fill out whereabouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're going,</v>

938
00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:49.940
<v Speaker 1>where they can be located,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're staying overnight,</v>

939
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:55.510
<v Speaker 1>regularly scheduled activities that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have during the day so that if you saw </v>

940
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:59.411
<v Speaker 1>to who's administrating our program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to go out and find that athlete </v>

941
00:43:59.411 --> 00:43:59.411
<v Speaker 1>they can do that now.</v>

942
00:43:59.411 --> 00:44:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't include.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't include our involved.</v>

943
00:44:01.311 --> 00:44:06.311
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four slash seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereabouts are athletes don't need to </v>

944
00:44:06.311 --> 00:44:10.001
<v Speaker 1>let you saw to know where they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be at all times if they're going out </v>

945
00:44:10.001 --> 00:44:11.240
<v Speaker 1>to a movie or the supermarket or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

946
00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:13.640
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that it just means if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw to,</v>

947
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.360
<v Speaker 1>chooses on a day or night to go locate </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of our athletes,</v>

948
00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:22.780
<v Speaker 1>they have an idea of where to go find </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and can find them within a </v>

949
00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:26.441
<v Speaker 1>reasonable amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having a conversation with a to </v>

950
00:44:26.441 --> 00:44:27.890
<v Speaker 1>keep this as vague as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

951
00:44:27.891 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I was having a conversation with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete who was telling that he knew of</v>

952
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:37.010
<v Speaker 3>an athlete that was not clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then so this athlete decided to go </v>

953
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:42.000
<v Speaker 3>overseas and train,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just decided to like go hang out in some</v>

954
00:44:42.001 --> 00:44:43.830
<v Speaker 3>other country and train there for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

955
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.900
<v Speaker 3>What do you do if someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

956
00:44:45.901 --> 00:44:47.280
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go train and Thailand.</v>

957
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:49.320
<v Speaker 3>You guys going to go fly out to Thailand</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

958
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:50.220
<v Speaker 3>and test them.</v>

959
00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:52.770
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons we hired you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw that you saw to,</v>

960
00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:56.400
<v Speaker 1>has partnerships with international,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

961
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.110
<v Speaker 1>anti-doping agencies all across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

962
00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

963
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:02.590
<v Speaker 1>that's their job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're constantly going to conferences,</v>

964
00:45:02.591 --> 00:45:07.591
<v Speaker 1>they're going out and training </v>
<v Speaker 1>collection officers from other </v>

965
00:45:07.591 --> 00:45:08.320
<v Speaker 1>international bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they do,</v>

966
00:45:08.321 --> 00:45:13.321
<v Speaker 1>they have the ability to reach out </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere in the world because our </v>

967
00:45:13.321 --> 00:45:16.711
<v Speaker 1>population of athletes is spread across </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and get a test taken or a </v>

968
00:45:16.711 --> 00:45:17.340
<v Speaker 1>sample taken from them at any time.</v>

969
00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

970
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.820
<v Speaker 3>let's just say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

971
00:45:19.821 --> 00:45:20.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

972
00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:26.590
<v Speaker 3>not accusing anybody of anything but </v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just say if you were an </v>

973
00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:31.031
<v Speaker 3>unscrupulous athlete and you had ties to</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe people who also do unscrupulous </v>

974
00:45:31.031 --> 00:45:34.760
<v Speaker 3>things and they had a reasonable amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of power in a certain country,</v>

975
00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:40.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could just go there and they </v>

976
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:40.700
<v Speaker 3>kinda had deals with people and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

977
00:45:40.701 --> 00:45:41.390
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

978
00:45:41.391 --> 00:45:42.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

979
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:47.930
<v Speaker 3>we're going to give you a blood sample </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to give you a urine </v>

980
00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:50.681
<v Speaker 3>sample,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we just like you to wait here for a </v>

981
00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:52.661
<v Speaker 3>moment and we'll just go in the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>room and we come back with this stuff </v>

982
00:45:52.661 --> 00:45:52.661
<v Speaker 3>and they come back and they give it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys.</v>

983
00:45:52.661 --> 00:45:57.660
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you getting like video tape of this </v>

984
00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:00.521
<v Speaker 3>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you making sure you're seeing the </v>

985
00:46:00.521 --> 00:46:01.530
<v Speaker 3>exact athlete put the exact blood in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>exact thing,</v>

986
00:46:01.531 --> 00:46:04.520
<v Speaker 3>like how were you going to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's no fuckery,</v>

987
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:08.030
<v Speaker 3>no shenanigans going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in other countries?</v>

988
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a certain standard,</v>

989
00:46:09.581 --> 00:46:13.510
<v Speaker 1>no matter which country the collection's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going onto a of how these,</v>

990
00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:17.920
<v Speaker 1>how these collections happen and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>doping collection officer,</v>

991
00:46:17.921 --> 00:46:22.921
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the DCO has to physically witness the </v>

992
00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:24.950
<v Speaker 1>athlete providing the sample.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

993
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.090
<v Speaker 1>whether it be urine or blood test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to.</v>

994
00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:31.370
<v Speaker 3>How do you prove that they did that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're dealing with someone like</v>

995
00:46:31.371 --> 00:46:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I said in another country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you prove that this,</v>

996
00:46:34.011 --> 00:46:39.011
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this commissioner guy actually was </v>

997
00:46:39.011 --> 00:46:39.011
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>

998
00:46:39.011 --> 00:46:39.011
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these,</v>

999
00:46:39.011 --> 00:46:40.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dcos are trained,</v>

1000
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:45.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on worldwide collection standards </v>

1001
00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:45.740
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1002
00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.280
<v Speaker 1>they're vetted before they're hired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

1003
00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:53.310
<v Speaker 1>that could happen anywhere Joe could </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in this country or another </v>

1004
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:53.310
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1005
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:53.310
<v Speaker 1>but I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1006
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Erika better than I like other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

1007
00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.110
<v Speaker 1>so like to talk shit about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it will be,</v>

1008
00:46:57.111 --> 00:46:59.420
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the laboratory gets these samples,</v>

1009
00:46:59.421 --> 00:46:59.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1010
00:46:59.961 --> 00:47:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I think we're doing 2,700</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 3000 tests a year.</v>

1011
00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.150
<v Speaker 1>You start looking at samples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1012
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:12.250
<v Speaker 1>from a particular country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be the United States in a </v>

1013
00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:15.011
<v Speaker 1>certain region or another country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start seeing suspicion in that </v>

1014
00:47:15.011 --> 00:47:15.460
<v Speaker 1>sample.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1015
00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:19.970
<v Speaker 1>you start seeing Aaron variances in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological passport and collections done</v>

1016
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:22.760
<v Speaker 1>in another country versus when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1017
00:47:22.761 --> 00:47:24.500
<v Speaker 1>maybe they come here to the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

1018
00:47:24.501 --> 00:47:29.501
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a constant detective game going </v>

1019
00:47:29.501 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>on and there's,</v>

1020
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:35.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things put in place for every </v>

1021
00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.800
<v Speaker 2>conceivable situation to try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to detect that it's his seems </v>

1022
00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1023
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:43.330
<v Speaker 2>you're going to catch them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like there's only so much,</v>

1024
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:47.200
<v Speaker 2>so much wiggle room these guys have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these days,</v>

1025
00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:52.260
<v Speaker 2>but are there any things that are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your radar that could possibly be used </v>

1026
00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.540
<v Speaker 2>to cheat that we're not aware of yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>that most people aren't aware of?</v>

1027
00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Like the testosterone that's being done </v>
<v Speaker 2>with animals?</v>

1028
00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:05.970
<v Speaker 2>I never heard about that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything else like that that's </v>

1029
00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:06.250
<v Speaker 2>going on right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I can't give you any specific</v>

1030
00:48:06.251 --> 00:48:11.251
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will give the example of cyclists </v>

1031
00:48:11.251 --> 00:48:13.720
<v Speaker 2>that just got caught for the drugs still</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a clinical trial and what the </v>

1032
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:18.930
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping with that shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the anti-doping community has been </v>

1033
00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:22.591
<v Speaker 2>doing is reaching out to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical industry and saying and </v>

1034
00:48:22.591 --> 00:48:22.930
<v Speaker 2>querying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1035
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.700
<v Speaker 2>any drugs that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1036
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:29.701
<v Speaker 2>in clinical trial or to being developed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you see any potential for athletic </v>

1037
00:48:29.701 --> 00:48:30.550
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing benefits?</v>

1038
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 2>And if the pharmaceutical industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1039
00:48:32.621 --> 00:48:33.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1040
00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:36.040
<v Speaker 2>this particular drug was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was called oxygen and a pill,</v>

1041
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:41.520
<v Speaker 2>so you take it and create more red blood</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells similar to hipo but in an oral </v>

1042
00:48:41.531 --> 00:48:46.531
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the pharmaceutical industry </v>

1043
00:48:46.531 --> 00:48:46.810
<v Speaker 2>obviously told anti-doping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now this is coming out.</v>

1044
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Anti-Doping community was able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop a test kind of secretly and use </v>

1045
00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:55.390
<v Speaker 2>the test and caught somebody's oxygen in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pill.</v>

1046
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:56.260
<v Speaker 2>So it was called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1047
00:48:56.290 --> 00:49:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's essentially the same thing as </v>

1048
00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:05.071
<v Speaker 2>epo or works in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My understanding essentially the same </v>

1049
00:49:05.071 --> 00:49:08.221
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It causes your body to produce more red </v>

1050
00:49:08.221 --> 00:49:10.450
<v Speaker 2>blood cells which carry more oxygen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>can replenish your muscles quicker.</v>

1051
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the rub on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1052
00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Obviously that's an illegal substance </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it should be banned,</v>

1053
00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:17.950
<v Speaker 2>but what about guys who trained at </v>
<v Speaker 2>altitude?</v>

1054
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:21.370
<v Speaker 2>What about guys who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who sleeping altitude tense?</v>

1055
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember on one of the countdown </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>

1056
00:49:23.501 --> 00:49:28.501
<v Speaker 2>Bj Penn was sleeping in this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>zip-up tent and one of the things he </v>

1057
00:49:28.501 --> 00:49:30.310
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bj Penn's accent,</v>

1058
00:49:30.311 --> 00:49:31.270
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1059
00:49:31.271 --> 00:49:36.271
<v Speaker 2>I'm sleeping in a plastic tent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's getting their ass kicked </v>

1060
00:49:36.271 --> 00:49:38.350
<v Speaker 2>because yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the zip up this fucking tent to sleep in</v>

1061
00:49:38.351 --> 00:49:41.560
<v Speaker 2>it to simulate that he's at 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet or these sleeping there.</v>

1062
00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of other things like a</v>

1063
00:49:43.891 --> 00:49:47.200
<v Speaker 2>scent of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're aware of those altitudes machines</v>

1064
00:49:47.201 --> 00:49:49.090
<v Speaker 2>that they use at very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the altitude.</v>

1065
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:54.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm a Ian Mccall is a big fan of </v>

1066
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.730
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said they have tremendous effects.</v>

1067
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 2>A cryogenic chambers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of those.</v>

1068
00:49:57.791 --> 00:50:00.130
<v Speaker 2>They have massive effects on </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation,</v>

1069
00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:02.770
<v Speaker 2>massive effects on the neo Pranav </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend,</v>

1070
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.440
<v Speaker 2>a cold shock proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different things that help you</v>

1071
00:50:05.441 --> 00:50:08.840
<v Speaker 2>heal and reduce inflammation and help </v>
<v Speaker 2>you train more the.</v>

1072
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:13.000
<v Speaker 2>If you could do what that could do in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pill form,</v>

1073
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.470
<v Speaker 2>it might be illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1074
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1075
00:50:15.941 --> 00:50:16.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1076
00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.590
<v Speaker 2>I hear the argument of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1077
00:50:17.591 --> 00:50:19.510
<v Speaker 2>isn't that cheating getting in an oxygen</v>
<v Speaker 2>tent,</v>

1078
00:50:19.511 --> 00:50:24.511
<v Speaker 2>but I don't buy off that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the same thing as taking a drug </v>

1079
00:50:24.511 --> 00:50:26.200
<v Speaker 2>that manipulate the hormones and </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids in your body.</v>

1080
00:50:26.201 --> 00:50:27.440
<v Speaker 2>I think what ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1081
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:29.210
<v Speaker 2>isn't it exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you,</v>

1082
00:50:29.211 --> 00:50:32.960
<v Speaker 2>if you take gpo doesn't do exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing as sleeping at altitude,</v>

1083
00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:36.220
<v Speaker 2>but I think it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does it in a quicker forum.</v>

1084
00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:41.260
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to put forth the effort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of sleeping in an oxygen tent every </v>

1085
00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.790
<v Speaker 2>night for a period of weeks or months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's instantaneous.</v>

1086
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on the side of EPO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>

1087
00:50:47.991 --> 00:50:49.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should be allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it.</v>

1088
00:50:49.641 --> 00:50:54.641
<v Speaker 2>And I think as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only fighter that has been popped </v>

1089
00:50:54.641 --> 00:50:57.311
<v Speaker 2>for in the UFC was Ali bag off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which shows you how impressive Demetrius</v>

1090
00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Johnson's cardio is.</v>

1091
00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:01.850
<v Speaker 2>He outworked that guy who was on epo at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

1092
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:06.440
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he's taken that and that's illegal,</v>

1093
00:51:06.441 --> 00:51:11.441
<v Speaker 2>but he gets the exact same benefit as </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's sleeping in an oxygen </v>

1094
00:51:11.441 --> 00:51:11.720
<v Speaker 2>tent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it more difficult?</v>

1095
00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that legal?</v>

1096
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:16.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you get the same exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit.</v>

1097
00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I think it's way more extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1098
00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:22.300
<v Speaker 2>and using the drug you can get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>

1099
00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:27.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some hermatocrit levels of </v>

1100
00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:29.370
<v Speaker 2>some athletes get up in the mid fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 years.</v>

1101
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:31.520
<v Speaker 2>What's a normal number of adequate </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels?</v>

1102
00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:34.280
<v Speaker 2>The amount of red blood cells per blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>volume.</v>

1103
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:38.990
<v Speaker 2>Normal numbers are 42 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe on the high end,</v>

1104
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:42.170
<v Speaker 2>47 or 48 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1105
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:47.440
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them again in the mid fifties </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sixties and we start talking about </v>

1106
00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.430
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adequate levels of those amounts.</v>

1107
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:54.790
<v Speaker 2>There's so many red blood cells per </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood volume that your blood becomes </v>

1108
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.790
<v Speaker 2>thick.</v>

1109
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Tar like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we saw this with cyclists in</v>

1110
00:51:59.061 --> 00:52:02.360
<v Speaker 2>the mid nineties that just discovered </v>
<v Speaker 2>epo and we're using it.</v>

1111
00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:07.810
<v Speaker 2>They were dropping dead in their mid </v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties because of having strokes </v>

1112
00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:10.040
<v Speaker 2>because their blood became so thick that</v>
<v Speaker 2>any small little blockage,</v>

1113
00:52:10.041 --> 00:52:12.350
<v Speaker 2>the blood couldn't get through and stops</v>
<v Speaker 2>circulating.</v>

1114
00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:17.830
<v Speaker 2>You've got instances where they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>setting their alarms in the middle of </v>

1115
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:21.280
<v Speaker 2>the night and to get up and drink water </v>
<v Speaker 2>and do pushups and exercise to make sure</v>

1116
00:52:21.451 --> 00:52:24.410
<v Speaker 2>that their blood was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was still flowing for fear of it slowing</v>

1117
00:52:24.411 --> 00:52:26.960
<v Speaker 2>down and stopped flowing in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the night.</v>

1118
00:52:26.961 --> 00:52:31.961
<v Speaker 2>So you can extremely increase hematocrit</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels via using drugs like this versus </v>

1119
00:52:34.401 --> 00:52:37.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>training at oxygen and oxygen tents.</v>

1120
00:52:37.401 --> 00:52:39.790
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe you can get up a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit higher into that,</v>

1121
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:42.830
<v Speaker 2>that normal range and the 47 or 48 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>

1122
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:47.150
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't seen extremes of getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>into mid fifties and sixties from that.</v>

1123
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend who was on the cycling team </v>

1124
00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:52.210
<v Speaker 2>said that he would hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

1125
00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:53.420
<v Speaker 2>they would be on a tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sleeping in a bus,</v>

1126
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:58.600
<v Speaker 2>and you would hear guys get up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the night and hear their bike </v>

1127
00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:58.640
<v Speaker 2>come off the rack and they'd go riding </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they had to.</v>

1128
00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because their heart would start beating </v>

1129
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:03.790
<v Speaker 2>funky and they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>

1130
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:07.240
<v Speaker 2>And they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They literally are producing so much </v>

1131
00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:07.240
<v Speaker 2>blood that they had to burn some of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

1132
00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:08.240
<v Speaker 2>That's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1133
00:53:08.241 --> 00:53:13.241
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's burning it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just keeping it circulating </v>

1134
00:53:13.241 --> 00:53:16.430
<v Speaker 2>internally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the fact that these are the </v>

1135
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:17.250
<v Speaker 2>same guys who are taking this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the.</v>

1136
00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.400
<v Speaker 2>The cyclists were obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fighters,</v>

1137
00:53:19.401 --> 00:53:21.490
<v Speaker 2>they would get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get hit,</v>

1138
00:53:21.491 --> 00:53:26.491
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get a lot of bruising </v>
<v Speaker 2>and bruising is essentially just </v>

1139
00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:26.491
<v Speaker 2>internal bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's</v>

1140
00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:28.980
<v Speaker 3>what you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you used to look at a guy's leg and</v>

1141
00:53:28.981 --> 00:53:33.981
<v Speaker 3>he gets leg kicked a bunch and you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>these big welts and black and blue all </v>

1142
00:53:33.981 --> 00:53:34.140
<v Speaker 3>over his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's blood.</v>

1143
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:36.480
<v Speaker 3>He's bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's clotting up inside of his leg.</v>

1144
00:53:36.481 --> 00:53:39.330
<v Speaker 3>But he's bleeding and swelling when a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's on epo,</v>

1145
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:43.080
<v Speaker 3>is there a more significant danger when </v>
<v Speaker 3>when something like that's going on,</v>

1146
00:53:43.081 --> 00:53:45.300
<v Speaker 3>if you are bleeding like that or if your</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bruising?</v>

1147
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1148
00:53:46.321 --> 00:53:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a scientist,</v>

1149
00:53:47.371 --> 00:53:49.520
<v Speaker 1>but common sense will show you if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had more,</v>

1150
00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:51.960
<v Speaker 1>lot more red blood cells floating around</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

1151
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:53.700
<v Speaker 1>that are able to clot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then yeah,</v>

1152
00:53:53.701 --> 00:53:58.701
<v Speaker 1>you're likely running that risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing what people are </v>

1153
00:53:58.701 --> 00:54:00.990
<v Speaker 1>willing to risk just to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sure is.</v>

1154
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.590
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been a lesson that I'm just,</v>

1155
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1156
00:54:05.011 --> 00:54:10.011
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a lot informal questionnaires,</v>

1157
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:15.080
<v Speaker 1>interviews of athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could give up a couple of years </v>

1158
00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:15.080
<v Speaker 1>in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1159
00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:18.730
<v Speaker 1>and there was a pill that would allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to win an Olympic gold medal that </v>

1160
00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:18.730
<v Speaker 1>you had to give up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1161
00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:20.100
<v Speaker 1>four or five years and your life would </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1162
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:23.100
<v Speaker 1>And typically you see the answers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that overwhelmingly.</v>

1163
00:54:23.101 --> 00:54:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1164
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:29.160
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of it is athletes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit younger and their mid,</v>

1165
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:32.010
<v Speaker 1>early twenties feeling invincible at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that time.</v>

1166
00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Who's thinking about five years on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of your life then,</v>

1167
00:54:34.921 --> 00:54:36.040
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1168
00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:41.080
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the decision making of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of taking some of these performance </v>

1169
00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:41.670
<v Speaker 1>enhancing drugs occurs then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1170
00:54:41.671 --> 00:54:46.671
<v Speaker 1>were you feel young and invincible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares what you have to pay 20 or 30 </v>

1171
00:54:46.671 --> 00:54:48.440
<v Speaker 1>years down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1172
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.760
<v Speaker 1>for making a decision now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1173
00:54:50.761 --> 00:54:55.761
<v Speaker 1>And there's also a bunch of athletes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are putting money in the bank of </v>

1174
00:54:55.761 --> 00:54:58.230
<v Speaker 1>medical technology and innovation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1175
00:54:58.231 --> 00:55:00.300
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day they going to fix this.</v>

1176
00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Let me just take the shit now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then five,</v>

1177
00:55:02.671 --> 00:55:05.070
<v Speaker 1>10 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just build me a new liver.</v>

1178
00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1179
00:55:07.111 --> 00:55:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1180
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:13.460
<v Speaker 1>one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were kind of surprised that this </v>

1181
00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:13.460
<v Speaker 1>is my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1182
00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:17.250
<v Speaker 1>but I understand a lot of times why </v>
<v Speaker 1>these decisions are made.</v>

1183
00:55:17.251 --> 00:55:20.190
<v Speaker 1>There's such temptation financially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still,</v>

1184
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:22.980
<v Speaker 1>there's such incentive out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>financially and a lot of these sports,</v>

1185
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:26.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's such pressure.</v>

1186
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:31.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the word is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distrust of their competitors or </v>

1187
00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:33.390
<v Speaker 1>teammates that they all feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are using something.</v>

1188
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:38.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of distrust of sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>governing bodies that they really don't </v>

1189
00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.640
<v Speaker 1>feel that they care because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs aren't solid at.</v>

1190
00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:46.660
<v Speaker 1>So I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had so many of these athletes </v>

1191
00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:46.660
<v Speaker 1>really surprised that I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1192
00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I understand why I made that decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1193
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.950
<v Speaker 1>As opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1194
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.080
<v Speaker 1>well you do and you should never have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done that.</v>

1195
00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:54.750
<v Speaker 1>So you do the good cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1196
00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:56.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I genuinely feel that.</v>

1197
00:55:56.491 --> 00:55:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I like to think that I wouldn't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>that decision,</v>

1198
00:55:58.621 --> 00:56:00.570
<v Speaker 1>but health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in my early twenties,</v>

1199
00:56:00.571 --> 00:56:01.620
<v Speaker 1>mid twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1200
00:56:01.621 --> 00:56:04.710
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't sit here and tell you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're in the culture of,</v>

1201
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:09.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in these camps and everyone in </v>

1202
00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:09.990
<v Speaker 1>the camp is using you most likely would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a problem.</v>

1203
00:56:09.991 --> 00:56:12.810
<v Speaker 1>If you weren't where people wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust you or</v>

1204
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:18.000
<v Speaker 3>now they would be more likely to turn on</v>
<v Speaker 3>you or you'd have a problem with </v>

1205
00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.050
<v Speaker 3>training with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's A.</v>

1206
00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:22.720
<v Speaker 3>There's this culture of comradery that </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes with fight camps,</v>

1207
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 3>especially where these</v>

1208
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:29.100
<v Speaker 2>guys have to trust each other because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're beating the shit out of each </v>

1209
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:29.920
<v Speaker 2>other on a daily basis and they have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>trust that they're hitting each other at</v>

1210
00:56:29.921 --> 00:56:30.940
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent,</v>

1211
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:35.941
<v Speaker 2>not 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they are trying to work and </v>

1212
00:56:35.941 --> 00:56:38.911
<v Speaker 2>help each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you had resistance from any camps </v>

1213
00:56:38.911 --> 00:56:39.430
<v Speaker 2>in particular?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1214
00:56:39.431 --> 00:56:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Outwardly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1215
00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 2>It's all been positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of questioning on the ivy issue,</v>

1216
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:49.050
<v Speaker 2>so maybe quantify a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance there in terms of the </v>

1217
00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:49.630
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Overwhelmingly,</v>

1218
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:51.160
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for you guys.</v>

1219
00:56:51.161 --> 00:56:54.640
<v Speaker 2>This is great and I don't know if that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of that's lip service or not,</v>

1220
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:59.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'm guessing that even those </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes that have chosen in the past to</v>

1221
00:56:59.411 --> 00:57:01.810
<v Speaker 2>use that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are like,</v>

1222
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:04.660
<v Speaker 2>thank God I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This decisions now made for me.</v>

1223
00:57:04.661 --> 00:57:07.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to be making this decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1224
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm now.</v>

1225
00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:13.980
<v Speaker 2>There's something in place where I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>trust that my sport really does care </v>

1226
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:14.380
<v Speaker 2>about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can trust that,</v>

1227
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:16.450
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if my opponent is using,</v>

1228
00:57:16.451 --> 00:57:18.910
<v Speaker 2>he's risking at least his career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1229
00:57:18.911 --> 00:57:23.911
<v Speaker 2>go down the tubes so I can begin to </v>
<v Speaker 2>trust that who I'm fighting is clean or </v>

1230
00:57:23.911 --> 00:57:27.280
<v Speaker 2>just being really stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had this conversation in Brazil about</v>

1231
00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Vituro Belfort's levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1232
00:57:30.011 --> 00:57:33.700
<v Speaker 2>when he was tested during this camp for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Weidman.</v>

1233
00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:39.060
<v Speaker 2>Vito Belfort was a guy who was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone replacement because he </v>

1234
00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:39.760
<v Speaker 2>allegedly had low testosterone and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1235
00:57:39.761 --> 00:57:43.630
<v Speaker 2>he was making it out like he was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>martyr and he needed medicine because,</v>

1236
00:57:43.631 --> 00:57:45.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was sick and he had an issue and even</v>

1237
00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:49.390
<v Speaker 2>compared it to someone being a diabetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>and needing insulin,</v>

1238
00:57:49.391 --> 00:57:54.391
<v Speaker 2>you have to give them their insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was disingenuous and in </v>

1239
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.940
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ways is kind of a crazy thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say when everybody knows.</v>

1240
00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:03.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not a mystery that he used to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>240 pounds and he's 19 years old.</v>

1241
00:58:03.461 --> 00:58:06.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not a mystery that he was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone replacement and looked like</v>

1242
00:58:06.581 --> 00:58:11.581
<v Speaker 2>a fucking gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then during camp he tests three </v>

1243
00:58:11.711 --> 00:58:16.711
<v Speaker 2>times higher than Weidman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weidman's tests at 300 Vittorio test at </v>

1244
00:58:16.711 --> 00:58:19.150
<v Speaker 2>1200 and everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1245
00:58:19.151 --> 00:58:21.730
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1246
00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:23.350
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I saying?</v>

1247
00:58:23.351 --> 00:58:23.860
<v Speaker 2>The numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1248
00:58:23.861 --> 00:58:26.740
<v Speaker 2>It was a four times higher or it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>900,</v>

1249
00:58:26.741 --> 00:58:27.550
<v Speaker 2>1200,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1200,</v>

1250
00:58:27.551 --> 00:58:28.490
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was right.</v>

1251
00:58:28.491 --> 00:58:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's four times higher.</v>

1252
00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he tells,</v>

1253
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:36.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weidman tells him,</v>

1254
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:37.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to punish you.</v>

1255
00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I know you were using in camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to punish you.</v>

1256
00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:44.850
<v Speaker 2>But you were saying that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily the case and that when </v>

1257
00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:48.520
<v Speaker 2>someone tests at 1200 through a urine </v>
<v Speaker 2>test,</v>

1258
00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.840
<v Speaker 2>explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How has.</v>

1259
00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually relied on experts to kind</v>

1260
00:58:54.541 --> 00:58:59.290
<v Speaker 2>of guide me through this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but urine results like that,</v>

1261
00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:01.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are depend on,</v>

1262
00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called your excretion </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

1263
00:59:03.401 --> 00:59:08.401
<v Speaker 2>Different people excrete out in urine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different levels of testosterone depends</v>

1264
00:59:08.861 --> 00:59:13.861
<v Speaker 2>a lot on your metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One person could be a high excreta and </v>

1265
00:59:13.861 --> 00:59:17.770
<v Speaker 2>one person could be a low Iq screener.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily a representation of</v>

1266
00:59:17.771 --> 00:59:20.770
<v Speaker 2>your true testosterone levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've talked about earlier.</v>

1267
00:59:20.771 --> 00:59:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Blood tests would be</v>

1268
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:25.340
<v Speaker 1>way more accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why test him for urine at all?</v>

1269
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1270
00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:29.060
<v Speaker 1>I think the urine test is done because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit cheaper.</v>

1271
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:33.050
<v Speaker 1>They could initially look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone to epitestosterone ratio.</v>

1272
00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:38.740
<v Speaker 1>That is a pretty true marker and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the amount of testosterone that you </v>

1273
00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:42.581
<v Speaker 1>have to epitestosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The levels can barely vary depending on </v>

1274
00:59:42.581 --> 00:59:45.020
<v Speaker 1>how you're excluding out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that ratio,</v>

1275
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:50.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll stay will be very accurate of </v>

1276
00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:51.980
<v Speaker 1>what's in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normal human has a one to one ratio.</v>

1277
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:57.170
<v Speaker 1>There are some variances on the positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on the plus and negative side.</v>

1278
00:59:57.171 --> 01:00:00.860
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at what vittores ratio </v>
<v Speaker 1>was there,</v>

1279
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:03.950
<v Speaker 1>it was within normal range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>

1280
01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:06.410
<v Speaker 1>but you allow up to four to one in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevada.</v>

1281
01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Is that still the case with the way the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC has?</v>

1282
01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:14.231
<v Speaker 1>This new program is still four to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was six to one at one point </v>

1283
01:00:14.231 --> 01:00:15.050
<v Speaker 1>in time that was criticized and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped down to four to one.</v>

1284
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.910
<v Speaker 1>So that's gone out the window a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

1285
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ratio is looked at to determine </v>

1286
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:25.691
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you go to a more accurate</v>
<v Speaker 1>backup tests called we talked about </v>

1287
01:00:25.691 --> 01:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the carbon isotope ratio tests.</v>

1288
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:29.230
<v Speaker 1>So in all cases you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1289
01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:34.300
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a test proves high over whatever the </v>

1290
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:34.300
<v Speaker 1>number is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three to one,</v>

1291
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:38.360
<v Speaker 1>four to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six to one than the termination is </v>

1292
01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:38.360
<v Speaker 1>usually made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1293
01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.071
<v Speaker 1>let's go to the definitive test carbon </v>
<v Speaker 1>isotope to determine whether or not </v>

1294
01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:46.040
<v Speaker 1>that's foreign based testosterone and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is foreign based testosterone,</v>

1295
01:00:46.041 --> 01:00:48.680
<v Speaker 1>how much of a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like once you get the test results,</v>

1296
01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>like say if you test a guy and his urine</v>
<v Speaker 1>tests are kind of Funky,</v>

1297
01:00:51.801 --> 01:00:55.400
<v Speaker 1>he's reading really high and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide to go to a blood test.</v>

1298
01:00:55.730 --> 01:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>If he's doing something like Alex </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rodriguez was doing where it's like </v>

1299
01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:01.430
<v Speaker 1>quick release or how would you describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

1300
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick half live,</v>

1301
01:01:02.751 --> 01:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>what would you describe it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1302
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.300
<v Speaker 1>fast acting fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ach Clearing,</v>

1303
01:01:05.301 --> 01:01:07.520
<v Speaker 1>fast clearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you,</v>

1304
01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:11.090
<v Speaker 1>how would you mitigate that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ask the question again.</v>

1305
01:01:11.091 --> 01:01:16.091
<v Speaker 1>So you do the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do the one test and shows that </v>

1306
01:01:16.091 --> 01:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>he's got a very high level 1200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1307
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:18.830
<v Speaker 1>and then you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do a blood test,</v>

1308
01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:23.860
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily you could go right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that same urine sample and do a </v>

1309
01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:24.620
<v Speaker 1>different test or cir test on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it can be.</v>

1310
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>So you don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ordinarily the carbon isotope is not </v>

1311
01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:30.230
<v Speaker 1>done immediately in our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our program.</v>

1312
01:01:30.231 --> 01:01:32.420
<v Speaker 1>It will be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will be as opposed to,</v>

1313
01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:33.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1314
01:01:33.531 --> 01:01:37.160
<v Speaker 1>let's do the testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>epitestosterone ratio tests first.</v>

1315
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:39.830
<v Speaker 1>In some cases we'll go right to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Usada,</v>

1316
01:01:39.831 --> 01:01:43.640
<v Speaker 1>we'll go right to the CIO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our test and bypass the t ratio.</v>

1317
01:01:43.641 --> 01:01:46.550
<v Speaker 1>And that is because of the micro dosing </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

1318
01:01:46.550 --> 01:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>So say like an Alex Rodriguez took a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast acting testosterone,</v>

1319
01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.160
<v Speaker 1>didn't really manipulate his tat level </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much if you were just doing that </v>

1320
01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.021
<v Speaker 1>test would show a two or three to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe and in the past and say,</v>

1321
01:01:59.180 --> 01:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he's good.</v>

1322
01:01:59.961 --> 01:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>He's under four to one or six to one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1323
01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:05.990
<v Speaker 1>where if a car test was done on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have known right away that he</v>

1324
01:02:05.991 --> 01:02:07.820
<v Speaker 1>was using.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So under our program,</v>

1325
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:13.390
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes the cir tests will be done </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away regardless of what the t </v>

1326
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:14.060
<v Speaker 1>ratio is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1327
01:02:14.061 --> 01:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>So if you are doing with Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rodrigo was.</v>

1328
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Rodriguez was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if he tests okay.</v>

1329
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Within his boundaries and normal levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do a cir test and catch him even</v>

1330
01:02:26.851 --> 01:02:28.570
<v Speaker 1>though it's out of a system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1331
01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1332
01:02:28.951 --> 01:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>If it's out of his system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's out of his system.</v>

1333
01:02:31.021 --> 01:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>But if it's a four hour thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1334
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that actually the level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1335
01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>it really is gone for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1336
01:02:38.611 --> 01:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>that's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be a little bit hesitant if I was an</v>

1337
01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:43.360
<v Speaker 1>athlete to depend on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1338
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I had a drug test in five hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1339
01:02:45.241 --> 01:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>something's going to clear in four </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

1340
01:02:47.101 --> 01:02:52.101
<v Speaker 1>They can detect pretty minute amounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my understanding is it does clear </v>

1341
01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>pretty quickly and you're going to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys in the middle of the night,</v>

1342
01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:55.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the side,</v>

1343
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>it has the ability to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're gonna,</v>

1344
01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make that routine.</v>

1345
01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:00.180
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1346
01:03:00.181 --> 01:03:05.181
<v Speaker 1>this is all detective work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're looking at biological </v>

1347
01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:09.111
<v Speaker 1>passports over time and see variances </v>
<v Speaker 1>between mornings and evenings,</v>

1348
01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:12.930
<v Speaker 1>they could get a tip or other </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that's,</v>

1349
01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non science related.</v>

1350
01:03:14.551 --> 01:03:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Just a tip from somebody that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1351
01:03:15.961 --> 01:03:18.510
<v Speaker 1>this is what's going on in this camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd had the ability to do that.</v>

1352
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a tip.</v>

1353
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Has that happened before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys have tips from people like </v>

1354
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.500
<v Speaker 1>the fighters are using?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a uh,</v>

1355
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:32.570
<v Speaker 1>so actually you saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a hotline or a tip line that's </v>

1356
01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:32.570
<v Speaker 1>given dollar athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1357
01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:37.431
<v Speaker 1>here's something about something going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on from somebody or a camp they can </v>

1358
01:03:37.431 --> 01:03:38.490
<v Speaker 1>anonymously call and lead that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you look back at,</v>

1359
01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:43.520
<v Speaker 1>you look back at all of the major </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drug cases that </v>

1360
01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.680
<v Speaker 1>have come out over the past 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at Belko,</v>

1361
01:03:46.681 --> 01:03:48.840
<v Speaker 1>you look at Biogenesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1362
01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.090
<v Speaker 1>you look at Kirk Radomski,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who in New York,</v>

1363
01:03:51.091 --> 01:03:56.091
<v Speaker 1>mets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bat boy that was distributing to </v>

1364
01:03:56.091 --> 01:03:56.091
<v Speaker 1>athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bat boy.</v>

1365
01:03:56.091 --> 01:03:57.120
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a clubhouse attendant.</v>

1366
01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:00.270
<v Speaker 1>The back boy was getting them dressed or</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

1367
01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How they catch him.</v>

1368
01:04:01.681 --> 01:04:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Was He in jail now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1369
01:04:03.031 --> 01:04:03.690
<v Speaker 1>he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1370
01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:07.650
<v Speaker 1>he's a convicted felon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's done with probation.</v>

1371
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of those cases,</v>

1372
01:04:10.411 --> 01:04:13.950
<v Speaker 1>all the major cases that have happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last decade,</v>

1373
01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:18.951
<v Speaker 1>decade and a half all were a result of </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigations not necessarily </v>

1374
01:04:18.951 --> 01:04:23.780
<v Speaker 1>anti-doping side of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you sorta who we're using is aware </v>

1375
01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:28.131
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually have someone on their </v>

1376
01:04:28.131 --> 01:04:30.321
<v Speaker 1>staff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former law enforcement who's </v>

1377
01:04:30.321 --> 01:04:32.730
<v Speaker 1>investigator that will liaison and reach</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to various law enforcement agencies </v>

1378
01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:36.960
<v Speaker 1>both here in the United States and </v>
<v Speaker 1>internationally so that say another case</v>

1379
01:04:36.961 --> 01:04:41.490
<v Speaker 1>comes out and local law enforcement </v>
<v Speaker 1>agency goes in and does a search warrant</v>

1380
01:04:41.491 --> 01:04:43.040
<v Speaker 1>and they find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1381
01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:47.550
<v Speaker 1>list of UFC athletes of what drugs they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were getting or being distributed.</v>

1382
01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:51.420
<v Speaker 1>You saw it would have the ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully to go to law enforcement said,</v>

1383
01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:56.421
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're done kind of with the </v>

1384
01:04:56.421 --> 01:04:56.421
<v Speaker 1>criminal side of things here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you give us,</v>

1385
01:04:56.421 --> 01:04:57.200
<v Speaker 1>find a way to give us some of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence,</v>

1386
01:04:57.230 --> 01:05:00.270
<v Speaker 1>use it here and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and use it that way.</v>

1387
01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:01.260
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1388
01:05:01.261 --> 01:05:06.261
<v Speaker 1>we're just trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our program has every resource available</v>

1389
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:11.630
<v Speaker 1>that we know of science wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigative lies to create that </v>

1390
01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:11.940
<v Speaker 1>deterrent effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So athlete,</v>

1391
01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:13.680
<v Speaker 1>you may have found the newest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>latest,</v>

1392
01:05:13.681 --> 01:05:16.140
<v Speaker 1>greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest strug that they will never be a</v>

1393
01:05:16.141 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>test for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're running</v>

1394
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.560
<v Speaker 2>the risk of whoever's getting that for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you at some point,</v>

1395
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:25.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>running along to some investigation and </v>

1396
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.910
<v Speaker 2>that information out and catching you on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back door.</v>

1397
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:30.611
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely happened a lot in the </v>

1398
01:05:30.611 --> 01:05:30.611
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is that what happened with Bronco?</v>

1399
01:05:30.611 --> 01:05:33.130
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Balco was a criminal investigation,</v>

1400
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:34.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

1401
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:39.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what we did there was interfaced </v>

1402
01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:42.361
<v Speaker 2>with anti-doping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we discovered drugs in balco that </v>

1403
01:05:42.361 --> 01:05:44.190
<v Speaker 2>were designer drugs that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't tests for,</v>

1404
01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.920
<v Speaker 2>and through the back door went to anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>doping and said,</v>

1405
01:05:47.921 --> 01:05:49.000
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what we've got.</v>

1406
01:05:49.001 --> 01:05:51.340
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to figure out who palcos </v>
<v Speaker 2>clients are,</v>

1407
01:05:51.341 --> 01:05:52.990
<v Speaker 2>what they're using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

1408
01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:57.991
<v Speaker 2>when we bring them in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're telling us the truth about what </v>

1409
01:05:57.991 --> 01:06:00.361
<v Speaker 2>they've used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the anti-doping side of thing was </v>

1410
01:06:00.361 --> 01:06:03.430
<v Speaker 2>able to develop tests for these drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out and test some of these athletes,</v>

1411
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:08.520
<v Speaker 2>both current samples provided and </v>
<v Speaker 2>samples that were frozen and leftover </v>

1412
01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:12.990
<v Speaker 2>from previous provisions and kept some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those athletes for the drugs they </v>

1413
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:13.240
<v Speaker 2>were using.</v>

1414
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:18.870
<v Speaker 2>They then pass that information back </v>
<v Speaker 2>along to us so that when we go out and </v>

1415
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.870
<v Speaker 2>question athlete and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1416
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:21.940
<v Speaker 2>I didn't use anything we will to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're full of shit now.</v>

1417
01:06:21.941 --> 01:06:24.100
<v Speaker 2>When you say it was a criminal </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation first,</v>

1418
01:06:24.101 --> 01:06:27.430
<v Speaker 2>what was the crime?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So actually that was back in my days,</v>

1419
01:06:27.431 --> 01:06:32.431
<v Speaker 2>I was a irs special agents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it involved a financial crime and </v>

1420
01:06:32.431 --> 01:06:36.750
<v Speaker 2>money laundering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the taking of profits from Doug drug </v>

1421
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:38.410
<v Speaker 2>distribution and putting them back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the financial system.</v>

1422
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they have to have some way to </v>

1423
01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:44.080
<v Speaker 2>account for the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1424
01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're making all these might </v>

1425
01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:49.260
<v Speaker 2>look good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much does a guy like barry bonds pay</v>

1426
01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.170
<v Speaker 2>for for steroids to a guy like Victor </v>
<v Speaker 2>Conte,</v>

1427
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:53.290
<v Speaker 2>like how much does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was interesting because he didn't pay</v>

1428
01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:56.320
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He paid in the form of giving.</v>

1429
01:06:56.321 --> 01:06:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Advertise and it was really an ingenious</v>
<v Speaker 2>plan instead of,</v>

1430
01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:01.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in exchange for what I'm giving you,</v>

1431
01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:06.660
<v Speaker 2>you give me back money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do advertising for my supplement </v>

1432
01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.740
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go in magazines and ads and say,</v>

1433
01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:13.741
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you work with me and my supplements and </v>

1434
01:07:13.741 --> 01:07:13.930
<v Speaker 2>they're the reason for your success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cma and stuff like that.</v>

1435
01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what the value of that was of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1436
01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Advertise for a guy bonds millions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really an engine.</v>

1437
01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:23.050
<v Speaker 2>It was an ingenious plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Money Laundering plan.</v>

1438
01:07:23.110 --> 01:07:25.870
<v Speaker 2>I've had content here and Dana White </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking hates that guy,</v>

1439
01:07:25.871 --> 01:07:27.700
<v Speaker 2>but I found them to be a pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

1440
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.100
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a problem with him and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was very forthright.</v>

1441
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:35.130
<v Speaker 2>He was very honest about what he did and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he got away with it and what he </v>

1442
01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:37.540
<v Speaker 2>thinks is going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are suspicious of him of</v>

1443
01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:42.541
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I mean he's now like working as </v>

1444
01:07:42.541 --> 01:07:45.841
<v Speaker 2>an anti performance enhancing drugs </v>
<v Speaker 2>advocate when he became famous for being</v>

1445
01:07:45.971 --> 01:07:49.510
<v Speaker 2>a guy who provided performance enhancing</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs to athletes.</v>

1446
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.840
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird sort of turnaround late in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and people or they're suspicious </v>

1447
01:07:56.090 --> 01:08:00.640
<v Speaker 2>and rightly so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what he has,</v>

1448
01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:06.050
<v Speaker 2>what he has done is at least illuminates</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was able to pull off.</v>

1449
01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking about him often and I always </v>

1450
01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:12.090
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1451
01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:12.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I welcome anybody over to,</v>

1452
01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:14.570
<v Speaker 2>to the good side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You believe him.</v>

1453
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:20.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm a firm believer in second chances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to have to take </v>

1454
01:08:20.050 --> 01:08:21.230
<v Speaker 2>everything he says with a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>grain of salt.</v>

1455
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read something the other day that he </v>

1456
01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.901
<v Speaker 2>still keeps a hand in kind of the dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and that's where we learned about </v>

1457
01:08:28.901 --> 01:08:29.000
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're truly,</v>

1458
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:34.630
<v Speaker 2>if you're truly an anti-doping advocate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know about things going on in </v>

1459
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:37.100
<v Speaker 2>the dark world and you're not exposing </v>
<v Speaker 2>who those people are,</v>

1460
01:08:37.101 --> 01:08:40.040
<v Speaker 2>then you're really not truly an </v>
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping advocate,</v>

1461
01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:42.680
<v Speaker 2>but a [inaudible] guy's a character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1462
01:08:42.681 --> 01:08:47.681
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of those guys and in my former </v>

1463
01:08:47.681 --> 01:08:50.891
<v Speaker 2>career you run into a lot of characters </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and I enjoy everything about </v>

1464
01:08:50.891 --> 01:08:50.891
<v Speaker 2>those people.</v>

1465
01:08:50.891 --> 01:08:54.590
<v Speaker 2>It's just living life and running into </v>
<v Speaker 2>characters like that.</v>

1466
01:08:54.591 --> 01:08:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Whether in a good or bad way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fun.</v>

1467
01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:01.370
<v Speaker 2>You enjoy it because it's part of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the flavor of the Gig.</v>

1468
01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also because you're a pretty </v>

1470
01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.670

<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1471
01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:09.980

<v Speaker 2>side lives.</v>

1472
01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust anybody with a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>mustache like that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>them little skinny mustaches,</v>

<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>

1475
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a couple of black eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe some people of Puerto Rican </v>

1476
01:09:23.530 --> 01:09:23.530
<v Speaker 2>descent and have a little skinny </v>

01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:45.650
<v Speaker 2>he's been critical of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm waiting for.</v>

1487
01:09:46.690 --> 01:09:48.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm waiting for a thank you from him for</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1488
01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Vocal to the good side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his criticism in A.</v>

1489
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:54.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't listen to it,</v>

1490
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:57.500
<v Speaker 2>don't listen to it really good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1491
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Aldo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josie,</v>

1492
01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:03.761
<v Speaker 2>although has said that he won't do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ivy or that he won't listen to the band </v>

1493
01:10:03.761 --> 01:10:07.901
<v Speaker 2>on Ivs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to take it and he said </v>

1494
01:10:07.901 --> 01:10:07.901
<v Speaker 2>they'll still let me fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1495
01:10:07.901 --> 01:10:08.570
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

1496
01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.550
<v Speaker 2>when we were in Brazil a couple of weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

1497
01:10:10.551 --> 01:10:15.551
<v Speaker 2>had a conversation with them about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you said it was just one of those </v>

1498
01:10:15.551 --> 01:10:17.950
<v Speaker 2>days where he was in a certain mood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1499
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:23.110
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little bit joking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little bit pissed off about </v>

1500
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 2>something else and said those things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said he shouldn't have.</v>

1501
01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't believe those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you apologize for doing that.</v>

1502
01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:31.360
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I felt pretty good at conor mcgregor </v>

1503
01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.110
<v Speaker 2>felt that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crawl inside that Dude's head and camped</v>

1504
01:10:33.111 --> 01:10:35.480
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planted flags shit all over the place.</v>

1505
01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:40.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy was dealing with some serious </v>

1506
01:10:40.481 --> 01:10:42.191
<v Speaker 2>psychological warfare at a level that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think he had ever experienced </v>

1507
01:10:42.191 --> 01:10:42.191
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1508
01:10:42.191 --> 01:10:43.400
<v Speaker 2>Connor is really good at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't he?</v>

1509
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:46.040
<v Speaker 2>He's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the best.</v>

1510
01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:51.041
<v Speaker 2>It's like he took Mohamad Ali and chill </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunnen and he rolled it up in this crazy</v>

1511
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:54.420
<v Speaker 2>Celtic warrior character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just and just.</v>

1512
01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.320
<v Speaker 2>And He's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

1513
01:10:57.530 --> 01:11:00.020
<v Speaker 2>He's not just trash-talker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking dangerous.</v>

1514
01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a once in a lifetime personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he pulls it off consistently.</v>

1515
01:11:04.881 --> 01:11:06.740
<v Speaker 2>He's always on his game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1516
01:11:06.741 --> 01:11:08.690
<v Speaker 2>the fact that it was willing to Bet Dana</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Lorenzo,</v>

1517
01:11:08.691 --> 01:11:13.691
<v Speaker 2>$3,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would knock Mendez out in the second </v>

1518
01:11:13.691 --> 01:11:13.691
<v Speaker 2>round and he knocked Mendez out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second round.</v>

1519
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:15.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking freak.</v>

1520
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.040
<v Speaker 2>He really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a freak.</v>

1521
01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:19.230
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it comes naturally or you sits.</v>

1522
01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:21.420
<v Speaker 2>It sits around at night plotting these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things out.</v>

1523
01:11:22.150 --> 01:11:23.280
<v Speaker 2>So damn good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1524
01:11:23.281 --> 01:11:28.281
<v Speaker 2>he was always a very good fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a big fan of his when he was </v>

1525
01:11:28.281 --> 01:11:30.981
<v Speaker 2>competing in Europe and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fighting in the UK and quite an </v>

1526
01:11:30.981 --> 01:11:34.930
<v Speaker 2>actually I tweeted him way back in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day before he ever came to the UFC </v>

1527
01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:37.230
<v Speaker 2>saying that I enjoy his fights and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hope he gets over here.</v>

1528
01:11:37.231 --> 01:11:39.600
<v Speaker 2>And then boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he get over here.</v>

1529
01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that UFC wayans when he fought </v>

1530
01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:48.771
<v Speaker 2>Mendez was the craziest thing I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen in my life of all the fights that </v>

1531
01:11:48.841 --> 01:11:51.300
<v Speaker 2>have ever called all the weigh ins that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever been at.</v>

1532
01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I have never seen anything like that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

1533
01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.670
<v Speaker 2>And it was like we were in Dublin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's amazing.</v>

1534
01:11:56.671 --> 01:11:58.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm four months into this,</v>

1535
01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:00.410
<v Speaker 2>so I'm a Newbie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I expect that now.</v>

1536
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

1537
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.970
<v Speaker 2>that was a total outlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen any expected.</v>

1538
01:12:05.971 --> 01:12:10.971
<v Speaker 2>If he fights again though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a bigger way in December when he </v>

1539
01:12:10.971 --> 01:12:11.070
<v Speaker 2>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although Jesus Christ,</v>

1540
01:12:11.071 --> 01:12:16.071
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be crazy if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although makes it to it without getting </v>

1541
01:12:16.071 --> 01:12:16.071
<v Speaker 2>injured and he makes it to it without </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting injured.</v>

1542
01:12:16.071 --> 01:12:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Which is a big problem with this sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1543
01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:21.660
<v Speaker 2>if you look at boxing matches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing matches that get arranged and how</v>

1544
01:12:21.661 --> 01:12:24.210
<v Speaker 2>many of them actually come to fruition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's most of them,</v>

1545
01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.890
<v Speaker 2>most fights gets scheduled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd come and they,</v>

1546
01:12:26.891 --> 01:12:30.300
<v Speaker 2>they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come to pass with the UFC.</v>

1547
01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:32.790
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's maybe 70 percent,</v>

1548
01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 70 May.</v>

1549
01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:35.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong,</v>

1550
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.520
<v Speaker 2>but if I had to guess like big fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>75 at the most,</v>

1551
01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.230
<v Speaker 2>25 percent of them fall out.</v>

1552
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:42.150
<v Speaker 2>It seems like just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting,</v>

1553
01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.840
<v Speaker 2>it's another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's lagging behind a little bit,</v>

1554
01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:49.850
<v Speaker 2>the anti-doping side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's taken up so much of my </v>

1555
01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:49.850
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's another responsibility under my</v>

1556
01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:52.860
<v Speaker 2>title is to try to provide our athletes </v>
<v Speaker 2>reach out,</v>

1557
01:12:52.861 --> 01:12:56.040
<v Speaker 2>provide them with other resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In terms of training,</v>

1558
01:12:56.041 --> 01:13:01.041
<v Speaker 2>rehabilitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've reached out to a couple of </v>

1559
01:13:01.041 --> 01:13:01.710
<v Speaker 2>companies here domestically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exos,</v>

1560
01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:06.740
<v Speaker 2>which there's a lot of training for NFL </v>
<v Speaker 2>exos or out of what does that x o,</v>

1561
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:11.820
<v Speaker 2>s and what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their training facility?</v>

1562
01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:12.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they,</v>

1563
01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:15.780
<v Speaker 2>they are most widely known from taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot.</v>

1564
01:13:15.781 --> 01:13:18.540
<v Speaker 2>If you look at most of the first round </v>
<v Speaker 2>draft picks in the NFL,</v>

1565
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:21.360
<v Speaker 2>they've gone and trained at exos from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1566
01:13:21.361 --> 01:13:26.361
<v Speaker 2>their end of their last season in </v>
<v Speaker 2>college through the combine and they've </v>

1567
01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:29.940
<v Speaker 2>just instituted good nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good training methods.</v>

1568
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:32.850
<v Speaker 2>We've contracted with them a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>months ago,</v>

1569
01:13:32.851 --> 01:13:34.560
<v Speaker 2>sent a couple athletes down there.</v>

1570
01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Rashad Evans went down a forest,</v>

1571
01:13:37.921 --> 01:13:40.230
<v Speaker 2>went down kind of from an internal </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

1572
01:13:40.231 --> 01:13:45.231
<v Speaker 2>look at things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Luke rockhold went down their </v>

1573
01:13:45.231 --> 01:13:45.231
<v Speaker 2>cm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>punk is retired.</v>

1574
01:13:45.231 --> 01:13:50.181
<v Speaker 2>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he went down there to look at </v>

1575
01:13:50.181 --> 01:13:52.880
<v Speaker 2>experience week of training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is to get our athletes to </v>

1576
01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.000
<v Speaker 2>train smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to listen to their bodies,</v>

1577
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:56.140
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1578
01:13:56.141 --> 01:13:59.190
<v Speaker 2>give them techniques and proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition,</v>

1579
01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:04.250
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that as our guys are training </v>

1580
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:04.830
<v Speaker 2>smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to their bodies better,</v>

1581
01:14:04.890 --> 01:14:07.800
<v Speaker 2>there will be less instances of getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>injured.</v>

1582
01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:12.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming up to big fights in the UFC is </v>

1583
01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:12.920
<v Speaker 2>developing some sort of a performance</v>

1584
01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:13.420
<v Speaker 3>center,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct?</v>

1585
01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are that,</v>

1586
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I think they're breaking ground pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon on that,</v>

1587
01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:23.510
<v Speaker 1>but the idea would be through consulting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these other companies that had been</v>

1588
01:14:23.881 --> 01:14:28.881
<v Speaker 1>in the business of training high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes to putting all these resources </v>

1589
01:14:29.221 --> 01:14:34.221
<v Speaker 1>and tools and machines and space </v>
<v Speaker 1>available to this state of the art world</v>

1590
01:14:34.381 --> 01:14:38.730
<v Speaker 1>class facility that our athletes would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the ability to come to and train to</v>

1591
01:14:38.731 --> 01:14:43.290
<v Speaker 1>come to an rehabilitate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only UFC athletes,</v>

1592
01:14:43.291 --> 01:14:47.040
<v Speaker 1>but I think the idea is to make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>place so state of the arts that we would</v>

1593
01:14:47.041 --> 01:14:49.410
<v Speaker 1>welcome in athletes from other sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1594
01:14:49.411 --> 01:14:54.411
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the world class place to go to </v>

1595
01:14:54.411 --> 01:14:58.131
<v Speaker 1>your training and learn how to do your </v>
<v Speaker 1>training and a similar that as we're </v>

1596
01:14:58.131 --> 01:15:00.600
<v Speaker 1>doing with our anti-doping program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping to lead the pack.</v>

1597
01:15:00.601 --> 01:15:04.710
<v Speaker 1>The idea is to lead the pack in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we teach our athletes that train.</v>

1598
01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:10.610
<v Speaker 3>Is there a consensus though on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct way to train as far as strength </v>

1599
01:15:11.331 --> 01:15:16.331
<v Speaker 3>and conditioning goes as far as like how</v>
<v Speaker 3>much time to spend doing skill work </v>

1600
01:15:16.331 --> 01:15:18.810
<v Speaker 3>versus how much time to spend during </v>
<v Speaker 3>endurance work.</v>

1601
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:24.350
<v Speaker 3>There seems like there's a lot of debate</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a lot of athletes very </v>

1602
01:15:24.751 --> 01:15:27.510
<v Speaker 3>as far as their needs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their style of fighting.</v>

1603
01:15:27.511 --> 01:15:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Like how would you manage something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

1604
01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one for me that I'm a be </v>

1605
01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:34.500
<v Speaker 1>the first to admit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just learning and coming up to speed.</v>

1606
01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:39.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably know better and your </v>

1607
01:15:39.361 --> 01:15:39.670
<v Speaker 1>involvement in mma and what it feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to train in which you would need to</v>

1608
01:15:39.671 --> 01:15:44.671
<v Speaker 1>do in your training to be able to ready </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get into a real fight a month or a </v>

1609
01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:48.040
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll turn that back around on you.</v>

1610
01:15:48.041 --> 01:15:53.041
<v Speaker 1>What do you think in terms of how close </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a fight these guys need to be going </v>

1611
01:15:53.041 --> 01:15:54.100
<v Speaker 1>full speed so that when they get in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>octagon,</v>

1612
01:15:54.101 --> 01:15:56.290
<v Speaker 1>it's not a shock to the system like holy</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit</v>

1613
01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:57.460
<v Speaker 3>going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1614
01:15:57.461 --> 01:16:02.461
<v Speaker 3>it depends on who you ask because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that I respect </v>

1615
01:16:02.461 --> 01:16:05.330
<v Speaker 3>that very wide wildly on how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach things like you'll.</v>

1616
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:10.390
<v Speaker 3>You'll talk to one guy who's a strength </v>
<v Speaker 3>and conditioning coach and he has this </v>

1617
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:13.831
<v Speaker 3>very specific idea of how you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>train and then another guy who was also </v>

1618
01:16:13.831 --> 01:16:15.220
<v Speaker 3>very well respected but completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>different methodology.</v>

1619
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:20.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of what Marv Marinovich </v>
<v Speaker 3>was able to do with Bj Penn and the </v>

1620
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:23.230
<v Speaker 3>amount of work that he did with Bj's </v>
<v Speaker 3>endurance.</v>

1621
01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:28.410
<v Speaker 3>I think that Bj during that time was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just one of the greatest of all time </v>

1622
01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:32.640
<v Speaker 3>during the time we fought to Diego </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sanchez and Sean Sherk and when Bj was </v>

1623
01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:37.081
<v Speaker 3>in his prime and I know during the Diego</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sanchez fight in particular was an </v>

1624
01:16:37.081 --> 01:16:41.400
<v Speaker 3>absolutely brutal camp for him and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>went and worked with him for only a </v>

1625
01:16:43.331 --> 01:16:46.330
<v Speaker 3>couple of fights because it was so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so goddamn brutal,</v>

1626
01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:51.190
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people think and nick curse</v>
<v Speaker 3>on who was a protege of Marinovich.</v>

1627
01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:53.620
<v Speaker 3>I've had him on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We discussed it pretty,</v>

1628
01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:57.640
<v Speaker 3>pretty deep and he thinks and I liked </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he thinks.</v>

1629
01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:03.060
<v Speaker 3>He believes that strength and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning during camp is everything </v>

1630
01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:04.810
<v Speaker 3>and that's really what you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>primarily focus on.</v>

1631
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:09.990
<v Speaker 3>That these guys already know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight and that really they should be </v>

1632
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:11.150
<v Speaker 3>putting almost all of their effort into </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning.</v>

1633
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:16.330
<v Speaker 3>Getting their body to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>their body can perform at an extremely </v>

1634
01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:18.890
<v Speaker 3>high level for five rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes each and that all the other</v>

1635
01:17:18.891 --> 01:17:23.891
<v Speaker 3>skill work and everything like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>should actually take a back seat to </v>

1636
01:17:23.891 --> 01:17:26.651
<v Speaker 3>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because what you're dealing with when </v>

1637
01:17:26.651 --> 01:17:28.691
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with a championship level</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight like that is an athlete that's so </v>

1638
01:17:28.691 --> 01:17:32.441
<v Speaker 3>finely tuned in skill wise already that </v>
<v Speaker 3>really what you need to do is give them </v>

1639
01:17:32.441 --> 01:17:35.770
<v Speaker 3>the horsepower and give him the gas tank</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that also would,</v>

1640
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:41.110
<v Speaker 3>that also would do is it would prevent </v>
<v Speaker 3>the really hard training that is </v>

1641
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:46.001
<v Speaker 3>breaking guys down like the really hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling training that's breaking guys </v>

1642
01:17:46.001 --> 01:17:46.001
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1643
01:17:46.001 --> 01:17:49.420
<v Speaker 3>Instead of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would just drill and instead of </v>

1644
01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:49.490
<v Speaker 3>doing these hard sparring drills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would just drill.</v>

1645
01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:54.700
<v Speaker 3>Matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tim Kennedy was just on the fighter and </v>

1646
01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:57.371
<v Speaker 3>the kid podcast with Brian Kaylin and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brendan Schaub and Brendan texted me </v>

1647
01:17:57.371 --> 01:17:59.120
<v Speaker 3>last night and said that Kennedy said he</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't spar,</v>

1648
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:04.600
<v Speaker 3>said he just doesn't spark city moves </v>
<v Speaker 3>around with guys and he just does </v>

1649
01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:04.600
<v Speaker 3>strength and conditioning work and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything like that.</v>

1650
01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.050
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the sparring,</v>

1651
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.480
<v Speaker 3>like if you take enough punishment </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting,</v>

1652
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:13.750
<v Speaker 3>so he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's of the mindset that you shouldn't </v>

1653
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:17.441
<v Speaker 3>be beating yourself up in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's a lot of variation </v>

1654
01:18:17.441 --> 01:18:17.441
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1655
01:18:17.441 --> 01:18:17.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1656
01:18:17.441 --> 01:18:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that's something that exos </v>
<v Speaker 1>promotes,</v>

1657
01:18:19.851 --> 01:18:21.770
<v Speaker 1>is that it depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1658
01:18:21.771 --> 01:18:23.460
<v Speaker 1>an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual to individual,</v>

1659
01:18:23.461 --> 01:18:25.100
<v Speaker 1>some are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are different than others.</v>

1660
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:30.850
<v Speaker 1>One thing that they did tell us was they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were just amazed and getting back to </v>

1661
01:18:30.850 --> 01:18:34.901
<v Speaker 1>kind of the weight cutting thing that an</v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete who's going to compete 24 hours </v>

1662
01:18:34.901 --> 01:18:39.311
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's putting their body through such </v>

1663
01:18:39.311 --> 01:18:41.470
<v Speaker 1>extreme conditions just 24 hours before </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that that's going to have </v>

1664
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:45.971
<v Speaker 1>on your performance when you do an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme cut and then put that weight </v>

1665
01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:45.971
<v Speaker 1>back on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1666
01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:46.220
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1667
01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:51.221
<v Speaker 1>during the off season when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a fight scheduled and you're maybe </v>

1668
01:18:51.221 --> 01:18:52.730
<v Speaker 1>even 20 pounds heavier than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1669
01:18:52.731 --> 01:18:57.731
<v Speaker 1>the muscle memory of getting used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>working out at that 20 pounds heavier </v>

1670
01:18:57.731 --> 01:19:00.710
<v Speaker 1>than you're actually going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting a doesn't seem to make a lot of</v>

1671
01:19:00.711 --> 01:19:05.711
<v Speaker 1>common sense because you're fighting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a completely different feel and person </v>

1672
01:19:05.711 --> 01:19:06.890
<v Speaker 1>and muscle mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1673
01:19:06.891 --> 01:19:07.340
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1674
01:19:07.341 --> 01:19:08.030
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1675
01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:10.280
<v Speaker 1>training wise doesn't seem to make a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sense.</v>

1676
01:19:10.281 --> 01:19:11.570
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1677
01:19:11.571 --> 01:19:16.571
<v Speaker 1>I'm new to all this and trying to be as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sponge and absorb everything and uh,</v>

1678
01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:18.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen the horror stories.</v>

1679
01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:21.880
<v Speaker 3>I've seen guys cut too much weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fight like shit.</v>

1680
01:19:21.881 --> 01:19:25.420
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen guys that really blew </v>
<v Speaker 3>their opportunity of being champion.</v>

1681
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.870
<v Speaker 3>The best example that I've ever used as </v>
<v Speaker 3>Travis Luder,</v>

1682
01:19:29.230 --> 01:19:34.230
<v Speaker 3>Travis Luder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the best American black </v>

1683
01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:34.230
<v Speaker 3>belts in Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially at the time.</v>

1684
01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:36.940
<v Speaker 3>He was just extremely high level black </v>
<v Speaker 3>belt,</v>

1685
01:19:36.941 --> 01:19:38.350
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very technical,</v>

1686
01:19:38.351 --> 01:19:42.850
<v Speaker 3>very strong and fought Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't make weight,</v>

1687
01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:43.960
<v Speaker 3>didn't make weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1688
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:46.810
<v Speaker 3>and when I tell you that he was on </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking death's door,</v>

1689
01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.210
<v Speaker 3>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in all my years of watching fights,</v>

1690
01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching weigh ins,</v>

1691
01:19:50.970 --> 01:19:55.970
<v Speaker 3>seeing guys look dehydrated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen anybody look as bad as </v>

1692
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:55.970
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His lips were cracked,</v>

1693
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:58.240
<v Speaker 3>like you could see like he'll like </v>
<v Speaker 3>cracks in his lips.</v>

1694
01:19:58.241 --> 01:20:01.210
<v Speaker 3>His lips had shrunken down and like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1695
01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:06.330
<v Speaker 3>like he was chapped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his face was completely sunk and scary </v>

1696
01:20:06.330 --> 01:20:06.700
<v Speaker 3>and he was shuffling.</v>

1697
01:20:06.730 --> 01:20:11.730
<v Speaker 3>He Walk to the scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was shuffling and he didn't make the </v>

1698
01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:15.021
<v Speaker 3>weight and he tried for like an hour and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a half afterwards to try to make the </v>

1699
01:20:15.021 --> 01:20:15.990
<v Speaker 3>weight still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The next day took Anderson Silva down,</v>

1700
01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:18.870
<v Speaker 3>mounted him was on top of them and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you what,</v>

1701
01:20:18.871 --> 01:20:22.650
<v Speaker 3>if travis was 100 percent right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would've submitted Anderson.</v>

1702
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:27.790
<v Speaker 3>Like Travis was submitting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody who's was just kinda blood </v>

1703
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:28.670
<v Speaker 3>will like Charles Mccarthy who was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend of mine,</v>

1704
01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:32.010
<v Speaker 3>have train with them in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said it was like rolling with Ricardo</v>

1705
01:20:32.010 --> 01:20:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Laborio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said his level was like super high </v>

1706
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:38.871
<v Speaker 3>level and blues chance and really never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never sort of reached the full potential</v>

1707
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.750
<v Speaker 3>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was,</v>

1708
01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:47.840
<v Speaker 3>that was like the worst I've ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>is like a guy who just blew his </v>

1709
01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:47.840
<v Speaker 3>potential.</v>

1710
01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you an interesting stat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the American Journal of </v>

1711
01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Sports Medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they had a,</v>

1712
01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.550
<v Speaker 1>a dehydration rehydration study and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had certain percentages of dehydration </v>

1713
01:20:56.550 --> 01:21:01.271
<v Speaker 1>and what that meant to a body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was seven percent or </v>

1714
01:21:01.271 --> 01:21:04.010
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cognitive skills decline immensely.</v>

1715
01:21:04.011 --> 01:21:08.630
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was 15 percent dehydrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the study.</v>

1716
01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:12.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a death imminent death organs shut </v>
<v Speaker 1>down 15 percent.</v>

1717
01:21:12.231 --> 01:21:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Start doing the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1718
01:21:13.431 --> 01:21:16.490
<v Speaker 1>of what some of these cuts that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard about and seen.</v>

1719
01:21:16.491 --> 01:21:21.491
<v Speaker 1>I heard one the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone on the radio talking about an </v>

1720
01:21:21.491 --> 01:21:24.881
<v Speaker 1>athlete that they had that was one 74 </v>
<v Speaker 1>days before a way in and went down I </v>

1721
01:21:26.721 --> 01:21:30.200
<v Speaker 1>think to 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do the math on knots.</v>

1722
01:21:30.201 --> 01:21:35.201
<v Speaker 1>Assuming all that weight cut was water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's actually the </v>

1723
01:21:35.201 --> 01:21:38.861
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably in where you're talking </v>

1724
01:21:38.861 --> 01:21:38.861
<v Speaker 1>about your time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's almost 15 percent.</v>

1725
01:21:38.861 --> 01:21:39.860
<v Speaker 3>Conor mcgregor when he fought Chad </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mendez,</v>

1726
01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:44.861
<v Speaker 3>he looked like a dead man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could see people were </v>

1727
01:21:44.861 --> 01:21:44.861
<v Speaker 3>commenting and online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like Jesus Christ,</v>

1728
01:21:44.861 --> 01:21:46.280
<v Speaker 3>look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can a guide like that?</v>

1729
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:48.650
<v Speaker 3>A guy like that who's fighting a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Mendez,</v>

1730
01:21:48.651 --> 01:21:53.651
<v Speaker 3>Kennett guy like that in 24 hours orally</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehydrate properly.</v>

1731
01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the question of that.</v>

1732
01:21:56.951 --> 01:21:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1733
01:21:58.030 --> 01:22:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I think our athletes are outliers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are the toughest individual,</v>

1734
01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:06.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their genetic freaks to begin with.</v>

1735
01:22:06.431 --> 01:22:11.431
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this common science doesn't quite </v>

1736
01:22:11.431 --> 01:22:13.540
<v Speaker 1>apply to them by the exact number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I tell you,</v>

1737
01:22:13.541 --> 01:22:18.541
<v Speaker 1>it's something we had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a meeting the other day with our </v>

1738
01:22:18.541 --> 01:22:19.540
<v Speaker 1>operation staff and our fighters come in</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Monday or Tuesday and the first thing</v>

1739
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:23.680
<v Speaker 1>I do is weigh a men just to kind of get </v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea of hey,</v>

1740
01:22:23.681 --> 01:22:27.010
<v Speaker 1>where they're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do a body or water company that I'm</v>

1741
01:22:27.011 --> 01:22:32.011
<v Speaker 1>aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I tell you I'm going to start being </v>

1742
01:22:32.011 --> 01:22:33.080
<v Speaker 1>aware of kind of what these numbers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in versus you know,</v>

1743
01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:35.020
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the ultimate way it is.</v>

1744
01:22:35.021 --> 01:22:37.150
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trying to be,</v>

1745
01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:42.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not trying to be the police but trying </v>

1746
01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:43.951
<v Speaker 1>to be an advocate and maybe sit down </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some of these fighters as a hey </v>

1747
01:22:43.951 --> 01:22:43.951
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what the studies show here,</v>

1748
01:22:43.951 --> 01:22:45.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what you're subjecting yourself to.</v>

1749
01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can get away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1750
01:22:46.991 --> 01:22:51.991
<v Speaker 1>on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on the inside these things don't go </v>

1751
01:22:51.991 --> 01:22:52.720
<v Speaker 1>away and you're probably doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1752
01:22:52.721 --> 01:22:54.820
<v Speaker 1>lasting damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you talked to any x fighters?</v>

1753
01:22:54.821 --> 01:22:59.821
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to a few about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have ongoing kidney problems are </v>

1754
01:22:59.821 --> 01:22:59.821
<v Speaker 1>probably going to have the rest of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1755
01:22:59.821 --> 01:23:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Fibroid problems where their thyroid is </v>
<v Speaker 1>all messed up from these extreme weight </v>

1756
01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:08.251
<v Speaker 1>cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely there if you have to </v>

1757
01:23:08.251 --> 01:23:08.251
<v Speaker 1>have</v>

1758
01:23:08.251 --> 01:23:08.251
<v Speaker 3>a statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1759
01:23:08.251 --> 01:23:08.251
<v Speaker 3>it's devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>

1760
01:23:08.251 --> 01:23:10.350
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Cormier didn't make the Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 3>team because was in.</v>

1761
01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:13.030
<v Speaker 3>Didn't compete in the Olympics because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of his kidneys shutting down.</v>

1762
01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:14.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1763
01:23:14.201 --> 01:23:16.000
<v Speaker 3>it's a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giant problem.</v>

1764
01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1765
01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:21.050
<v Speaker 3>it's awful and it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing for a guy like,</v>

1766
01:23:21.051 --> 01:23:26.051
<v Speaker 3>although when a guy like mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what really people want to see is what </v>

1767
01:23:26.051 --> 01:23:26.620
<v Speaker 3>they want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aldo fight mcgregor,</v>

1768
01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:31.680
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck if they weigh in </v>

1769
01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.601
<v Speaker 3>at 1:45,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then rehydrate backup to whatever the </v>

1770
01:23:33.601 --> 01:23:33.601
<v Speaker 3>hell they weighed before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nonsense.</v>

1771
01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:37.570
<v Speaker 3>What they should do is figure out where </v>
<v Speaker 3>are these guys are healthy,</v>

1772
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.500
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are you healthy?</v>

1773
01:23:38.501 --> 01:23:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Then we're going to see the best fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of these guys.</v>

1774
01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:44.260
<v Speaker 3>The problem is the title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The title is everything,</v>

1775
01:23:44.290 --> 01:23:45.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to be.</v>

1776
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.730
<v Speaker 3>Chris Weidman is the UFC middleweight </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion of the world.</v>

1777
01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:51.430
<v Speaker 3>If Chris Weidman releases his title and </v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

1778
01:23:51.431 --> 01:23:56.431
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't make the UFC one 85 pound limit </v>

1779
01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:56.431
<v Speaker 3>anymore because of this new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1780
01:23:56.431 --> 01:24:00.880
<v Speaker 3>and non ivy using policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm just going to drop the title </v>

1781
01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Chris Weidman and could still have huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super fights because he's Chris Weidman </v>

1782
01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.310
<v Speaker 3>and everybody knows he's a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

1783
01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.120
<v Speaker 3>So if he decided to fight at two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1784
01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:10.210
<v Speaker 3>five or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are going to line up.</v>

1785
01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:12.640
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if it's for the title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a name.</v>

1786
01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:15.310
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda Rousey has a name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>connor has a name,</v>

1787
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:17.830
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of guys that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have a name.</v>

1788
01:24:17.831 --> 01:24:19.340
<v Speaker 3>So for those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that,</v>

1789
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:21.160
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that title is critical.</v>

1790
01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:26.580
<v Speaker 3>The difference between Robbie lawler </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting Carlos condit just in a fight </v>

1791
01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:28.270
<v Speaker 3>and Robbie lawler fighting crime was </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of as a champion.</v>

1792
01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:30.910
<v Speaker 3>It's too big goddamn difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big difference.</v>

1793
01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:34.330
<v Speaker 3>And that's unfortunate because I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this,</v>

1794
01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:34.970
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1795
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:40.030
<v Speaker 3>the situation that they're in right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they have to hit this specific </v>

1796
01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:41.110
<v Speaker 3>weight class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we should match guys up based on</v>

1797
01:24:41.111 --> 01:24:46.111
<v Speaker 3>their size and not based on weighing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>24 hours beforehand.</v>

1798
01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:51.420
<v Speaker 3>At a very specific way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's dangerous and I also think </v>

1799
01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:51.420
<v Speaker 3>it's irrelevant.</v>

1800
01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:51.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1801
01:24:51.971 --> 01:24:56.971
<v Speaker 3>I think there's advantages that guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have if they were a more than a </v>

1802
01:24:56.971 --> 01:24:57.920
<v Speaker 3>certain amount over their opponent or </v>
<v Speaker 3>less than a certain amount of,</v>

1803
01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:02.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a way that you could mitigate </v>

1804
01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:04.741
<v Speaker 3>that though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a way that you could figure out </v>

1805
01:25:04.741 --> 01:25:04.741
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1806
01:25:04.741 --> 01:25:06.190
<v Speaker 3>what is the range of these guys could </v>
<v Speaker 3>weigh in,</v>

1807
01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:10.990
<v Speaker 3>but make sure that they are within the </v>
<v Speaker 3>range of dehydration within the range of</v>

1808
01:25:10.991 --> 01:25:14.410
<v Speaker 3>body composition and then they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking with the numbers any.</v>

1809
01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Let's find out what you actually weigh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1810
01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:19.300
<v Speaker 3>what does Johnny Hendricks actually way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he fights,</v>

1811
01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:22.090
<v Speaker 3>when Johnny Hendricks is at his best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where Johnny Hendricks,</v>

1812
01:25:22.091 --> 01:25:27.091
<v Speaker 3>you'd be fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about Tyron Woodley all those guys </v>

1813
01:25:27.091 --> 01:25:27.820
<v Speaker 3>and figure out where everybody belongs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then compete at that level.</v>

1814
01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:30.360
<v Speaker 3>But everybody's competing for titles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1815
01:25:30.370 --> 01:25:33.490
<v Speaker 3>and I think that is part of the problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the 1:55</v>

1816
01:25:33.491 --> 01:25:36.010
<v Speaker 3>pound title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one 70 pound title.</v>

1817
01:25:36.190 --> 01:25:41.190
<v Speaker 3>But really what we want to see as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best fighters fighting against the best </v>

1818
01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:41.190
<v Speaker 3>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where the money's at.</v>

1819
01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:42.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear you.</v>

1820
01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:44.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1821
01:25:44.150 --> 01:25:45.670
<v Speaker 3>a simple answer to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

1822
01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:50.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a process and steps and then all I </v>

1823
01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:50.730
<v Speaker 3>can say is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I already am beating this,</v>

1824
01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:52.300
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to be the squeaky wheel </v>
<v Speaker 3>here that,</v>

1825
01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:57.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully at some point squeaks enough </v>

1826
01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:57.360
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1827
01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:57.970
<v Speaker 3>get some grease into this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in terms of the fighters,</v>

1828
01:25:57.971 --> 01:26:01.560
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have just one interest at mind.</v>

1829
01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:06.570
<v Speaker 3>My one goal in one interest and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking out for their health short and </v>

1830
01:26:06.570 --> 01:26:10.091
<v Speaker 3>longterm with everything we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this anti doping program with the </v>

1831
01:26:10.091 --> 01:26:10.580
<v Speaker 3>ivy ban.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>

1832
01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.900
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately,</v>

1833
01:26:11.901 --> 01:26:16.901
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I challenge anyone to say that I don't </v>

1834
01:26:16.901 --> 01:26:16.901
<v Speaker 3>have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1835
01:26:16.901 --> 01:26:18.170
<v Speaker 3>at the forefront of what we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do here.</v>

1836
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:21.560
<v Speaker 3>I certainly think you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just think that the ivy band,</v>

1837
01:26:21.561 --> 01:26:26.561
<v Speaker 3>without some sort of weight class </v>
<v Speaker 3>management is almost like </v>

1838
01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.960
<v Speaker 3>counterintuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there has to be something that </v>

1839
01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:34.631
<v Speaker 3>allows these guys who they've got like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Weidman is worked so hard to get to the </v>

1840
01:26:34.631 --> 01:26:39.580
<v Speaker 3>185 pound title to all of a sudden he </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't make it anymore because you can't </v>

1841
01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:43.901
<v Speaker 3>use [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just seems ridiculous because you </v>

1842
01:26:43.901 --> 01:26:45.410
<v Speaker 3>have a policy that he's too dehydrated </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you check them and you find out what</v>

1843
01:26:45.411 --> 01:26:50.411
<v Speaker 3>he's doing to get to one 85.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though he's been doing his whole </v>

1844
01:26:50.411 --> 01:26:50.411
<v Speaker 3>career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys step in and say,</v>

1845
01:26:50.411 --> 01:26:54.521
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is too dangerous and we're not </v>

1846
01:26:54.521 --> 01:26:54.521
<v Speaker 3>gonna allow you to do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1847
01:26:54.521 --> 01:26:55.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of crazy.</v>

1848
01:26:55.011 --> 01:27:00.011
<v Speaker 3>If he's gotta move up 20 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's already talked about fighting Jon </v>

1849
01:27:00.011 --> 01:27:04.240
<v Speaker 3>Jones statement he made recently and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one thing I love about this guy </v>

1850
01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:08.050
<v Speaker 3>said he wants to fight the best guys in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and he says if Weidman or if </v>

1851
01:27:08.050 --> 01:27:09.380
<v Speaker 3>John Jones rather comes back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

1852
01:27:09.381 --> 01:27:14.381
<v Speaker 3>I have to fight this guy because he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best and I'm not leaving the sport </v>

1853
01:27:14.381 --> 01:27:17.120
<v Speaker 3>until I fight Jon Jones and because he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best at two,</v>

1854
01:27:17.121 --> 01:27:17.630
<v Speaker 3>oh five.</v>

1855
01:27:17.630 --> 01:27:22.250
<v Speaker 3>And so he wants to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just think that,</v>

1856
01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:28.300
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making the weight cut and making that </v>

1857
01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:30.461
<v Speaker 3>way classes probably reducing his career</v>
<v Speaker 3>and probably reducing a lot of these </v>

1858
01:27:30.461 --> 01:27:31.190
<v Speaker 3>athletes' careers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can do it,</v>

1859
01:27:31.191 --> 01:27:34.100
<v Speaker 3>they get through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at what price and that price is,</v>

1860
01:27:34.101 --> 01:27:37.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure cumulative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to be.</v>

1861
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear everything you're saying Joe.</v>

1862
01:27:39.250 --> 01:27:40.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1863
01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:43.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I say as this program has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been up and running now for a month,</v>

1864
01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:46.580
<v Speaker 3>month and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm generally don't listen to me,</v>

1865
01:27:46.581 --> 01:27:47.420
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They gotta listen to you.</v>

1866
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:49.670
<v Speaker 3>They think I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta you gotTa talk to them.</v>

1867
01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Weight classes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more weight classes and all the people </v>

1868
01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.420
<v Speaker 3>who support shut up dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut up.</v>

1869
01:27:56.450 --> 01:28:01.450
<v Speaker 3>All of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what you're talking </v>

1870
01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:01.450
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1871
01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking sport is so filled with </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy people.</v>

1872
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:06.500
<v Speaker 3>They're willing to do anything to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1873
01:28:06.501 --> 01:28:11.501
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things about the weight cut </v>

1874
01:28:11.501 --> 01:28:13.990
<v Speaker 3>is that the amount of effort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that titanic effort that it takes to get</v>

1875
01:28:14.301 --> 01:28:19.301
<v Speaker 3>down to some of these weight classes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehydrate and compete against world </v>

1876
01:28:19.301 --> 01:28:23.021
<v Speaker 3>class athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>world class athletes and the toughest </v>

1877
01:28:23.021 --> 01:28:23.021
<v Speaker 3>sport in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty four hours later.</v>

1878
01:28:23.021 --> 01:28:25.220
<v Speaker 3>It's just nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're superhuman on so many levels,</v>

1879
01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:28.310
<v Speaker 3>so many levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fighting skills,</v>

1880
01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:33.140
<v Speaker 3>their ability to withstand pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just incredible.</v>

1881
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:38.290
<v Speaker 3>The mental toughness to the mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>toughness that it takes to go through </v>

1882
01:28:38.290 --> 01:28:38.660
<v Speaker 3>those weight cuts and then compete 24 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours later.</v>

1883
01:28:38.661 --> 01:28:43.661
<v Speaker 3>It's just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we were talking earlier about the </v>

1884
01:28:43.661 --> 01:28:48.341
<v Speaker 3>designer drugs that you're catching </v>
<v Speaker 3>people on or these drugs that they're </v>

1885
01:28:48.341 --> 01:28:51.800
<v Speaker 3>testing that they like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about the cyclist.</v>

1886
01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Is there anything else that's like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you may see coming up?</v>

1887
01:28:57.050 --> 01:29:02.050
<v Speaker 3>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't have anything for you </v>

1888
01:29:02.050 --> 01:29:02.280
<v Speaker 3>here today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's</v>

1889
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:06.600
<v Speaker 1>constantly drugs in clinical trial phase</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could have an application to,</v>

1890
01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:12.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancement and how do you </v>

1891
01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:12.420
<v Speaker 1>guys stay on top of that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is,</v>

1892
01:29:12.450 --> 01:29:17.450
<v Speaker 1>what's the method of making sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aware of every new thing that </v>

1893
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:21.981
<v Speaker 1>these guys are doing to try to get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of an advantage and when these </v>

1894
01:29:21.981 --> 01:29:22.830
<v Speaker 1>things should be legal and illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1895
01:29:22.831 --> 01:29:23.570
<v Speaker 1>What's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

1896
01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:28.630
<v Speaker 1>that's the role of the anti-doping </v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities and you saw to who we use </v>

1897
01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:31.731
<v Speaker 1>and they constantly interact and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interface with the pharmaceutical </v>

1898
01:29:31.731 --> 01:29:32.940
<v Speaker 1>industry so that way they know these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things run the pipeline.</v>

1899
01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:34.710
<v Speaker 1>They can get a look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1900
01:29:34.711 --> 01:29:37.290
<v Speaker 1>what's potentially performance enhancing</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not?</v>

1901
01:29:37.291 --> 01:29:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I think the pharmaceutical companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>been pretty cooperative about it.</v>

1902
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:46.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean financially they could probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>care less but you know,</v>

1903
01:29:46.230 --> 01:29:49.110
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when they have a product like an</v>

1904
01:29:49.111 --> 01:29:54.111
<v Speaker 1>EPO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a great drug for someone who </v>

1905
01:29:54.111 --> 01:29:57.261
<v Speaker 1>has cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosa anemic and helps your body create </v>

1906
01:29:57.261 --> 01:29:58.830
<v Speaker 1>red blood cells that you need to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>great drug,</v>

1907
01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:04.340
<v Speaker 1>but then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the press about it as athletes </v>

1908
01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:04.340
<v Speaker 1>that are using it to cheat.</v>

1909
01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:09.110
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's good for our reputation </v>
<v Speaker 1>standpoint for the pharmaceutical </v>

1910
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:10.220
<v Speaker 1>industry to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1911
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:15.350
<v Speaker 1>get on top of these things and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the application could be in and </v>

1912
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:18.690
<v Speaker 1>helping anti-doping with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a window where these guys are </v>

1913
01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:22.251
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to use certain things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you guys haven't caught onto yet </v>

1914
01:30:22.251 --> 01:30:24.780
<v Speaker 1>that are actually legal for them at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain point,</v>

1915
01:30:24.781 --> 01:30:29.781
<v Speaker 1>like some natural supplements perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>that turn out to be like a little bit </v>

1916
01:30:29.781 --> 01:30:33.471
<v Speaker 1>too effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you make that distinction </v>

1917
01:30:33.471 --> 01:30:33.471
<v Speaker 1>potentially and that that really lies </v>
<v Speaker 1>with water.</v>

1918
01:30:33.471 --> 01:30:38.310
<v Speaker 1>The world antidoping agency and they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly monitoring things.</v>

1919
01:30:38.311 --> 01:30:39.780
<v Speaker 1>There's certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was,</v>

1920
01:30:39.781 --> 01:30:43.230
<v Speaker 1>we were talking last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have things on their watch list</v>

1921
01:30:43.710 --> 01:30:48.710
<v Speaker 1>so that something like you just talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about could be some type of legal </v>

1922
01:30:48.710 --> 01:30:50.040
<v Speaker 1>supplement and they're taking a look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and studying it.</v>

1923
01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:51.900
<v Speaker 1>What are the performance enhancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits?</v>

1924
01:30:51.901 --> 01:30:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Does it have side effects were that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1925
01:30:54.370 --> 01:30:59.370
<v Speaker 1>if you had athlete and say hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to risk myself to those </v>

1926
01:30:59.370 --> 01:30:59.490
<v Speaker 1>side effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't want to use that.</v>

1927
01:30:59.491 --> 01:31:04.491
<v Speaker 1>Even if it is legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as somebody's gaining an unfair </v>

1928
01:31:04.491 --> 01:31:04.491
<v Speaker 1>advantage because they're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>risk,</v>

1929
01:31:04.491 --> 01:31:08.421
<v Speaker 1>so side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a constant monitoring process </v>

1930
01:31:08.421 --> 01:31:11.340
<v Speaker 1>being done by the top level anti-doping </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority,</v>

1931
01:31:11.341 --> 01:31:16.341
<v Speaker 1>which is water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what about unintentional </v>

1932
01:31:16.341 --> 01:31:17.610
<v Speaker 1>contamination?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva just got through this big</v>

1933
01:31:17.611 --> 01:31:22.611
<v Speaker 1>crazy trial in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure you watched those in the </v>

1934
01:31:22.611 --> 01:31:22.611
<v Speaker 1>front row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was right behind him.</v>

1935
01:31:22.611 --> 01:31:26.900
<v Speaker 1>What the hell was that about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The songs that kept playing I was </v>

1936
01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:28.860
<v Speaker 1>hearing was disturbing on so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

1937
01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:33.210
<v Speaker 1>So many explain to people what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about because for some they hear</v>

1938
01:31:33.211 --> 01:31:34.350
<v Speaker 1>it from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna think I'm kidding.</v>

1939
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Like explain what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had a,</v>

1940
01:31:37.770 --> 01:31:40.020
<v Speaker 1>they had a little conference call </v>
<v Speaker 1>device,</v>

1941
01:31:40.021 --> 01:31:45.021
<v Speaker 1>which they have actually a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists on the line for that were </v>

1942
01:31:45.021 --> 01:31:48.021
<v Speaker 1>testifying about some of his tests and </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody out there was able to get the </v>

1943
01:31:48.021 --> 01:31:50.580
<v Speaker 1>number and in the middle of the hearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>was playing these songs.</v>

1944
01:31:50.581 --> 01:31:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say he was taught,</v>

1945
01:31:53.711 --> 01:31:57.420
<v Speaker 1>he was testifying about the Cialis that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought was cialis that he was using.</v>

1946
01:31:57.421 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 1>And like a shaggy came on,</v>

1947
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:02.580
<v Speaker 2>salt and pepper song came on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1948
01:32:02.581 --> 01:32:07.581
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Songs about sex kept coming on during </v>

1949
01:32:07.581 --> 01:32:07.690
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be such a zoo.</v>

1950
01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:09.520
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing was just so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1951
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:13.420
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was great for people that were paying</v>

1952
01:32:13.421 --> 01:32:14.470
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1953
01:32:14.471 --> 01:32:16.480
<v Speaker 2>the courtroom burst out in laughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1954
01:32:16.481 --> 01:32:17.020
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1955
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:21.250
<v Speaker 2>sad somebodies career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reputation at stake in a bright.</v>

1956
01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:22.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me that's.</v>

1957
01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:25.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm all about having a little humor </v>
<v Speaker 2>injected into things,</v>

1958
01:32:25.301 --> 01:32:27.650
<v Speaker 2>but I hated to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1959
01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1960
01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:31.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't say I hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1961
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:37.030
<v Speaker 2>it was just too funny to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the whole thing was odd in the </v>

1962
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.030
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1963
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:41.520
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument is for folks who hadn't </v>

1964
01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:44.971
<v Speaker 2>heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was taking or the excuses that </v>

1965
01:32:44.971 --> 01:32:47.971
<v Speaker 2>he was taking liquid cialis that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently made in the laboratory that </v>

1966
01:32:47.971 --> 01:32:52.801
<v Speaker 2>also made steroids and that this liquid </v>
<v Speaker 2>cialis was tainted unintentionally.</v>

1967
01:32:53.770 --> 01:32:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Like you get a vat of stuff and you mix </v>
<v Speaker 2>it all together and then you throw the </v>

1968
01:32:58.770 --> 01:33:00.130
<v Speaker 2>new stuff and the next VAT and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't cleaned it.</v>

1969
01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:05.520
<v Speaker 2>His story was it was liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cialis from a friend that he recently </v>

1970
01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:07.960
<v Speaker 2>got to know that came from Thailand in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue on mark vial,</v>

1971
01:33:08.650 --> 01:33:11.620
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're gonna make something up,</v>

1972
01:33:11.621 --> 01:33:14.380
<v Speaker 2>but you really make that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would lead,</v>

1973
01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:19.150
<v Speaker 2>lend more credibility to that story </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the personal nature of taking</v>

1974
01:33:19.151 --> 01:33:22.630
<v Speaker 2>it and maybe the embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the embarrassment around taking that.</v>

1975
01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:23.650
<v Speaker 2>He have come in and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1976
01:33:23.651 --> 01:33:26.560
<v Speaker 2>I used the protein powder and found </v>
<v Speaker 2>something in it.</v>

1977
01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would lend some credibility to that.</v>

1978
01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1979
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:32.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had alluded to that on this show.</v>

1980
01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:37.620
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't express the exact nature of the </v>

1981
01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:41.011
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd known about this for a long </v>

1982
01:33:41.011 --> 01:33:41.011
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1983
01:33:41.011 --> 01:33:42.280
<v Speaker 2>I had heard about the liquid cialis </v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse for a long time,</v>

1984
01:33:42.490 --> 01:33:47.490
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that he had taken that same </v>

1985
01:33:47.531 --> 01:33:52.531
<v Speaker 2>steroid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went while he was healing from his </v>

1986
01:33:52.531 --> 01:33:54.010
<v Speaker 2>broken leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that he had said that he</v>

1987
01:33:54.011 --> 01:33:56.980
<v Speaker 2>had taken it before to heal his broken </v>
<v Speaker 2>leg.</v>

1988
01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:01.570
<v Speaker 2>And then when he was surprised was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he had tested negative during camp,</v>

1989
01:34:01.571 --> 01:34:06.571
<v Speaker 2>but then positive after the fight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when they decided to check out </v>

1990
01:34:06.571 --> 01:34:07.900
<v Speaker 2>the liquid cialis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>

1991
01:34:07.930 --> 01:34:10.350
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't aware of of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That didn't come up in the,</v>

1992
01:34:10.351 --> 01:34:12.790
<v Speaker 2>in the here and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my boss route and was critical of</v>

1993
01:34:12.791 --> 01:34:15.940
<v Speaker 2>it boss route and was saying that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed his story more than once.</v>

1994
01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:19.360
<v Speaker 2>And boss was saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is what he had said,</v>

1995
01:34:19.361 --> 01:34:22.720
<v Speaker 2>that he had taken it to heal up his leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>

1996
01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:25.750
<v Speaker 2>then it was this new excuse with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>liquid cialis.</v>

1997
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:30.990
<v Speaker 2>And if there's a lesson I learned over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the years of seeing so many of these </v>

1998
01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:33.700
<v Speaker 2>high profile athletes kind of get </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought to the table and you know,</v>

1999
01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:38.760
<v Speaker 2>their reputations kind of tarnished </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever is come to the table and just be</v>

2000
01:34:41.201 --> 01:34:43.450
<v Speaker 2>transparent and miss exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Transparency.</v>

2001
01:34:43.451 --> 01:34:46.360
<v Speaker 2>That the public is very forgiving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very forgiving.</v>

2002
01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Especially in a sport like this where </v>
<v Speaker 2>most people believe that a large </v>

2003
01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:56.251
<v Speaker 2>percentage of the athletes at one point </v>
<v Speaker 2>in time have done something that at </v>

2004
01:34:56.251 --> 01:34:58.310
<v Speaker 2>least now would not be legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including testosterone replacement,</v>

2005
01:34:58.310 --> 01:35:01.160
<v Speaker 1>which was legal just a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a year ago in Nevada.</v>

2006
01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Which again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back to what I said,</v>

2007
01:35:03.171 --> 01:35:05.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the understanding of why things happen,</v>

2008
01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:08.180
<v Speaker 1>my personal understanding of why </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes shows to go that route.</v>

2009
01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I think most of the public will be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2010
01:35:09.951 --> 01:35:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't much testing going on.</v>

2011
01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:17.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a couple weeks out the night of </v>

2012
01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:17.640
<v Speaker 1>the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2013
01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:21.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were probably stupid if you weren't </v>

2014
01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:21.860
<v Speaker 1>doing something based on your risk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life every time you got in there.</v>

2015
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:25.760
<v Speaker 1>So definitely under those circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now under the new one here,</v>

2016
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:30.790
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think people should be as </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgiving because everybody should know </v>

2017
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:31.070
<v Speaker 1>now how serious this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

2018
01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:36.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>year round that there are serious </v>

2019
01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:38.270
<v Speaker 1>consequences and the risk is far going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to outweigh the reward.</v>

2020
01:35:38.271 --> 01:35:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2021
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:45.910
<v Speaker 1>as far as inadvertent contamination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as accidental dosing,</v>

2022
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:52.270
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you buy something from some protein </v>

2023
01:35:52.270 --> 01:35:53.480
<v Speaker 1>powder or vitamin that comes from some </v>
<v Speaker 1>shop,</v>

2024
01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:55.320
<v Speaker 1>you know and you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2025
01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:58.070
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to boost testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally or something like that,</v>

2026
01:35:58.071 --> 01:35:59.480
<v Speaker 1>and then it turns out that steroids in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2027
01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:03.080
<v Speaker 1>How often does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real issue with athletes or is</v>

2028
01:36:03.081 --> 01:36:08.081
<v Speaker 1>it a bullshit excuse they use to cover </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the fact that it took steroids are </v>

2029
01:36:08.081 --> 01:36:12.040
<v Speaker 1>real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my career I just left to come to the </v>

2030
01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:15.431
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was with the Food and Drug </v>

2031
01:36:15.431 --> 01:36:15.431
<v Speaker 1>Administration Office of Criminal </v>
<v Speaker 1>Investigation.</v>

2032
01:36:15.431 --> 01:36:19.241
<v Speaker 1>We investigated the dietary sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement and industry and there's </v>

2033
01:36:20.361 --> 01:36:25.361
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of products out there on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelves with steroids over the counter </v>

2034
01:36:25.361 --> 01:36:30.310
<v Speaker 1>with steroids and other substances which</v>
<v Speaker 1>would cause our athletes to test </v>

2035
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:34.631
<v Speaker 1>positive for and as we're getting out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and going out and educating our </v>

2036
01:36:34.631 --> 01:36:36.140
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a huge portion of the education.</v>

2037
01:36:36.650 --> 01:36:40.490
<v Speaker 1>It is that you have to be more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful,</v>

2038
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:45.610
<v Speaker 1>extreme careful about what you take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately you're liable for everything </v>

2039
01:36:45.610 --> 01:36:47.000
<v Speaker 1>that goes into your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2040
01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:52.001
<v Speaker 1>we'll be here and will be a resource for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to help kind of Wade through those </v>

2041
01:36:52.001 --> 01:36:53.210
<v Speaker 1>issues and those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those landmines that are out there,</v>

2042
01:36:53.211 --> 01:36:56.150
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately you're responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>what goes in your body.</v>

2043
01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Now we have built in our policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitigating factors that can reduce </v>

2044
01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:02.980
<v Speaker 1>sanctions so that if somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2045
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:08.110
<v Speaker 1>did test positive for steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were able to show because they kept</v>

2046
01:37:08.751 --> 01:37:10.580
<v Speaker 1>a sample of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2047
01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:13.310
<v Speaker 1>they told us what the lot number with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottle was.</v>

2048
01:37:13.311 --> 01:37:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Someone went and got that off the shelf </v>
<v Speaker 1>to ensure that hey,</v>

2049
01:37:15.921 --> 01:37:17.750
<v Speaker 1>they didn't just spike the sample that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>

2050
01:37:18.230 --> 01:37:23.230
<v Speaker 1>that there was that steroid in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there were other circumstances </v>

2051
01:37:23.230 --> 01:37:23.230
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2052
01:37:23.230 --> 01:37:25.640
<v Speaker 1>occurrences like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that could,</v>

2053
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:29.240
<v Speaker 1>could be grounds for a reduction and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctioned to as low as,</v>

2054
01:37:29.241 --> 01:37:34.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a public warning for the first </v>

2055
01:37:34.241 --> 01:37:34.241
<v Speaker 1>time maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2056
01:37:34.241 --> 01:37:38.260
<v Speaker 1>but nevertheless there's still going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be some type of sanction and that'll be </v>

2057
01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:41.711
<v Speaker 1>your first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that the next one that came about </v>

2058
01:37:41.711 --> 01:37:41.711
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2059
01:37:41.711 --> 01:37:42.950
<v Speaker 1>double potential penalties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's tough issue,</v>

2060
01:37:42.951 --> 01:37:43.130
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2061
01:37:43.130 --> 01:37:47.390
<v Speaker 1>One that I worry about a lot because all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our fighters take supplements.</v>

2062
01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:50.510
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to get up there and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take supplements.</v>

2063
01:37:50.511 --> 01:37:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Anybody I don't think that's realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

2064
01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:53.470
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

2065
01:37:53.630 --> 01:37:58.630
<v Speaker 1>contradicting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about the fact that all </v>

2066
01:37:58.630 --> 01:37:59.190
<v Speaker 1>these athletes takes off elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2067
01:37:59.191 --> 01:38:04.191
<v Speaker 1>why are they taking supplements?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why gain in performance enhancing </v>

2068
01:38:04.191 --> 01:38:09.020
<v Speaker 1>advantage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of an advantage that we're </v>

2069
01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:09.020
<v Speaker 1>talking and talking supplements you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

2070
01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:10.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>derivatives of food.</v>

2071
01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:15.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking drugs here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of these derivatives of food </v>

2072
01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.820
<v Speaker 1>had been known to enhance testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>development or production.</v>

2073
01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2074
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:24.070
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these natural testosterone </v>

2075
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.070
<v Speaker 1>boosters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2076
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>

2077
01:38:24.511 --> 01:38:28.590
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it's Hocus pocus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just marketing and sales pitches.</v>

2078
01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard ones,</v>

2079
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:33.840
<v Speaker 1>things like creatine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that has an athletic advantage.</v>

2080
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:36.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a performance enhancing benefit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of creatine,</v>

2081
01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:37.620
<v Speaker 1>but creatines legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2082
01:38:37.770 --> 01:38:38.430
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2083
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:42.150
<v Speaker 1>So the amount is just small enough so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's not,</v>

2084
01:38:42.690 --> 01:38:44.040
<v Speaker 1>it's under the wire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

2085
01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:49.100
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't reach this steroid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like level where you guys have to step </v>

2086
01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:52.671
<v Speaker 1>in and say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that would be the reasoning why </v>

2087
01:38:52.671 --> 01:38:52.671
<v Speaker 1>water has not prohibited Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 that,</v>

2088
01:38:52.671 --> 01:38:56.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the level of what it's </v>

2089
01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:56.630
<v Speaker 1>really going to do for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2090
01:38:56.630 --> 01:39:01.021
<v Speaker 1>it's minor is zero and avenue that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters have where they can send you </v>

2091
01:39:01.021 --> 01:39:02.370
<v Speaker 1>guys stuff that they're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking.</v>

2092
01:39:02.371 --> 01:39:04.890
<v Speaker 1>And then you could test it like say if a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy is at,</v>

2093
01:39:05.010 --> 01:39:10.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some vitamin store or something like </v>

2094
01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:10.410
<v Speaker 1>that and see some human growth hormone </v>
<v Speaker 1>booster,</v>

2095
01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:12.960
<v Speaker 1>that's all amino acids and totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural.</v>

2096
01:39:12.961 --> 01:39:13.590
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2097
01:39:13.591 --> 01:39:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we,</v>

2098
01:39:14.970 --> 01:39:16.440
<v Speaker 1>can they send it to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2099
01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:18.630
<v Speaker 1>now we don't have anything in place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they can send it to us.</v>

2100
01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:19.620
<v Speaker 1>That would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2101
01:39:19.890 --> 01:39:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we get inundated with things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and be spending money.</v>

2102
01:39:23.101 --> 01:39:25.200
<v Speaker 1>We could be spending on a testing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2103
01:39:25.201 --> 01:39:30.120
<v Speaker 1>But what they do do is shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get 20 to 30 a week,</v>

2104
01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:32.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe emails from athletes about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2105
01:39:32.941 --> 01:39:34.680
<v Speaker 1>here's what I'm taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I take this one?</v>

2106
01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one.</v>

2107
01:39:36.421 --> 01:39:41.421
<v Speaker 1>And typically what I do is for that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States antidoping agency you saw </v>

2108
01:39:42.261 --> 01:39:44.210
<v Speaker 1>to where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2109
01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:45.090
<v Speaker 1>actually have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2110
01:39:45.091 --> 01:39:47.230
<v Speaker 1>a phd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman who's,</v>

2111
01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:52.500
<v Speaker 1>she is probably the nation's expert on </v>
<v Speaker 1>dietary supplements and she buys you </v>

2112
01:39:53.551 --> 01:39:58.551
<v Speaker 1>Sato will buy on their own hundred or so</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year and test them theirselves.</v>

2113
01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:03.660
<v Speaker 1>They actually have a website that lists </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these that have tested positive</v>

2114
01:40:03.661 --> 01:40:08.400
<v Speaker 1>for substances that would be a positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>test under our program.</v>

2115
01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:11.640
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're constantly answering questions,</v>

2116
01:40:11.641 --> 01:40:16.641
<v Speaker 1>providing resource.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately I tell everybody and </v>

2117
01:40:16.641 --> 01:40:19.071
<v Speaker 1>they're disappointed that I say I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>never give you 100 percent green light </v>

2118
01:40:19.071 --> 01:40:19.140
<v Speaker 1>to take something.</v>

2119
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:21.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say 100 percent,</v>

2120
01:40:21.631 --> 01:40:24.150
<v Speaker 1>don't touch that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you red flags.</v>

2121
01:40:24.151 --> 01:40:25.230
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

2122
01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:28.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most reputable company that sells,</v>

2123
01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:33.700
<v Speaker 1>you know their vitamin in Costco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know about that one bottle </v>

2124
01:40:34.141 --> 01:40:37.290
<v Speaker 1>from that one batch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave you the horror story of all time.</v>

2125
01:40:37.291 --> 01:40:38.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the news,</v>

2126
01:40:38.671 --> 01:40:43.671
<v Speaker 1>you can google it and read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was a a vitamin company that </v>

2127
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:46.740
<v Speaker 1>had a vitamin B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was 12,</v>

2128
01:40:46.741 --> 01:40:49.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it was manufactured in long </v>
<v Speaker 1>island a couple of years back,</v>

2129
01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:54.820
<v Speaker 1>and the guy that was manufacturing it on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the run before vitamin took,</v>

2130
01:40:54.821 --> 01:40:59.500
<v Speaker 1>did a run of a raw product that he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>from some guy in the south.</v>

2131
01:41:00.250 --> 01:41:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Ran that through the machine with </v>
<v Speaker 1>instructions of how much to put in each </v>

2132
01:41:05.250 --> 01:41:05.470
<v Speaker 1>capsule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sent that off to the guy in the south.</v>

2133
01:41:05.770 --> 01:41:08.020
<v Speaker 1>The vitamin companies product is next on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the machine.</v>

2134
01:41:08.021 --> 01:41:09.610
<v Speaker 1>You didn't clean the machine off well </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

2135
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:13.060
<v Speaker 1>and that previous product had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>designer,</v>

2136
01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:15.910
<v Speaker 1>anabolic steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super drawl mythos drone,</v>

2137
01:41:15.911 --> 01:41:18.970
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>anabolic steroids.</v>

2138
01:41:18.971 --> 01:41:22.670
<v Speaker 1>It's orally taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That got into the [inaudible].</v>

2139
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:27.740
<v Speaker 1>The [inaudible] I'm sure I'm thinking it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was maybe a.</v>

2140
01:41:28.050 --> 01:41:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a reputable retail store </v>
<v Speaker 1>or it was sold a week or two later.</v>

2141
01:41:33.010 --> 01:41:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Elderly people started presenting </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves at hospitals in this area.</v>

2142
01:41:36.851 --> 01:41:40.870
<v Speaker 1>What was being sold with yellow eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yellow palms.</v>

2143
01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Because they were ingesting a vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had his very toxic steroid in it </v>

2144
01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:47.980
<v Speaker 1>and they were getting sick from liver </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>

2145
01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Luckily that's the extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there have been cases of and we </v>

2146
01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:55.840
<v Speaker 1>talked and then we start talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports supplement and industry,</v>

2147
01:41:55.841 --> 01:41:56.560
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2148
01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:58.990
<v Speaker 1>testosterone boosters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe more edgy stuff.</v>

2149
01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:01.300
<v Speaker 1>You see that happen way more often.</v>

2150
01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I invite you after it go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw it aside.</v>

2151
01:42:03.551 --> 01:42:06.850
<v Speaker 1>It's publicly available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A supplement for one one.</v>

2152
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:11.910
<v Speaker 1>They have listed all of the dietary </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements that they've bought this </v>

2153
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:13.240
<v Speaker 1>year and tested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just looking at it last night.</v>

2154
01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's over 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably more than 50 in there,</v>

2155
01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:22.150
<v Speaker 1>which the public can still go out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy a there on the shelves of stores and</v>

2156
01:42:22.151 --> 01:42:24.370
<v Speaker 1>they contain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many instances,</v>

2157
01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:29.050
<v Speaker 1>anabolic steroids in all instances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compounds which would cause our athletes</v>

2158
01:42:29.051 --> 01:42:30.730
<v Speaker 1>to test positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

2159
01:42:30.731 --> 01:42:33.250

<v Speaker 1>There's that many of these things.</v>

2160
01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Here it is right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

2161
01:42:34.630 --> 01:42:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Supplement four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one one.</v>

2162
01:42:35.891 --> 01:42:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize and reduce.</v>

2163
01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:40.000
<v Speaker 1>So if you scroll down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scroll Down Syndrome list,</v>

2164
01:42:40.330 --> 01:42:41.710
<v Speaker 1>keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

2165
01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:46.740
<v Speaker 1>go back up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>High risk list there on the left high </v>

2166
01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:47.890
<v Speaker 1>risk supplement products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to have to enter?</v>

2167
01:42:47.891 --> 01:42:51.490

<v Speaker 1>Put Joe's name and there you have to put</v>

2168
01:42:51.491 --> 01:42:52.590
<v Speaker 1>it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were searching.</v>

2169
01:42:53.110 --> 01:42:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ya know,</v>

2170
01:42:54.570 --> 01:42:59.570
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind that is actually a </v>

2171
01:42:59.570 --> 01:43:01.270
<v Speaker 1>protection of the athlete so that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>went in there,</v>

2172
01:43:01.410 --> 01:43:06.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you put your name in and then later </v>

2173
01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:06.410
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2174
01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I went and searched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2175
01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:09.420
<v Speaker 1>you saw it as site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2176
01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:11.830
<v Speaker 1>there will be a record of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you haven't searched that.</v>

2177
01:43:13.330 --> 01:43:15.640
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's see what we got here.</v>

2178
01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:17.660
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got it.</v>

2179
01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:21.710
<v Speaker 4>What do we got?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these different.</v>

2180
01:43:24.450 --> 01:43:26.840
<v Speaker 1>You're scrolling down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but scroll the page down for.</v>

2181
01:43:26.841 --> 01:43:28.950
<v Speaker 1>So we get a full screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there you go.</v>

2182
01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Zero liquid and that stuff has got dag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A product contains a list of prohibited </v>

2183
01:43:38.371 --> 01:43:43.371
<v Speaker 1>substance label lists a prohibited </v>
<v Speaker 1>substance product contains prohibitive </v>

2184
01:43:43.371 --> 01:43:47.370
<v Speaker 1>in testing revealed presence of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrew [inaudible] dial.</v>

2185
01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:48.990
<v Speaker 1>And that stuff's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now though,</v>

2186
01:43:48.991 --> 01:43:53.991
<v Speaker 1>isn't it interesting that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>prohormones he used to be able to sell </v>

2187
01:43:53.991 --> 01:43:53.991
<v Speaker 1>those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>

2188
01:43:53.991 --> 01:43:55.490
<v Speaker 1>It was a new law passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was late last year,</v>

2189
01:43:55.491 --> 01:43:56.960
<v Speaker 1>early this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the designer,</v>

2190
01:43:57.050 --> 01:44:02.050
<v Speaker 1>anabolic steroid control act or Baska </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it basically made it easier to </v>

2191
01:44:02.091 --> 01:44:06.260
<v Speaker 1>quantify some of these designer drugs as</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids and took a whole bunch of known</v>

2192
01:44:06.261 --> 01:44:08.570
<v Speaker 1>ones that weren't on the steroid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2193
01:44:08.630 --> 01:44:11.090
<v Speaker 1>List yet and converted them to control </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sepsis,</v>

2194
01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:14.750
<v Speaker 1>but here we're still only at the aes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>product name on the list.</v>

2195
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:17.150
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2196
01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:18.470
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>

2197
01:44:18.530 --> 01:44:21.950
<v Speaker 1>A lot of xander's teen dial up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2198
01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:24.470
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2199
01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:27.860
<v Speaker 1>It used to be just a few years ago that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could basically.</v>

2200
01:44:27.861 --> 01:44:29.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess more than a decade ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2201
01:44:29.691 --> 01:44:32.180
<v Speaker 1>but you could basically buy steroids </v>
<v Speaker 1>from like GNC.</v>

2202
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean the stuff that they had was oral </v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids.</v>

2203
01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there still some of these out there?</v>

2204
01:44:36.801 --> 01:44:41.801
<v Speaker 1>They've just become more designers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just look at the fucking list of </v>

2205
01:44:42.351 --> 01:44:44.360
<v Speaker 1>prohibited substance in this Angel Dust </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2206
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2207
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we'll.</v>

2208
01:44:48.241 --> 01:44:50.000
<v Speaker 1>We'll leave it to anybody who wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look into this.</v>

2209
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our athletes,</v>

2210
01:44:51.501 --> 01:44:53.360
<v Speaker 1>we're constantly directing them toward </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2211
01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Obviously if it's on this list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take it,</v>

2212
01:44:55.251 --> 01:44:58.490
<v Speaker 1>but there's hundreds of others that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't on that list.</v>

2213
01:44:58.491 --> 01:45:00.680
<v Speaker 1>They only have so much time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources to buy these.</v>

2214
01:45:00.681 --> 01:45:04.730
<v Speaker 1>They they could probably hire another </v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three phds and by these full time</v>

2215
01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:06.890
<v Speaker 1>and triple or quadruple that list.</v>

2216
01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:07.810
<v Speaker 1>That is mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2217
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:12.870
<v Speaker 1>the industry that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an athlete go into a vitamin store </v>

2218
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:13.070
<v Speaker 1>and just buying a bunch of these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the counter.</v>

2219
01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:16.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a very good possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get an actual steroids and</v>

2220
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I'd be very concerned and that's where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we pass it along to them.</v>

2221
01:45:20.511 --> 01:45:25.511
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't be concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the story that you told about the </v>

2222
01:45:25.511 --> 01:45:26.330
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is really disturbing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that if they cleaned it at</v>

2223
01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.130
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would it be possible?</v>

2224
01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:33.140
<v Speaker 1>These trace amounts would get into these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's vitamins to the point where </v>

2225
01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:33.800
<v Speaker 1>they're getting sick from liver damage </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's toxic.</v>

2226
01:45:33.810 --> 01:45:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they obviously didn't do a good job and </v>

2227
01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:38.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean it at all.</v>

2228
01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:39.590
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2229
01:45:39.591 --> 01:45:44.591
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the dietary laws in here in the </v>

2230
01:45:44.591 --> 01:45:46.010
<v Speaker 1>United States and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for foods and dietary supplements,</v>

2231
01:45:46.011 --> 01:45:48.800
<v Speaker 1>there's no premarket review of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>product,</v>

2232
01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:50.420
<v Speaker 1>so you and I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

2233
01:45:50.421 --> 01:45:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I think the bells you had on last week </v>
<v Speaker 1>as part of bigger,</v>

2234
01:45:52.731 --> 01:45:53.540
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

2235
01:45:53.541 --> 01:45:57.170
<v Speaker 1>did a little piece on what the dietary </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement industry is.</v>

2236
01:45:57.170 --> 01:46:02.170
<v Speaker 1>And I think he hired a couple people off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the street to make supplements and </v>

2237
01:46:02.170 --> 01:46:02.720
<v Speaker 1>showed you could put them right to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shop.</v>

2238
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:07.070
<v Speaker 1>That's accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's up to the FDA after the fact,</v>

2239
01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:12.880
<v Speaker 1>after something's already been on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelf after probably somebody's already </v>

2240
01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:16.781
<v Speaker 1>got sick or hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you have somebody in the FDA </v>

2241
01:46:16.781 --> 01:46:16.940
<v Speaker 1>being very proactive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'll tell you,</v>

2242
01:46:16.941 --> 01:46:18.740
<v Speaker 1>coming from the FDA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not proactive.</v>

2243
01:46:18.741 --> 01:46:21.230
<v Speaker 1>They're reactive agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2244
01:46:21.231 --> 01:46:26.231
<v Speaker 1>that typically either a complaint has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be made or somebody gets hurt before </v>

2245
01:46:26.391 --> 01:46:29.480
<v Speaker 1>they go out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enforce what the law is.</v>

2246
01:46:29.481 --> 01:46:31.460
<v Speaker 1>That product shouldn't be at the show on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shelf.</v>

2247
01:46:31.461 --> 01:46:34.190
<v Speaker 1>They need to do a much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much better job.</v>

2248
01:46:34.191 --> 01:46:38.330
<v Speaker 1>And especially in my position now where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this group of athletes,</v>

2249
01:46:38.331 --> 01:46:42.650
<v Speaker 1>which I feel very fatherly over a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would call on the FDA to,</v>

2250
01:46:42.651 --> 01:46:43.610
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2251
01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:47.030
<v Speaker 1>a way better job than what I saw was </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening on the inside.</v>

2252
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:49.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly regulatory.</v>

2253
01:46:49.741 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I was</v>

2254
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.980
<v Speaker 2>on the criminal side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have a huge population of </v>

2255
01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:58.311
<v Speaker 2>regulatory employees that they could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a much better job in managing and </v>

2256
01:46:58.801 --> 01:47:00.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and taking these products off the shelf.</v>

2257
01:47:01.610 --> 01:47:04.770
<v Speaker 2>It just seems almost like there's no way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep up with.</v>

2258
01:47:04.771 --> 01:47:09.771
<v Speaker 2>And if there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you looked at so many different </v>

2259
01:47:09.771 --> 01:47:12.111
<v Speaker 2>supplements right there that just were </v>
<v Speaker 2>the letter a and how many of them all </v>

2260
01:47:12.181 --> 01:47:14.250
<v Speaker 2>told that they have on their list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

2261
01:47:14.251 --> 01:47:15.980
<v Speaker 2>you can answer that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>

2262
01:47:15.981 --> 01:47:16.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you say it,</v>

2263
01:47:16.801 --> 01:47:19.980
<v Speaker 2>is there a number that shows how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have now?</v>

2264
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:21.810
<v Speaker 2>These were all even just tested this </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

2265
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:25.530
<v Speaker 2>She's been doing that for a period of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2266
01:47:25.531 --> 01:47:27.730
<v Speaker 2>that's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2267
01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd heard about that before from </v>

2268
01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:33.480
<v Speaker 2>athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've all heard,</v>

2269
01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:33.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he,</v>

2270
01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:38.360
<v Speaker 2>he took a supplement and it turned out </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a banned substance in it and </v>

2271
01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:43.161
<v Speaker 2>inadvertently tested positive for </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids and a lot of times you think </v>

2272
01:47:43.161 --> 01:47:43.320
<v Speaker 2>they're full of shit and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>their excuse.</v>

2273
01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:48.320
<v Speaker 2>But Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at it a different way right </v>

2274
01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.980
<v Speaker 2>now because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no doubt concerning.</v>

2275
01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Now what about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it possible that one of these things </v>

2276
01:47:55.700 --> 01:48:00.240
<v Speaker 2>like an Hvac machine or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or altitude training,</v>

2277
01:48:00.241 --> 01:48:05.241
<v Speaker 2>or is it possible that one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things will eventually be so effective </v>

2278
01:48:05.241 --> 01:48:06.450
<v Speaker 2>that you guys are going to have to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about banning that as well?</v>

2279
01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're,</v>

2280
01:48:07.770 --> 01:48:11.250
<v Speaker 2>we're following the law prohibited lists</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Wada prohibited methods.</v>

2281
01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:14.100
<v Speaker 2>So it ultimately would be if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if water decided this,</v>

2282
01:48:14.101 --> 01:48:17.370
<v Speaker 2>it would fall under our program and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually under our program,</v>

2283
01:48:17.630 --> 01:48:18.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2284
01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:23.190
<v Speaker 2>I think we'd have the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>evaluate it and determine whether or not</v>

2285
01:48:23.191 --> 01:48:24.780
<v Speaker 2>we wanted to adopt it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We likely would,</v>

2286
01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:27.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the gold standard and you know,</v>

2287
01:48:27.650 --> 01:48:31.050
<v Speaker 2>they're not just arbitrarily throwing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things out there that that wouldn't give</v>

2288
01:48:31.051 --> 01:48:34.160
<v Speaker 2>someone an unfair advantage to put on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their prohibited lists.</v>

2289
01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:36.120
<v Speaker 2>So we'd fall along likely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

2290
01:48:36.121 --> 01:48:41.121
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I really wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make sure I talked to you about </v>

2291
01:48:41.121 --> 01:48:42.630
<v Speaker 2>because it was one that really raised my</v>
<v Speaker 2>eyebrows when we're talking in Brazil is</v>

2292
01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:48.080
<v Speaker 2>gene doping and it seems like we are at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this very strange point when it comes to</v>

2293
01:48:49.771 --> 01:48:53.050
<v Speaker 2>technology and innovation that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

2294
01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:58.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're more than a decade</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from doing something very bizarre </v>

2295
01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:02.601
<v Speaker 2>to human bodies where it might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>undetectable or might be so prevalent </v>

2296
01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:06.080
<v Speaker 2>that it might change the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

2297
01:49:06.130 --> 01:49:11.130
<v Speaker 2>you're aware of crispr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know about the innovation that </v>

2298
01:49:11.130 --> 01:49:14.031
<v Speaker 2>they created in 2012 called Crispr?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That allows them to much more </v>

2299
01:49:14.031 --> 01:49:18.180
<v Speaker 2>efficiently manipulate genes and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it mostly,</v>

2300
01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:22.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're testing it in non viable embryos</v>

2301
01:49:22.591 --> 01:49:27.000
<v Speaker 2>in China and they're doing it in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>different animals and different things.</v>

2302
01:49:27.001 --> 01:49:31.140
<v Speaker 2>But the idea being that within a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of time,</v>

2303
01:49:31.170 --> 01:49:36.120
<v Speaker 2>it's just undoubtedly going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that they experiment with with</v>

2304
01:49:36.121 --> 01:49:37.500
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2305
01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:41.910
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who knows someone that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

2306
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000
<v Speaker 2>They were traveling to the Middle East </v>
<v Speaker 2>where in this one lab they were </v>

2307
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.610
<v Speaker 2>performing these tests</v>

2308
01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:52.120
<v Speaker 3>where they were going to make it so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could determine.</v>

2309
01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:54.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is.</v>

2310
01:49:54.161 --> 01:49:57.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the preliminary stages and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it is,</v>

2311
01:49:58.340 --> 01:50:01.360
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't been totally proven that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective,</v>

2312
01:50:01.690 --> 01:50:02.860
<v Speaker 3>but they're gonna be able to manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2313
01:50:02.861 --> 01:50:05.170
<v Speaker 3>I call her think I'm going to build,</v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulate sex,</v>

2314
01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:07.150
<v Speaker 3>change the hair color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna,</v>

2315
01:50:07.151 --> 01:50:09.370
<v Speaker 3>be able to do all sorts of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things to,</v>

2316
01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:15.060
<v Speaker 3>to the baby in the embryonic stage to </v>
<v Speaker 3>change what they are as adults.</v>

2317
01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:20.580
<v Speaker 3>And the idea of creating a super athlete</v>
<v Speaker 3>through genetic manipulation is not that</v>

2318
01:50:21.671 --> 01:50:22.240
<v Speaker 3>far away.</v>

2319
01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:24.370
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2320
01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:29.560
<v Speaker 1>I know anti-doping when they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>together many times during the year and </v>

2321
01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.310
<v Speaker 1>have their conferences and bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>together leading scientists.</v>

2322
01:50:31.311 --> 01:50:33.590
<v Speaker 1>It's almost always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2323
01:50:33.591 --> 01:50:37.460
<v Speaker 1>one or two hour block on where gene </v>
<v Speaker 1>doping is going,</v>

2324
01:50:37.461 --> 01:50:40.310
<v Speaker 1>where it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was it now I don't,</v>

2325
01:50:40.530 --> 01:50:42.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the technicalities of where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is now,</v>

2326
01:50:42.981 --> 01:50:45.680
<v Speaker 1>how close athletes are doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God,</v>

2327
01:50:45.681 --> 01:50:47.540
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk about taking a risk,</v>

2328
01:50:47.541 --> 01:50:51.020
<v Speaker 1>one thing to take a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're manipulating your gene,</v>

2329
01:50:51.021 --> 01:50:52.370
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2330
01:50:53.070 --> 01:50:56.120
<v Speaker 1>and shoot one or two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that's gonna do to you.</v>

2331
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:59.120
<v Speaker 1>It feels like an x men movie though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that?</v>

2332
01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:00.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like Jurassic Park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2333
01:51:00.650 --> 01:51:04.010
<v Speaker 1>or getting out of control real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm mostly that happening.</v>

2334
01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:07.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about Wolverine Guy Heels </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and saying,</v>

2335
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:08.680
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2336
01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:13.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean Jurassic Park Wolverine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I mean I just feel like there </v>

2337
01:51:15.070 --> 01:51:17.560
<v Speaker 3>people are gonna be the first to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>the leap.</v>

2338
01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:20.260
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be someone or some </v>
<v Speaker 3>government or</v>

2339
01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:25.300
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be the bodybuilding </v>

2340
01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:27.310
<v Speaker 1>community and every drug that I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>used in athletics,</v>

2341
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:29.330
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti benefits,</v>

2342
01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.610
<v Speaker 1>that is the community that always tries </v>
<v Speaker 1>at first.</v>

2343
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are willing to risk anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it get bigger or die trying?</v>

2344
01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Kind of the motto that is very common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2345
01:51:40.730 --> 01:51:43.970
<v Speaker 1>saw it firsthand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're willing to try and be the Guinea</v>

2346
01:51:43.971 --> 01:51:46.490
<v Speaker 1>pig for anything and they'll still get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit bigger,</v>

2347
01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:49.250
<v Speaker 1>die young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of those guys.</v>

2348
01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:53.540
<v Speaker 1>They're usually the ones that refine how</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drugs are taken to determine,</v>

2349
01:51:53.541 --> 01:51:54.350
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2350
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:55.840
<v Speaker 1>even though it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2351
01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:59.300
<v Speaker 1>marketed or promoted for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually we'll do this for you as well.</v>

2352
01:51:59.810 --> 01:52:04.810
<v Speaker 1>And saw that firsthand where non </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding athletes would rely on </v>

2353
01:52:05.151 --> 01:52:08.660
<v Speaker 1>advice from them of how to do it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the effects were.</v>

2354
01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they turn over again,</v>

2355
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:11.540
<v Speaker 1>saw that insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2356
01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is super dangerous,</v>

2357
01:52:13.581 --> 01:52:18.581
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No doubt that make you a diabetic real </v>

2358
01:52:18.581 --> 01:52:18.581
<v Speaker 1>quick</v>

2359
01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:24.940
<v Speaker 3>myostatin inhibitors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's something that I have been </v>

2360
01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:27.080
<v Speaker 3>fascinated ever since I saw a photo of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those whippets that have that genetic.</v>

2361
01:52:27.310 --> 01:52:32.310
<v Speaker 3>It just an aberration in the whippets </v>
<v Speaker 3>from breeding and they've been able to </v>

2362
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:35.870
<v Speaker 3>manipulate cows and pigs and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and cause it to happen now.</v>

2363
01:52:36.230 --> 01:52:39.110
<v Speaker 3>And pigs I think are the latest ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been able to do it to where they</v>

2364
01:52:39.111 --> 01:52:44.111
<v Speaker 3>have double muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen some of those photos and sane </v>

2365
01:52:44.111 --> 01:52:47.530
<v Speaker 3>and they've been able to do it to mice </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the fucked up thing about mice as </v>

2366
01:52:47.530 --> 01:52:50.831
<v Speaker 3>they live longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have doubled their lifespan I </v>

2367
01:52:50.831 --> 01:52:50.840
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they look awesome.</v>

2368
01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Beach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look like Kevin Randleman mice.</v>

2369
01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:57.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>

2370
01:52:57.940 --> 01:53:00.830
<v Speaker 3>what's going to happen when that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes its way into mma?</v>

2371
01:53:00.831 --> 01:53:01.610
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

2372
01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my guessing an anti doping is is </v>

2373
01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:09.550
<v Speaker 1>you're going to at some point get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some type of gene testing and the </v>

2374
01:53:09.550 --> 01:53:13.801
<v Speaker 1>ability to look at human genes and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they'd been manipulated,</v>

2375
01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:15.700
<v Speaker 1>manipulated or inhibited.</v>

2376
01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:18.880
<v Speaker 3>But what if someone has a natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulation?</v>

2377
01:53:18.881 --> 01:53:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a boy that was born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's been more than one person,</v>

2378
01:53:22.031 --> 01:53:27.031
<v Speaker 3>but I know of one that was born in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany that has that same issue that </v>

2379
01:53:27.031 --> 01:53:28.990
<v Speaker 3>these cows have and these whippets have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this young boy,</v>

2380
01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:31.090
<v Speaker 3>there he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

2381
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:33.310
<v Speaker 3>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not real.</v>

2382
01:53:33.311 --> 01:53:34.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

2383
01:53:34.150 --> 01:53:36.730
<v Speaker 3>Is that real way to scroll up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scroll up.</v>

2384
01:53:36.731 --> 01:53:41.731
<v Speaker 3>Don't hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How genetic engineering to make us look </v>

2385
01:53:41.731 --> 01:53:41.731
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bodybuilders naturally it.</v>

2386
01:53:41.731 --> 01:53:43.570
<v Speaker 3>Just scroll down so it can hear what </v>
<v Speaker 3>she.</v>

2387
01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:49.380
<v Speaker 3>In past posts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll look into this because this might </v>

2388
01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:52.771
<v Speaker 3>be bullshit because that's Chris Bell </v>
<v Speaker 3>right there posing with that cow that's </v>

2389
01:53:52.771 --> 01:53:52.771
<v Speaker 3>from bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>

2390
01:53:52.771 --> 01:53:52.771
<v Speaker 3>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find.</v>

2391
01:53:52.771 --> 01:53:57.510
<v Speaker 3>Find out if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I know there was a young boy </v>

2392
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:58.240
<v Speaker 3>looked different than that because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked like a kid with an adult arm.</v>

2393
01:53:58.750 --> 01:54:01.560
<v Speaker 3>The other one looked like a kid that had</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a six pack.</v>

2394
01:54:01.590 --> 01:54:03.040
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really bizarre.</v>

2395
01:54:03.041 --> 01:54:08.041
<v Speaker 3>He had really thick leg muscles and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were saying that this child was </v>

2396
01:54:08.041 --> 01:54:11.950
<v Speaker 3>born without that gene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean myostatin inhibitor gene and that</v>

2397
01:54:12.490 --> 01:54:14.770
<v Speaker 3>this is something that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be him.</v>

2398
01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:16.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Myostatin muscle.</v>

2399
01:54:16.130 --> 01:54:17.290
<v Speaker 3>Her looks real like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

2400
01:54:17.291 --> 01:54:20.050
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't look real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kid is fucking shredded.</v>

2401
01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:21.580
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a six pack.</v>

2402
01:54:21.850 --> 01:54:26.850
<v Speaker 3>That's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks like he's got a turtle shell </v>

2403
01:54:26.850 --> 01:54:26.850
<v Speaker 3>grown out of his stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

2404
01:54:27.130 --> 01:54:30.580
<v Speaker 3>That kid is going to be a stud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you do with a kid like that?</v>

2405
01:54:30.581 --> 01:54:32.200
<v Speaker 3>If a kid like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once it compete in the UFC,</v>

2406
01:54:32.201 --> 01:54:32.770
<v Speaker 3>do you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2407
01:54:32.771 --> 01:54:35.050
<v Speaker 3>you're a mutant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to compete in the x games.</v>

2408
01:54:35.490 --> 01:54:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2409
01:54:37.050 --> 01:54:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I always liked seeing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that genetic freak of nature that comes </v>

2410
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:46.221
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone Herschel Walker or even like a </v>

2411
01:54:46.221 --> 01:54:49.311
<v Speaker 1>babe ruth who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a boiler on him that was obviously </v>

2412
01:54:49.311 --> 01:54:49.311
<v Speaker 1>strong as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe one of these.</v>

2413
01:54:49.311 --> 01:54:54.250
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those cool people that come along once </v>

2414
01:54:54.250 --> 01:54:57.051
<v Speaker 1>every generation and everybody can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind because I know in there knowing </v>

2415
01:54:57.051 --> 01:54:57.051
<v Speaker 1>that that's real.</v>

2416
01:54:57.051 --> 01:54:58.220
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's real,</v>

2417
01:54:58.221 --> 01:55:01.490
<v Speaker 3>but it's also a genetic freak accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2418
01:55:01.491 --> 01:55:04.760
<v Speaker 3>he is definitely a real kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he didn't,</v>

2419
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:07.760
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't born as far as we know it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't created in a lab,</v>

2420
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:10.850
<v Speaker 3>but he has some sort of a freak </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage.</v>

2421
01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Like it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Lebron James is a genetic freak </v>

2422
01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:16.280
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Izzy.</v>

2423
01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one could argue that.</v>

2424
01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2425
01:55:16.501 --> 01:55:18.900
<v Speaker 1>you absolutely can and you would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2426
01:55:19.290 --> 01:55:24.290
<v Speaker 1>but he's not competing and fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that that is a little bit more </v>

2427
01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:24.790
<v Speaker 1>extreme there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2428
01:55:24.810 --> 01:55:29.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously he's going to be able </v>

2429
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:30.630
<v Speaker 1>to show through medical records that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been that way.</v>

2430
01:55:30.631 --> 01:55:35.631
<v Speaker 1>And all through his life and didn't just</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly appear when he was 16 and did </v>

2431
01:55:35.631 --> 01:55:40.370
<v Speaker 1>manipulate his jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean I guess you can show that was </v>

2432
01:55:40.370 --> 01:55:40.370
<v Speaker 1>his natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2433
01:55:40.370 --> 01:55:43.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the answer to that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a for your job,</v>

2434
01:55:43.170 --> 01:55:48.170
<v Speaker 1>it seems like there's like a window of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time for you to enact change before all </v>

2435
01:55:48.170 --> 01:55:52.971
<v Speaker 1>this crazy genetic shit starts rolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>in from China and Russia and who knows </v>

2436
01:55:52.971 --> 01:55:53.100
<v Speaker 1>where.</v>

2437
01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Not accusing China and Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have been known to do some </v>

2438
01:55:58.460 --> 01:55:59.130
<v Speaker 1>funky things in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2439
01:55:59.131 --> 01:56:00.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked at my last job,</v>

2440
01:56:00.901 --> 01:56:05.901
<v Speaker 1>I worked at the Air Mail facility at San</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco International Airport and part</v>

2441
01:56:06.661 --> 01:56:11.661
<v Speaker 1>of that job was to monitor everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in from China and the stuff that </v>

2442
01:56:12.091 --> 01:56:17.091
<v Speaker 1>came through there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my primary focus was on drugs and </v>

2443
01:56:17.091 --> 01:56:20.520
<v Speaker 1>raw product and compounds that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting into dietary supplements here.</v>

2444
01:56:20.521 --> 01:56:24.570
<v Speaker 1>But the majority of bad stuff going into</v>
<v Speaker 1>these supplements come in here.</v>

2445
01:56:24.571 --> 01:56:26.370
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From China.</v>

2446
01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:27.070
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2447
01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:28.950
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a lot of rules over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2448
01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:34.040
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's also scary than </v>

2449
01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:36.171
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing standards over there </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't good so that they'll send </v>

2450
01:56:36.171 --> 01:56:37.980
<v Speaker 1>something over to a US manufacturer here</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

2451
01:56:37.981 --> 01:56:42.981
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's in this product or this </v>

2452
01:56:42.981 --> 01:56:45.801
<v Speaker 1>raw compound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the US manufacturers take that at </v>

2453
01:56:45.801 --> 01:56:47.580
<v Speaker 1>its word and really not know what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going into his product.</v>

2454
01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:51.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's why often you see supplements</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't have on the label.</v>

2455
01:56:51.031 --> 01:56:56.031
<v Speaker 1>What's what's really in that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not cost effective for them to test </v>

2456
01:56:56.031 --> 01:56:58.290
<v Speaker 1>every batch and every lot that comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see a lot of that as well.</v>

2457
01:56:58.710 --> 01:57:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned from the Sopranos that most of</v>

2458
01:57:01.021 --> 01:57:06.021
<v Speaker 1>the shipping containers are coming to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States don't get tested and </v>

2459
01:57:06.021 --> 01:57:07.680
<v Speaker 1>true volume that comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be in pot,</v>

2460
01:57:07.710 --> 01:57:12.420
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to hire a million or 2 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people to inspect everything.</v>

2461
01:57:12.421 --> 01:57:15.360
<v Speaker 1>So they target things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the intelligently target,</v>

2462
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:20.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on what area is it comes from </v>

2463
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.870
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2464
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:21.750
<v Speaker 1>what is declared at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

2465
01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:26.700
<v Speaker 1>there's the percentage of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do get looked at and tested is,</v>

2466
01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:29.130
<v Speaker 1>is pretty low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just kind of disturbing.</v>

2467
01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:32.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing to consider that there's so</v>

2468
01:57:32.941 --> 01:57:35.450
<v Speaker 1>many shipping containers that are coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>in from somewhere like China,</v>

2469
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:38.790
<v Speaker 1>China on a daily basis and who knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>what could be possibly in them.</v>

2470
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Scary now as far as like what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>prohibited in band right now,</v>

2471
01:57:46.410 --> 01:57:48.960
<v Speaker 1>how many different things are prohibited</v>
<v Speaker 1>in band?</v>

2472
01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:54.560
<v Speaker 1>We could actually pull up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Water's got they're prohibited list </v>

2473
01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:58.150
<v Speaker 1>available and that's one of the cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about our policy is how </v>

2474
01:57:58.150 --> 01:58:00.480
<v Speaker 1>transparent it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that we're doing,</v>

2475
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:05.510
<v Speaker 1>our rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC rules are fighters can go look at </v>

2476
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:07.440
<v Speaker 1>their support personnel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can look at the public and go look at.</v>

2477
01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:10.050
<v Speaker 1>They can look at the water prohibited </v>
<v Speaker 1>lists,</v>

2478
01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:12.960
<v Speaker 1>the water prohibited method.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's out there for everyone to see.</v>

2479
01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are surprised at this,</v>

2480
01:58:17.881 --> 01:58:21.270
<v Speaker 1>but actually when we as our testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're testing now,</v>

2481
01:58:21.271 --> 01:58:23.460
<v Speaker 1>but it goes forward and starts really in</v>
<v Speaker 1>earnest.</v>

2482
01:58:23.461 --> 01:58:28.461
<v Speaker 1>You cited will start posting who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tested and how many times they're tested</v>

2483
01:58:28.890 --> 01:58:33.890
<v Speaker 1>by athlete name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the end of this year of public and </v>

2484
01:58:33.890 --> 01:58:37.791
<v Speaker 1>pull up the USADA UFC websites who ufc </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter a was tested eight times UFC </v>

2485
01:58:38.101 --> 01:58:38.400
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>

2486
01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Be They were tested three times total </v>
<v Speaker 1>transparency and that's done.</v>

2487
01:58:43.541 --> 01:58:48.541
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go back to what we talked about </v>

2488
01:58:48.541 --> 01:58:48.541
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust and credibility of the system.</v>

2489
01:58:48.541 --> 01:58:49.000
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's paramount.</v>

2490
01:58:49.001 --> 01:58:52.810
<v Speaker 1>It's huge for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For you to be able to say,</v>

2491
01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:58.140
<v Speaker 1>we're not hiding anything here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all out in the open what we're </v>

2492
01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:58.140
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that athlete,</v>

2493
01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:03.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't really think you know </v>

2494
01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:03.630
<v Speaker 1>what's going on or I think this has got </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

2495
01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:07.330
<v Speaker 1>it's all out there in the open for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look exactly what we're doing is.</v>

2496
01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:12.390
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that people found </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing about the Anderson Silva </v>

2497
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:15.301
<v Speaker 1>allegations was that it was revealed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he would never been tested outside </v>

2498
01:59:15.301 --> 01:59:18.520
<v Speaker 1>of competition except this one time </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we tested negative for most of our</v>

2499
01:59:18.521 --> 01:59:21.310
<v Speaker 1>athletes fall under that same </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance.</v>

2500
01:59:21.311 --> 01:59:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevada California started doing it too.</v>

2501
01:59:24.851 --> 01:59:29.851
<v Speaker 1>It was probably the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe New Jersey where they </v>

2502
01:59:29.851 --> 01:59:31.981
<v Speaker 1>would do what we call enhanced testing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they would maybe take the top two </v>

2503
01:59:31.981 --> 01:59:35.590
<v Speaker 1>or three fights on a card and go out for</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe six weeks.</v>

2504
01:59:35.710 --> 01:59:39.970
<v Speaker 1>That was the extent of any out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition tests,</v>

2505
01:59:40.290 --> 01:59:41.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we educate,</v>

2506
01:59:41.650 --> 01:59:46.030
<v Speaker 1>we're going out to different gyms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're educating the fight cards,</v>

2507
01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:48.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Wednesday before Saturday fight.</v>

2508
01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:49.990
<v Speaker 1>We usually ask the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2509
01:59:49.991 --> 01:59:52.080
<v Speaker 1>who's been tested other than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2510
01:59:52.090 --> 01:59:56.200
<v Speaker 1>a day of competition test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few hands go up,</v>

2511
01:59:56.590 --> 01:59:58.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a couple per session.</v>

2512
01:59:58.930 --> 02:00:00.130
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2513
02:00:00.131 --> 02:00:01.360
<v Speaker 1>in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2514
02:00:01.361 --> 02:00:03.460
<v Speaker 1>understanding why an athlete will do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2515
02:00:03.461 --> 02:00:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're not testing anybody,</v>

2516
02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>unless it's on the day of the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really just an Iq test as long </v>

2517
02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:13.630
<v Speaker 1>as you're smart enough to know how fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>a drug a clear your system,</v>

2518
02:00:13.631 --> 02:00:16.900
<v Speaker 1>you could easily use drugs in the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get off,</v>

2519
02:00:16.901 --> 02:00:17.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2520
02:00:17.601 --> 02:00:22.601
<v Speaker 1>a week or two ahead of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have them clear system and maintain the </v>

2521
02:00:22.601 --> 02:00:24.400
<v Speaker 1>benefits of those drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them through the fight.</v>

2522
02:00:24.401 --> 02:00:26.650
<v Speaker 1>So is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it any surprise,</v>

2523
02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y,</v>

2524
02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:33.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're risking your </v>

2525
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:34.120
<v Speaker 1>health and in some arguments your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're getting in that octagon,</v>

2526
02:00:34.121 --> 02:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>is it any surprise why a lot of athletes</v>
<v Speaker 1>have made that under really?</v>

2527
02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:39.580
<v Speaker 1>No testing in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not to me,</v>

2528
02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:42.580
<v Speaker 1>but a guy like Anderson Silva who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>widely considered to be,</v>

2529
02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:47.640
<v Speaker 1>if not the greatest of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the top two or three grants of </v>

2530
02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:51.391
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he was only tested once </v>

2531
02:00:51.391 --> 02:00:51.730
<v Speaker 1>out of competition and failed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

2532
02:00:51.731 --> 02:00:53.560
<v Speaker 1>that's really disturbing to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2533
02:00:53.561 --> 02:00:54.170
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2534
02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:59.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at these spectacular </v>

2535
02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:01.141
<v Speaker 1>performances that he was able to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what he was under or on when </v>

2536
02:01:01.751 --> 02:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>he pulled those off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2537
02:01:03.791 --> 02:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not just,</v>

2538
02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:06.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taints the legacy.</v>

2539
02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Looking at him individually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2540
02:01:08.321 --> 02:01:10.360
<v Speaker 1>you extrapolate that out with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2541
02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the sport that likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2542
02:01:13.191 --> 02:01:18.191
<v Speaker 1>if he wasn't tested out of competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about the other 549 behind him if </v>

2543
02:01:18.611 --> 02:01:20.650
<v Speaker 1>he's at the top of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you extrapolate that out.</v>

2544
02:01:20.651 --> 02:01:21.310
<v Speaker 1>It's scary.</v>

2545
02:01:21.850 --> 02:01:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a,</v>

2546
02:01:23.681 --> 02:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see real quick here.</v>

2547
02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it though early on is,</v>

2548
02:01:29.111 --> 02:01:30.730
<v Speaker 1>and then thank you for this platform </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

2549
02:01:30.731 --> 02:01:34.510
<v Speaker 1>but just getting the message out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being that deterrent effect upfront.</v>

2550
02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having those athletes and support look </v>

2551
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>now saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2552
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:41.120
<v Speaker 1>the game's changed now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no longer,</v>

2553
02:01:41.121 --> 02:01:43.610
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be tested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't trust that your opponents.</v>

2554
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Now the game's changed that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>using every method and tool available.</v>

2555
02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:52.430
<v Speaker 1>They're using blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>urine testing for specific drugs.</v>

2556
02:01:52.610 --> 02:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at a biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>passport.</v>

2557
02:01:54.711 --> 02:01:57.650
<v Speaker 1>So if a specific drug doesn't show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could catch somebody that way.</v>

2558
02:01:57.651 --> 02:02:02.651
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're freezing our blood and urine </v>

2559
02:02:02.651 --> 02:02:04.780
<v Speaker 1>that if the test isn't available today </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe in a year or two and they'll </v>

2560
02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>go back and test that and then maybe if </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not fighting,</v>

2561
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>my legacy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is done.</v>

2562
02:02:08.210 --> 02:02:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully everybody's hearing all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we're doing a hearing me </v>

2563
02:02:13.210 --> 02:02:16.451
<v Speaker 1>talk about experiences I've had with </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes in the past about how damn </v>

2564
02:02:16.451 --> 02:02:20.711
<v Speaker 1>stressful it's going to be for a UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete right now to use drugs and get </v>

2565
02:02:20.711 --> 02:02:20.711
<v Speaker 1>away with it.</v>

2566
02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>They are going to be thinking about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 slash seven.</v>

2567
02:02:23.991 --> 02:02:26.390
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you a shit who's coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

2568
02:02:26.410 --> 02:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long do I got for this clears my </v>

2569
02:02:31.410 --> 02:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I trust the person that's telling me</v>

2570
02:02:31.410 --> 02:02:33.920
<v Speaker 1>that all this shit's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening from now out in the hope would</v>

2571
02:02:33.921 --> 02:02:38.570
<v Speaker 1>be being that determine up front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the decisions made on the front end.</v>

2572
02:02:38.571 --> 02:02:43.571
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't something that we can do now </v>

2573
02:02:43.571 --> 02:02:44.420
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to all of a sudden dozens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive tests on the back end.</v>

2574
02:02:44.421 --> 02:02:49.421
<v Speaker 1>The hope is I can get out and do a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough job of expressing how serious is </v>

2575
02:02:49.421 --> 02:02:52.010
<v Speaker 1>going to be that that our population of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter here that</v>

2576
02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:57.640
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about the difference between in </v>

2577
02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:59.560
<v Speaker 3>competition and the competition testing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and as far as like what the penalties </v>

2578
02:02:59.631 --> 02:03:04.631
<v Speaker 3>are for added competition testing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what about recreational drugs in </v>

2579
02:03:04.631 --> 02:03:05.990
<v Speaker 3>competition?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a competition.</v>

2580
02:03:05.991 --> 02:03:10.991
<v Speaker 3>Testing like John Jones tested positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>for cocaine and it was out of </v>

2581
02:03:10.991 --> 02:03:13.130
<v Speaker 3>competition so he was still allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>compete in.</v>

2582
02:03:13.131 --> 02:03:18.131
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people were kind of critical of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and like how is that possible that </v>

2583
02:03:18.131 --> 02:03:20.330
<v Speaker 3>you tested guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tests positive for a banned substance</v>

2584
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:22.670
<v Speaker 3>and yet he still allowed to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even hear about it,</v>

2585
02:03:22.671 --> 02:03:26.660
<v Speaker 3>but the results were known before he </v>
<v Speaker 3>fought and they never went public.</v>

2586
02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of different issues there.</v>

2587
02:03:28.871 --> 02:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>So let me one at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first our UFC policy,</v>

2588
02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>so out of competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the test for out of competition drugs,</v>

2589
02:03:36.311 --> 02:03:41.311
<v Speaker 1>those drugs are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those substances will be your hard </v>

2590
02:03:41.311 --> 02:03:41.311
<v Speaker 1>substances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your anabolic steroids,</v>

2591
02:03:41.311 --> 02:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>your human growth hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your blood doping type drugs,</v>

2592
02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:49.640
<v Speaker 1>those are tested for both out and in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are tested 365 days a year in </v>

2593
02:03:49.781 --> 02:03:54.781
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the definition of in competition </v>

2594
02:03:54.781 --> 02:03:54.781
<v Speaker 1>under our policy is six hours before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>weigh,</v>

2595
02:03:54.781 --> 02:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>in to six hours after the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During that period of time,</v>

2596
02:03:59.470 --> 02:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>the drugs tested will be your drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recreational drugs,</v>

2597
02:04:03.311 --> 02:04:06.160
<v Speaker 1>marijuana stimulants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including cocaine,</v>

2598
02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>other drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's only really a,</v>

2599
02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:14.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 48 hour so window that those will be </v>

2600
02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:16.540
<v Speaker 1>tested for those recreational drugs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not tested for at a competition.</v>

2601
02:04:16.930 --> 02:04:21.250
<v Speaker 1>And the John Jones situation that was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevada State Athletic Commission test,</v>

2602
02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:23.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the same rules at the time.</v>

2603
02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Drugs of abuse were to be tested for </v>
<v Speaker 1>only in competition.</v>

2604
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:30.040
<v Speaker 1>My understand drugs of abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean recreational drugs?</v>

2605
02:04:30.041 --> 02:04:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Racial drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

2606
02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some.</v>

2607
02:04:32.861 --> 02:04:37.861
<v Speaker 1>My understanding is somebody made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake and check the box to do </v>

2608
02:04:37.861 --> 02:04:40.560
<v Speaker 1>recreational drugs and an attic </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition collection.</v>

2609
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he wasn't supposed to be tested for </v>

2610
02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:45.950
<v Speaker 1>cocaine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2611
02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2612
02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:48.240
<v Speaker 1>their policy was not to test for </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>

2613
02:04:48.241 --> 02:04:50.520
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stimulants out of competition.</v>

2614
02:04:50.730 --> 02:04:55.410
<v Speaker 1>It was a mistake of checking a box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when it turns out positive,</v>

2615
02:04:55.500 --> 02:05:00.500
<v Speaker 1>he's not punished for it because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't supposed to test for it in the </v>

2616
02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:00.500
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my understanding.</v>

2617
02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2618
02:05:00.980 --> 02:05:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2619
02:05:02.010 --> 02:05:07.010
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like when any mistakes are made </v>

2620
02:05:07.010 --> 02:05:07.010
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2621
02:05:07.010 --> 02:05:07.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it was Nevada state athletic</v>

2622
02:05:07.711 --> 02:05:10.770
<v Speaker 1>commission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it taints the entire anti-doping,</v>

2623
02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:12.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arena.</v>

2624
02:05:12.181 --> 02:05:17.181
<v Speaker 1>I think anti-doping needs to be almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect because again,</v>

2625
02:05:17.581 --> 02:05:20.610
<v Speaker 1>going back to that trust and credibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>factor,</v>

2626
02:05:21.090 --> 02:05:26.090
<v Speaker 1>regardless of who's doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they make mistakes and anti-doping </v>

2627
02:05:26.090 --> 02:05:26.090
<v Speaker 1>like a false positive.</v>

2628
02:05:26.090 --> 02:05:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

2629
02:05:26.221 --> 02:05:31.020
<v Speaker 1>a false positive could never happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>because no one would ever trust anything</v>

2630
02:05:31.021 --> 02:05:33.520
<v Speaker 1>that's going on for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2631
02:05:33.690 --> 02:05:38.690
<v Speaker 1>mistakes like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>collection errors where the collectors </v>

2632
02:05:38.690 --> 02:05:43.161
<v Speaker 1>aren't going observing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have holes in the system and it </v>

2633
02:05:43.161 --> 02:05:43.260
<v Speaker 1>gets out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it matter who's doing it?</v>

2634
02:05:43.261 --> 02:05:48.261
<v Speaker 1>I think it taints all of anti-doping and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one of the reasons we went to </v>

2635
02:05:48.261 --> 02:05:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Usada is these guys have been in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>business longer than anybody else.</v>

2636
02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:56.360
<v Speaker 1>They're known as kind of the gold </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard entity and all the world they </v>

2637
02:05:56.491 --> 02:05:59.280
<v Speaker 1>are in that business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been doing it for 15 years.</v>

2638
02:05:59.281 --> 02:06:03.390
<v Speaker 1>They know what all the pitfalls are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they expect themselves to be perfect and</v>

2639
02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I think that's huge to lend that </v>
<v Speaker 1>credibility and trust to our athletes.</v>

2640
02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Nevada recently changed its levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable use of marijuana.</v>

2641
02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:16.710
<v Speaker 1>They changed the levels of acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and metabolites in the system.</v>

2642
02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:20.040
<v Speaker 1>What is it at now and what you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing with me in Brazil,</v>

2643
02:06:20.041 --> 02:06:25.041
<v Speaker 1>you were saying that you essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have to fight high in order to </v>

2644
02:06:25.041 --> 02:06:25.041
<v Speaker 1>test positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2645
02:06:25.041 --> 02:06:29.810
<v Speaker 1>likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Nevada adopted in terms of marijuana </v>

2646
02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:33.291
<v Speaker 1>with the water standard was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's 150 nanograms per milliliter </v>

2647
02:06:33.860 --> 02:06:38.860
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably doesn't mean much to most </v>

2648
02:06:38.860 --> 02:06:38.910
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to give you some perspective,</v>

2649
02:06:38.911 --> 02:06:42.360
<v Speaker 1>it used to be 15 nanograms per </v>
<v Speaker 1>milliliter.</v>

2650
02:06:42.810 --> 02:06:45.330
<v Speaker 1>So they've increased it 10 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 times.</v>

2651
02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2652
02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:49.440
<v Speaker 1>so you'd have to be under the influence </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're fighting.</v>

2653
02:06:50.070 --> 02:06:52.350
<v Speaker 1>It's tough because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we're out educating,</v>

2654
02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:54.780
<v Speaker 1>the next question we get is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2655
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:56.760
<v Speaker 1>how long would I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was a chronic smoker,</v>

2656
02:06:56.761 --> 02:07:01.290
<v Speaker 1>how long would it have to be off it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to say each individual varies</v>

2657
02:07:01.291 --> 02:07:06.291
<v Speaker 1>in terms of how they metabolize the fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>content on your body may store it </v>

2658
02:07:06.291 --> 02:07:09.921
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can't give our athletes guidance </v>

2659
02:07:09.921 --> 02:07:09.921
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2660
02:07:09.921 --> 02:07:11.790
<v Speaker 1>if you do it a week out or two days out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>

2661
02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only thing we can give them is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of what statistics have borne </v>

2662
02:07:17.260 --> 02:07:18.070
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2663
02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:21.330
<v Speaker 1>you sought as tested all their Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes.</v>

2664
02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Thousands now under this standard of 150</v>
<v Speaker 1>milligrams per milliliter over the last </v>

2665
02:07:28.410 --> 02:07:31.080
<v Speaker 1>couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've had very few positive tests.</v>

2666
02:07:31.081 --> 02:07:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2667
02:07:32.850 --> 02:07:35.550
<v Speaker 1>a couple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then along comes Nick Diaz</v>

2668
02:07:37.650 --> 02:07:41.500
<v Speaker 2>was under 150 nanogram per milliliter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stays at that point he was under,</v>

2669
02:07:41.980 --> 02:07:44.200
<v Speaker 2>but he's still tested positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was over.</v>

2670
02:07:44.201 --> 02:07:46.090
<v Speaker 2>That was over when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Andrea,</v>

2671
02:07:46.091 --> 02:07:47.440
<v Speaker 2>he fell under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2672
02:07:47.441 --> 02:07:48.880
<v Speaker 2>that standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was,</v>

2673
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:51.640
<v Speaker 2>what was his test results?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know specifically what it was.</v>

2674
02:07:51.641 --> 02:07:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have been over 150.</v>

2675
02:07:53.561 --> 02:07:57.880
<v Speaker 2>So he essentially fought high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably respect.</v>

2676
02:07:59.710 --> 02:08:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that you're not just fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson Silva.</v>

2677
02:08:01.991 --> 02:08:05.260
<v Speaker 2>You fighting them while you're stoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

2678
02:08:05.930 --> 02:08:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz is a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2679
02:08:09.070 --> 02:08:13.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't advise it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I respect it kinda crazy though,</v>

2680
02:08:13.001 --> 02:08:18.001
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That he could a fight in the UFC in the </v>

2681
02:08:18.001 --> 02:08:18.001
<v Speaker 2>main event like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2682
02:08:18.001 --> 02:08:18.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>

2683
02:08:18.730 --> 02:08:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I was a basketball player in college </v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball player and uh,</v>

2684
02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:22.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I played,</v>

2685
02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I had guys on my team that will get </v>
<v Speaker 2>stone before practice.</v>

2686
02:08:27.230 --> 02:08:30.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm dominate practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2687
02:08:30.070 --> 02:08:32.870
<v Speaker 2>People love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Jujitsu to Jujitsu.</v>

2688
02:08:32.890 --> 02:08:37.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge part of the Jujitsu world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many guys like you go to a lot of </v>

2689
02:08:37.890 --> 02:08:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu schools and you'll see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parking lot before,</v>

2690
02:08:38.591 --> 02:08:40.540
<v Speaker 2>but he goes into train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys are smoking pot.</v>

2691
02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:45.900
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very common because they feel like it </v>

2692
02:08:45.900 --> 02:08:47.700
<v Speaker 2>puts them in a zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My own personal experience I feel like </v>

2693
02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:48.010
<v Speaker 2>it does puts me in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a zone.</v>

2694
02:08:48.011 --> 02:08:53.011
<v Speaker 2>It makes me understand the techniques </v>
<v Speaker 2>better because you look more of a </v>

2695
02:08:53.011 --> 02:08:53.011
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity to training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2696
02:08:53.011 --> 02:08:57.511
<v Speaker 2>how about in the MMA world because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're worried about so many different </v>

2697
02:08:57.511 --> 02:09:00.961
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A strike a take that you got so many </v>

2698
02:09:00.961 --> 02:09:00.961
<v Speaker 2>things to worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2699
02:09:00.961 --> 02:09:04.641
<v Speaker 2>do you find that you're focusing in on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this one thing and you're not paying </v>

2700
02:09:04.641 --> 02:09:04.641
<v Speaker 2>attention to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2701
02:09:04.641 --> 02:09:04.870
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2702
02:09:04.871 --> 02:09:05.320
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2703
02:09:05.321 --> 02:09:07.210
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're not ready.</v>

2704
02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:07.690
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2705
02:09:07.710 --> 02:09:07.860
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

2706
02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:12.860
<v Speaker 3>I find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that it's not that good for </v>

2707
02:09:12.860 --> 02:09:15.591
<v Speaker 3>learning things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that when you're learning </v>

2708
02:09:15.591 --> 02:09:18.441
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially like if you're drilling </v>

2709
02:09:18.441 --> 02:09:19.680
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find drilling is better done sober.</v>

2710
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:21.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm better off at learning things </v>
<v Speaker 3>sober,</v>

2711
02:09:21.841 --> 02:09:25.050
<v Speaker 3>but once something is committed to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous system,</v>

2712
02:09:25.051 --> 02:09:28.440
<v Speaker 3>once I understand how to do the move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's certain positions,</v>

2713
02:09:28.670 --> 02:09:32.910
<v Speaker 3>there are certain positions that did </v>
<v Speaker 3>just fall into the way a Eddie Bravo is,</v>

2714
02:09:32.911 --> 02:09:34.890
<v Speaker 3>describes it best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love this analogy.</v>

2715
02:09:34.891 --> 02:09:36.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you tie your shoes,</v>

2716
02:09:36.421 --> 02:09:41.421
<v Speaker 3>you don't even think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just wish you just tie your shoes </v>

2717
02:09:41.421 --> 02:09:44.001
<v Speaker 3>because you've tied your shoes every day</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your whole life and it just becomes </v>

2718
02:09:44.001 --> 02:09:46.941
<v Speaker 3>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are certain positions where you </v>

2719
02:09:46.941 --> 02:09:48.771
<v Speaker 3>find yourself sinking into submission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even know what's happening </v>

2720
02:09:48.771 --> 02:09:52.641
<v Speaker 3>until you've done it because you've done</v>
<v Speaker 3>it so many times in drills that it just </v>

2721
02:09:52.641 --> 02:09:52.740
<v Speaker 3>becomes automatic.</v>

2722
02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Those are enhanced by marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the learning part,</v>

2723
02:09:56.910 --> 02:10:00.780
<v Speaker 3>I feel like sometimes you don't get all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the finer details,</v>

2724
02:10:00.781 --> 02:10:02.590
<v Speaker 3>but maybe that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2725
02:10:02.650 --> 02:10:07.650
<v Speaker 3>I think there's also the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>that everybody has their own different </v>

2726
02:10:07.650 --> 02:10:10.850
<v Speaker 3>way of experiencing marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biodiversity aspect of human beings.</v>

2727
02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:14.550
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people just don't like it at all.</v>

2728
02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:17.090
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that just can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll smoke a little pot and like,</v>

2729
02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:18.490
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just hate,</v>

2730
02:10:18.491 --> 02:10:21.030
<v Speaker 3>it freaks them out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't like doing anything on it.</v>

2731
02:10:21.210 --> 02:10:23.400
<v Speaker 3>And then other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like doing everything on it.</v>

2732
02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:27.210
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what other folks feel,</v>

2733
02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:30.750
<v Speaker 3>but for me I feel like I learn things </v>
<v Speaker 3>better when I'm not high,</v>

2734
02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:34.310
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like once I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I understand</v>

2735
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:35.500
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just become,</v>

2736
02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:40.920
<v Speaker 2>it's like a second nature thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I feel like I'm more tuned in if </v>

2737
02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:45.401
<v Speaker 2>that makes any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because there's the </v>

2738
02:10:45.401 --> 02:10:45.410
<v Speaker 2>argument out there from a lot like why </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that even band?</v>

2739
02:10:45.411 --> 02:10:48.110
<v Speaker 2>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is marijuana performance enhancing?</v>

2740
02:10:48.111 --> 02:10:49.730
<v Speaker 2>So it's interesting to hear you say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2741
02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I think it can be a performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drug.</v>

2742
02:10:52.101 --> 02:10:53.190
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2743
02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:58.200
<v Speaker 2>how bout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how bout deadening pits obviously used </v>

2744
02:10:58.200 --> 02:10:58.330
<v Speaker 2>for pain relief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think about it?</v>

2745
02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Could mask pain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly could.</v>

2746
02:11:00.110 --> 02:11:02.690
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not even,</v>

2747
02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:04.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not,</v>

2748
02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:06.270
<v Speaker 2>you're not sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

2749
02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:11.280
<v Speaker 2>the idea that anything that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>use that could possibly give you an </v>

2750
02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:13.100
<v Speaker 2>advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know it gives you an advantage.</v>

2751
02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Uses Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it does.</v>

2752
02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:20.290
<v Speaker 2>I know so many guys use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many guys roll with it like big name </v>

2753
02:11:20.290 --> 02:11:21.860
<v Speaker 2>guys that that are high level Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitors.</v>

2754
02:11:22.070 --> 02:11:27.070
<v Speaker 2>They train high every time and they love</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and I just think you can't ignore </v>

2755
02:11:27.070 --> 02:11:31.601
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's quite possible that </v>

2756
02:11:31.601 --> 02:11:33.380
<v Speaker 2>there's an advantage to using it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then the pain relief aspect of it.</v>

2757
02:11:33.650 --> 02:11:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't fight on pain pills or and if </v>

2758
02:11:38.650 --> 02:11:38.650
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was a pain blocker that allowed</v>

2759
02:11:38.650 --> 02:11:43.631
<v Speaker 2>you to not feel impacts of strikes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he just went out there and fought and </v>

2760
02:11:43.631 --> 02:11:44.720
<v Speaker 2>dealt with the consequences tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it wore off,</v>

2761
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:47.420
<v Speaker 2>that would be illegal for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2762
02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:51.740
<v Speaker 2>marijuana is absolutely used to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>people with pain management.</v>

2763
02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think it should be legal to </v>

2764
02:11:56.980 --> 02:11:56.980
<v Speaker 2>compete with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think I.</v>

2765
02:11:56.980 --> 02:12:01.511
<v Speaker 2>I think there's too many possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also don't think a lot of testing has </v>

2766
02:12:01.511 --> 02:12:04.220
<v Speaker 2>been done on the performance enhancing </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of marijuana,</v>

2767
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:08.900
<v Speaker 2>but what has been revealed recently is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefits that ultra marathon runners</v>

2768
02:12:08.901 --> 02:12:13.901
<v Speaker 2>experience with and marijuana that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can push through better put their mind </v>

2769
02:12:13.901 --> 02:12:14.300
<v Speaker 2>in a different place and not.</v>

2770
02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took this on the hours and hours of </v>

2771
02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:19.910
<v Speaker 2>monotony and I don't think you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignore that.</v>

2772
02:12:19.970 --> 02:12:20.400
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2773
02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I think that's certainly something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be considered and if you're going</v>

2774
02:12:24.861 --> 02:12:27.980
<v Speaker 2>to ban a lot of different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I liked marijuana.</v>

2775
02:12:27.981 --> 02:12:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm an enthusiastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that there's,</v>

2776
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:36.030
<v Speaker 2>there's absolutely potential that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be a performance enhancing drug </v>

2777
02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:38.720
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of ways I was people mocked me</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that for a long time,</v>

2778
02:12:38.721 --> 02:12:41.000
<v Speaker 2>but now that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these new studies are coming out,</v>

2779
02:12:41.001 --> 02:12:43.040
<v Speaker 2>especially with a ultra marathon </v>
<v Speaker 2>runners,</v>

2780
02:12:43.041 --> 02:12:46.490
<v Speaker 2>I feel vindicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel vindicated for you.</v>

2781
02:12:46.610 --> 02:12:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2782
02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:51.350
<v Speaker 2>is there anything else we should cover?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We pretty much nailed almost everything,</v>

2783
02:12:51.710 --> 02:12:54.590
<v Speaker 2>the comprehensive aspect of the drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing policy.</v>

2784
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:56.100
<v Speaker 2>The randomness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2785
02:12:56.101 --> 02:13:00.220
<v Speaker 2>I believe the top athletes are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be tested five times a year randomly.</v>

2786
02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:00.830
<v Speaker 2>So it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2787
02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:02.720
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you look the average with our</v>

2788
02:13:02.721 --> 02:13:07.721
<v Speaker 2>population versus how many tests that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were contracted to do or that you saw </v>

2789
02:13:07.721 --> 02:13:08.740
<v Speaker 2>this contractor to do with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2790
02:13:08.930 --> 02:13:10.040
<v Speaker 2>it'll average to that.</v>

2791
02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:10.910
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2792
02:13:10.970 --> 02:13:14.000
<v Speaker 2>everybody will be able to go on and see </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting soon here,</v>

2793
02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:16.280
<v Speaker 2>who's tested by name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times,</v>

2794
02:13:16.281 --> 02:13:18.110
<v Speaker 2>and you're not going to see across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>board,</v>

2795
02:13:18.111 --> 02:13:22.070
<v Speaker 2>five for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Likely you're going to see 10 or a dozen</v>

2796
02:13:22.071 --> 02:13:23.780
<v Speaker 2>per year for some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2797
02:13:23.810 --> 02:13:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Maybe two or three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is there a.</v>

2798
02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:28.100
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not random testing.</v>

2799
02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:31.620
<v Speaker 2>It's intelligent testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You saw it as not going to say hey,</v>

2800
02:13:31.621 --> 02:13:33.510
<v Speaker 2>we're going to roll the dice and whoever</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes up,</v>

2801
02:13:33.540 --> 02:13:37.020
<v Speaker 2>they're going to look at everything from</v>
<v Speaker 2>tips they may get.</v>

2802
02:13:37.710 --> 02:13:41.070
<v Speaker 2>How they'll even look at physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>appearances of athletes.</v>

2803
02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:46.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does this athlete pass kind of the </v>

2804
02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:46.520
<v Speaker 2>physical appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smell tests?</v>

2805
02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:51.231
<v Speaker 2>And if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey maybe we need to test that person a </v>

2806
02:13:51.231 --> 02:13:51.231
<v Speaker 2>little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Physical appearance,</v>

2807
02:13:51.231 --> 02:13:51.231
<v Speaker 2>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>

2808
02:13:52.050 --> 02:13:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

2809
02:13:53.250 --> 02:13:55.200
<v Speaker 2>like what would you like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at a guy and you go,</v>

2810
02:13:55.201 --> 02:13:56.860
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy just looks juiced.</v>

2811
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.960
<v Speaker 2>He looks different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

2812
02:13:57.990 --> 02:13:59.160
<v Speaker 2>you've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2813
02:13:59.161 --> 02:14:00.330
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2814
02:14:00.331 --> 02:14:05.331
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it on guys that have tested </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative and I've seen guys that have </v>

2815
02:14:05.331 --> 02:14:06.660
<v Speaker 2>been accused of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've tested negative every time.</v>

2816
02:14:06.690 --> 02:14:08.610
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with Dos Anjos,</v>

2817
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:12.240
<v Speaker 2>heartfelt dos Anjos was a UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>lightweight champion when he beat Pettis</v>

2818
02:14:12.241 --> 02:14:14.250
<v Speaker 2>and he beat Pettis in such a convincing </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2819
02:14:14.610 --> 02:14:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were so many people accusing that </v>

2820
02:14:19.610 --> 02:14:19.610
<v Speaker 2>guy and being on performance enhancing </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

2821
02:14:19.610 --> 02:14:23.130
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at his body over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>years really hasn't varied that much,</v>

2822
02:14:23.450 --> 02:14:25.410
<v Speaker 2>a little bit from the first time he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UFC,</v>

2823
02:14:25.411 --> 02:14:30.411
<v Speaker 2>but that was before he was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehensive strength and conditioning </v>

2824
02:14:30.411 --> 02:14:33.021
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at him like over the last few </v>

2825
02:14:33.021 --> 02:14:33.030
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's pretty consistent,</v>

2826
02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:38.360
<v Speaker 2>but yet once he wins the title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody starts pointing fingers at </v>

2827
02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:41.751
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at him like pull up a </v>

2828
02:14:41.751 --> 02:14:43.731
<v Speaker 2>picture of a Hoffeld dos Anjos UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>lightweight champion of the world,</v>

2829
02:14:44.150 --> 02:14:49.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he is fighting and when he's in </v>

2830
02:14:49.150 --> 02:14:49.150
<v Speaker 2>shape and he's fit.</v>

2831
02:14:49.150 --> 02:14:49.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like,</v>

2832
02:14:49.530 --> 02:14:52.440
<v Speaker 2>like I would like to look like if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were on steroids,</v>

2833
02:14:52.650 --> 02:14:57.650
<v Speaker 2>I would say that people would take </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids if they could look like this </v>

2834
02:14:57.650 --> 02:14:58.350
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he pass the smell test?</v>

2835
02:15:00.060 --> 02:15:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Like see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if you could find a picture of him </v>

2836
02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:08.390
<v Speaker 2>where he's just looked jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a picture of him over in the </v>

2837
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:09.900
<v Speaker 2>far left up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's him after he beat Pettis.</v>

2838
02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:11.220
<v Speaker 2>But look there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

2839
02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:12.750
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that looks just like an athlete,</v>

2840
02:15:12.751 --> 02:15:14.910
<v Speaker 2>but that looks okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a perfect one.</v>

2841
02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:19.770
<v Speaker 2>That's him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he was fighting pedes I believe.</v>

2842
02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Is that from the same fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2843
02:15:23.010 --> 02:15:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking shredded.</v>

2844
02:15:27.020 --> 02:15:29.790
<v Speaker 2>His six pack has a six pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2845
02:15:30.630 --> 02:15:34.980
<v Speaker 2>but not much different physically other </v>
<v Speaker 2>than like a little bit less body fat.</v>

2846
02:15:35.140 --> 02:15:37.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a fucking Stud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2847
02:15:37.410 --> 02:15:38.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why he's the champ.</v>

2848
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:41.910
<v Speaker 2>Obviously there's a lot of hard work </v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes into that,</v>

2849
02:15:41.911 --> 02:15:43.800
<v Speaker 2>but when people look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2850
02:15:43.801 --> 02:15:44.760
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2851
02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:48.870
<v Speaker 2>that looks like a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2852
02:15:48.930 --> 02:15:53.930
<v Speaker 2>if someone didn't look like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they took something and look like </v>

2853
02:15:53.930 --> 02:15:53.930
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would say,</v>

2854
02:15:53.930 --> 02:15:55.650
<v Speaker 2>well then the guys on steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if he always looks like that,</v>

2855
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:57.620
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to.</v>

2856
02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:00.150
<v Speaker 2>I different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's outliers,</v>

2857
02:16:00.180 --> 02:16:01.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2858
02:16:02.130 --> 02:16:07.130
<v Speaker 2>over those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that 15 year law enforcement career I </v>

2859
02:16:07.130 --> 02:16:07.130
<v Speaker 2>had involved with all of these cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2860
02:16:07.130 --> 02:16:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I knew of many athletes who look like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they did,</v>

2861
02:16:10.381 --> 02:16:13.200
<v Speaker 2>who didn't release no evidence appeared </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

2862
02:16:13.230 --> 02:16:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Many who didn't look like they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

2863
02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is strictly,</v>

2864
02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:20.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another tool to be used.</v>

2865
02:16:20.971 --> 02:16:22.590
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean all the time that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2866
02:16:22.591 --> 02:16:26.190
<v Speaker 2>an athlete that doesn't pass the smell </v>
<v Speaker 2>test will test positive.</v>

2867
02:16:26.191 --> 02:16:28.910
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of the times it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2868
02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:29.320
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>means,</v>

2869
02:16:29.321 --> 02:16:30.190
<v Speaker 2>is a test doesn't</v>

2870
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:33.760
<v Speaker 1>mean that person's all your positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you look like you did.</v>

2871
02:16:33.761 --> 02:16:34.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2872
02:16:34.301 --> 02:16:37.330
<v Speaker 1>you may be an extra test or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I was at athlete,</v>

2873
02:16:37.540 --> 02:16:39.250
<v Speaker 1>that was that freak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>

2874
02:16:39.251 --> 02:16:44.251
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man touched me more because people </v>

2875
02:16:44.251 --> 02:16:44.251
<v Speaker 1>were accusing me of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that'll be cool.</v>

2876
02:16:44.251 --> 02:16:48.361
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody will look at my stats on the </v>

2877
02:16:48.361 --> 02:16:50.080
<v Speaker 1>webpage and see I was tested 10 times </v>
<v Speaker 1>and no positive test for me here.</v>

2878
02:16:50.081 --> 02:16:55.081
<v Speaker 1>So I'm hoping a lot of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be,</v>

2879
02:16:55.460 --> 02:16:57.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the whereabouts program,</v>

2880
02:16:57.521 --> 02:16:59.140
<v Speaker 1>the amount of tests are athletes </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>

2881
02:16:59.141 --> 02:17:04.141
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be an inconvenience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm hoping that there's a lot of </v>

2882
02:17:04.141 --> 02:17:06.190
<v Speaker 1>acceptance and embracement of it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like hell yeah,</v>

2883
02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:09.460
<v Speaker 1>not only is this the baddest sport in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world were the toughest dude,</v>

2884
02:17:09.461 --> 02:17:12.640
<v Speaker 1>but we have the toughest anti-doping </v>
<v Speaker 1>program and bring it on.</v>

2885
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:16.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that there's a lot of that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sentiment that I get is as we go out</v>

2886
02:17:16.571 --> 02:17:18.930
<v Speaker 1>and talk is a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2887
02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:20.470
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's lip service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2888
02:17:20.471 --> 02:17:21.550
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2889
02:17:21.551 --> 02:17:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I would like to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2890
02:17:23.420 --> 02:17:25.560
<v Speaker 1>little certainly become that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's not that right now,</v>

2891
02:17:25.561 --> 02:17:30.561
<v Speaker 1>it will certainly become that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any potential for manipulation </v>

2892
02:17:30.561 --> 02:17:33.760
<v Speaker 1>by opponents calling into hotlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accusing someone of something and having</v>

2893
02:17:33.761 --> 02:17:35.980
<v Speaker 1>them task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving false information,</v>

2894
02:17:36.670 --> 02:17:38.200
<v Speaker 1>false tips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2895
02:17:38.201 --> 02:17:40.450
<v Speaker 1>There always is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see her doing that.</v>

2896
02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:43.690
<v Speaker 1>I dealt with that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in law enforcement,</v>

2897
02:17:43.691 --> 02:17:44.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First Time,</v>

2898
02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:47.470
<v Speaker 1>first thing a tip comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to evaluate who is this person?</v>

2899
02:17:47.471 --> 02:17:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Are they an x wide for an ex husband?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2900
02:17:50.290 --> 02:17:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they being sued by this?</v>

2901
02:17:51.581 --> 02:17:54.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluate that and you it do that too.</v>

2902
02:17:54.630 --> 02:17:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so does someone have to say who they are</v>

2903
02:17:57.011 --> 02:17:59.040
<v Speaker 1>when they give a tip or can they leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous today?</v>

2904
02:17:59.050 --> 02:18:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Can leave it anonymously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funnels conor Mcgregor.</v>

2905
02:18:01.421 --> 02:18:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I'd be calling that although hotline old</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2906
02:18:03.881 --> 02:18:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I bet he just to fuck with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2907
02:18:06.700 --> 02:18:08.200
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be guys that are going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2908
02:18:08.201 --> 02:18:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brogue might give it away.</v>

2909
02:18:09.881 --> 02:18:10.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2910
02:18:10.871 --> 02:18:11.450
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2911
02:18:11.850 --> 02:18:16.850
<v Speaker 1>is full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can shape but a guy like like say dose </v>

2912
02:18:16.850 --> 02:18:17.560
<v Speaker 1>on Joe's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2913
02:18:17.770 --> 02:18:22.770
<v Speaker 1>like who has that appearance just looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely shredded and is beating </v>

2914
02:18:23.531 --> 02:18:28.531
<v Speaker 1>everybody is automatically going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that point fingers at a guy like </v>

2915
02:18:28.531 --> 02:18:28.531
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2916
02:18:28.531 --> 02:18:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Potentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2917
02:18:29.620 --> 02:18:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Is there any other type of testing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're working on on,</v>

2918
02:18:34.840 --> 02:18:39.840
<v Speaker 1>on the pipeline that may perhaps be even</v>
<v Speaker 1>more effective than what they're doing </v>

2919
02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:39.840
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>

2920
02:18:39.990 --> 02:18:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2921
02:18:40.541 --> 02:18:41.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2922
02:18:41.111 --> 02:18:46.111
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get too far in the weeds when </v>

2923
02:18:46.111 --> 02:18:46.810
<v Speaker 1>the scientists and these conferences </v>
<v Speaker 1>break off the middle,</v>

2924
02:18:46.811 --> 02:18:49.510
<v Speaker 1>a little group or if ever I have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it goes over my head.</v>

2925
02:18:49.510 --> 02:18:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2926
02:18:51.011 --> 02:18:56.011
<v Speaker 1>but I mean there's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really smart people that their </v>

2927
02:18:56.011 --> 02:19:00.430
<v Speaker 1>profession and life is dedicated to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>arena of anti-doping.</v>

2928
02:19:00.730 --> 02:19:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out what's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out if there's not a test for </v>

2929
02:19:05.730 --> 02:19:09.031
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do it and develop it or some </v>

2930
02:19:09.031 --> 02:19:09.610
<v Speaker 1>super intelligent people on that mission</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

2931
02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:14.640
<v Speaker 1>So I'd be concerned if I was using </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that at some point someone's </v>

2932
02:19:15.161 --> 02:19:17.070
<v Speaker 1>not going to come up with a test for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>or tech.</v>

2933
02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:18.910
<v Speaker 1>What it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2934
02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:19.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2935
02:19:19.871 --> 02:19:23.740
<v Speaker 1>part of the stress that's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there from someone who's still under</v>

2936
02:19:23.741 --> 02:19:26.260
<v Speaker 1>this program chooses to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be stressful.</v>

2937
02:19:26.530 --> 02:19:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2938
02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:29.060
<v Speaker 1>this is really the gold standard program</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2939
02:19:29.090 --> 02:19:29.760
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2940
02:19:29.850 --> 02:19:31.100
<v Speaker 1>in professional sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2941
02:19:31.101 --> 02:19:34.820
<v Speaker 1>So there's no other professional sport </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has number one,</v>

2942
02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:38.120
<v Speaker 1>a truly independent authority </v>
<v Speaker 1>administering it.</v>

2943
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:43.150
<v Speaker 1>And what that does is it shows you </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not going to be any business </v>

2944
02:19:43.150 --> 02:19:44.130
<v Speaker 1>interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2945
02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:45.400
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2946
02:19:45.410 --> 02:19:50.410
<v Speaker 1>carrying out the program you saw doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>give a shit if it's our number one </v>

2947
02:19:50.410 --> 02:19:51.170
<v Speaker 1>earner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they test positive,</v>

2948
02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:53.600
<v Speaker 1>does that benefit them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't care.</v>

2949
02:19:53.601 --> 02:19:55.990
<v Speaker 1>All they care about is clean sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't care.</v>

2950
02:19:56.030 --> 02:19:59.180
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna be no allegations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>favoritism.</v>

2951
02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:01.370
<v Speaker 1>You sought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't care who the athlete is,</v>

2952
02:20:01.371 --> 02:20:02.720
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they live,</v>

2953
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:04.610
<v Speaker 1>they're all about clean sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2954
02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:07.190
<v Speaker 1>365 day a year or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2955
02:20:07.191 --> 02:20:12.191
<v Speaker 1>first off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no other professional sports have that </v>

2956
02:20:12.191 --> 02:20:12.320
<v Speaker 1>independent nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympic sports had that.</v>

2957
02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:15.770
<v Speaker 1>They have independent agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but professional sports don't.</v>

2958
02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:17.030
<v Speaker 1>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To begin with,</v>

2959
02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:19.520
<v Speaker 1>365 days a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Testing.</v>

2960
02:20:19.970 --> 02:20:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the other professional </v>

2961
02:20:24.970 --> 02:20:24.970
<v Speaker 1>sports here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the United States,</v>

2962
02:20:24.970 --> 02:20:29.030
<v Speaker 1>they can't say that I'm urine and blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests,</v>

2963
02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:31.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at any point blood by the way,</v>

2964
02:20:31.110 --> 02:20:32.600
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of concerns from athletes like,</v>

2965
02:20:32.601 --> 02:20:33.900
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much blood he taken from me,</v>

2966
02:20:33.901 --> 02:20:36.950
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be a deterrent or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could affect my performance.</v>

2967
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:41.950
<v Speaker 1>If you take blood from me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's less than a tablespoon of blood </v>

2968
02:20:41.950 --> 02:20:43.010
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So very little amount science shows will</v>

2969
02:20:43.011 --> 02:20:46.970
<v Speaker 1>have no effect whatsoever on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance even later that day.</v>

2970
02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2971
02:20:49.041 --> 02:20:54.041
<v Speaker 1>the biological passports huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if you don't find a specific </v>

2972
02:20:54.041 --> 02:20:54.041
<v Speaker 1>drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2973
02:20:54.041 --> 02:20:56.570
<v Speaker 1>we can go over time and look at abnormal</v>
<v Speaker 1>variances.</v>

2974
02:20:57.090 --> 02:21:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you throw all those things </v>

2975
02:21:02.090 --> 02:21:03.020
<v Speaker 1>together and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my experience,</v>

2976
02:21:03.050 --> 02:21:05.540
<v Speaker 1>both dealing with sports here in the US </v>
<v Speaker 1>and worldwide,</v>

2977
02:21:05.690 --> 02:21:10.690
<v Speaker 1>there's no other organization that </v>
<v Speaker 1>touches with this thing is now there's </v>

2978
02:21:10.690 --> 02:21:15.421
<v Speaker 1>some sports that you could argue really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just can't exist without </v>

2979
02:21:15.421 --> 02:21:16.220
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bodybuilding,</v>

2980
02:21:16.221 --> 02:21:17.450
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to the frontline.</v>

2981
02:21:17.451 --> 02:21:18.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the first one that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks about.</v>

2982
02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:24.010
<v Speaker 1>If bodybuilding instituted something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this to sport would change </v>

2983
02:21:24.010 --> 02:21:27.820
<v Speaker 1>radically overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you would see people shrink to </v>

2984
02:21:27.820 --> 02:21:27.820
<v Speaker 1>the point where they didn't.</v>

2985
02:21:27.820 --> 02:21:32.460
<v Speaker 1>They bear no resemblance to Dorian Yates</v>
<v Speaker 1>or green or any of these guys that were </v>

2986
02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:37.600
<v Speaker 1>in their prime that were just these </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaks that look,</v>

2987
02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:39.560
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even look like real people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2988
02:21:39.690 --> 02:21:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Not agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about pro football?</v>

2989
02:21:42.650 --> 02:21:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Like those guys are fucking gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of that is strength and </v>

2990
02:21:47.650 --> 02:21:47.650
<v Speaker 1>conditioning programs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2991
02:21:47.650 --> 02:21:52.481
<v Speaker 1>do you know how much of that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have those strength and </v>

2992
02:21:52.481 --> 02:21:55.571
<v Speaker 1>conditioning programs in the sixties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of it is steroids and growth </v>

2993
02:21:55.571 --> 02:21:55.571
<v Speaker 1>hormone and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2994
02:21:55.571 --> 02:21:56.450
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to say.</v>

2995
02:21:56.451 --> 02:21:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do have,</v>

2996
02:21:58.130 --> 02:21:59.990
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know and I've worked with,</v>

2997
02:21:59.991 --> 02:22:02.210
<v Speaker 1>they're people who are instituting their</v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

2998
02:22:02.211 --> 02:22:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Their program is not administered at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not independently administered.</v>

2999
02:22:07.090 --> 02:22:08.630
<v Speaker 1>It's them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in house,</v>

3000
02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:10.790
<v Speaker 1>in house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So say if they have a star athlete,</v>

3001
02:22:10.791 --> 02:22:12.080
<v Speaker 1>the test positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can kind of.</v>

3002
02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:17.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's happening because </v>

3003
02:22:17.420 --> 02:22:19.571
<v Speaker 1>you looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you looked at some of the athletes that </v>

3004
02:22:19.571 --> 02:22:19.571
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3005
02:22:19.571 --> 02:22:19.571
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3006
02:22:19.571 --> 02:22:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3007
02:22:20.451 --> 02:22:25.451
<v Speaker 1>that question would always pose itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that is the Fox guarding the hen</v>

3008
02:22:25.651 --> 02:22:28.320
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not nearly as comprehensive.</v>

3009
02:22:28.770 --> 02:22:30.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3010
02:22:30.241 --> 02:22:33.240
<v Speaker 1>one thing that I've found in anti-doping</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs,</v>

3011
02:22:33.241 --> 02:22:36.570
<v Speaker 1>you could have the most solid program </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way around.</v>

3012
02:22:36.571 --> 02:22:41.571
<v Speaker 1>If you have one little weakness in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tiniest weakness could be a loophole</v>

3013
02:22:41.850 --> 02:22:44.130
<v Speaker 1>that you can drive a tractor trailer </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

3014
02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:49.300
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say a program has everything that we </v>

3015
02:22:49.300 --> 02:22:51.990
<v Speaker 1>have a 365 day year testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say it's even,</v>

3016
02:22:51.991 --> 02:22:56.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sought administering it and say in </v>

3017
02:22:56.991 --> 02:22:59.010
<v Speaker 1>the collection process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the season,</v>

3018
02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:04.460
<v Speaker 1>the collector would call up somebody on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the team or in the organization the </v>

3019
02:23:04.460 --> 02:23:04.460
<v Speaker 1>night before and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3020
02:23:04.460 --> 02:23:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I need a parking pass tomorrow.</v>

3021
02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get in,</v>

3022
02:23:07.471 --> 02:23:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be showing up that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>little phone call.</v>

3023
02:23:09.901 --> 02:23:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Despite all the strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive strength could be,</v>

3024
02:23:14.130 --> 02:23:19.130
<v Speaker 1>could be the weakness that would cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody to run through that employee </v>

3025
02:23:19.350 --> 02:23:24.350
<v Speaker 1>is friends with somebody you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the players on the team knows who's hot </v>

3026
02:23:24.350 --> 02:23:25.020
<v Speaker 1>or not makes a call the night before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man,</v>

3027
02:23:25.021 --> 02:23:30.021
<v Speaker 1>they're coming tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't show up tomorrow to the </v>

3028
02:23:30.021 --> 02:23:34.191
<v Speaker 1>professional sports leagues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they do have a three </v>

3029
02:23:34.191 --> 02:23:34.191
<v Speaker 1>strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereabouts,</v>

3030
02:23:34.191 --> 02:23:35.250
<v Speaker 1>policy where if they're not there for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain day,</v>

3031
02:23:35.340 --> 02:23:40.340
<v Speaker 1>then that can be used against them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if they're not there for that day as </v>

3032
02:23:40.340 --> 02:23:40.340
<v Speaker 1>a test said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3033
02:23:40.340 --> 02:23:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll just get that person later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3034
02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.040
<v Speaker 1>so little things like that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulated to,</v>

3035
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:47.640
<v Speaker 1>to again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive a truck for.</v>

3036
02:23:47.940 --> 02:23:52.940
<v Speaker 1>What did you think about the vandelay </v>
<v Speaker 1>Silva situation for people not aware of </v>

3037
02:23:52.940 --> 02:23:53.670
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vandelay Silva,</v>

3038
02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:57.030
<v Speaker 1>they showed up for random drug test out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of competition.</v>

3039
02:23:57.350 --> 02:23:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't scheduled for a fight and just</v>

3040
02:23:59.611 --> 02:24:02.160
<v Speaker 1>bolted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he bolted,</v>

3041
02:24:02.220 --> 02:24:05.610
<v Speaker 1>they gave him a lifetime suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said you're done.</v>

3042
02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Your career is over you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You avoided a drug test.</v>

3043
02:24:10.350 --> 02:24:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3044
02:24:11.460 --> 02:24:13.800
<v Speaker 1>what did you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first under our program,</v>

3045
02:24:13.801 --> 02:24:17.880
<v Speaker 1>well we had this whereabouts where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get basically three strikes in a rolling</v>

3046
02:24:17.881 --> 02:24:22.881
<v Speaker 1>12 months and then there's a sanction </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's if you know they just can't </v>

3047
02:24:22.881 --> 02:24:27.351
<v Speaker 1>locate you or you didn't do a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough job or using complete your </v>

3048
02:24:27.351 --> 02:24:28.590
<v Speaker 1>whereabouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a tester comes to test,</v>

3049
02:24:28.591 --> 02:24:30.720
<v Speaker 1>one of our athletes say out of Jim says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3050
02:24:30.721 --> 02:24:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm here from Usada to test you and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete says,</v>

3051
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:37.680
<v Speaker 1>screw you and runs out the back door as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sanction right there,</v>

3052
02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:42.740
<v Speaker 1>a penalty and potentially under our </v>
<v Speaker 1>system with aggravating circumstances </v>

3053
02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:47.721
<v Speaker 1>could be four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may be an aggravating circumstance </v>

3054
02:24:47.721 --> 02:24:47.940
<v Speaker 1>where this guy or girl said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screw you,</v>

3055
02:24:47.970 --> 02:24:50.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing this thing and runs out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back door.</v>

3056
02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:55.220
<v Speaker 1>So that's four years on the first time </v>
<v Speaker 1>his case that he had had one before and </v>

3057
02:24:55.220 --> 02:24:56.910
<v Speaker 1>he had a positive before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the first one.</v>

3058
02:24:56.970 --> 02:24:58.050
<v Speaker 1>It was this first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3059
02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:03.200
<v Speaker 1>well he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he obviously didn't test positive even </v>

3060
02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:03.200
<v Speaker 1>then because he didn't test it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he admitted that he was,</v>

3061
02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:07.380
<v Speaker 1>in his words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was taking some sort of a.</v>

3062
02:25:07.740 --> 02:25:10.500
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a steroid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a diuretic,</v>

3063
02:25:10.501 --> 02:25:13.800
<v Speaker 1>it was saying because he had fluid build</v>
<v Speaker 1>up something.</v>

3064
02:25:14.300 --> 02:25:16.660
<v Speaker 1>It didn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3065
02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:20.970
<v Speaker 1>but like Aldo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he avoided taking a drug test in Brazil.</v>

3066
02:25:20.971 --> 02:25:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3067
02:25:22.110 --> 02:25:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the,</v>

3068
02:25:23.350 --> 02:25:24.400
<v Speaker 1>that he avoided it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3069
02:25:24.401 --> 02:25:28.350
<v Speaker 1>there was obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Nevada play,</v>

3070
02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:31.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly disclosed what was played out.</v>

3071
02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:36.360
<v Speaker 1>They sent a collector here from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States down there and showed up </v>

3072
02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:36.520
<v Speaker 1>at the gym.</v>

3073
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:39.660
<v Speaker 1>They disputed whether or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3074
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing,</v>

3075
02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:44.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly how everything went</v>

3076
02:25:44.411 --> 02:25:49.411
<v Speaker 1>down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing I can say is under our </v>

3077
02:25:49.411 --> 02:25:49.411
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the reasons we went to</v>

3078
02:25:49.411 --> 02:25:54.121
<v Speaker 1>Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usada needs to go to another country to </v>

3079
02:25:54.121 --> 02:25:55.510
<v Speaker 1>do a collection like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They reach out to the national authority</v>

3080
02:25:55.511 --> 02:26:00.511
<v Speaker 1>of that country so that when somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows up on behalf of you saw or with </v>

3081
02:26:00.511 --> 02:26:05.011
<v Speaker 1>Usada out of gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get an instance or </v>

3082
02:26:05.011 --> 02:26:05.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasoning that,</v>

3083
02:26:05.011 --> 02:26:06.460
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know who this person was.</v>

3084
02:26:06.461 --> 02:26:09.250
<v Speaker 1>There'll be credentialed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every bone will know who they are.</v>

3085
02:26:09.550 --> 02:26:12.490
<v Speaker 1>There'll be a representative from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nation there.</v>

3086
02:26:12.670 --> 02:26:15.190
<v Speaker 1>I think they tested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although sample anyway,</v>

3087
02:26:15.191 --> 02:26:17.230
<v Speaker 1>if I'm correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he tested negative,</v>

3088
02:26:17.231 --> 02:26:18.160
<v Speaker 1>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

3089
02:26:18.161 --> 02:26:23.161
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the next day that he </v>

3090
02:26:23.161 --> 02:26:23.161
<v Speaker 1>provided a sample,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3091
02:26:23.161 --> 02:26:27.210
<v Speaker 1>and that did test negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was some issues about the day </v>

3092
02:26:27.210 --> 02:26:29.890
<v Speaker 1>before or sample wasn't provided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3093
02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:35.160
<v Speaker 1>because because it went 24 hours and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have whatever he had could have </v>

3094
02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:37.280
<v Speaker 1>cleaned out of a system that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3095
02:26:37.330 --> 02:26:38.200
<v Speaker 1>that would be a concern.</v>

3096
02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

3097
02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:44.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can test for human growth </v>

3098
02:26:44.290 --> 02:26:46.741
<v Speaker 1>hormone now too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was something that they couldn't </v>

3099
02:26:46.741 --> 02:26:47.410
<v Speaker 1>ask for for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't true.</v>

3100
02:26:47.411 --> 02:26:50.230
<v Speaker 1>And there's also another test that came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out for it,</v>

3101
02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:55.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they can run back a couple of </v>

3102
02:26:55.380 --> 02:26:55.380
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be with a blood test,</v>

3103
02:26:55.380 --> 02:26:59.230
<v Speaker 1>she would have had to detect it within </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 24 hours of its use.</v>

3104
02:26:59.850 --> 02:27:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is now an isoform test,</v>

3105
02:27:02.351 --> 02:27:05.620
<v Speaker 1>which isn't necessarily for the drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

3106
02:27:05.621 --> 02:27:07.900
<v Speaker 1>but kind of like with the biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>passport.</v>

3107
02:27:07.901 --> 02:27:12.901
<v Speaker 1>If you take growth hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will affect certain markers in you </v>

3108
02:27:12.901 --> 02:27:14.500
<v Speaker 1>that will last over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the drug is cleared your system,</v>

3109
02:27:14.890 --> 02:27:19.890
<v Speaker 1>so it gives anti-doping that ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reach back a couple of weeks and </v>

3110
02:27:19.890 --> 02:27:20.980
<v Speaker 1>determine if it was used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

3111
02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:26.110
<v Speaker 1>an evolving tool that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe some organization says,</v>

3112
02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>news tests two weeks,</v>

3113
02:27:28.060 --> 02:27:33.060
<v Speaker 1>we can call back all those frozen sample</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's go back and retest them and see </v>

3114
02:27:33.060 --> 02:27:35.800
<v Speaker 1>that maybe it wasn't within 24 hours an </v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete use but two weeks.</v>

3115
02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:40.800
<v Speaker 1>So that factor I think is always hanging</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there for somebody who chooses to </v>

3116
02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:42.370
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use the substances band.</v>

3117
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Well Jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for coming on here </v>

3118
02:27:48.030 --> 02:27:50.761
<v Speaker 1>and then taking the time to explain all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff and thank you very much for </v>

3119
02:27:50.761 --> 02:27:52.930
<v Speaker 1>this incredibly comprehensive effort to </v>
<v Speaker 1>clean up the sport.</v>

3120
02:27:52.931 --> 02:27:55.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it's awesome and I think what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing is just.</v>

3121
02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:56.840
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

3122
02:27:56.890 --> 02:28:01.890
<v Speaker 1>it's very intriguing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's inspiring and I think ultimately </v>

3123
02:28:01.890 --> 02:28:02.530
<v Speaker 1>it's great for the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>

3124
02:28:02.531 --> 02:28:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to say no,</v>

3125
02:28:04.030 --> 02:28:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
