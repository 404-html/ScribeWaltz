8
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

100
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.620

<v Speaker 2>people could do.</v>

142
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:27.341
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't scare the shit out of me </v>
<v Speaker 2>nearly as much as people can get so </v>

143
00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 2>angry at someone that they could shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

144
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.400
<v Speaker 2>but it scares the shit out of me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone could do that to their dad and </v>

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.870
<v Speaker 2>their mom to written.</v>

150
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

151
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

152
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Sexual and psychological abuse that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffered at the hands of their parents.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Because they killed their parents,</v>

157
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:00.230
<v Speaker 2>but the parents could have been fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters.</v>

158
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>

162
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 2>how do you make a kid that is capable of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting you in your sleep?</v>

00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 2>birth that you could have done nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix.</v>

166
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.880
<v Speaker 2>You've got two guys that are willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot you while you're sleeping and you </v>

167
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 2>raise them from the time they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>

168

<v Speaker 2>Burnt that fucking thing to the ground.</v>

171
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what happened to it.</v>

172
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Like Nicole Simpson's house still there </v>
<v Speaker 2>for somebody lived there.</v>

173
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't Nicole Simpson's?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that a house or was that outside of </v>

174
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:46.930
<v Speaker 2>my apartment building or Condo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

175
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.230

<v Speaker 2>that's a weird one because that's like,</v>

176
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 2>it's a public building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to just deal with it.</v>

177

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.160
<v Speaker 2>that he killed them on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He killed them outside,</v>

179
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:06.161
<v Speaker 2>but every time you go home you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>step over a crime scene to walk into </v>

180
00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:10.470
<v Speaker 2>your house and you've seen the pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

181
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:15.550
<v Speaker 2>You know the history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time Oj documentary comes out or </v>

182
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.781
<v Speaker 2>every time they have an Oj series on tv </v>
<v Speaker 2>or when his a parole hearing comes up,</v>

183
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.040
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a doorway into the house.</v>

184
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.680
<v Speaker 2>So I wonder if like I want to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who's like,</v>

185
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 2>doesn't give a fuck and listen that </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

187

<v Speaker 2>Like a deal's a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baby Sprint would listen.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You get it.</v>

192
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:58.150
<v Speaker 2>I saw the murder scene photos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so hard to believe that </v>

193
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 2>someone could do that to someone that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was pretty scared about it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's weird to think that there's someone</v>

268
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:27.541
<v Speaker 3>that could be a spy in your neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that he thinks that you're the enemy</v>

269
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.260
<v Speaker 3>because you were born over here and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was born over there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like what we were talking about </v>

275
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.800
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot of very wealthy people</v>

<v Speaker 3>Montclair's a very nice area.</v>

278
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:57.510
<v Speaker 3>Google that should be.</v>

290
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:30.750
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like Beverly Hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the Beverly Hills of New </v>

291
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.750
<v Speaker 3>Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm exaggerating.</v>

292
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Hundred Sixty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>3000.</v>

293
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.560

<v Speaker 3>the average,</v>

294
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.850

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's probably a lot of rich this one.</v>

<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

297
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.520

<v Speaker 3>Why do you think they do it?</v>

298
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>financial wizard.</v>

356
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.410
<v Speaker 1>He's coming on again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an interesting cat.</v>

357
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.440

<v Speaker 1>employees who knows how many fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

359
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.550
<v Speaker 1>But he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's also always on television.</v>

360
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Breaking down what's wrong with like </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial bubbles at the real estate </v>

361
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:37.580
<v Speaker 1>bubble?</v>

362
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.370
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called all that shit.</v>

363
00:16:38.371 --> 00:16:43.371
<v Speaker 1>The subprime mortgage bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He called all that shit years ago after </v>

364
00:16:43.371 --> 00:16:46.161
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling the Netflix bubble right </v>

365
00:16:46.161 --> 00:16:46.161
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uhm,</v>

366
00:16:46.161 --> 00:16:47.130
<v Speaker 1>up to hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling.</v>

367
00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.520
<v Speaker 1>It cannot be the only one in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not the only one by the cool.</v>

368
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.670
<v Speaker 1>You know there was an article that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>out just yesterday about debt.</v>

369
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.800
<v Speaker 1>There was something about Netflix when </v>
<v Speaker 1>in debt,</v>

370
00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:01.210
<v Speaker 1>something like does think it was said it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was good times did an investigation and </v>

371
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.020
<v Speaker 1>it was just like they found out their </v>
<v Speaker 1>$20,000,000,000</v>

372
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.740
<v Speaker 1>in debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that possible?</v>

373
00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Because they're spending so much money </v>
<v Speaker 1>on these shows man and promoting them </v>

374
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:10.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

375
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:15.221
<v Speaker 1>they just celebrated a few months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The $100 million a customer like </v>

376
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever they called it $100 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means that facebook will be </v>

377
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.590
<v Speaker 1>laughing because facebook's got how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers.</v>

378
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a big difference.</v>

379
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Facebook doesn't get $9 a month from </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

380
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:34.310
<v Speaker 1>but each one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 million people are giving $9 a </v>

381
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.310
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's $900.</v>

382
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Million dollars a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

383
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.980
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's almost a billion dollars a month.</v>

384
00:17:37.981 --> 00:17:39.780
<v Speaker 1>That's $12,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>

385
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$10,000,000,000</v>

386
00:17:42.391 --> 00:17:44.880
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an insane amount of money.</v>

387
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.350
<v Speaker 1>You know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>

388
00:17:46.351 --> 00:17:49.000
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human man,</v>

389
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.110
<v Speaker 1>man is so valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

390
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.880
<v Speaker 1>I know even when something can work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they make systems at work,</v>

391
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:02.240
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with those systems is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that humans run those systems and they </v>

392
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:08.270
<v Speaker 1>are so valuable that they fuck shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the right way to say that word </v>

393
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.350
<v Speaker 1>valuable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

394
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Sounds perfect though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

395
00:18:10.841 --> 00:18:12.180
<v Speaker 1>it sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't look it up.</v>

396
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought it was valuable because</v>

397
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:20.080
<v Speaker 1>it must be British.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamaican accent makes sing things sounds</v>

398
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:25.701
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's always those words that you </v>

399
00:18:25.701 --> 00:18:27.441
<v Speaker 1>never say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see written and you know the </v>

400
00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:27.441
<v Speaker 1>word and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how am I saying this?</v>

401
00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I know what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't.</v>

402
00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't say it can't come up with a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

403
00:18:31.291 --> 00:18:32.730
<v Speaker 1>That is one of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what it's funny.</v>

404
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember ever saying that word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Roy.</v>

405
00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never say Reuters,</v>

406
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Reuters news source,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I look at it,</v>

407
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:43.380
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

408
00:18:43.381 --> 00:18:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read it a thousand times,</v>

409
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 1>but how do I say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Routers,</v>

410
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.320
<v Speaker 1>routers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>routers,</v>

411
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Broida sounds right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the right way to say that's what </v>

412
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.100
<v Speaker 1>everybody says it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when left to my own devices,</v>

413
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll just fuck ups pronounced this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

414
00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have way too much totally useless </v>

415
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.220
<v Speaker 1>information going around inside my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to do some spring cleaning.</v>

416
00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:13.580
<v Speaker 1>I got to throw away your memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to throw away some childhood memories </v>

417
00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.590
<v Speaker 1>that are not serving me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just taking up space in my head.</v>

418
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You run out of hard drive space,</v>

419
00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:19.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

420
00:19:19.251 --> 00:19:22.410
<v Speaker 1>you do every day you're looking at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>new story everyday.</v>

421
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a new thing going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

422
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:27.510
<v Speaker 1>and especially if you're trying to file </v>
<v Speaker 1>game of thrones and maybe how's of cards</v>

423
00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:32.511
<v Speaker 1>to and maybe stranger things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I used to remember </v>

424
00:19:32.511 --> 00:19:34.830
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I could remember every movie,</v>

425
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.690
<v Speaker 1>every part of every part of my childhood</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then now somebody said,</v>

426
00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:41.610
<v Speaker 1>remember that time we did this and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

427
00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.860
<v Speaker 1>you are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember the time,</v>

428
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember it that you were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess you were.</v>

429
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like now it's my memory's full.</v>

430
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I need to go to the Mac store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had some shit added.</v>

431
00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you were like an old farmer,</v>

432
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.650
<v Speaker 1>you remember all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just every day getting up,</v>

433
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.680
<v Speaker 1>milking the cows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picking the eggs,</v>

434
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.960
<v Speaker 1>killing a sheep or something for dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would,</v>

435
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:14.060
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have those memories because </v>

436
00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:14.370
<v Speaker 1>you're in that same spot everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about your childhood,</v>

437
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.640
<v Speaker 1>your way from all the distractions come </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your head.</v>

438
00:20:19.641 --> 00:20:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no books,</v>

439
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.360
<v Speaker 1>no books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing bro.</v>

440
00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:27.450
<v Speaker 1>You gotta eat cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably just read one book over </v>

441
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.000
<v Speaker 1>and over five days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing story,</v>

442
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:35.020
<v Speaker 1>but it is written in storybook for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

443
00:20:35.611 --> 00:20:36.270
<v Speaker 1>it's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

444
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.130
<v Speaker 1>The Bible is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.830
<v Speaker 1>a fascinating book in that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start,</v>

446
00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:46.860
<v Speaker 1>you start off with someone telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories for like a thousand years before</v>

447
00:20:46.861 --> 00:20:47.650
<v Speaker 1>you write it down</v>

448
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.980
<v Speaker 4>and then you've got a bunch of really </v>
<v Speaker 4>old versions of the story and no one's </v>

449
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:56.521
<v Speaker 4>sure which ones to use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they got the version that's in the </v>

450
00:20:56.521 --> 00:21:01.410
<v Speaker 4>Dead Sea Scrolls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the oldest versions of some of </v>

451
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:01.410
<v Speaker 4>those stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

452
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.170
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

453
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.590
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

454
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.820
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe the only one that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>written in Aramaic or they found it in </v>

455
00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 4>these clay pots and Qumran and Qumran is</v>
<v Speaker 4>an area in Israel.</v>

456
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:17.230
<v Speaker 4>So they have these like little caves and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will find these clay pots.</v>

457
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.380
<v Speaker 4>And in these clay pots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got these scrolls that are made </v>

458
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:22.380
<v Speaker 4>out of animal skins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them.</v>

459
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.410
<v Speaker 4>So they take these scrolls out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy.</v>

460
00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.300
<v Speaker 4>Takes like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it took them like 14 to 15 years</v>

461
00:21:28.301 --> 00:21:30.760
<v Speaker 4>just to piece it together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they allow,</v>

462
00:21:30.761 --> 00:21:35.761
<v Speaker 4>broke it up and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they couldn't figure out what goes </v>

463
00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:35.761
<v Speaker 4>with what.</v>

464
00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:38.660
<v Speaker 4>So they had to take DNA tests on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the actual pieces of animal skin,</v>

465
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Speaker 4>so they could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

466
00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:45.310
<v Speaker 4>well this is some skin from this animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's concentrate on this.</v>

467
00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:48.490
<v Speaker 4>All these pieces have been genetically </v>
<v Speaker 4>tested to be from this animal.</v>

468
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.860
<v Speaker 4>So let's put these together because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably the same scroll.</v>

469
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:56.070
<v Speaker 4>Then they have to like figure out I take</v>
<v Speaker 4>these crumbs and chunks that are just </v>

470
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.360
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years of trust this.</v>

471
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.560
<v Speaker 4>Well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also you're reading it in,</v>

472
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.700
<v Speaker 4>in an ancient ancient land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

473
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.800
<v Speaker 4>you're reading it in the also like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>references and the way people thought </v>

474
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:12.970
<v Speaker 4>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

475
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:19.110
<v Speaker 4>Then they have like the oldest version </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the Hebrew Bible is like the very </v>

476
00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:24.580
<v Speaker 4>oldest versions were written in ancient </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hebrew and ancient Hebrews.</v>

477
00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.150
<v Speaker 4>Crazy because it has numbers as well as </v>
<v Speaker 4>letters.</v>

478
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.030
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you have a letter a,</v>

479
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.650
<v Speaker 4>it's also the number one.</v>

480
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.990
<v Speaker 4>It's all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So linkedin.</v>

481
00:22:34.991 --> 00:22:39.991
<v Speaker 4>So like when you have a word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like words have like a numerical value </v>

482
00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:44.630
<v Speaker 4>and if I'm butchering this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if anyone's an ancient Hebrew </v>

483
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.430
<v Speaker 4>representative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Ari and I discussed this for a </v>

484
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.430
<v Speaker 4>couple of times because Ra,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

485
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.270
<v Speaker 4>went to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it called,</v>

486
00:22:49.271 --> 00:22:54.271
<v Speaker 4>like that thing that they send him off </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that religious camp when he was a </v>

487
00:22:54.271 --> 00:22:55.450
<v Speaker 4>serious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>serious,</v>

488
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.130
<v Speaker 4>a Orthodox Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

489
00:22:57.131 --> 00:22:59.160
<v Speaker 4>So that's why he's such a serious </v>
<v Speaker 4>atheist now.</v>

490
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.190
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's such a freak now.</v>

491
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:05.420
<v Speaker 4>But that's exactly why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so like their words had numerical </v>

492
00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.690
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the word God and the word love,</v>

493
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.330
<v Speaker 4>they have the same numerical value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

494
00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.930
<v Speaker 4>like with the letter n the letter o and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they all have like numbers,</v>

495
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.780
<v Speaker 4>like we can't even think like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because none of our words have numerical</v>

496
00:23:16.781 --> 00:23:18.460
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like the,</v>

497
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:22.660
<v Speaker 4>the actual meaning of a word has more </v>
<v Speaker 4>value with more numbers to it.</v>

498
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.080
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff's lost on our stupid </v>

499
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.590
<v Speaker 4>goofy language because when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>translated it to Latin,</v>

500
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:33.580
<v Speaker 4>it translated to Greek or English.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all kind of lost.</v>

501
00:23:33.581 --> 00:23:38.581
<v Speaker 4>And then who was translating this shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what was everything is based off </v>

502
00:23:38.581 --> 00:23:42.620
<v Speaker 4>like what your goal is or what your </v>
<v Speaker 4>perception of the world is and where </v>

503
00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 4>you're from or how you were raised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what you want this thing to mean</v>

504
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.630
<v Speaker 2>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

505
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.510
<v Speaker 2>So like you can't get away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

506
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.700
<v Speaker 2>So if you're the person putting this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff together and translate and it's </v>

507
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.621
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you not let your influence </v>

508
00:23:59.621 --> 00:24:00.220
<v Speaker 2>influenced this thing you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

509
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.640
<v Speaker 2>You tweak it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little tweak it.</v>

510
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want it to mean the things that it </v>

511
00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.031
<v Speaker 2>means to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you just want people to believe </v>

512
00:24:10.031 --> 00:24:13.060
<v Speaker 2>this is an ancient scroll that you found</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this goes back to you finding it and</v>

513
00:24:13.731 --> 00:24:17.140
<v Speaker 2>it goes to your name and to your legacy </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

514
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.720
<v Speaker 2>well this also massive amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence of people.</v>

515
00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:25.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at something and then having</v>
<v Speaker 2>a distorted perception of what something</v>

516
00:24:25.401 --> 00:24:27.950
<v Speaker 2>means and then having that band in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>favor.</v>

517
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

518
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
<v Speaker 2>There's so many points of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that with all my relationships and </v>

519
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.640
<v Speaker 2>all of them in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of my favorite.</v>

520
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many people think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the victim.</v>

521
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:44.260
<v Speaker 2>How many people were just running around</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking the world's against the total </v>

522
00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.231
<v Speaker 2>victim and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's just evidence of a bias </v>

523
00:24:48.561 --> 00:24:49.270
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

524
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:54.300
<v Speaker 2>If you have bias thinking in regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that the god of Gods wants to </v>

525
00:24:55.491 --> 00:25:00.491
<v Speaker 2>govern humanity and our behavior and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should behave with each other and </v>

526
00:25:00.491 --> 00:25:04.990
<v Speaker 2>treat each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look in to let your own personal </v>

527
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:06.020
<v Speaker 2>ego and biases get in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it absolutely did,</v>

528
00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:11.420
<v Speaker 2>there's still shit written in the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 2>that treats women as second class </v>

529
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:11.810
<v Speaker 2>citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It condoned slavery.</v>

530
00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:15.470
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no like talking about slavery as</v>

531
00:25:15.471 --> 00:25:17.960
<v Speaker 2>if it's some horrible thing that has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like banished.</v>

532
00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Like there's in the ancient Hebrew Bible</v>
<v Speaker 2>condones slavery,</v>

533
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:27.530
<v Speaker 2>they just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's really nothing bad about being </v>

534
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.070
<v Speaker 2>about having slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like God doesn't come and kill you,</v>

535
00:25:28.071 --> 00:25:30.650
<v Speaker 2>but God will kill you if you were to </v>
<v Speaker 2>different types of cloth.</v>

536
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.710
<v Speaker 2>I know like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they'll burn witches,</v>

537
00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.810
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what you are,</v>

538
00:25:35.811 --> 00:25:36.920
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

539
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Because I said you're a witch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

540
00:25:39.851 --> 00:25:42.110
<v Speaker 2>it's not evil slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

541
00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 2>The table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inquisition,</v>

542
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:49.750
<v Speaker 2>the during the inquisition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't torturing people because </v>

543
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.180
<v Speaker 2>they had slaves because they thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were witches.</v>

544
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 2>They were torturing people because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just didn't believe enough in a way.</v>

545
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

546
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:59.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What caught you doing something or if </v>

547
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.661
<v Speaker 2>you want it to get rid of somebody that </v>
<v Speaker 2>say somebody had a job that you wanted,</v>

548
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:07.300
<v Speaker 2>a position that you wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could prove that that person like</v>

549
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:11.420
<v Speaker 2>slandered God or blast themed or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

550
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.480
<v Speaker 2>then you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the standard maneuver,</v>

551
00:26:14.481 --> 00:26:15.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

552
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the government to get rid of </v>

553
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.020
<v Speaker 2>this person for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you get shit like North Korea</v>

554
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.910
<v Speaker 2>and that's how you get shit like Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

555
00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:25.970
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just.</v>

556
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Everybody turned it on everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody trying to figure out a way </v>

557
00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:35.470
<v Speaker 2>that they can use their power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what's kind of happening in </v>

558
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.470
<v Speaker 2>America to a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

559
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an article in the new,</v>

560
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.910
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the New Yorker just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>two days ago with the senator.</v>

561
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it a senator who wrote.</v>

562
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you just read?</v>
<v Speaker 2>An</v>

563
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.980
<v Speaker 2>article last night is a Republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>senator and he said when Obama was </v>

564
00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:53.661
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans made a concerted effort </v>

565
00:26:53.661 --> 00:26:58.050
<v Speaker 2>to just push the Republican agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make Obama a one term president,</v>

566
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.590
<v Speaker 2>and now that trump has hijack their </v>
<v Speaker 2>party,</v>

567
00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.240
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of turning a blind eye to </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that they wouldn't have if Obama </v>

568
00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:13.161
<v Speaker 2>was president just because trump is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>republican candidate.</v>

569
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

570
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.760
<v Speaker 2>where our loyalties to our party or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this country because we're kind of like </v>

571
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.990
<v Speaker 2>fucking up the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

572
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 2>and it's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda like,</v>

573
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:29.250
<v Speaker 2>like when Obama was president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what you think of them,</v>

574
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.050
<v Speaker 2>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he,</v>

575
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:32.970
<v Speaker 2>if he was a good president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

576
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Say he's a good president because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not your person,</v>

577
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.540
<v Speaker 2>you're going to shut down the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's doing to get your party in </v>

578
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.570
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't give a fuck.</v>

579
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because all you care about is your party</v>

580
00:27:45.331 --> 00:27:46.430
<v Speaker 2>winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

581
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:49.830
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now that trump is president,</v>

582
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.010
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats are taken the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the same book.</v>

583
00:27:53.011 --> 00:27:54.660
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not even saying trump is a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

584
00:27:54.661 --> 00:27:57.180
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying everybody's turning </v>
<v Speaker 2>on everybody.</v>

585
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all trying to figure out a way </v>

586
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:04.521
<v Speaker 2>to win so they'd get their agenda </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward and that's not the country's </v>

587
00:28:04.521 --> 00:28:04.521
<v Speaker 2>agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No at all.</v>

588
00:28:04.521 --> 00:28:08.970
<v Speaker 2>So destroying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroying each other.</v>

589
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:09.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

590
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.770
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely like a battle between </v>
<v Speaker 4>the two sides right now,</v>

591
00:28:12.771 --> 00:28:17.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot of people that are </v>

592
00:28:17.771 --> 00:28:17.771
<v Speaker 4>getting excited by it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take,</v>

593
00:28:17.771 --> 00:28:21.761
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have not just a vested interest in </v>

594
00:28:21.761 --> 00:28:25.601
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it becomes like a part of their </v>

595
00:28:25.601 --> 00:28:25.601
<v Speaker 4>identity to be a part of the resistance </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>

596
00:28:25.601 --> 00:28:26.300
<v Speaker 4>fighting against this evil empire,</v>

597
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.300
<v Speaker 2>but at the detriment of like,</v>

598
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:33.700
<v Speaker 4>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it really depends because like </v>

599
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:33.700
<v Speaker 4>when you put a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure on someone,</v>

600
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.780
<v Speaker 4>like they're putting on trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you agree with it or not,</v>

601
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.840
<v Speaker 4>it forces that person to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people like that out there and </v>

602
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.501
<v Speaker 4>you adjust accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It moves the tied a couple degrees one </v>

603
00:28:44.501 --> 00:28:48.791
<v Speaker 4>way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just does like the idea that we're </v>

604
00:28:48.791 --> 00:28:50.460
<v Speaker 4>not culturally malleable that our </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultures and shift back and forth.</v>

605
00:28:50.461 --> 00:28:55.461
<v Speaker 4>It certainly does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things that used to be totally </v>

606
00:28:55.461 --> 00:28:58.001
<v Speaker 4>acceptable are now completely taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's just over the course of the </v>

607
00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:01.460
<v Speaker 4>last decade or so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think that even the far left,</v>

608
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:06.490
<v Speaker 4>it's all necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just doesn't seem necessary because </v>

609
00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.870
<v Speaker 4>we're caught up in it and we can see if </v>
<v Speaker 4>we just meet in the middle somewhere can</v>

610
00:29:08.871 --> 00:29:13.871
<v Speaker 4>all be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you just looked at this thing </v>

611
00:29:13.871 --> 00:29:13.871
<v Speaker 4>objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like not,</v>

612
00:29:13.871 --> 00:29:16.640
<v Speaker 4>not like a human being even look at it </v>
<v Speaker 4>at like a mathematic problem,</v>

613
00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you could see human culture,</v>

614
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:25.150
<v Speaker 4>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well there's this complete constant </v>

615
00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.080
<v Speaker 4>shift of energy that goes left and right</v>
<v Speaker 4>and left and right,</v>

616
00:29:27.081 --> 00:29:30.260
<v Speaker 4>like some crazy ping pong game </v>
<v Speaker 4>occasionally goes right.</v>

617
00:29:30.261 --> 00:29:35.261
<v Speaker 4>And then right again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very rarely like Reagan and then Bush </v>

618
00:29:35.261 --> 00:29:36.410
<v Speaker 4>senior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then it balances itself out and goes</v>

619
00:29:36.411 --> 00:29:39.200
<v Speaker 4>left again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this weird battle.</v>

620
00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 4>And along the way if you look at</v>

621
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.310
<v Speaker 3>like if you really step away from it </v>
<v Speaker 3>along the way,</v>

622
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:49.330
<v Speaker 3>there are incremental changes that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving in a good direction.</v>

623
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:50.760
<v Speaker 3>It's just hard to see them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

624
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.320
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of bad shit happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

625
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:57.270
<v Speaker 5>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then we only hear about the stuff,</v>

626
00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:02.300
<v Speaker 5>the bad stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because each side is just trying to get </v>

627
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.710
<v Speaker 5>points from the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I.</v>

628
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.530
<v Speaker 5>But I'm just saying it's just that when </v>
<v Speaker 5>one party,</v>

629
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:09.900
<v Speaker 5>no matter what party is trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>something good,</v>

630
00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.680
<v Speaker 5>even if it's something good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the people from the other party are</v>

631
00:30:13.681 --> 00:30:17.220
<v Speaker 5>going to be against it because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't want that party to score that good</v>

632
00:30:17.221 --> 00:30:19.530
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You then they knocked that off the table</v>

633
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:23.910
<v Speaker 5>and that thing that could help people is</v>
<v Speaker 5>never going to help people.</v>

634
00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:26.880
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also part of having two </v>
<v Speaker 3>teams.</v>

635
00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:32.210
<v Speaker 3>If think if there was way more teams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there was like 20 or 30 different </v>

636
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:32.340
<v Speaker 3>parties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd be way better off.</v>

637
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:37.580
<v Speaker 3>You're better off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Politicians are spread across 20 or 30 </v>

638
00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.781
<v Speaker 3>different parties instead of jammed into</v>
<v Speaker 3>one or the other or the freaks that are </v>

639
00:30:41.781 --> 00:30:44.220
<v Speaker 3>independent or green party liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Fuck Outta here.</v>

640
00:30:44.221 --> 00:30:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Where your Green party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a goofy right?</v>

641
00:30:46.591 --> 00:30:48.870
<v Speaker 3>That's no one's going to elect a Green </v>
<v Speaker 3>party president.</v>

642
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.830
<v Speaker 3>All the bankers are going to put a stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>

643
00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.440
<v Speaker 3>This guy's just going to steal money </v>
<v Speaker 3>from us.</v>

644
00:30:52.441 --> 00:30:54.540
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to give it to penguins and</v>

645
00:30:54.541 --> 00:30:55.640
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

646
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.160
<v Speaker 3>That's going to give out money to </v>
<v Speaker 3>penguin.</v>

647
00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.000
<v Speaker 3>So you've got really three choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got independent,</v>

648
00:31:00.001 --> 00:31:05.001
<v Speaker 3>which is so rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only person that I could think ever </v>

649
00:31:05.001 --> 00:31:07.671
<v Speaker 3>winning as an independent right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly would be someone like trump or </v>

650
00:31:07.671 --> 00:31:09.780
<v Speaker 3>like elon musk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mark Cuban,</v>

651
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump is basically an independent who </v>

652
00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:14.840
<v Speaker 3>hijack Republican Party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

653
00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.500
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he voted Democrat like his whole life.</v>

654
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.280
<v Speaker 3>He was pro choice like his whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

655
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:24.120
<v Speaker 3>it's like he's been on the side of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic issues forever.</v>

656
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:24.990
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

657
00:31:24.991 --> 00:31:29.880
<v Speaker 5>I saw the video where he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw the video right the day before.</v>

658
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:34.970
<v Speaker 5>I saw it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The last time I saw it was the day </v>

659
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:37.020
<v Speaker 5>before the election where he said if I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was going to run,</v>

660
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:41.550
<v Speaker 5>I would run as a Republican because </v>
<v Speaker 5>Republicans are stupid and blah,</v>

661
00:31:41.551 --> 00:31:41.840
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah.</v>

662
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.130
<v Speaker 5>I saw that video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like him being interviewed.</v>

663
00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.690
<v Speaker 5>I tell you the next day that shit was </v>
<v Speaker 5>scrubbed from the Internet and if I tell</v>

664
00:31:48.691 --> 00:31:49.950
<v Speaker 5>people I saw that video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said,</v>

665
00:31:49.951 --> 00:31:50.580
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're crazy.</v>

666
00:31:50.581 --> 00:31:51.180
<v Speaker 5>It was just like,</v>

667
00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.030
<v Speaker 3>so he really had it taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

668
00:31:54.031 --> 00:31:54.870
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

669
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.550
<v Speaker 3>that's like some l Ron Hubbard type </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

670
00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:02.040
<v Speaker 3>Ron Hubbard was quoted as saying that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really want to make money should </v>

671
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:02.040
<v Speaker 3>start a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he started.</v>

672
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:05.370
<v Speaker 3>Scientology wasn't bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell the truth.</v>

673
00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:09.810
<v Speaker 3>They got so much for coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

674
00:32:09.811 --> 00:32:11.670
<v Speaker 3>He's a fascinating character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

675
00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:17.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously there's a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of issues with him not telling </v>

676
00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:18.420
<v Speaker 3>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be the biggest problem.</v>

677
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:22.140
<v Speaker 3>The number one biggest problem might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the line that we can't trust them.</v>

678
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:26.430
<v Speaker 3>That is so crazy that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>president that just lies all the time,</v>

679
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.990
<v Speaker 3>but if you step away from the lying part</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you look at like what he's doing.</v>

680
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:36.110
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting is this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know too much about the </v>

681
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:38.781
<v Speaker 3>affordable care act or Obamacare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that a whole lot of people</v>

682
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:43.880
<v Speaker 3>voted against it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are now voting against repealing it.</v>

683
00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it either means one of two things,</v>

684
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:48.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means trump's plan is so bad that the</v>

685
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:52.370
<v Speaker 3>people hated obamacare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is even worse.</v>

686
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:58.660
<v Speaker 3>Or it's a bunch of people that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like trump and even though they </v>

687
00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.050
<v Speaker 3>didn't want obamacare in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

688
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.180
<v Speaker 3>no matter what trump comes up with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be like,</v>

689
00:33:02.181 --> 00:33:05.120
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to fight against that.</v>

690
00:33:05.121 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 3>Which maybe there's a few other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be this or it could be that,</v>

691
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.760
<v Speaker 3>but those two to me are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating.</v>

692
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:12.290
<v Speaker 3>That's like childish shit.</v>

693
00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.110
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Instead of solving shit.</v>

708
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:47.890
<v Speaker 5>on</v>

709
00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.310
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right when the president,</v>

710
00:33:51.311 --> 00:33:53.050
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of the president of the world,</v>

711
00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.720
<v Speaker 3>like you might not be running these </v>
<v Speaker 3>other countries,</v>

712
00:33:55.721 --> 00:33:58.840
<v Speaker 3>but everybody knows is the country that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has all the fucking bombs and it's crazy</v>

713
00:33:58.841 --> 00:34:00.070
<v Speaker 3>enough to use them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

714
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:05.250
<v Speaker 3>So this is the president of the arguably</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest army in the world's ever </v>

715
00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:09.631
<v Speaker 3>known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the commander in chief right </v>

716
00:34:09.631 --> 00:34:11.161
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They talk shit about people on twitter </v>

717
00:34:11.161 --> 00:34:12.190
<v Speaker 3>talking shit about people having plastic</v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>

718
00:34:12.191 --> 00:34:17.191
<v Speaker 3>Scars bleeding badly from a facelift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see New York so crazy.</v>

719
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.770
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy and people are so angry </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I get it.</v>

720
00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.630
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get everybody being angry.</v>

721
00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:27.610
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not what I'm saying.</v>

722
00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is so surreal.</v>

723
00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:34.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like everybody wanted change and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then when change came you're like,</v>

724
00:34:34.751 --> 00:34:34.980
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

725
00:34:34.981 --> 00:34:36.400
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This change is making money.</v>

726
00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:37.250
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

727
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:37.420
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

728
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.310
<v Speaker 3>We don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy's stealing money.</v>

729
00:34:39.311 --> 00:34:41.020
<v Speaker 3>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to make billions of dollars.</v>

730
00:34:41.021 --> 00:34:43.330
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's his tax returns?</v>

731
00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:48.570
<v Speaker 3>Show me the tax red turns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think what's going to come out of </v>

732
00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:53.101
<v Speaker 3>it is that there's so many people now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are politically motivated.</v>

733
00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.200
<v Speaker 3>There's so many people that are looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at this whole thing on,</v>

734
00:34:56.201 --> 00:34:56.560
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

735
00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:57.040
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

736
00:34:57.041 --> 00:34:59.740
<v Speaker 3>You can't just sit back and just let </v>
<v Speaker 3>this happen.</v>

737
00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:05.130
<v Speaker 3>Then you get someone who doesn't tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth as the president and that you </v>

738
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.250
<v Speaker 3>know how bad that fucks up kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

739
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.140
<v Speaker 3>When you're looking at like the highest </v>
<v Speaker 3>level of human being in the country.</v>

740
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:12.530
<v Speaker 3>Like if every kid says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who?</v>

741
00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.870
<v Speaker 3>Billy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you want to be when you grow up?</v>

742
00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.480
<v Speaker 3>I want to be approved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

743
00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.840
<v Speaker 3>that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

744
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Jam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to be the president.</v>

745
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:19.840
<v Speaker 3>You don't only want to be the vice </v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

746
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.450
<v Speaker 3>You want to be the command.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to be the number one guy that's</v>

747
00:35:22.451 --> 00:35:24.250
<v Speaker 3>an amputee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So possible.</v>

748
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:29.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's also like if the guy who's the </v>

749
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.690
<v Speaker 3>guy at the top of the list is embedded </v>
<v Speaker 3>than people that you know,</v>

750
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.900
<v Speaker 3>like his mind is petty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Petty.</v>

751
00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:35.910
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

752
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.730
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goofs people that just don't like his</v>

753
00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.550
<v Speaker 3>policies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll talk shit about like their plastic</v>

754
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:43.150
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

755
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:49.200
<v Speaker 3>A guy with fake hair is talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>people bleeding from surgery.</v>

756
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just like the whole hurt your </v>

757
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:54.870
<v Speaker 3>feelings thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lash out and hurt your feelings,</v>

758
00:35:54.871 --> 00:35:55.910
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's trying to do,</v>

759
00:35:55.930 --> 00:36:00.930
<v Speaker 3>trying to hurt their feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like someone just needs to like sit him </v>

760
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:00.930
<v Speaker 3>down and</v>

761
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.190
<v Speaker 5>I think they tried.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

762
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.750
<v Speaker 5>he ain't listening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the one that's his way.</v>

763
00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:07.570
<v Speaker 5>I know he is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He won but he won that way.</v>

764
00:36:07.571 --> 00:36:10.150
<v Speaker 5>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how I won my base.</v>

765
00:36:10.151 --> 00:36:10.660
<v Speaker 5>Likes that.</v>

766
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:15.740
<v Speaker 3>Got To let it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to let that go because you have </v>

767
00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.970
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a broader responsibility as the</v>

768
00:36:17.971 --> 00:36:19.080
<v Speaker 3>head guy.</v>

769
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.500
<v Speaker 5>I think he's getting feedback that </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough that he has the amazing ability </v>

770
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:29.660
<v Speaker 5>to ignore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to ignore things that I wouldn't ignore </v>

771
00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.450
<v Speaker 5>and now I think most people wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>ignore,</v>

772
00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.970
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like blow back,</v>

773
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:34.780
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

774
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.380
<v Speaker 5>like I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is what happened when one time I</v>

775
00:36:39.381 --> 00:36:44.020
<v Speaker 5>went to see a movie screening with Kevin</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hart was in it with Asha.</v>

776
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:47.300
<v Speaker 5>There's a long time ago and me and Kevin</v>
<v Speaker 5>with friends,</v>

777
00:36:47.301 --> 00:36:52.301
<v Speaker 5>we used to hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we went to the screening and we sat </v>

778
00:36:52.301 --> 00:36:55.481
<v Speaker 5>there and we watched the movie and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>movie was terrible.</v>

779
00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.170
<v Speaker 5>So then after the movie I'm gonna see </v>
<v Speaker 5>cap.</v>

780
00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:05.830
<v Speaker 5>So my worry is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck am I going to tell this </v>

781
00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:05.830
<v Speaker 5>guy because I can't lie to him about </v>
<v Speaker 5>this movie.</v>

782
00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:08.870
<v Speaker 5>And before I said anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he looked at me and said,</v>

783
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.520
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that movie was bad,</v>

784
00:37:10.521 --> 00:37:15.140
<v Speaker 5>but I was great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know what he was right here.</v>

785
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:22.100
<v Speaker 5>So he brushed off like how bad the movie</v>
<v Speaker 5>and found something.</v>

786
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:28.850
<v Speaker 5>This motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump can find something like he could </v>

787
00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.150
<v Speaker 5>heal here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What he needs to hear from whatever is </v>

788
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.750
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've probably enough people,</v>

789
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:37.050
<v Speaker 5>events,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even one or a few million that likes his</v>

790
00:37:37.051 --> 00:37:42.051
<v Speaker 5>tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we only see the people that hate </v>

791
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:42.051
<v Speaker 5>his tweets.</v>

792
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:42.051
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

793
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:46.571
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that like sweets</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all have American flags in their </v>

794
00:37:46.571 --> 00:37:46.571
<v Speaker 3>avatars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's gonna go for that.</v>

795
00:37:46.571 --> 00:37:49.220
<v Speaker 3>They have like eagles and Dobermans and </v>
<v Speaker 3>American flags guns.</v>

796
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:52.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>

797
00:37:52.191 --> 00:37:53.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the recent.</v>

798
00:37:53.091 --> 00:37:55.670
<v Speaker 3>He gave some recent speech where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought was really truck.</v>

799
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.400
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

800
00:37:56.401 --> 00:37:56.960
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

801
00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:02.020
<v Speaker 3>That was good one too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it was today where he was </v>

802
00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:02.600
<v Speaker 3>talking about unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being down,</v>

803
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:07.930
<v Speaker 3>how I'm of the economy is up and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different factors,</v>

804
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.790
<v Speaker 3>and they were talking about how no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentions it.</v>

805
00:38:10.791 --> 00:38:13.250
<v Speaker 3>And then I went to CNN and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

806
00:38:13.251 --> 00:38:16.100
<v Speaker 3>they're not even mentioning that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>given this speech.</v>

807
00:38:16.101 --> 00:38:17.630
<v Speaker 3>And he's saying all the like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much,</v>

808
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:19.550
<v Speaker 3>how much should that be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The number one story.</v>

809
00:38:19.551 --> 00:38:21.890
<v Speaker 3>Like what's the number one store when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to CNN,</v>

810
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:24.590
<v Speaker 3>go to the front page of CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do we got here?</v>

811
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.140
<v Speaker 3>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Highest stock market ever.</v>

812
00:38:27.141 --> 00:38:29.450
<v Speaker 3>Best economic numbers and years </v>
<v Speaker 3>unemployment.</v>

813
00:38:29.451 --> 00:38:32.060
<v Speaker 3>Lowest and 17 years wages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rising.</v>

814
00:38:32.061 --> 00:38:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Border secure.</v>

815
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But wait,</v>

816
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:36.790
<v Speaker 5>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

817
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:38.030
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's true though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

818
00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's probably true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

819
00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:45.540
<v Speaker 5>But these were the same things that will</v>
<v Speaker 5>happening when Obama was president and </v>

820
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:49.810
<v Speaker 5>he used to shit on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He used to say it's not rising enough.</v>

821
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:55.350
<v Speaker 5>The unemployed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the unemployment level should still be </v>

822
00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:58.441
<v Speaker 5>lower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or like when they put out the job gains </v>

823
00:38:58.441 --> 00:39:02.191
<v Speaker 5>or whatever they call that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Technically he would say that's not </v>

824
00:39:02.191 --> 00:39:03.640
<v Speaker 5>enough growth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there is a way to shit on everything,</v>

825
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:04.600
<v Speaker 5>but look at all this.</v>

826
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:09.960
<v Speaker 4>Look at what they show on CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like right away you see on the top,</v>

827
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:13.900
<v Speaker 4>trump weighed in on sons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>misleading claim breaking news.</v>

828
00:39:13.901 --> 00:39:18.901
<v Speaker 4>So you've got a negative trump ad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no inaccuracy in Donald Trump's junior </v>

829
00:39:18.901 --> 00:39:21.160
<v Speaker 4>statements,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about 2016 meeting with Russians.</v>

830
00:39:21.161 --> 00:39:25.030
<v Speaker 4>White House says White House comments on</v>
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump jr statements,</v>

831
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:30.330
<v Speaker 4>timeline of dot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So none of that as anything to do with </v>

832
00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:30.970
<v Speaker 4>unemployment being down or the economy </v>
<v Speaker 4>being up.</v>

833
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:35.920
<v Speaker 4>And this is like the front page of CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all negative.</v>

834
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 4>They're going to have to for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is not good.</v>

835
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 4>It's not good to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not given all the news.</v>

836
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:48.070
<v Speaker 4>You got to give the news like he does </v>
<v Speaker 4>plenty of stupid shit that you can cover</v>

837
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.970
<v Speaker 4>your as short of stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when good shit happens,</v>

838
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.420
<v Speaker 4>like when the economy is up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when unemployment is down,</v>

839
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:57.890
<v Speaker 4>he probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'd be reporting that.</v>

840
00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.100
<v Speaker 4>It seems like that's new,</v>

841
00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.200
<v Speaker 5>but all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if it's true,</v>

842
00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.940
<v Speaker 5>if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

843
00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:03.840
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your,</v>

844
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.670
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

845
00:40:05.671 --> 00:40:07.800
<v Speaker 5>you have a powerful twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your name is trump,</v>

846
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:13.190
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know this and you know the game </v>

847
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.190
<v Speaker 5>by now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

848
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:18.500
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you tweet about some woman's plastic </v>

849
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.910
<v Speaker 5>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to go in on you.</v>

850
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:22.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what's going to be on CNN,</v>

851
00:40:22.681 --> 00:40:23.070
<v Speaker 5>CNN,</v>

852
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:25.660
<v Speaker 4>but that's not CNN or MSNBC.</v>

853
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:30.650
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he is going to be on every news,</v>

854
00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:33.590
<v Speaker 5>all the media outlets that are not in </v>
<v Speaker 5>favor of,</v>

855
00:40:33.591 --> 00:40:35.210
<v Speaker 5>you are going to put that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

856
00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.520
<v Speaker 5>So everyone except Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone except Fox.</v>

857
00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:42.700
<v Speaker 5>So it's like stop putting shit that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people can use to cover up and use </v>

858
00:40:45.441 --> 00:40:48.740
<v Speaker 5>instead of the employment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unemployment stuff being down.</v>

859
00:40:48.741 --> 00:40:53.741
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you mean stop giving people ammo </v>

860
00:40:53.741 --> 00:40:53.741
<v Speaker 5>against you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

861
00:40:53.741 --> 00:40:55.580
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stop giving them information.</v>

862
00:40:56.330 --> 00:41:01.330
<v Speaker 5>Negative stuff that they can put on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>front of their website instead of </v>

863
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:03.230
<v Speaker 5>unemployment numbers going down.</v>

864
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's no way they're going to stop</v>

865
00:41:05.041 --> 00:41:09.540
<v Speaker 4>that as long as their stories like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Donald Jr secretly meeting with the</v>

866
00:41:09.541 --> 00:41:14.541
<v Speaker 4>Russians and not telling people and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>release in the emails and then saying </v>

867
00:41:14.541 --> 00:41:14.541
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

868
00:41:14.541 --> 00:41:18.651
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff and then it turns out </v>
<v Speaker 4>that trump was the one who coordinated </v>

869
00:41:18.651 --> 00:41:20.120
<v Speaker 4>the statement about it and like all that</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

870
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.660
<v Speaker 4>It's never gonna stop fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

871
00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.310
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing.</v>

872
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.300
<v Speaker 4>You got to write the good stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

873
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:30.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have write news.</v>

874
00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I feel like if I'm going to trust</v>

875
00:41:32.011 --> 00:41:34.050
<v Speaker 4>you for the news I want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

876
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.680
<v Speaker 3>would like to think as a person who </v>
<v Speaker 3>leans very left,</v>

877
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I would like to think that CNN is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be better than right wing agenda </v>

878
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:41.890
<v Speaker 3>websites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

879
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.000
<v Speaker 3>how can they not be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

880
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:45.040
<v Speaker 3>that's very disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very disappointing.</v>

881
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't have both thing.</v>

882
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:51.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't trust none of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't trust the news or the because </v>

883
00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:55.080
<v Speaker 5>you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because when Obama was president or just</v>

884
00:41:55.081 --> 00:42:00.081
<v Speaker 5>in presidents before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a lot of shit was phony and false.</v>

885
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.250
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they just did it.</v>

886
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:08.290
<v Speaker 5>Here's a funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they just did a study of like body </v>

887
00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:09.290
<v Speaker 5>cams on cops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

888
00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:15.240
<v Speaker 5>And just did a study and they said from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the study they see that cops treat black</v>

889
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:23.530
<v Speaker 5>people that they pull over worst than </v>
<v Speaker 5>they treat white people say </v>

890
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.060
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've been trying to tell you that,</v>

891
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:31.870
<v Speaker 5>but now it's only official when white </v>
<v Speaker 5>people did the study,</v>

892
00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.560
<v Speaker 5>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they like,</v>

893
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.220
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing is true,</v>

894
00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:40.190
<v Speaker 5>but been trying to tell you that shit is</v>
<v Speaker 5>true for a long time,</v>

895
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:46.300
<v Speaker 5>but that's just a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're not covering anything </v>

896
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.890
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't serve you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

897
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:54.430
<v Speaker 5>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not covering anything that </v>

898
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.430
<v Speaker 5>doesn't serve you anymore.</v>

899
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But their news,</v>

900
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:57.731
<v Speaker 3>they're not cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can understand like cops being racist </v>

901
00:42:57.731 --> 00:42:58.430
<v Speaker 3>that I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're,</v>

902
00:42:58.431 --> 00:43:03.431
<v Speaker 3>if you're the news source,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you have to just distribute the </v>

903
00:43:03.431 --> 00:43:07.661
<v Speaker 3>news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't selectively decide after 10 </v>

904
00:43:07.661 --> 00:43:10.530
<v Speaker 3>and can't hear you when you focus on you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to and you should never have.</v>

905
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.010
<v Speaker 3>Well they should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never.</v>

906
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:17.100
<v Speaker 3>They showed but then they just never </v>
<v Speaker 3>have obvious know what's really fucked </v>

907
00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.980
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That isn't really getting nearly as much</v>

908
00:43:18.981 --> 00:43:23.981
<v Speaker 3>press as I think it should get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or people haven't really been talking </v>

909
00:43:23.981 --> 00:43:26.831
<v Speaker 3>about that much is how many people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on that white lady from </v>

910
00:43:26.831 --> 00:43:30.110
<v Speaker 3>Australia who got shot unnecessarily by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cop.</v>

911
00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because she was a white lady from </v>

912
00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

913
00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 3>That look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what you say,</v>

914
00:43:35.511 --> 00:43:40.511
<v Speaker 3>what that is is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously it's a tragic accident </v>

915
00:43:40.511 --> 00:43:40.610
<v Speaker 3>because she was the one that called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cops and then they shot her,</v>

916
00:43:40.611 --> 00:43:45.611
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times they've done that to other </v>

917
00:43:45.611 --> 00:43:45.611
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

918
00:43:45.611 --> 00:43:46.970
<v Speaker 5>But that's my whole point is like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>news serves it.</v>

919
00:43:46.971 --> 00:43:50.150
<v Speaker 5>Remember talking about the scrolls and </v>
<v Speaker 5>how you can't.</v>

920
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.510
<v Speaker 5>If you found a skull,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the scrolls,</v>

921
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:57.520
<v Speaker 5>you can't help but make a story that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>in your favor.</v>

922
00:43:58.740 --> 00:43:59.360
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

923
00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:04.510
<v Speaker 5>I forgot the exact words you used,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just because your perception is</v>

924
00:44:04.521 --> 00:44:06.560
<v Speaker 5>going to come through in this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To me,</v>

925
00:44:06.561 --> 00:44:08.780
<v Speaker 5>that's how the news has been all my </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

926
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:14.020
<v Speaker 5>Like whoever owns the news makes news in</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

927
00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:19.110
<v Speaker 3>Faith always has been since William </v>
<v Speaker 3>Randolph hearst hearst publications,</v>

928
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:21.960
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to me the news has always been,</v>

929
00:44:21.961 --> 00:44:25.200
<v Speaker 3>even if it was slightly inaccurate </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

930
00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.910
<v Speaker 3>it's just being growingly not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

931
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.670
<v Speaker 3>but that drives people fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean that it does people,</v>

932
00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:37.120
<v Speaker 5>because like when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a stupid little kid and I was </v>

933
00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.881
<v Speaker 5>watching the news just stupid enough to </v>
<v Speaker 5>think like when somebody's telling me </v>

934
00:44:40.881 --> 00:44:42.300
<v Speaker 5>what's going on in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

935
00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:47.660
<v Speaker 5>the news is God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like because they thought that it was </v>

936
00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:48.060
<v Speaker 5>all real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was like just like,</v>

937
00:44:48.061 --> 00:44:50.640
<v Speaker 5>not just like a kid that's like you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't know any better,</v>

938
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:52.590
<v Speaker 5>but how did these people know </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything?</v>

939
00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:57.660
<v Speaker 5>They're telling you everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're kind of getting programmed to </v>

940
00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:01.371
<v Speaker 5>believe this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So people are getting programmed to </v>

941
00:45:01.371 --> 00:45:01.371
<v Speaker 5>believe Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 5>MSNBC,</v>

942
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:06.950
<v Speaker 5>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they don't know any better and they </v>

943
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:09.711
<v Speaker 5>get an angry based on what they're being</v>
<v Speaker 5>told and we're not being told </v>

944
00:45:09.711 --> 00:45:11.010
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not being told everything.</v>

945
00:45:11.011 --> 00:45:13.200
<v Speaker 5>Like you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not showing both sides,</v>

946
00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 5>right or everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not.</v>

947
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.300
<v Speaker 5>There's no reason for the people who own</v>
<v Speaker 5>the news to be fair.</v>

948
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:25.640
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just have to get people to pay </v>

949
00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:26.340
<v Speaker 5>attention to get people get so they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The third thing is how do I make money?</v>

950
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.260
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be outrageous.</v>

951
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.780
<v Speaker 5>It got to be outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got gotta we got to,</v>

952
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.470
<v Speaker 5>even though we got to follow this Russia</v>
<v Speaker 5>story and we got to make money.</v>

953
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.530
<v Speaker 5>This is a soap opera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is game of thrones going on,</v>

954
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:41.220
<v Speaker 5>on fucking TV.</v>

955
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:46.250
<v Speaker 5>they milk the shit out of Katrina and </v>
<v Speaker 5>any tragedy and they're just milking </v>

960
00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:56.760
<v Speaker 5>like it's almost as if somebody wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 5>script and we're going today,</v>

970
00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:24.600
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some moments on the show where </v>

971
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:24.600
<v Speaker 3>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that would never happen.</v>

972

<v Speaker 3>The president's daughter is always </v>

974
00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:31.660
<v Speaker 3>behind him with a giant smile on her </v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

975
00:46:31.661 --> 00:46:33.340
<v Speaker 3>Every time he says anything and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>clapping.</v>

976
00:46:33.341 --> 00:46:35.380
<v Speaker 3>Like today,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's what a lot of countries are stuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>in right now,</v>

1016
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>new terms or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just locked his ass up.</v>

1032
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:52.520
<v Speaker 3>He opposed something that Putin wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

1033
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it gets heavier and heavier as you </v>

<v Speaker 1>Like they can just act with that stuff </v>

1230
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:33.550
<v Speaker 1>episode and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that boat's not real.</v>

1231
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:35.230

<v Speaker 1>crazy looking boat cutting through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>

1233

<v Speaker 1>That's not a real boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God damn it looks like a real boat.</v>

<v Speaker 1>money on those episodes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're getting deep into the lives of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these strange characters and sociopath </v>

1269
00:59:26.401 --> 00:59:29.540
<v Speaker 1>and you kind of understand their angst </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you started rooting for them.</v>

1270
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could.</v>

1271
00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Even in the Americans they're rushing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you start rooting for them.</v>

1272
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:36.410
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1273
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:41.770
<v Speaker 1>you want them to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really are from another </v>

1274
00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:41.770
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe maybe,</v>

1275
00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:46.240
<v Speaker 1>but if you watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch a few episodes and see if you </v>

1276
00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:46.240
<v Speaker 1>don't like start rooting for the Russian</v>
<v Speaker 1>space is how.</v>

1277
00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.870
<v Speaker 1>This is how I picture the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect APP.</v>

1278
00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:52.160
<v Speaker 1>You find out five minutes into the show </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're Russian spies.</v>

1279
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:57.170
<v Speaker 1>The FBI kicks the door down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of white guys guns blazing,</v>

1280
00:59:57.410 --> 01:00:02.410
<v Speaker 1>pointed out them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They immediately shipped them to </v>

1281
01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Guantanamo Bay and then put the House </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sale,</v>

1282
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.960
<v Speaker 1>for sale and they make a profit off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house by house.</v>

1283
01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:11.090
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they did a scan to the spy </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1284
01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Find out if they scan the spy house to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out what kind of spy shit they got.</v>

1285
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Because you know Russia's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just let you have a spy house by herself</v>

1286
01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:22.340
<v Speaker 1>and you haven't parties and we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>googled the other day to check in.</v>

1287
01:00:22.341 --> 01:00:27.341
<v Speaker 1>We saw barbecue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have blurbing you working us by </v>

1288
01:00:27.341 --> 01:00:29.810
<v Speaker 1>which one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one tends to be turned in American</v>

1289
01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.390
<v Speaker 1>easy blurb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acute time or spite time.</v>

1290
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.260
<v Speaker 1>You'll get the spine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1291
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:38.750
<v Speaker 1>So they probably like they gotta be </v>
<v Speaker 1>spying on the spies for sure.</v>

1292
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trust them.</v>

1293
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Spy just moved to New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a good time to start doing coke.</v>

1294
01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>They know you could get turned out for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1295
01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you get turned over here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

1296
01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people are not gonna kill you.</v>

1297
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they know you're there,</v>

1298
01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>so they'll send somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't even know who the person </v>

1299
01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like some La femme.</v>

1300
01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Nikita chick comes over your house </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling vacuums or something.</v>

1301
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>You opened the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She shoots you in the Dick.</v>

1302
01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:10.280

<v Speaker 1>Could be.</v>

1303
01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.320
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand why they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>use that strategy.</v>

1304
01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Like they hire someone to pretend to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>American flying across the world.</v>

1305
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Set them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go get information in Montclair.</v>

1362
01:03:49.721 --> 01:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>football and.</v>

1363
01:03:50.591 --> 01:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Americans around.</v>

1364
01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

1365
01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:57.040
<v Speaker 1>do you like it when they are around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

1366
01:03:57.090 --> 01:04:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I just say soccer just so people </v>

1367
01:04:02.090 --> 01:04:02.090
<v Speaker 1>know what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1368
01:04:02.090 --> 01:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was thinking.</v>

1369
01:04:02.321 --> 01:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>You'd probably say football when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>around other people.</v>

1370
01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm talking to somebody from,</v>

1371
01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'm talking to a friend</v>

1372
01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.340
<v Speaker 5>from England and I'll say soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they'll get mad at you.</v>

1373
01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:12.050
<v Speaker 5>Now</v>

1374
01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:15.340
<v Speaker 1>some people have disappointed though </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll correct it.</v>

1375
01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it won't,</v>

1376
01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.650
<v Speaker 1>it won't be a sticking point in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

1377
01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a sticking point in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1378
01:04:22.421 --> 01:04:23.980
<v Speaker 1>So you just stick with soccer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1379
01:04:23.981 --> 01:04:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've never said football to me,</v>

1380
01:04:25.511 --> 01:04:30.511
<v Speaker 1>but I always suspected it was packed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew something was going on this </v>

1381
01:04:30.511 --> 01:04:34.890
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker so into that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he uses the proper terminology </v>

1382
01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:41.310
<v Speaker 1>when I'm not around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1383
01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Like someone will say you want to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>billiards and I'll let it slide.</v>

1384
01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1385
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1386
01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

1387
01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pocket and pool billiards is a game that</v>

1388
01:04:52.001 --> 01:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>you play with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1389
01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>there's no holes in the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They received that game.</v>

1390
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>

1391
01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:01.980
<v Speaker 1>there's like things in the table now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's others in Italian version of it </v>

1392
01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:02.980
<v Speaker 1>where they play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have these little pins.</v>

1393
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:08.190
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking a bumper pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think three cushioned billiards is a </v>

1394
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:11.620
<v Speaker 1>very strange game where and that used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the premier game by the way back,</v>

1395
01:05:11.621 --> 01:05:14.140
<v Speaker 1>like in the willy hoppy days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like way,</v>

1396
01:05:14.141 --> 01:05:16.000
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way back in the,</v>

1397
01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>I guess probably the turn of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

1398
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:23.100
<v Speaker 3>the turn of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had thousands of pool halls and </v>

1399
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:28.921
<v Speaker 3>billiard halls in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but pool halls like where there's a hole</v>

1400
01:05:29.201 --> 01:05:31.060
<v Speaker 3>in the table and the boss to fall into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hole.</v>

1401
01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Those were thought to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the game of.</v>

1402
01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:38.740
<v Speaker 3>And like dirt bags,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gentlemen played billiards.</v>

1403
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:43.950
<v Speaker 3>They played three cushioned billiards </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was actually a part of the </v>

1404
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:47.701
<v Speaker 3>scene in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Hustler with Paul Newman and Jackie </v>

1405
01:05:47.701 --> 01:05:49.090
<v Speaker 3>gleason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul Newman goes over this dude's house.</v>

1406
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.770
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget the gentleman's name,</v>

1407
01:05:50.771 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 3>but he's a very famous actors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1408
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Great scene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

1409
01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:59.180
<v Speaker 3>they're supposed to gamble because this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's a big fish and he has this big </v>

1410
01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:02.311
<v Speaker 3>mansion and Paul Newman is this hustler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes over the guy's mansion and the </v>

1411
01:06:02.311 --> 01:06:03.640
<v Speaker 3>guy doesn't have a pool table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a billiards table.</v>

1412
01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:05.010
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1413
01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:08.680
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mob guy who's backing Paul Newman on</v>

1414
01:06:08.681 --> 01:06:11.110
<v Speaker 3>the bet doesn't believe that he could </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat this guy.</v>

1415
01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:16.980
<v Speaker 3>And so they have to figure out like what</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do because it's totally different </v>

1416
01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:17.470
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was the game of gentlemen.</v>

1417
01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:22.860
<v Speaker 3>Three cushioned billiards is a game </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's you have to hit a ball and </v>

1418
01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:26.611
<v Speaker 3>then your ball has to go three cushions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means bounced into three rails and </v>

1419
01:06:26.611 --> 01:06:30.010
<v Speaker 3>then come back and hit the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy.</v>

1420
01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:30.790
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1421
01:06:30.791 --> 01:06:33.910
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting game because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>all about angles you ever played.</v>

1422
01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:34.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played it,</v>

1423
01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:36.640
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to do.</v>

1424
01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:41.880
<v Speaker 3>You have to really understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of factors that come into </v>

1425
01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.030
<v Speaker 3>play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it is right here.</v>

1426
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:48.130
<v Speaker 3>This is the actual game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do shit like that when you play </v>

1427
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:48.130
<v Speaker 3>pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1428
01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:48.850
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1429
01:06:48.851 --> 01:06:51.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely moved the ball around and I</v>

1430
01:06:51.251 --> 01:06:54.600
<v Speaker 3>understand some angles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like this stuff like what this guy's</v>

1431
01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.300
<v Speaker 3>doing right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1432
01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.700
<v Speaker 3>this is like super complicated stuff to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to help you win this thing.</v>

1433
01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:04.030
<v Speaker 3>You just get a point every time you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>three cushions,</v>

1434
01:07:04.031 --> 01:07:06.390
<v Speaker 3>like see how he's doing this right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing that.</v>

1435
01:07:06.391 --> 01:07:08.440
<v Speaker 3>It bounced off the railroad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hits that and then it's going to hit the</v>

1436
01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:11.710
<v Speaker 3>other one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like doing stuff like that on purpose.</v>

1437
01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:16.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're doing it on purpose is </v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to do like you to to </v>

1438
01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:21.781
<v Speaker 3>really understand how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean sometimes you're going four and </v>

1439
01:07:21.781 --> 01:07:25.381
<v Speaker 3>five and even six rails to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>something do what you wanted to do </v>

1440
01:07:25.381 --> 01:07:29.161
<v Speaker 3>because it was the only option you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the position of the ball on the </v>

1441
01:07:29.161 --> 01:07:29.890
<v Speaker 3>table relative to the position of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ball you're trying to hit.</v>

1442
01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:34.190
<v Speaker 3>If you have to go three rails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you see like these crazy tricky shots</v>

1443
01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:36.820
<v Speaker 3>these guys do where they're calculating </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ball,</v>

1444
01:07:36.821 --> 01:07:41.821
<v Speaker 3>going three rails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting another ball and then going to </v>

1445
01:07:41.821 --> 01:07:41.821
<v Speaker 3>rails and then hitting a third ball.</v>

1446
01:07:41.821 --> 01:07:43.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the way they do it is amazing.</v>

1447
01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.950
<v Speaker 3>It's really amazing how many balls are </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the table that he's three balls.</v>

1448
01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Three balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1449
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:51.280
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating.</v>

1450
01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:55.420
<v Speaker 3>I never got into it because I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that it would become addictive,</v>

1451
01:07:55.421 --> 01:07:57.970
<v Speaker 3>just like pools addictive and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the time.</v>

1452
01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:01.660
<v Speaker 3>I just can't be fucking with some new </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to get addicted to it.</v>

1453
01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.170
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you're going to start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1454
01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:06.190
<v Speaker 3>checking out some soccer I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1455
01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.770
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that weird though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How they do this?</v>

1456
01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:12.040
<v Speaker 3>See he's going to hit that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to bounce up and hit the other one</v>

1457
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:15.010
<v Speaker 3>and they are planning this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's interesting.</v>

1458
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:20.290
<v Speaker 3>And the guys who are real good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times it translates very good </v>

1459
01:08:20.290 --> 01:08:21.800
<v Speaker 3>into pool too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it would.</v>

1460
01:08:22.050 --> 01:08:27.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they figure out how to move the </v>

1461
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:27.050
<v Speaker 3>ball better than other people.</v>

1462
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:31.220
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a guy named Aaron Ray is </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's widely considered to be </v>

1463
01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:35.051
<v Speaker 3>probably the best pool player of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and he plays this game really good.</v>

1464
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.630
<v Speaker 3>He plays this game really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any place.</v>

1465
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:44.110
<v Speaker 3>Another game that the Filipinos like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>play called rotation and rotation is a </v>

1466
01:08:44.631 --> 01:08:48.530
<v Speaker 3>game like you know how you play nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>ball and shoot one through nine.</v>

1467
01:08:48.531 --> 01:08:50.600
<v Speaker 3>You got to shoot the balls in order </v>
<v Speaker 3>rotation.</v>

1468
01:08:50.601 --> 01:08:52.730
<v Speaker 3>They do that with 15 balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1469
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:57.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Filipinos are some of the best players </v>

1470
01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:59.720
<v Speaker 3>in the world and it's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the the game of billiards,</v>

1471
01:08:59.810 --> 01:09:04.810
<v Speaker 3>pocket billiards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say I guess regular billiards </v>

1472
01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:07.510
<v Speaker 3>to got brought to them during World War </v>
<v Speaker 3>II when they had a American.</v>

1473
01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:12.810
<v Speaker 3>Gis would be in the Philippines </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently during the war when people </v>

1474
01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:18.191
<v Speaker 3>would go over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would set up pool tables and Gis </v>

1475
01:09:18.191 --> 01:09:21.240
<v Speaker 3>would go to bars and they figured out </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to play pool and it became a great </v>

1476
01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.610
<v Speaker 3>thing for the Filipinos who love </v>
<v Speaker 3>gambling,</v>

1477
01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:27.930
<v Speaker 3>love gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they would just play pool and gamble </v>

1478
01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:27.930
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

1479
01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.780
<v Speaker 3>So some of the best players in the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>have come out of the Philippines.</v>

1480
01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.600
<v Speaker 3>Manila has some of the best players </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>

1481
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:38.050
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the top guys like that guy effort </v>

1482
01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:38.050
<v Speaker 3>and ray is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's from the Philippines.</v>

1483
01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Francisco boosted monitoring where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best of all time he's from the </v>

1484
01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:44.111
<v Speaker 3>Philippines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like you keep going on and on </v>

1485
01:09:44.111 --> 01:09:44.111
<v Speaker 3>and on and on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's A.</v>

1486
01:09:44.111 --> 01:09:46.490
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole gang of these dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little tiny killers,</v>

1487
01:09:46.730 --> 01:09:48.680
<v Speaker 3>so I never played pool against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Filipino.</v>

1488
01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:50.710
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm learning there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real quiet,</v>

1489
01:09:51.230 --> 01:09:53.270
<v Speaker 3>real friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll smash you.</v>

1490
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:55.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the best players in the world.</v>

1491
01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:58.650
<v Speaker 3>It's just a huge sport over there as </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay.</v>

1492
01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.470
<v Speaker 3>It's on television all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Over there.</v>

1493
01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:06.040
<v Speaker 5>Pool is like the first video game </v>
<v Speaker 5>because because it's,</v>

1494
01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:11.980
<v Speaker 5>it's a pool and just a table and you go </v>
<v Speaker 5>into a bar and it's there.</v>

1495
01:10:12.471 --> 01:10:17.471
<v Speaker 5>You put money in there and you start </v>
<v Speaker 5>playing it before they were graphics or </v>

1496
01:10:17.471 --> 01:10:19.550
<v Speaker 5>programs or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

1497
01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:24.640
<v Speaker 5>it's just a game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the first game you can play </v>

1498
01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.030
<v Speaker 5>without before video games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1499
01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.120
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1500
01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:30.420
<v Speaker 3>It was like an arcade game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like dark.</v>

1501
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and darks here.</v>

1502
01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:36.310
<v Speaker 3>They would play I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they started calling it pool.</v>

1503
01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.310
<v Speaker 3>I know actually they started calling it </v>
<v Speaker 3>pool because it was a gambling thing.</v>

1504
01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:42.430
<v Speaker 3>The thing that they would pool their </v>
<v Speaker 3>money together,</v>

1505
01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:45.090
<v Speaker 3>bed on stuff and that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1506
01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:48.220
<v Speaker 3>that's how pool got its bad name versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>billiards,</v>

1507
01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:51.340
<v Speaker 3>but like darts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they must bet on dark.</v>

1508
01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.660
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And people would bid on dots.</v>

1509
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:54.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dots is a big sport in England.</v>

1510
01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:56.280
<v Speaker 5>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's on TV.</v>

1511
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.460
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

1512
01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:58.470
<v Speaker 3>saw it on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw snicker,</v>

1513
01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:00.720
<v Speaker 3>snicker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snicker.</v>

1514
01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:04.680
<v Speaker 3>They call it sneaker is pool or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>

1515
01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.750
<v Speaker 3>Sneakers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A totally different game.</v>

1516
01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.510
<v Speaker 3>And it's on a giant table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1517
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:13.860
<v Speaker 3>The a pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A pool table is nine by and a half,</v>

1518
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.110
<v Speaker 3>which means four and a half foot wide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine foot long.</v>

1519
01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:19.410
<v Speaker 3>That's a real legit pool table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also 10 by fives.</v>

1520
01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Ten by five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pool tables are just starting to make a </v>

1521
01:11:24.650 --> 01:11:25.470
<v Speaker 3>comeback as a company called diamond and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make a 10 by five.</v>

1522
01:11:25.471 --> 01:11:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a big deal because the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>high end players like the extra space at</v>

1523
01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.400
<v Speaker 3>the 10 by five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think it makes you play a better </v>

1524
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:35.400
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But snookers 12 feet.</v>

1525
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.230
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1526
01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:39.270
<v Speaker 3>It's 12 by six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So giant fucking table.</v>

1527
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 3>And these dudes have a tiny little ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tiny ass little ball.</v>

1528
01:11:43.441 --> 01:11:47.610
<v Speaker 3>It's way smaller than a pool ball and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the holes are really tiny and the cut of</v>

1529
01:11:47.611 --> 01:11:48.930
<v Speaker 3>the rails is very different.</v>

1530
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:52.470
<v Speaker 3>Like you can kind of rattle a ball into </v>
<v Speaker 3>a pool table hole.</v>

1531
01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:57.680
<v Speaker 3>It'll kind of drop in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to hit like this is a </v>

1532
01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:58.680
<v Speaker 3>snooker table size of this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>table.</v>

1533
01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:03.360
<v Speaker 3>Now this is Ronnie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Sullivan who's one of the greatest of</v>

1534
01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:08.361
<v Speaker 3>all time and he's a fucking wizard and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the greatest game of snooker </v>

1535
01:12:08.361 --> 01:12:09.160
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because he just.</v>

1536
01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:13.320
<v Speaker 3>He does everything perfect and he shoots</v>
<v Speaker 3>his whole rack perfect.</v>

1537
01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:18.650
<v Speaker 3>But snickers a totally different game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like see how the sneaker rather that </v>

1538
01:12:18.650 --> 01:12:22.521
<v Speaker 3>goes in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A sneaker that he shot the ball in and </v>

1539
01:12:22.521 --> 01:12:22.650
<v Speaker 3>then the ball comes back up again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes back up.</v>

1540
01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:23.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1541
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:24.580
<v Speaker 3>The black ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1542
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:26.760
<v Speaker 3>every time he shoots the black that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>no scratching.</v>

1543
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:28.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can scratch.</v>

1544
01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.940
<v Speaker 3>I did don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the game.</v>

1545
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a bunch of points and all </v>

1546
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:35.010
<v Speaker 3>these different things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

1547
01:12:35.011 --> 01:12:39.000
<v Speaker 3>but see how he knocks that a black ball </v>
<v Speaker 3>in after the black ball goes in,</v>

1548
01:12:39.001 --> 01:12:42.450
<v Speaker 3>the guy pulls it out and he puts it back</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the spot and then he has to shoot one</v>

1549
01:12:42.451 --> 01:12:44.640
<v Speaker 3>of the reds again and then after he </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoots the red,</v>

1550
01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.760
<v Speaker 3>then he goes and shoots the black again </v>
<v Speaker 3>and every time he's doing it see that </v>

1551
01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:49.760
<v Speaker 3>stack of balls.</v>

1552
01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:54.250
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to collide into those balls </v>
<v Speaker 3>to open them up and if he can open them </v>

1553
01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:58.101
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he can get it to a place where he </v>

1554
01:12:58.101 --> 01:12:58.350
<v Speaker 3>can separate those balls and make them </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1555
01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:03.380
<v Speaker 3>So Watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to make this red ball and </v>

1556
01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.571
<v Speaker 3>then he's going to pound up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he see on an angle would that black </v>

1557
01:13:05.571 --> 01:13:06.240
<v Speaker 3>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as he shoot that black ball in,</v>

1558
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:09.300
<v Speaker 3>he's going to smack into those other </v>
<v Speaker 3>balls being see that.</v>

1559
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see now again,</v>

1560
01:13:11.731 --> 01:13:15.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know this game very well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I understand pool so I see what he's</v>

1561
01:13:15.751 --> 01:13:17.610
<v Speaker 3>doing with those balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew he was going to do that,</v>

1562
01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:20.370
<v Speaker 3>so now he's just going to pocket these </v>
<v Speaker 3>balls in the side,</v>

1563
01:13:20.371 --> 01:13:25.371
<v Speaker 3>but you're dealing with the tiniest </v>
<v Speaker 3>little fucking hole and they have tiny </v>

1564
01:13:25.371 --> 01:13:28.230
<v Speaker 3>little tips on their pool cues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of like a pool cue,</v>

1565
01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:29.130
<v Speaker 3>but it's all.</v>

1566
01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.350
<v Speaker 3>They're all made of ash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very different than.</v>

1567
01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ashwood.</v>

1568
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:38.210
<v Speaker 3>Whereas I'm most American pool cues that</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least the shafts are made out of </v>

1569
01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:43.131
<v Speaker 3>maple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of weird variables </v>

1570
01:13:43.131 --> 01:13:43.410
<v Speaker 3>like ash is very stiff but also very </v>
<v Speaker 3>light,</v>

1571
01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:47.160
<v Speaker 3>so their game is very different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's also very similar.</v>

1572
01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:49.080
<v Speaker 3>He's also thinking very fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1573
01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:51.600
<v Speaker 3>he's a wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy's a super genius,</v>

1574
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:54.630
<v Speaker 3>but like I wouldn't have taken my second</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot yet.</v>

1575
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:57.480
<v Speaker 3>I know he's like clearing the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's doing this every day.</v>

1576
01:13:57.481 --> 01:13:59.910
<v Speaker 3>You don't realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you gotta think he's also.</v>

1577
01:13:59.911 --> 01:14:02.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm extremely wealthy because of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

1578
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:07.760
<v Speaker 3>This is not a game like American pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a game like more akin to like </v>

1579
01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:11.120
<v Speaker 3>golf in terms of like purses and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>much money these guys can make it.</v>

1580
01:14:11.130 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 3>At least it was at one point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think somehow or another it's dried up</v>

1581
01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:19.780
<v Speaker 3>a think like snuckered doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have the same respect that it </v>

1582
01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:19.780
<v Speaker 3>used to have.</v>

1583
01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:23.560
<v Speaker 3>There's been also a few controversies in</v>
<v Speaker 3>England or guys got busted,</v>

1584
01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:25.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to people about fixing games.</v>

1585
01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:28.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That gets ugly.</v>

1586
01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:31.060
<v Speaker 3>That old man is like the ball boy in </v>
<v Speaker 3>tennis.</v>

1587
01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:36.230
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grabbing the ball at the hole and </v>

1588
01:14:36.230 --> 01:14:36.230
<v Speaker 3>putting it on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he does it with gloves on,</v>

1589
01:14:36.230 --> 01:14:38.140
<v Speaker 3>like a gentleman that actually the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gloves have a purpose.</v>

1590
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:43.510
<v Speaker 3>The gloves are so your hand oils don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get on the ball because the balls are </v>

1591
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:46.340
<v Speaker 3>made out of what's called phenolic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a type of thing.</v>

1592
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:48.580
<v Speaker 3>It's like a composite plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1593
01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:53.850
<v Speaker 3>and they're super hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you touch those balls that are </v>

1594
01:14:53.850 --> 01:14:56.251
<v Speaker 3>out there on that table and they're like</v>
<v Speaker 3>super hard and they used to make them </v>

1595
01:14:56.251 --> 01:14:59.290
<v Speaker 3>with either clay or ivory back then way </v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the day.</v>

1596
01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1597
01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.470
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times they made the cue ball </v>
<v Speaker 3>with ivory and then the other balls it'd</v>

1598
01:15:04.471 --> 01:15:08.170
<v Speaker 3>be made out of clay or sometimes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole everything would be made at clay.</v>

1599
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:11.590
<v Speaker 3>But they were like these dead balls that</v>
<v Speaker 3>were really tough to move around.</v>

1600
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:13.780
<v Speaker 3>And then when they figured out this </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenolic stuff,</v>

1601
01:15:14.050 --> 01:15:16.690
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets super slick.</v>

1602
01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:21.070
<v Speaker 3>So the greases from your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you touch a ball,</v>

1603
01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:26.280
<v Speaker 3>the oils on your hands will actually put</v>
<v Speaker 3>a residue on the ball and it'll affect </v>

1604
01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.090
<v Speaker 3>the way the ball moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the game off.</v>

1605
01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:33.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you see dudes touching cue balls </v>

1606
01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.641
<v Speaker 3>and balls and you're playing pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like anybody who really knows how to </v>

1607

1620
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:16.000
<v Speaker 3>after it collides with a ball and knocks</v>

<v Speaker 2>You gotta keep your behavior in check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be yourself.</v>

1739
01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:41.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many people just live out </v>

1744
01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:57.740
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I think I'm not saying enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the other people that are </v>

1745
01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:58.680
<v Speaker 2>saying shit to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1746
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:04.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if you're in an office with 50 </v>

1747
01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:04.890
<v Speaker 2>people and you hate 10 of them and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them's your boss,</v>

1748
01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:06.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1749
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:11.960
<v Speaker 2>And there's a bunch of attention seeking</v>
<v Speaker 2>dipshits in the staff taking credit for </v>

1750
01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.320
<v Speaker 2>other people's work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say anything.</v>

1751
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1752
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:21.950
<v Speaker 2>your wife or your husband or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many people live in hell.</v>

1753
01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:27.380
<v Speaker 2>How many people live in hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that just stuck all day with </v>

1754
01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:32.121
<v Speaker 2>dipshits saying dumb things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's why people listen to your </v>

1755
01:22:32.121 --> 01:22:34.560
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's there.</v>

1756
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you watch a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like somebody on tv,</v>

1757
01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:42.180
<v Speaker 2>you watch a James Bond movie and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing things that you can't do,</v>

1758
01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:48.020
<v Speaker 2>like just having a podcast where you say</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck you want and just </v>

1759
01:22:48.301 --> 01:22:53.301
<v Speaker 2>living like people live in the office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to live through you.</v>

1760
01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:55.470
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Through your podcast.</v>

1761
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:59.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just keep doing what you're doing sort</v>

1762
01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:00.960
<v Speaker 2>of pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel pressure.</v>

1763
01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:04.560
<v Speaker 2>You got to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that pressure.</v>

1764
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>

1765
01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:10.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it may be partly why trump is</v>

1766
01:23:10.181 --> 01:23:15.181
<v Speaker 2>so popular because he's the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>president to just talk shit like it's </v>

1767
01:23:16.181 --> 01:23:20.520
<v Speaker 2>truly a powerful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you build a powerful man,</v>

1768
01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.480
<v Speaker 2>most powerful man in the world are </v>
<v Speaker 2>censored,</v>

1769
01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:26.920
<v Speaker 2>but this is the first uncensored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most powerful man in the world.</v>

1770
01:23:26.921 --> 01:23:31.921
<v Speaker 2>He's truly exuding his power on a don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>give a fuck level,</v>

1771
01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:35.830
<v Speaker 2>but he knows a little bit of a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not enough of a change.</v>

1772
01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He only gives a fuck if he gets dinged a</v>

1773
01:23:39.071 --> 01:23:39.820
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's.</v>

1774
01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:41.260
<v Speaker 2>He not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't pull back.</v>

1775
01:23:41.261 --> 01:23:44.020
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he swats back defensively.</v>

1776
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a way that a listener would want to </v>

1777
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.070
<v Speaker 2>swap back defensively at work.</v>

1778
01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still can because they.</v>

1779
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Trump seems so less worried about his </v>
<v Speaker 2>job and more like,</v>

1780
01:23:56.710 --> 01:24:01.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to be me and that's when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle quit the Chappelle show.</v>

1781
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:04.000
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of people found freedom in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1782
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:06.400
<v Speaker 2>That's why he's so mythical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1783
01:24:06.401 --> 01:24:07.270
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1784
01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1785
01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people make $50,000,000,</v>

1786
01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:14.400
<v Speaker 2>but how many people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn down $50,</v>

1787
01:24:14.401 --> 01:24:16.480
<v Speaker 2>million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's fewer of those.</v>

1788
01:24:16.690 --> 01:24:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1789
01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:19.270
<v Speaker 2>just one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just one.</v>

1790
01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he also didn't do standup in any </v>

1791
01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:27.460
<v Speaker 2>scheduled performance for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just would show up places.</v>

1792
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he still does that.</v>

1793
01:24:28.481 --> 01:24:29.910
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he just uses to.</v>

1794
01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna show up this place.</v>

1795
01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they put out an email or </v>

1796
01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:36.820
<v Speaker 2>however he just shows me about when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in Denver.</v>

1797
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh Yeah?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1798
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:38.730
<v Speaker 2>Showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1799
01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I go to the greenroom.</v>

1800
01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Dave's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1801
01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:41.170
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

1802
01:24:41.890 --> 01:24:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan.</v>

1803
01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1804
01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:47.470
<v Speaker 2>that's his way I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of just being free.</v>

1805
01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1806
01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it was.</v>

1807
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:53.790
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that he has scheduled is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the radio city thing and that's because </v>

1808
01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's radio city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to schedule.</v>

1809
01:24:55.301 --> 01:24:57.310
<v Speaker 2>What does he do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does a regular show there.</v>

1810
01:24:57.370 --> 01:24:59.110
<v Speaker 2>He's going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did it a few years ago.</v>

1811
01:24:59.111 --> 01:25:04.111
<v Speaker 2>Now he's going to do like maybe a week </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half or two weeks of shows there </v>

1812
01:25:04.111 --> 01:25:04.900
<v Speaker 2>and he's going to guess on it like </v>
<v Speaker 2>musical guests,</v>

1813
01:25:05.170 --> 01:25:09.850
<v Speaker 2>comics some days like as that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have a comics ball party.</v>

1814
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:10.940
<v Speaker 2>That's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1815
01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:13.150
<v Speaker 2>that's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1816
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:14.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

1817
01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:19.880
<v Speaker 2>he does represent what we all considered</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be like the highest standard of a </v>

1818
01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:21.870
<v Speaker 2>real comic artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1819
01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:22.840
<v Speaker 2>when uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when uh,</v>

1820
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:27.990
<v Speaker 2>you get together with a group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Comedians and you look at like who's </v>

1821
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:29.140
<v Speaker 2>doing it the right way.</v>

1822
01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:34.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's other ways to do it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are really like more commercially </v>

1823
01:25:34.650 --> 01:25:35.500
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louis is more commercially successful in</v>

1824
01:25:35.501 --> 01:25:37.120
<v Speaker 2>terms of like constantly chasing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1825
01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:41.530
<v Speaker 2>but David's just also has that mythical </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality to it as well.</v>

1826
01:25:41.531 --> 01:25:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Like you're talking about turning down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the $50 million.</v>

1827
01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:46.990
<v Speaker 2>That has a big factor in how we look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it too.</v>

1828
01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:50.380
<v Speaker 2>That's his biggest TV credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's turning down and John.</v>

1829
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:55.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also like walking away from the </v>

1830
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:55.470
<v Speaker 2>greatest sketch show the world's ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>known.</v>

1831
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:57.310
<v Speaker 2>That is still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me in my eyes,</v>

1832
01:25:57.311 --> 01:25:59.860
<v Speaker 2>the greatest sketch show of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a lot of funny.</v>

1833
01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.090
<v Speaker 2>That shit on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1834
01:26:01.091 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 2>as far as like hit or miss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the best ever.</v>

1835
01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:09.380
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't compare like Saturday </v>
<v Speaker 4>night live has some great sketches but </v>

1836
01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:11.270
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of turds in there too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mostly turns.</v>

1837
01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:14.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just over the accumulation of years.</v>

1838
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:17.930
<v Speaker 4>You've got a lot of bullshit and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>also because of the format.</v>

1839
01:26:17.931 --> 01:26:20.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're trying to come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>new show every week.</v>

1840
01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:21.290
<v Speaker 4>It's brutal.</v>

1841
01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also like,</v>

1842
01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:27.800
<v Speaker 4>like when I was talking to Phil Hartman </v>
<v Speaker 4>when he had just come from Saturday </v>

<v Speaker 4>long fucking time,</v>

1867
01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:32.340
<v Speaker 4>but if you come up to the average person</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1868
01:27:32.490 --> 01:27:35.540
<v Speaker 4>and he's a funny comment.</v>

<v Speaker 4>man before Saturday night live,</v>

1870
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:43.190

<v Speaker 4>movies are a lot of stuff.</v>

1871
01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:46.640

<v Speaker 2>but he's not big like he was when he's </v>

1875
01:27:56.850 --> 01:27:57.700

1884
01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:18.700
<v Speaker 2>like that was like a record deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you get out,</v>

1885
01:28:18.730 --> 01:28:23.170
<v Speaker 2>you drop your first album and if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't hit to rap,</v>

1886
01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.070
<v Speaker 2>rap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show business,</v>

1887
01:28:24.071 --> 01:28:25.210
<v Speaker 2>be stone cold.</v>

1888
01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Look at a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ladies.</v>

1889
01:28:29.561 --> 01:28:34.561

<v Speaker 2>He was funny in this movie too and that </v>

1890
01:28:34.561 --> 01:28:34.561
<v Speaker 2>was his character on snl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1891
01:28:34.561 --> 01:28:37.480
<v Speaker 2>Which means it's not even his movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Lauren gets the.</v>

1892
01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:42.340
<v Speaker 2>He gets all the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you created a character on snl.</v>

1893
01:28:42.341 --> 01:28:43.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1894
01:28:43.181 --> 01:28:48.181
<v Speaker 2>that's my movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't just do it on your own </v>

1895
01:28:48.181 --> 01:28:48.730
<v Speaker 2>and then you cut loose and then it's </v>

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:12.640
<v Speaker 5>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a skinny guy.</v>

1949
01:31:12.670 --> 01:31:14.080
<v Speaker 5>Tommy Davidson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tommy Davidson.</v>

1950
01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:19.060
<v Speaker 5>That's all this talent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just just needing a shot and a fly girl,</v>

1951
01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:21.070
<v Speaker 5>Jennifer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jennifer Lopez.</v>

1952
01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:25.060
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the other Puerto Rican leader.</v>

1953
01:31:25.061 --> 01:31:27.040
<v Speaker 5>The fly girls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forgot her name right now.</v>

1954
01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:29.470
<v Speaker 5>Rosie Perez.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rosie Perez.</v>

1955
01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:32.020
<v Speaker 5>Like how much shit came out of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>show?</v>

1956
01:31:32.170 --> 01:31:33.560
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even afterwards,</v>

1957
01:31:33.610 --> 01:31:38.610
<v Speaker 5>Jamie Foxx came on just careers that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>still going man.</v>

1958
01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:45.800
<v Speaker 1>And then there was mad tv where you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch mad TV will be on like seasoned </v>

1959
01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Tanney Blake that chose to what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1960
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:53.130
<v Speaker 1>But Mad TV had a bunch of great sketches</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people just forgot.</v>

1961
01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:55.920
<v Speaker 1>They had really good innovative sketches</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1962
01:31:56.130 --> 01:31:59.740
<v Speaker 1>And that was like when people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparing inside Schumer,</v>

1963
01:31:59.741 --> 01:32:04.741
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of the shows they were saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the episodes that were saying </v>

1964
01:32:04.741 --> 01:32:05.650
<v Speaker 1>we were ripped off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ripped off from mad tv,</v>

1965
01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:11.520
<v Speaker 1>but part of that is because you run on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>premises like didn't the simpsons like </v>

1966
01:32:12.090 --> 01:32:15.330
<v Speaker 1>South Park always used to joke around </v>
<v Speaker 1>about like simpsons late.</v>

1967
01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.480
<v Speaker 1>They had episodes called Simpson's </v>
<v Speaker 1>already did it?</v>

1968
01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because everything.</v>

1969
01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:22.120
<v Speaker 1>You're stealing from yourself because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got new riders.</v>

1970
01:32:22.150 --> 01:32:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>

1971
01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:26.100
<v Speaker 1>since it's been almost 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe longer,</v>

1972
01:32:26.150 --> 01:32:29.770
<v Speaker 1>east South Park's been on 20 years now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so somebody who's been writing,</v>

1973
01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I think the simpsons or Ron Haiti's.</v>

1974
01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might've been close to 30 years for</v>

1975
01:32:34.361 --> 01:32:39.361
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somebody who's just been writing on </v>

1976
01:32:39.361 --> 01:32:39.460
<v Speaker 1>the simpsons five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just five years,</v>

1977
01:32:39.461 --> 01:32:42.760
<v Speaker 1>which is a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can come up with a premise that was dead</v>

1978
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:46.780
<v Speaker 1>in year 10 or the simpsons and not know </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody there,</v>

1979
01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.030
<v Speaker 1>they might've forgotten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fuck it,</v>

1980
01:32:49.031 --> 01:32:50.110
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1981
01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:52.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter as long as you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it right.</v>

1982
01:32:52.751 --> 01:32:54.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1983
01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:57.580
<v Speaker 1>no one's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's got to be someone,</v>

1984
01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:01.510
<v Speaker 1>but no one can probably recall every </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode of the simpsons.</v>

1985
01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:07.100
<v Speaker 1>That's I'm probably wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably some real super fans out </v>

1986
01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:07.510
<v Speaker 1>there that can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you do.</v>

1987
01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:08.590
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's like,</v>

1988
01:33:08.591 --> 01:33:11.050
<v Speaker 1>I've got blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1989
01:33:11.630 --> 01:33:12.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1990
01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you get to a certain </v>

1991
01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:21.181
<v Speaker 1>number of episodes of things for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've covered virtually,</v>

1992
01:33:21.521 --> 01:33:25.330
<v Speaker 1>at least close to every subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not,</v>

1993
01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:31.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about cartoons though is </v>

1994
01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:31.360
<v Speaker 1>that you could just do anything.</v>

1995
01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:36.110
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much more beautiful in terms of </v>

1996
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.110
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1997
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:38.611
<v Speaker 1>you can get away with kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come back to life next week and </v>

1998
01:33:38.611 --> 01:33:40.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know like South Park can do anything</v>

1999
01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:43.480
<v Speaker 1>it could do and their animation is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>crude and simple.</v>

2000
01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:45.970
<v Speaker 1>They whacked together a show in a matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>of minutes.</v>

2001
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:47.860
<v Speaker 1>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happen today.</v>

2002
01:33:47.861 --> 01:33:50.440
<v Speaker 1>They can put a show up tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally could.</v>

2003
01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm sure there's such a well </v>
<v Speaker 1>oiled machine and then knight,</v>

2004
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:58.960
<v Speaker 1>those guys work ethic is just insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Trey Parker guys off the charts.</v>

2005
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.270
<v Speaker 1>They got rock work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2006
01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Like during their brain they bring you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what that's about.</v>

2007
01:34:05.230 --> 01:34:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Like what keeps a person going that hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>for so long.</v>

2008
01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I know like because it can't be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

2009
01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:18.160
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's gotta be the creativity.</v>

2010
01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:19.650
<v Speaker 1>It's just got to be psych.</v>

2011
01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Just seeing the finished product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also like very socially </v>

2012
01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.020
<v Speaker 1>responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2013
01:34:26.021 --> 01:34:28.480
<v Speaker 1>like they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll shit on people and things go bad</v>

2014
01:34:28.481 --> 01:34:31.680
<v Speaker 1>in the news and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come after people know.</v>

2015
01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:33.870
<v Speaker 1>I liked that about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do too.</v>

2016
01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that Carlos,</v>

2017
01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:40.540
<v Speaker 1>when Kanye West Phish Dick's episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

2018
01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:42.940
<v Speaker 1>and that was when he was on comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>central,</v>

2019
01:34:43.630 --> 01:34:44.740
<v Speaker 1>there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

2020
01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:48.850
<v Speaker 1>They went hard and team America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>world police.</v>

2021
01:34:48.851 --> 01:34:50.380
<v Speaker 1>They do that on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2022
01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:52.390
<v Speaker 1>In the book of Mormon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2023
01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just just super creative guys.</v>

2024
01:34:55.001 --> 01:34:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes you feel lazy.</v>

2025
01:34:57.890 --> 01:35:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people out there </v>

2026
01:35:02.890 --> 01:35:02.890
<v Speaker 1>apparently make me feel lazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>your schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep going,</v>

2028
01:35:05.410 --> 01:35:07.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck is he doing this shit?</v>

2029
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

2030
01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:13.550
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some deep seated desire to figure things</v>

2031
01:35:13.551 --> 01:35:14.390
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2032
01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:20.260
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to do a lot of shit that's not </v>

2033
01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:21.140
<v Speaker 1>work related to leaning more towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing more of that lately.</v>

2034
01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:24.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that after a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a certain point in time,</v>

2035
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep doing three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't keep working for the UFC doing a </v>

2036
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:30.770
<v Speaker 1>podcast and doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to chop it down to two</v>

2037
01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:35.800
<v Speaker 1>or one some day it will be just stand up</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally standing occasionally.</v>

2038
01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you get to a certain point.</v>

2039
01:35:42.850 --> 01:35:44.870
<v Speaker 1>You mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to just,</v>

2040
01:35:44.871 --> 01:35:46.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2041
01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I guess stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really have a burnout feeling </v>

2042
01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:55.481
<v Speaker 1>because I always create new stuff every </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years and it's always about </v>

2043
01:35:55.481 --> 01:35:58.541
<v Speaker 1>putting it together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean how many more years are you </v>

2044
01:35:58.541 --> 01:35:58.790
<v Speaker 1>going to want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so what's like,</v>

2045
01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:01.730
<v Speaker 1>what's your ultimate like later on </v>
<v Speaker 1>future goal?</v>

2046
01:36:01.731 --> 01:36:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's say even five years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

2047
01:36:04.630 --> 01:36:07.700
<v Speaker 1>What do you think would make you happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing does the part of the problem?</v>

2048
01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:11.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any goals of zero goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my goal.</v>

2049
01:36:11.241 --> 01:36:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Do the best standup I could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to do the best podcasts I can do,</v>

2050
01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:17.360
<v Speaker 1>do the best job when I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary.</v>

2051
01:36:17.361 --> 01:36:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Just do the best I could do while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it and enjoy it.</v>

2052
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.230
<v Speaker 1>That's simple enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2053
01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:23.570
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really have like a,</v>

2054
01:36:23.571 --> 01:36:28.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanna make x amount of money or x </v>

2055
01:36:28.571 --> 01:36:28.571
<v Speaker 1>amount of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2056
01:36:28.571 --> 01:36:29.320
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want it to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2057
01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:34.480
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole motivation is don't put </v>

2058
01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:35.420
<v Speaker 1>anything that sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put out things that people enjoy.</v>

2059
01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Figure out a way to make it enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do put all your effort into it because I</v>

2060
01:36:39.561 --> 01:36:44.000
<v Speaker 1>know that if I don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will feel like shit.</v>

2061
01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know if I like have a show that's not </v>

2062
01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:51.731
<v Speaker 1>so good and we've all had those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a podcast is not so good and I've </v>

2063
01:36:51.731 --> 01:36:52.280
<v Speaker 1>definitely had those just don't.</v>

2064
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:53.780
<v Speaker 1>It does not feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2065
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:57.080
<v Speaker 1>They don't always come out perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way around that.</v>

2066
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Especially when we're doing these live </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

2067
01:36:59.311 --> 01:37:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live shows have so many variables.</v>

2068
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:05.890
<v Speaker 1>The time of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how tired the audiences,</v>

2069
01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:07.610
<v Speaker 1>how tired you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you've been traveling,</v>

2070
01:37:07.611 --> 01:37:09.230
<v Speaker 1>are you sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2071
01:37:09.231 --> 01:37:14.231
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things that can affect </v>

2072
01:37:14.231 --> 01:37:15.620
<v Speaker 1>like how you performance comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you like consciously try to pump</v>

2073
01:37:15.621 --> 01:37:18.300
<v Speaker 1>yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had some bad shows when I,</v>

2074
01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.450
<v Speaker 1>when I wasn't feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hard,</v>

2075
01:37:20.451 --> 01:37:25.451
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you just don't have the energy or </v>

2076
01:37:25.451 --> 01:37:28.481
<v Speaker 1>the feeling in the bits the same because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're feeling sick or bad.</v>

2077
01:37:28.881 --> 01:37:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Shows help you get better shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

2078
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:33.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2079
01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:35.810
<v Speaker 1>you didn't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this next time.</v>

2080
01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:39.080
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do that work on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

2081
01:37:39.081 --> 01:37:43.070
<v Speaker 1>the sick feeling of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't let like a really good show.</v>

2082
01:37:43.071 --> 01:37:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't even like a show that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty good.</v>

2083
01:37:45.490 --> 01:37:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't even like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if it's like,</v>

2084
01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:47.960
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2085
01:37:48.010 --> 01:37:49.400
<v Speaker 1>ugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we talking?</v>

2086
01:37:49.410 --> 01:37:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Standardizing it better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2087
01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:52.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why isn't it better?</v>

2088
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't it like my best show ever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My last show might've been my best.</v>

2089
01:37:55.231 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Whenever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why</v>

2090
01:37:56.100 --> 01:38:00.150
<v Speaker 4>isn't this one my new best one ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>different audience.</v>

2091
01:38:00.151 --> 01:38:01.710
<v Speaker 4>Different place venue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

2092
01:38:01.711 --> 01:38:05.460
<v Speaker 4>but I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's my motivation.</v>

2093
01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.750
<v Speaker 4>That's what keeps me going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like trying to figure out how to weight,</v>

2094
01:38:07.751 --> 01:38:12.751
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then also trying to figure out what </v>

2095
01:38:12.751 --> 01:38:15.771
<v Speaker 4>to do with my material.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like should I be writing more stuff </v>

2096
01:38:15.771 --> 01:38:15.771
<v Speaker 4>here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'd just be honing this down.</v>

2097
01:38:15.771 --> 01:38:20.451
<v Speaker 4>Like how do I approach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should I toss some of this aside and </v>

2098
01:38:20.451 --> 01:38:21.450
<v Speaker 4>throw some new stuff in there and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>bring it back.</v>

2099
01:38:21.451 --> 01:38:26.451
<v Speaker 4>And it was constantly trying to make.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you creating something like when </v>

2100
01:38:26.451 --> 01:38:28.440
<v Speaker 4>you created your CD,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you get that feeling sort of where</v>

2101
01:38:28.441 --> 01:38:29.160
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2102
01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:33.480
<v Speaker 4>I gotTa Kinda engineer this a little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I also got to kind of like let it be</v>

2103
01:38:33.481 --> 01:38:34.980
<v Speaker 4>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2104
01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:40.260
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] like just I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like that Kinda before I start doing</v>

2105
01:38:42.991 --> 01:38:47.400
<v Speaker 2>a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I'm doing a joke and I'm like,</v>

2106
01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:52.580
<v Speaker 2>or if I think of a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my elimination process of what I </v>

2107
01:38:53.011 --> 01:38:57.300
<v Speaker 2>should or shouldn't do starts before I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started doing the joke.</v>

2108
01:38:58.130 --> 01:39:00.990
<v Speaker 2>The joke fits into my criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I started doing it.</v>

2109
01:39:00.991 --> 01:39:05.991
<v Speaker 2>So then I'm not wasting time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like I'm wasting time from </v>

2110
01:39:05.991 --> 01:39:09.090
<v Speaker 2>the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think creatively,</v>

2111
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:15.470
<v Speaker 2>like I try to do the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really like to talk about so then I </v>

2112
01:39:16.291 --> 01:39:21.291
<v Speaker 2>don't have to worry about later on </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the whole thing as much and </v>

2113
01:39:21.291 --> 01:39:21.700
<v Speaker 2>saying I got to lose this and I got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>lose that.</v>

2114
01:39:22.290 --> 01:39:27.290
<v Speaker 2>So I started early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then the things that I'm talking </v>

2115
01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:27.290
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm already feeling them.</v>

2116
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:31.800
<v Speaker 2>It's just sometimes when you hold onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>things a long time and you're doing them</v>

2117
01:39:31.801 --> 01:39:33.530
<v Speaker 2>for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel it,</v>

2118
01:39:33.630 --> 01:39:37.780
<v Speaker 2>then you don't feel it anymore and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience tells you you're not feeling it</v>

2119
01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:40.470
<v Speaker 2>anymore based on the reaction you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2120
01:39:41.010 --> 01:39:46.010
<v Speaker 2>And from when the reaction you used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get and you could feel that thing </v>

2121
01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:46.010
<v Speaker 2>getting tired.</v>

2122
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:50.120
<v Speaker 4>That's why I always say that standup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it some sort of massive gnosis?</v>

2123
01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:55.450
<v Speaker 4>It's very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like someone's tricking you or </v>

2124
01:39:55.450 --> 01:39:55.450
<v Speaker 4>telling you what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to get you to quit smoking.</v>

2125
01:39:55.450 --> 01:39:57.350
<v Speaker 4>Not In that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when the guys on stage,</v>

2126
01:39:57.351 --> 01:39:59.810
<v Speaker 4>like if I'm in the back of the room and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm watching you and you're killing.</v>

2127
01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:04.550
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that's really funny is</v>
<v Speaker 4>I start thinking the way you're thinking</v>

2128
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:10.030
<v Speaker 4>when you crack a joke about something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I'm in your group and I'm </v>

2129
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:13.040
<v Speaker 4>letting you do all the thinking for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you watch a really good comic,</v>

2130
01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.330
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if I'm watching you,</v>

2131
01:40:14.331 --> 01:40:16.490
<v Speaker 4>if I'm in the back of the room and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching you,</v>

2132
01:40:16.491 --> 01:40:21.491
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just let you do all the thinking </v>

2133
01:40:21.491 --> 01:40:21.530
<v Speaker 4>because I know you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you know what you're doing.</v>

2134
01:40:21.710 --> 01:40:23.480
<v Speaker 4>I know you're going to take it down a </v>
<v Speaker 4>funny place.</v>

2135
01:40:23.481 --> 01:40:24.650
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here we go.</v>

2136
01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:28.580
<v Speaker 4>Just let it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the moment that you don't trust that</v>

2137
01:40:28.581 --> 01:40:33.581
<v Speaker 4>person anymore moment they fuck up or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something goes weird and the spell gets </v>

2138
01:40:33.581 --> 01:40:34.280
<v Speaker 4>broken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2139
01:40:34.490 --> 01:40:35.540
<v Speaker 4>and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2140
01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:37.520
<v Speaker 4>that guy's just fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That joke.</v>

2141
01:40:37.690 --> 01:40:40.310
<v Speaker 4>This joke sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now this joke's not good.</v>

2142
01:40:40.490 --> 01:40:42.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let them think for me anymore.</v>

2143
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:42.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2144
01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:45.590

<v Speaker 4>All the subjects.</v>

2145
01:40:45.591 --> 01:40:50.591
<v Speaker 4>Just gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just trying to get noises out of </v>

2146
01:40:50.591 --> 01:40:50.591
<v Speaker 4>me now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2147
01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2148
01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:54.730
<v Speaker 2>you gotta earn the audience's trust to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you copilot.</v>

2149

<v Speaker 2>The evening 100 percent and take over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2150
01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:03.280
<v Speaker 2>And just relax and listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could take it and you bring it </v>

2151
01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:05.680
<v Speaker 2>back as possible to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're like real honest about</v>

<v Speaker 2>what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2153
01:41:06.551 --> 01:41:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was just,</v>

2154
01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:11.890
<v Speaker 2>when Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did a show before,</v>

2155

<v Speaker 2>minute segment on it and to network.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The first joke went well,</v>

2173
01:42:15.850 --> 01:42:19.660
<v Speaker 2>but then I have to stop and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you going to shut the fuck up and we</v>

2174
01:42:19.661 --> 01:42:20.980
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2175
01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:24.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have you kicked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nobody in the club moved.</v>

2176
01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:26.200
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no you're not.</v>

2177
01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:30.660
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no you're not.</v>

2178
01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:31.390
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

2179
01:42:31.391 --> 01:42:32.560
<v Speaker 2>we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to kicked out.</v>

2180
01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:34.210
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's running this shit?</v>

2181
01:42:34.690 --> 01:42:39.690
<v Speaker 2>And this is the eight dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only have eight minutes and I got to </v>

2182
01:42:39.690 --> 01:42:40.030
<v Speaker 2>get back on track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

2183
01:42:40.031 --> 01:42:41.020
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>

2184
01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she thought she could just talk.</v>

2185
01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>

2186
01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:46.450

<v Speaker 2>And you know what?</v>

2187
01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:51.570
<v Speaker 2>The club did not kick her out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see us do your whole set with her </v>

2188
01:42:51.570 --> 01:42:51.570
<v Speaker 2>sitting there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2189
01:42:51.670 --> 01:42:55.420
<v Speaker 2>but I got them back on track because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they did want her to shut up and she did</v>

2190
01:42:55.421 --> 01:42:58.450
<v Speaker 2>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the defiance I've never.</v>

2191
01:42:58.690 --> 01:43:01.660
<v Speaker 2>And then some con Canadian comic later </v>

2192
01:43:01.690 --> 01:43:06.690
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2193
01:43:06.690 --> 01:43:09.181
<v Speaker 2>have this prop in the club every time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you write a letter to the owner </v>

2194
01:43:09.181 --> 01:43:10.030
<v Speaker 2>and tell them they never have security </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2195
01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:13.030
<v Speaker 2>And it was a comedy nest.</v>

2208
01:43:42.661 --> 01:43:44.260
<v Speaker 2>intense environment for comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of pressure.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're thinking we got to go to another </v>

2212
01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:57.881
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to a country that doesn't even </v>

2213
01:43:57.881 --> 01:43:57.881
<v Speaker 2>speak English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in,</v>

2214
01:43:57.881 --> 01:43:58.730
<v Speaker 2>in Quebec they were English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>French,</v>

2215
01:43:58.731 --> 01:44:00.770
<v Speaker 2>French chat refuses to speak English.</v>

2216
01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.530
<v Speaker 2>Well that one section,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one section,</v>

2217
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:05.840
<v Speaker 2>but it is kind of like visiting another </v>
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>

2218
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:10.930
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you go to Toronto it might as </v>

2219
01:44:10.930 --> 01:44:11.240
<v Speaker 2>well be Detroit or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a nice city,</v>

2220
01:44:11.241 --> 01:44:13.250
<v Speaker 2>but I mean a little nicer than Detroit I</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess.</v>

2221
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:15.820
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

2225
01:44:22.610 --> 01:44:24.080
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel like you're in another </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2226
01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:27.020
<v Speaker 2>If you go to Montreal you feel like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might as well be in Europe.</v>

2227
01:44:27.130 --> 01:44:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>know any French and then start talking </v>

2230
01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:36.970
<v Speaker 2>English without a French accent.</v>

<v Speaker 1>because there's no air and they'd been </v>
<v Speaker 1>skiing all day.</v>

2288
01:46:53.690 --> 01:46:56.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever been asking other than that?</v>

2289
01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:57.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I caught the flu up there,</v>

2290
01:46:57.610 --> 01:47:02.080
<v Speaker 5>the worst flu I've ever had at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>festival because it was going around and</v>

2291
01:47:02.081 --> 01:47:07.081
<v Speaker 5>I was sick and I had to tape the TV show</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I mustered up enough energy to do </v>

2292
01:47:07.901 --> 01:47:11.440
<v Speaker 5>the taping and then I just slept in bed </v>
<v Speaker 5>for like two days.</v>

2293
01:47:12.190 --> 01:47:15.910
<v Speaker 5>And then I have to check out the thought</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of my hotel at 11,</v>

2294
01:47:16.270 --> 01:47:19.300
<v Speaker 5>but my flight wasn't till like seven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

2295
01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:24.360
<v Speaker 5>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like the worst flu ever that I've </v>

2296
01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.661
<v Speaker 5>ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you had to fly with it and had to </v>

2297
01:47:27.661 --> 01:47:27.661
<v Speaker 5>fly with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when,</v>

2298
01:47:27.661 --> 01:47:29.680
<v Speaker 5>when I checked out this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how bad I was when I checked out at 11,</v>

2299
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:32.890
<v Speaker 5>the guy looked at me and I told him that</v>
<v Speaker 5>my flight was at seven.</v>

2300
01:47:32.891 --> 01:47:37.891
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to give you a room so you </v>

2301
01:47:37.891 --> 01:47:37.891
<v Speaker 5>could sleep in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>

2302
01:47:37.891 --> 01:47:38.830
<v Speaker 5>Until your flight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That saved my life.</v>

2303
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:44.430
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's lay down for like maybe three </v>

2304
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.430
<v Speaker 5>hours that it helped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It helped.</v>

2305
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:46.180
<v Speaker 5>It helped me enough to have enough </v>
<v Speaker 5>energy to this.</v>

2306
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:48.670
<v Speaker 5>And then you're at the airport and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think the flight got delayed.</v>

2307
01:47:48.671 --> 01:47:53.671
<v Speaker 5>So now I'm like in the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 5>worst flu ever for like two hours.</v>

2308
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:56.450
<v Speaker 1>When your immune system is compromised </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that to you,</v>

2309
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:58.900
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how little energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2310
01:47:58.990 --> 01:48:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Like when people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a cliche.</v>

2311
01:48:00.701 --> 01:48:03.210
<v Speaker 1>That health is the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2312
01:48:03.370 --> 01:48:06.150
<v Speaker 1>fuck up bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Money's the most important thing.</v>

2313

<v Speaker 1>The fuck out of here with your health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll cough and count my cat feeling </v>

<v Speaker 1>If you just feel a little shitty,</v>

2316
01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:19.080
<v Speaker 1>just a little shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It markedly changes the way you look at </v>

2317
01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:20.830
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you cut your thumb right,</v>

2318
01:48:21.250 --> 01:48:23.560
<v Speaker 1>that changes your whole day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could,</v>

2319
01:48:23.570 --> 01:48:24.910
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if it gets infected.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That changes your whole.</v>

2323
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:33.600
<v Speaker 1>whole day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like healthwise,</v>

2324
01:48:33.670 --> 01:48:35.590
<v Speaker 1>stubbing your toe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't judge Bro.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Changes everything.</v>

2330
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh no that doesn't sound good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2337
01:49:02.201 --> 01:49:07.201
<v Speaker 1>Anytime something goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think like overall health and </v>

2338
01:49:07.201 --> 01:49:07.630
<v Speaker 1>wellness is so fucking important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2339
01:49:07.631 --> 01:49:09.550
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so important.</v>

2340
01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:12.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's so many people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that just don't take care of their</v>

2341

<v Speaker 1>vehicle.</v>

2343

<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

2344
01:49:19.150 --> 01:49:24.150
<v Speaker 1>you know what's really crazy to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people that I know that don't take </v>

2345
01:49:24.150 --> 01:49:27.091
<v Speaker 1>care of their body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they talk about being </v>

2346
01:49:27.091 --> 01:49:27.091
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did you think?</v>

2347
01:49:27.091 --> 01:49:30.420
<v Speaker 1>You think you just say poor shit down </v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole and you would feel good,</v>

2348
01:49:31.110 --> 01:49:36.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just no sleep and tons of </v>

2349
01:49:36.110 --> 01:49:36.110
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tons of booze.</v>

2350
01:49:36.110 --> 01:49:37.530
<v Speaker 1>And you thought you'd feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2351
01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:40.120
<v Speaker 1>You shot right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I feel sick.</v>

2352
01:49:40.810 --> 01:49:43.150
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which has been filled with shit lately.</v>

2353
01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Doing the same thing over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2354
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Taking drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2355
01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 1>So did you see</v>

2356
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:50.950
<v Speaker 4>a walk to health?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched a,</v>

2357
01:49:50.951 --> 01:49:55.630
<v Speaker 4>a doctor's response to what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch this.</v>

2358
01:49:55.690 --> 01:50:00.690
<v Speaker 4>Because I had heard it was like some </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy vegan propaganda is not based on </v>

2359
01:50:00.690 --> 01:50:04.501
<v Speaker 4>science at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they were trying to say that a fat </v>

2360
01:50:04.501 --> 01:50:07.300
<v Speaker 4>causes diabetes and fact that clogged up</v>
<v Speaker 4>and doctors that have looked at it,</v>

2361
01:50:07.301 --> 01:50:10.360
<v Speaker 4>there's been a ton of debunkers online </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have looked at it.</v>

2362
01:50:10.361 --> 01:50:12.550
<v Speaker 4>They said this is pseudoscience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not real.</v>

2363
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:15.430
<v Speaker 4>Like definitely a Vegan diet can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy,</v>

2364
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:20.470
<v Speaker 4>definitely taken a lot of vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can be really good for you and </v>

2365
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:22.420
<v Speaker 4>definitely a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good to have nutrient rich foods,</v>

2366
01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:27.780
<v Speaker 4>whether it's fresh vegetables or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to eat and you could </v>

2367
01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:27.850
<v Speaker 4>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

2368
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:32.890
<v Speaker 4>if you're careful and you're smart about</v>
<v Speaker 4>your saturated fats and unsaturated fats</v>

2369
01:50:32.891 --> 01:50:33.760
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2370
01:50:33.761 --> 01:50:34.600
<v Speaker 4>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2371
01:50:34.601 --> 01:50:36.550
<v Speaker 4>essential fatty acids and things like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2372
01:50:36.850 --> 01:50:38.980
<v Speaker 4>you can live a very healthy life is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Vegan,</v>

2373
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.970
<v Speaker 4>just do it right.</v>

2374
01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:44.470
<v Speaker 4>But these guys lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They went a little overboard.</v>

2375
01:50:44.471 --> 01:50:46.840
<v Speaker 4>They didn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't just document what it is,</v>

2376
01:50:46.841 --> 01:50:51.841
<v Speaker 4>is a Vegan proselytizing like doc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're trying to do is get </v>

2377
01:50:52.241 --> 01:50:56.080
<v Speaker 4>people to sign up for veganism but </v>
<v Speaker 4>scaring the shit out of with lies.</v>

2378
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:59.890
<v Speaker 4>And you're saying things like saturated </v>
<v Speaker 4>fats and all these,</v>

2379
01:51:00.190 --> 01:51:03.340
<v Speaker 4>these things clog up your arteries that </v>
<v Speaker 4>causes diabetes.</v>

2380
01:51:04.210 --> 01:51:08.260
<v Speaker 4>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in that in is what the health,</v>

2381
01:51:08.590 --> 01:51:11.470
<v Speaker 4>what is the same guys that made </v>
<v Speaker 4>cowspiracy exactly.</v>

2382
01:51:11.710 --> 01:51:14.170
<v Speaker 4>And they were wrong about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they came in here,</v>

2383
01:51:14.590 --> 01:51:17.500
<v Speaker 4>they were talking about how many acres </v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes for a cow to graze.</v>

2384
01:51:17.501 --> 01:51:22.060
<v Speaker 4>And all the negative aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's absolutely negative aspects when</v>

2385
01:51:22.061 --> 01:51:27.061
<v Speaker 4>it comes to animal agriculture and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's super important to be honest </v>

2386
01:51:27.061 --> 01:51:28.810
<v Speaker 4>about those aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even when criticizing it,</v>

2387
01:51:28.811 --> 01:51:32.600
<v Speaker 4>you can't exaggerate it to make a case </v>
<v Speaker 4>look better because the actual facts are</v>

2388
01:51:32.601 --> 01:51:33.400
<v Speaker 4>disturbing enough.</v>

2389
01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:38.620
<v Speaker 4>Like especially factory farming when it </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to like cows and chet and pigs,</v>

2390
01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:42.190
<v Speaker 4>it's disturbing to see them all stacked </v>
<v Speaker 4>up in there like that.</v>

2391
01:51:42.191 --> 01:51:44.470
<v Speaker 4>It's disturbing to see those rivers of </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2392
01:51:44.471 --> 01:51:49.471
<v Speaker 4>Where were people a run these pig farms </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the shit comes and he filmed it with</v>

2393
01:51:49.571 --> 01:51:52.090
<v Speaker 4>a drone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of these giant commercial places.</v>

2394
01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:55.210
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is straight up.</v>

2395
01:51:55.211 --> 01:51:56.210
<v Speaker 4>That's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's enough.</v>

2396
01:51:56.410 --> 01:52:01.000
<v Speaker 4>There's a ton of actual facts that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>disturbing and as soon as you have these</v>

2397
01:52:01.001 --> 01:52:06.001
<v Speaker 4>doctors that are just bullshit artists </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are saying all these things that </v>

2398
01:52:06.001 --> 01:52:10.771
<v Speaker 4>aren't supported by science and when </v>
<v Speaker 4>this one doctor goes over all the </v>

2399
01:52:10.771 --> 01:52:12.910
<v Speaker 4>different things and what the health </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are incorrect,</v>

2400
01:52:12.911 --> 01:52:14.740
<v Speaker 4>you kind of understand what it is they </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean.</v>

2401
01:52:14.741 --> 01:52:19.741
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure they mean what they're trying </v>

2402
01:52:19.741 --> 01:52:20.110
<v Speaker 4>to get people to quit eating processed </v>
<v Speaker 4>meat,</v>

2403
01:52:20.230 --> 01:52:21.490
<v Speaker 4>which is a very good idea.</v>

2404
01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:26.580
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>processed food is fucking terrible for </v>

2405
01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:26.580
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a food with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>preservatives,</v>

2406
01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:31.231
<v Speaker 4>meets with a lot of preservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff is definitely 100 </v>

2407
01:52:31.231 --> 01:52:31.231
<v Speaker 4>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not good for you,</v>

2408
01:52:31.231 --> 01:52:34.720
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that grassfed beef</v>
<v Speaker 4>is bad for you because it's not.</v>

2409
01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:39.850
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that you can't have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy diet with a salmon and fish,</v>

2410
01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:43.660
<v Speaker 4>different kinds of ocean fish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scallops,</v>

2411
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:48.230
<v Speaker 4>and use that as your primary protein </v>
<v Speaker 4>source and then vegetables and have like</v>

2412
01:52:48.231 --> 01:52:53.231
<v Speaker 4>a super healthy diet because you will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will have a super healthy diet and </v>

2413
01:52:53.231 --> 01:52:55.490
<v Speaker 4>you know there's a lot of arguments to </v>
<v Speaker 4>avoid dairy.</v>

2414
01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:57.760
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of it depends on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>

2415
01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:00.140
<v Speaker 4>A good arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of really good arguments,</v>

2416
01:53:00.230 --> 01:53:03.140
<v Speaker 4>really good arguments in terms of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>immune system inflammation.</v>

2417
01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:06.290
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of really good arguments </v>
<v Speaker 4>to avoid processed sugar.</v>

2418
01:53:06.291 --> 01:53:09.590
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of really good arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's like what we're talking</v>

2419
01:53:09.591 --> 01:53:11.840
<v Speaker 4>about earlier when you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about if you found those,</v>

2420
01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:15.620
<v Speaker 4>those scrolls scrolls in Qumran,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would kind of like,</v>

2421
01:53:15.621 --> 01:53:16.780
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what it's saying.</v>

2422
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:21.790
<v Speaker 4>I get all the bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You figure out a way to lean it towards </v>

2423
01:53:21.790 --> 01:53:23.420
<v Speaker 4>you will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These people are clearly on team Vegan,</v>

2424
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:28.450
<v Speaker 4>which is great and it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way to be on team Vegan and do it </v>

2425
01:53:28.450 --> 01:53:29.900
<v Speaker 4>right is be healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be nice and be honest,</v>

2426
01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:33.740
<v Speaker 4>be honest because it's good enough and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get plenty of those.</v>

2427
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:34.840
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of those out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2428
01:53:34.841 --> 01:53:36.380
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to discredit them.</v>

2429
01:53:36.710 --> 01:53:37.720
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2430
01:53:37.950 --> 01:53:40.550
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of crazy vegans to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are just going to get mad at you.</v>

2431
01:53:40.730 --> 01:53:45.730
<v Speaker 4>And they just decided now that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>Vegan to just attack everyone who's not </v>

2432
01:53:45.730 --> 01:53:45.730
<v Speaker 4>vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen those too.</v>

2433
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:47.210
<v Speaker 4>But that's just humans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2434
01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:48.920
<v Speaker 4>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just human shit.</v>

2435
01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:51.680
<v Speaker 4>Human Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

2436
01:53:51.681 --> 01:53:56.681
<v Speaker 4>I know a ton of people that are very </v>
<v Speaker 4>happy being Vegan and you're one of </v>

2437
01:53:56.681 --> 01:53:56.681
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2438
01:53:56.681 --> 01:53:58.130
<v Speaker 4>and I fuck with you all the time about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2439
01:53:58.131 --> 01:53:59.450
<v Speaker 4>but you're a healthy dude.</v>

2440
01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:01.200
<v Speaker 4>You've always been healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2441
01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:02.880
<v Speaker 4>but you do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2442
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:05.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've done it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I've been an unhealthy Vegan,</v>

2443
01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:11.260
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now I got to stop fucking with </v>

2444
01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:11.970
<v Speaker 4>sodium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's wrong with sodium like this?</v>

2445
01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:14.990
<v Speaker 4>High blood blood pressure wise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't really happen.</v>

2446
01:54:14.991 --> 01:54:16.330
<v Speaker 4>That's not the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll know.</v>

2447
01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:17.780
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's another misconception.</v>

2448
01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:23.260
<v Speaker 4>The misconception about sodium is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sodium is somehow or another the cause </v>

2449
01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:25.910
<v Speaker 4>of high blood pressure that was put </v>
<v Speaker 4>together by some bullshit ass doctor.</v>

2450
01:54:26.210 --> 01:54:29.270
<v Speaker 4>One doctor pull that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull up the myth of sodium.</v>

2451
01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:30.950
<v Speaker 4>This is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this story,</v>

2452
01:54:30.951 --> 01:54:33.200
<v Speaker 4>because so many people believe us as </v>
<v Speaker 4>high blood pressure.</v>

2453
01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:34.950
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it's genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>genetic,</v>

2454
01:54:35.210 --> 01:54:36.710
<v Speaker 4>genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be,</v>

2455
01:54:36.711 --> 01:54:39.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dammit the sedentary lifestyle.</v>

2456
01:54:39.171 --> 01:54:41.440
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of factors that sedentary </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifestyle.</v>

2457
01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:43.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't really work out.</v>

2458
01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:46.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm shaking up the salt myth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here you go.</v>

2459
01:54:46.221 --> 01:54:48.560
<v Speaker 4>Chris crusher was actually been on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast before,</v>

2460
01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:54.420
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all ages salt has been invested as </v>

2461
01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:57.380
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a significance for exceeding that </v>

2462
01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:57.380
<v Speaker 4>inherent in its natural properties.</v>

2463
01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:57.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2464
01:54:57.471 --> 01:55:01.430
<v Speaker 4>That's a little wordy either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm single,</v>

2465
01:55:01.431 --> 01:55:02.300
<v Speaker 4>most harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2466
01:55:02.301 --> 01:55:03.770
<v Speaker 4>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2467
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:07.550
<v Speaker 4>it's been referred to as the single most</v>
<v Speaker 4>harmful substance in the food supply.</v>

2468
01:55:07.551 --> 01:55:08.870
<v Speaker 4>But it's salt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really dangerous.</v>

2469
01:55:08.871 --> 01:55:10.790
<v Speaker 4>New New News.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taking up the salt myth.</v>

2470
01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:12.350
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not what I'm looking for.</v>

2471
01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:14.720
<v Speaker 4>What I want you to do is just pull up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2472
01:55:14.830 --> 01:55:19.830
<v Speaker 4>the conspiracy about how one doctor </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote some bullshit paper about sodium.</v>

2473
01:55:23.691 --> 01:55:26.030
<v Speaker 4>You got that from scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2474
01:55:26.150 --> 01:55:28.640
<v Speaker 4>Time to end the war on salt from </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific America.</v>

2475
01:55:28.641 --> 01:55:32.030
<v Speaker 4>The zealous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a drive by politicians to limit our salt</v>

2476
01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:34.690
<v Speaker 4>intake has little basis in science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all bullshit.</v>

2477
01:55:34.710 --> 01:55:35.770
<v Speaker 4>Make that larger please.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ms.</v>

2478
01:55:35.771 --> 01:55:38.210
<v Speaker 4>Dot shitty for so many are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do we.</v>

2479
01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:41.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we know what's real and what's not.</v>

2480
01:55:41.110 --> 01:55:42.250
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like it.</v>

2481
01:55:42.251 --> 01:55:47.251
<v Speaker 4>It started with a very clear beginning </v>
<v Speaker 4>for this.</v>

2482
01:55:47.491 --> 01:55:52.491
<v Speaker 4>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a bullshit study that someone </v>

2483
01:55:52.491 --> 01:55:52.910
<v Speaker 4>passed and you know there's also been a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ton of bullshit here.</v>

2484
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:53.550
<v Speaker 4>It is 19.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2485
01:55:53.551 --> 01:55:58.551
<v Speaker 4>four French doctors reported that six of</v>
<v Speaker 4>their subjects who had high blood </v>

2486
01:55:58.551 --> 01:55:59.070
<v Speaker 4>pressure and known risk factor for heart</v>
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>

2487
01:55:59.071 --> 01:56:04.071
<v Speaker 4>We're salt fiends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>worries escalated in the 19 seventies </v>

2488
01:56:04.071 --> 01:56:04.350
<v Speaker 4>when Brookhaven national laboratory is </v>
<v Speaker 4>Louis.</v>

2489
01:56:04.530 --> 01:56:09.530
<v Speaker 4>Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dol claimed that he had unequivocal </v>

2490
01:56:09.530 --> 01:56:10.860
<v Speaker 4>unequivocal evidence that salt causes </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypertension.</v>

2491
01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:16.220
<v Speaker 4>He induced high blood pressure in rats </v>
<v Speaker 4>by feeding them the human equivalent of </v>

2492
01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:20.280
<v Speaker 4>500 grams of sodium today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is an insane amount today.</v>

2493
01:56:20.281 --> 01:56:25.281
<v Speaker 4>The average American consumes three </v>
<v Speaker 4>point four grams of sodium or eight </v>

2494
01:56:25.281 --> 01:56:28.230
<v Speaker 4>point four grams of salt a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A scroll up a little there.</v>

2495
01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:33.440
<v Speaker 4>Doll also discovered that the population</v>
<v Speaker 4>tends to continue to be cited as strong </v>

2496
01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:37.440
<v Speaker 4>evidence of a link between salt intake </v>
<v Speaker 4>and high blood pressure.</v>

2497
01:56:37.441 --> 01:56:41.400
<v Speaker 4>People living in countries with high </v>
<v Speaker 4>salt consumption such as Japan also tend</v>

2498
01:56:41.401 --> 01:56:42.900
<v Speaker 4>to have high blood pressure and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>strokes,</v>

2499
01:56:43.230 --> 01:56:48.230
<v Speaker 4>but as a paper pointed out several years</v>
<v Speaker 4>later in American journal of </v>

2500
01:56:48.230 --> 01:56:51.261
<v Speaker 4>hypertension,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists had little luck finding such </v>

2501
01:56:51.261 --> 01:56:51.261
<v Speaker 4>associations when they compare it.</v>

2502
01:56:51.261 --> 01:56:56.080
<v Speaker 4>Sodium intakes within populations which </v>
<v Speaker 4>suggested that genetics or other </v>

2503
01:56:56.161 --> 01:56:59.040
<v Speaker 4>cultural factors might be the culprit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

2504
01:56:59.041 --> 01:57:04.041
<v Speaker 4>this 1977 study affected the US Senate </v>
<v Speaker 4>select committee on nutrition and human </v>

2505
01:57:05.701 --> 01:57:10.701
<v Speaker 4>needs and they released a report </v>
<v Speaker 4>recommending that Americans cut their </v>

2506
01:57:10.701 --> 01:57:14.271
<v Speaker 4>salt intake by 50 to 85 percent based </v>
<v Speaker 4>largely on dolls work,</v>

2507
01:57:15.150 --> 01:57:18.540
<v Speaker 4>so there's one dick fuck ruined it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

2508
01:57:18.541 --> 01:57:22.020
<v Speaker 4>The ones put salt in your fries like you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can get off of that,</v>

2509
01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:27.080
<v Speaker 4>but this is a salt is a mineral and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a natural part of being a human being.</v>

2510
01:57:28.351 --> 01:57:30.810
<v Speaker 4>It's an essential mineral essential </v>
<v Speaker 4>mineral.</v>

2511
01:57:31.170 --> 01:57:35.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you have endurance </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletes and they go on these crazy runs</v>

2512
01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:37.590
<v Speaker 4>and they do like a 100 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take salt.</v>

2513
01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:39.280
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things they said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2514
01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:41.760
<v Speaker 4>they put salt in their body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't data route.</v>

2515
01:57:42.290 --> 01:57:47.290
<v Speaker 4>It isn't gatorade a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know what the best version of it </v>

2516
01:57:47.290 --> 01:57:47.360
<v Speaker 4>apparently health wise is that Himalayan</v>
<v Speaker 4>salt.</v>

2517
01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:52.400
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because Himalayan salt has a bunch of </v>

2518
01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:52.400
<v Speaker 4>like natural based minerals in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2519
01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:57.500
<v Speaker 4>They recommend you take a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>him similarly and so I'll just drop a </v>

2520
01:57:57.500 --> 01:57:59.160
<v Speaker 4>little bit in your water in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 4>and put some lemon in there.</v>

2521
01:57:59.190 --> 01:57:59.400
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2522
01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:00.670
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I,</v>

2523
01:58:00.671 --> 01:58:05.380
<v Speaker 5>I use data a little bit but I think with</v>
<v Speaker 5>Vegan food,</v>

2524
01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:10.820
<v Speaker 5>like probably based on my genetics </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they try to make it taste a </v>

2525
01:58:11.441 --> 01:58:16.441
<v Speaker 5>certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They might put a lot of fucking salt in </v>

2526
01:58:16.441 --> 01:58:16.441
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh okay.</v>

2527
01:58:16.441 --> 01:58:21.301
<v Speaker 5>So I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I could feel something towards </v>

2528
01:58:21.301 --> 01:58:22.540
<v Speaker 5>December,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in my body whenever I ate.</v>

2529
01:58:23.050 --> 01:58:28.050
<v Speaker 5>So now that I've cut back on I like are </v>
<v Speaker 5>more and I'll just eat places that have </v>

2530
01:58:28.451 --> 01:58:31.900
<v Speaker 5>less salt because salt and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But some people oversalt shit.</v>

2531
01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:34.030
<v Speaker 5>It also could be sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sugar,</v>

2532
01:58:34.190 --> 01:58:35.080
<v Speaker 5>sugar too.</v>

2533
01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:39.450
<v Speaker 4>Well you should do honestly is I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>send you to a guy.</v>

2534
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 4>She gets some blood work done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

2535
01:58:42.131 --> 01:58:44.630
<v Speaker 4>Some did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did he say it was?</v>

2536
01:58:44.710 --> 01:58:46.840
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the guy said salt.</v>

2537
01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:49.810
<v Speaker 4>Too much salt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that guy's a fucking idiot.</v>

2538
01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:52.280
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You went to an idiot doctor.</v>

2539
01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:55.810
<v Speaker 4>Would you say you have too much salt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but do you find sodium in your blood?</v>

2540
01:58:55.840 --> 01:58:58.960
<v Speaker 4>Like what is he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my blood sugar was getting high.</v>

2541
01:58:58.990 --> 01:59:00.730
<v Speaker 4>What a fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This.</v>

2542
01:59:01.010 --> 01:59:06.010
<v Speaker 4>It's proven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not a connection and this idiot </v>

2543
01:59:06.010 --> 01:59:09.361
<v Speaker 4>is telling you to cut back the salt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck you supposed to trust </v>

2544
01:59:09.361 --> 01:59:12.481
<v Speaker 4>doctors when they're going to buy some </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit that they went to school with the </v>

2545
01:59:12.481 --> 01:59:12.481
<v Speaker 4>nitrogen in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's my point.</v>

2546
01:59:12.481 --> 01:59:13.770
<v Speaker 4>You can't trust anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's.</v>

2547
01:59:13.890 --> 01:59:18.890
<v Speaker 4>If a doctor physician dot your age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That motherfucker was in college in the </v>

2548
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:19.390
<v Speaker 4>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2549
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:22.570
<v Speaker 4>So what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a long goddamn time ago.</v>

2550
01:59:22.630 --> 01:59:24.170
<v Speaker 4>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was taught to shoot the,</v>

2551
01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:26.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 years after the seventies,</v>

2552
01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:28.090
<v Speaker 4>people were idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were monkeys.</v>

2553
01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:32.050
<v Speaker 4>They had fucking bell bottoms on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People were barely out of the caves.</v>

2554
01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:33.610
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm in the 19 seventies.</v>

2555
01:59:33.611 --> 01:59:33.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2556
01:59:33.770 --> 01:59:35.960
<v Speaker 2>if you committed to be a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2557
01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:37.700
<v Speaker 2>And you learned everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned,</v>

2558
01:59:39.170 --> 01:59:44.170
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your whole identity is being based on </v>

2559
01:59:44.170 --> 01:59:44.210
<v Speaker 2>what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2560
01:59:44.630 --> 01:59:49.630
<v Speaker 2>So if some new new shit comes up or if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you find out that something that you </v>

2561
01:59:50.511 --> 01:59:53.390
<v Speaker 2>were taught that's embedded in you is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not true,</v>

2562
01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:58.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to fight that new </v>

2563
01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:00.461
<v Speaker 2>truth and stick to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the old way because that fucks with </v>

2564
02:00:00.461 --> 02:00:03.710
<v Speaker 2>your identity and who you are and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>people perceive you to be.</v>

2565
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:06.060
<v Speaker 4>There's also like peripheral knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people have.</v>

2566
02:00:06.061 --> 02:00:07.590
<v Speaker 4>And I'm guilty of this too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody is,</v>

2567
02:00:07.591 --> 02:00:09.870
<v Speaker 4>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm guilty of it especially like you</v>

2568
02:00:09.871 --> 02:00:11.910
<v Speaker 4>get a little peripheral knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that you think,</v>

2569
02:00:11.911 --> 02:00:13.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you understand what it is.</v>

2570
02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:17.560
<v Speaker 4>Like I was talking to a scientist and </v>
<v Speaker 4>actual scientist and uh,</v>

2571
02:00:17.561 --> 02:00:19.000
<v Speaker 4>I was talking about eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2572
02:00:19.070 --> 02:00:19.860
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2573
02:00:19.861 --> 02:00:21.420
<v Speaker 4>that's gotta be fun growing your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>chickens.</v>

2574
02:00:21.690 --> 02:00:22.350
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2575
02:00:22.351 --> 02:00:23.870
<v Speaker 4>what about the cholesterol doesn't end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2576
02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:25.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lead to high blood pressure.</v>

2577
02:00:25.351 --> 02:00:26.760
<v Speaker 4>You're taking in all that cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2578
02:00:26.761 --> 02:00:28.950
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a fucking scientists.</v>

2579
02:00:28.951 --> 02:00:31.650
<v Speaker 4>Don't you understand that dietary </v>
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol doesn't even.</v>

2580
02:00:31.890 --> 02:00:35.160
<v Speaker 4>It barely even moves the needle on blood</v>
<v Speaker 4>lipids.</v>

2581
02:00:35.161 --> 02:00:39.390
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a lot of sedentary </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifestyle genetics.</v>

2582
02:00:39.391 --> 02:00:41.700
<v Speaker 4>There's all sorts of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like chickens,</v>

2583
02:00:41.701 --> 02:00:44.610
<v Speaker 4>like an eggs from chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not bad for you at all.</v>

2584
02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:47.070
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the healthiest foods you can eat,</v>

2585
02:00:47.310 --> 02:00:48.960
<v Speaker 4>if you're seeing that chicken eggs are </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad for you,</v>

2586
02:00:48.961 --> 02:00:50.790
<v Speaker 4>you're essentially saying that food is </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad for you.</v>

2587
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:52.730
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to see what the bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they.</v>

2588
02:00:53.190 --> 02:00:55.680
<v Speaker 4>They shit all over eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're idiots.</v>

2589
02:00:55.710 --> 02:00:59.820
<v Speaker 4>They should all over the healthy grass </v>
<v Speaker 4>fed chicken or a a free range.</v>

2590
02:00:59.821 --> 02:01:02.160
<v Speaker 4>Chicken is wandering around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

2591
02:01:02.250 --> 02:01:06.090
<v Speaker 4>Google egg might be the perfect food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an article about eggs,</v>

2592
02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:11.480
<v Speaker 4>might be the perfect food because eggs </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a ton of nutrients in them and </v>

2593
02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:16.220
<v Speaker 4>they're also essentially pretty ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like ethically free of any reservations </v>

2594
02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:18.960
<v Speaker 4>that chickens just lay eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to hurt them.</v>

2595
02:01:19.170 --> 02:01:21.180
<v Speaker 4>Our eggs really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nature's perfect food.</v>

2596
02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:25.590
<v Speaker 4>Rotten eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How a perfect food can go bad.</v>

2597
02:01:25.591 --> 02:01:26.970
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

2598
02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:27.540
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2599
02:01:27.541 --> 02:01:30.090
<v Speaker 4>the same article I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's.</v>

2600
02:01:30.091 --> 02:01:35.091
<v Speaker 4>There's an article.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter if there's an article </v>

2601
02:01:35.091 --> 02:01:35.310
<v Speaker 4>that I read on how an egg is the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>

2602
02:01:35.311 --> 02:01:40.311
<v Speaker 4>If you can find that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It explains all the nutritional </v>

2603
02:01:40.311 --> 02:01:40.370
<v Speaker 4>properties of egg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just</v>

2604
02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:43.320
<v Speaker 5>so much shit from so many different </v>
<v Speaker 5>styles.</v>

2605
02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:46.400
<v Speaker 5>All I've learned to do is just trust </v>
<v Speaker 5>myself.</v>

2606
02:01:46.610 --> 02:01:49.370
<v Speaker 5>So the doctor telling me this thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>about salt,</v>

2607
02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:51.920
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking 80 was kind of like,</v>

2608
02:01:51.921 --> 02:01:53.780
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could feel something wrong,</v>

2609
02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:55.430
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could feel something wrong.</v>

2610
02:01:55.431 --> 02:02:00.431
<v Speaker 5>So that data honestly felt so when he </v>
<v Speaker 5>said too much salt and then I know eaten</v>

2611
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:02.060
<v Speaker 5>out a lot.</v>

2612
02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Let me stop you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you said you could feel something </v>

2613
02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:07.820
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what are you talking about?</v>

2614
02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you experiencing?</v>

2615
02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:10.960
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just a feeling like,</v>

2616
02:02:12.430 --> 02:02:17.430
<v Speaker 5>like in my veins or not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could just feel like I pay attention </v>

2617
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:18.850
<v Speaker 5>to my body a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2618
02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:19.960
<v Speaker 5>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Naked.</v>

2619
02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:22.660
<v Speaker 5>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just after after I,</v>

2620
02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:24.150
<v Speaker 5>after I ate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2621
02:02:24.250 --> 02:02:28.690
<v Speaker 5>I could feel something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't in it and it was just,</v>

2622
02:02:29.490 --> 02:02:30.440
<v Speaker 5>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

2623
02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:32.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm not supposed to feel this way.</v>

2624
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:33.830
<v Speaker 4>And this was just from eating food.</v>

2625
02:02:34.810 --> 02:02:36.100
<v Speaker 5>Mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mostly</v>

<v Speaker 1>You might go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might become a hunter is going to be</v>

2640
02:03:16.150 --> 02:03:21.150
<v Speaker 1>shooting shit off the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was fucking rearrange people.</v>

2641
02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:24.550
<v Speaker 4>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whole eggs are mostly.</v>

2642
02:03:24.610 --> 02:03:29.610
<v Speaker 4>That is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whole eggs are amongst the most </v>

2643
02:03:29.610 --> 02:03:32.880
<v Speaker 4>abundant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most nutritious foods on earth and </v>

2644
02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:35.671
<v Speaker 4>so it made that a little larger there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can see one egg contains vitamin </v>

2645
02:03:35.671 --> 02:03:35.671
<v Speaker 4>B,</v>
<v Speaker 4>12,</v>

2646
02:03:35.671 --> 02:03:37.030
<v Speaker 4>nine percent of the RDA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamin B,</v>

2647
02:03:37.031 --> 02:03:38.020
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Riboflavin,</v>

2648
02:03:38.021 --> 02:03:41.770
<v Speaker 4>15 percent of the rda of vitamin A,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six percent,</v>

2649
02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:43.000
<v Speaker 4>vitamin B,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>

2650
02:03:43.001 --> 02:03:46.060
<v Speaker 4>seven percent a selenium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is an important mineral.</v>

2651
02:03:46.061 --> 02:03:51.061
<v Speaker 4>Twenty two percent of the rda eggs also </v>
<v Speaker 4>contains small amounts of almost every </v>

2652
02:03:51.061 --> 02:03:53.080
<v Speaker 4>vitamin and mineral required by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>human body,</v>

2653
02:03:53.081 --> 02:03:54.640
<v Speaker 4>including calcium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>iron,</v>

2654
02:03:54.850 --> 02:03:56.080
<v Speaker 4>potassium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>zinc,</v>

2655
02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:59.020
<v Speaker 4>a Maganini.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what that is.</v>

2656
02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:03.310
<v Speaker 4>Manganese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamin e full and many more.</v>

2657
02:04:03.311 --> 02:04:08.290
<v Speaker 4>A large egg contains 77 calories with </v>
<v Speaker 4>six grams of quality protein,</v>

2658
02:04:08.291 --> 02:04:11.470
<v Speaker 4>five grams of fat and trace amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>carbohydrates.</v>

2659
02:04:11.471 --> 02:04:16.471
<v Speaker 4>It's very important to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost all the nutrients are contained </v>

2660
02:04:16.471 --> 02:04:16.471
<v Speaker 4>in the yolk.</v>

2661
02:04:16.471 --> 02:04:19.390
<v Speaker 4>While the white contains only protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fantastic food source,</v>

2662
02:04:19.630 --> 02:04:20.850
<v Speaker 4>and here's the thing about eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2663
02:04:20.851 --> 02:04:23.260
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't hurt the chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not hurting anything.</v>

2664
02:04:23.261 --> 02:04:25.840
<v Speaker 4>You're not harming anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have free range chickens,</v>

2665
02:04:25.841 --> 02:04:27.670
<v Speaker 4>you could just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know a lot of people can't,</v>

2666
02:04:27.790 --> 02:04:31.240
<v Speaker 4>but know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if people buy actual free range chickens</v>

2667
02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:36.900
<v Speaker 4>or buy free range chicken eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're buying eggs from an animal that </v>

2668
02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:38.970
<v Speaker 4>just going to lay every day or every </v>
<v Speaker 4>other day.</v>

2669
02:04:39.210 --> 02:04:40.890
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't get hurt.</v>

2670
02:04:41.130 --> 02:04:46.130
<v Speaker 4>And if you could figure out a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the ideal thing would be like </v>

2671
02:04:46.130 --> 02:04:49.521
<v Speaker 4>communities having like co-ops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we grow your own vegetables and you guys</v>

2672
02:04:49.651 --> 02:04:54.651
<v Speaker 4>have like a chicken coop that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of helps take care of and these </v>

2673
02:04:54.651 --> 02:04:57.810
<v Speaker 4>chickens roam around and eat bugs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>worms and all the stuff they're supposed</v>

2674
02:04:57.811 --> 02:05:02.811
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you eat those chicken eggs and </v>

2675
02:05:02.811 --> 02:05:03.930
<v Speaker 4>it's like you get animal protein but you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have to hurt anything.</v>

2676
02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:08.960
<v Speaker 4>Nothing else to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you're getting a free range of </v>

2677
02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:09.030
<v Speaker 4>truly free range chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>egg,</v>

2678
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:14.270
<v Speaker 4>it's super healthy and to SSA anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise I have to stop and now I can't</v>

2679
02:05:15.301 --> 02:05:17.490
<v Speaker 4>watch your show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't watch your movie.</v>

2680
02:05:17.491 --> 02:05:22.491

<v Speaker 4>you're not being honest like no one's </v>

2681

<v Speaker 4>saying vegetables aren't honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are.</v>

2682
02:05:22.491 --> 02:05:24.900
<v Speaker 4>Or a healthy rather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vegetables are super.</v>

2683
02:05:25.330 --> 02:05:28.440
<v Speaker 4>Beets are fantastic for you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>onions,</v>

2685
02:05:30.271 --> 02:05:32.400
<v Speaker 4>all these different things that come out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the ground.</v>

2686
02:05:32.401 --> 02:05:33.830
<v Speaker 4>Yams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sweet potatoes also.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fantastic for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nutrients.</v>

2688

<v Speaker 4>It's all important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where what's.</v>

2689
02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:38.700
<v Speaker 4>That's real food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

2690
02:05:38.701 --> 02:05:40.890
<v Speaker 4>So eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing wrong with eating eggs.</v>

2691
02:05:40.970 --> 02:05:44.660
<v Speaker 5>Like my issue was I was just being a bad</v>
<v Speaker 5>vegan because you can be vegan and still</v>

2692
02:05:44.690 --> 02:05:45.950
<v Speaker 5>eat a lot of crap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2693
02:05:46.370 --> 02:05:50.510
<v Speaker 5>So and then like years of just eaten </v>
<v Speaker 5>crap is definitely gonna Affect you.</v>

2694
02:05:50.511 --> 02:05:51.740
<v Speaker 5>No matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2695
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:56.830
<v Speaker 5>like when somebody says to Vegan like </v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you eating because you could </v>

2696
02:05:56.830 --> 02:05:57.110
<v Speaker 5>eat bad shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2697
02:05:57.140 --> 02:06:01.280
<v Speaker 5>So I just needed to cut back on the bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>

2698
02:06:01.730 --> 02:06:02.780
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2699
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:07.870
<v Speaker 5>Like stuff with sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the Vegan ice creams and just a </v>

2700
02:06:08.061 --> 02:06:10.340
<v Speaker 5>bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so now I can,</v>

2701
02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:15.370
<v Speaker 5>I feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the feeling that you were </v>

2702
02:06:15.370 --> 02:06:18.341
<v Speaker 5>asking me about before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like when you have a </v>

2703
02:06:18.341 --> 02:06:20.981
<v Speaker 5>headache but your headache is in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>body and most of the time I could </v>

2704
02:06:20.981 --> 02:06:22.580
<v Speaker 5>correlate it with when I was eating and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what I was eating.</v>

2705
02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:24.930
<v Speaker 5>So then now just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

2706
02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:29.160
<v Speaker 5>you've been eating some crap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I think sodium is good,</v>

2707
02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:34.180
<v Speaker 5>salt is good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you probably take too much it is </v>

2708
02:06:34.180 --> 02:06:34.180
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>

2709
02:06:34.180 --> 02:06:38.710
<v Speaker 4>Let me stop you again because when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're telling me you're getting blood </v>

2710
02:06:38.710 --> 02:06:41.231
<v Speaker 4>work done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting your blood work done to </v>

2711

<v Speaker 4>pressure.</v>

2712
02:06:41.231 --> 02:06:44.890
<v Speaker 4>You're not getting your blood work done </v>
<v Speaker 4>while you're checking nutritional </v>

2713
02:06:44.890 --> 02:06:44.890
<v Speaker 4>levels.</v>

2714
02:06:44.890 --> 02:06:44.890
<v Speaker 5>I think they will checking for </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything,</v>

2715
02:06:44.890 --> 02:06:48.600
<v Speaker 4>but did they tell you you need more </v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamin B or Vitamin D or b,</v>

2716
02:06:48.601 --> 02:06:51.180
<v Speaker 4>12 or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They took Niacin.</v>

2717
02:06:51.210 --> 02:06:52.350
<v Speaker 4>They never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to call them.</v>

2718
02:06:52.351 --> 02:06:57.351
<v Speaker 4>I've got to call them a real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A doctor that's going to do a real </v>

2719
02:06:57.351 --> 02:07:00.480
<v Speaker 4>nutritional profile of you is going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on your nutrient intake,</v>

2720
02:07:00.690 --> 02:07:05.690
<v Speaker 4>is going to look at like tell you to eat</v>
<v Speaker 4>normal and then come in and do some </v>

2721
02:07:05.690 --> 02:07:09.321
<v Speaker 4>blood work and then maybe they do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>again in like six weeks or something </v>

2722
02:07:09.321 --> 02:07:09.321
<v Speaker 4>like that and they're going to check a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of different things in.</v>

2723
02:07:09.321 --> 02:07:12.000
<v Speaker 4>Check your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your hormone levels active,</v>

2724
02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:14.790
<v Speaker 4>a usable testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of different things,</v>

2725
02:07:14.970 --> 02:07:18.300
<v Speaker 4>but it's really important is checking </v>
<v Speaker 4>your vitamin levels,</v>

2726
02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:23.600
<v Speaker 4>making sure that you really like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have this weird idea that you get</v>

2727
02:07:23.670 --> 02:07:26.730
<v Speaker 4>everything you need from your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might,</v>

2728
02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:29.610
<v Speaker 4>you might get everything you need from </v>
<v Speaker 4>your diet depending on your hands,</v>

2729
02:07:29.730 --> 02:07:34.730
<v Speaker 4>on your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also depends on whether or not </v>

2730
02:07:34.730 --> 02:07:34.730
<v Speaker 4>you've checked.</v>

2731
02:07:34.730 --> 02:07:36.400
<v Speaker 4>Most people haven't checked or you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to a doctor and check,</v>

2732
02:07:36.401 --> 02:07:40.150
<v Speaker 4>go get yourself checked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find out like your nutrient levels,</v>

<v Speaker 4>vitamin D,</v>

2734
02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:48.360
<v Speaker 4>maybe it needs some b12 or b six.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they can find that your body is </v>

2735
02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:52.560
<v Speaker 4>low on Niacin or maybe they think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>consuming more essential fatty acids.</v>

2736
02:07:52.841 --> 02:07:56.050
<v Speaker 4>It'd be very good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can go to a really good doctor,</v>

2737

<v Speaker 4>healthy and then they do like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>triglyceride count on you and they do </v>

2741
02:08:14.401 --> 02:08:15.360
<v Speaker 4>your blood sugar count.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Sam Harris.</v>

2742
02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:20.420
<v Speaker 4>A friend of mine just started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He tried to be Vegan for a little while </v>

2743
02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:20.420
<v Speaker 4>and his.</v>

2744
02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:24.220
<v Speaker 4>He got his blood work done like on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>regular basis because he's smart guy and</v>

2745
02:08:24.221 --> 02:08:26.070
<v Speaker 4>wants to check his body out and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2746
02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:26.950
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not good.</v>

2747
02:08:26.980 --> 02:08:31.980
<v Speaker 4>Like there's too much sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The glucose levels is a bunch of </v>

2748
02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:33.310
<v Speaker 4>different factors and forget like what </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular was,</v>

2749
02:08:33.311 --> 02:08:36.610
<v Speaker 4>but he had to switch to eating a wild </v>
<v Speaker 4>fish,</v>

2750
02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:40.080
<v Speaker 4>wild fish and then mostly Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other than that,</v>

2751
02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:41.590
<v Speaker 4>cut out the dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cut out the factory.</v>

2752
02:08:41.591 --> 02:08:42.700
<v Speaker 4>Farming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Figured it out.</v>

2753
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:48.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think that there's a lot of bad </v>

2754
02:08:48.270 --> 02:08:53.190
<v Speaker 4>in modern diets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of bad in food </v>

2755
02:08:53.190 --> 02:08:53.890
<v Speaker 4>consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't need to make stuff up.</v>

2756
02:08:54.190 --> 02:08:59.190
<v Speaker 4>We need to find out who's telling the </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth and the doctor telling you that </v>

2757
02:08:59.190 --> 02:09:01.891
<v Speaker 4>you need to cut your salt back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what's giving you high blood </v>

2758
02:09:01.891 --> 02:09:01.891
<v Speaker 4>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy's an asshole.</v>

2759
02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:06.900
<v Speaker 4>He's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether he realizes he's an asshole or </v>

2760
02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:09.841
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not paying attention to the latest </v>

2761
02:09:09.841 --> 02:09:09.841
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He some dude,</v>

2762
02:09:09.841 --> 02:09:09.841
<v Speaker 4>it's probably</v>

2763
02:09:09.841 --> 02:09:13.750
<v Speaker 2>going or he's just a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

2764
02:09:13.751 --> 02:09:16.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust doctors per se.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2765
02:09:16.961 --> 02:09:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of them,</v>

2766
02:09:18.970 --> 02:09:21.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everything else,</v>

2767
02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:26.560
<v Speaker 2>they like everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like trusting a comedian to be </v>

2768
02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:26.560
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know someone,</v>

2769
02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:27.610
<v Speaker 2>some of them that just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's never going to happen.</v>

2770
02:09:27.611 --> 02:09:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they called themselves can be.</v>

2771
02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:31.810
<v Speaker 2>Or even if they often they're being be </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the audience has no.</v>

2772
02:09:31.811 --> 02:09:33.690
<v Speaker 2>They got that shit from somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true too.</v>

2773
02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of hacky doctors out </v>

2774
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:38.750
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just bad doctors,</v>

2775
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:39.170
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of really good ones.</v>

2776
02:09:39.370 --> 02:09:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Good ones too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2777
02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:41.020
<v Speaker 2>It's really good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2778
02:09:41.021 --> 02:09:42.250
<v Speaker 2>You just have to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old you?</v>

2779
02:09:42.251 --> 02:09:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He must have been like maybe around 50.</v>

2780
02:09:46.060 --> 02:09:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Fuck him.</v>

2781
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:54.660
<v Speaker 4>I hope he's on a treadmill right now and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hears this so it just start googling.</v>

2782
02:09:54.690 --> 02:09:55.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hypertension.</v>

2783
02:09:55.490 --> 02:09:58.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he looked like he </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't google.</v>

2784
02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:03.320
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he like just drank some </v>

2785
02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:03.320
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>

2786
02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:05.250
<v Speaker 4>If you have high blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>salt still matters.</v>

2787
02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:07.890
<v Speaker 4>New Research examines these sodium </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypertension.</v>

2788
02:10:07.891 --> 02:10:11.960
<v Speaker 4>Mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it say in comes from?</v>

2789
02:10:12.210 --> 02:10:16.640
<v Speaker 4>So if you have high blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>salt matters receptor that are.</v>

2790
02:10:17.700 --> 02:10:18.720
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it say?</v>

2791
02:10:18.721 --> 02:10:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Her articles and yourselves and kidneys </v>
<v Speaker 4>continue continuously.</v>

2792
02:10:22.591 --> 02:10:24.000
<v Speaker 4>Where's this coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

2793
02:10:24.660 --> 02:10:28.630
<v Speaker 4>and this is an actual study goes well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like that to face.</v>

2794
02:10:29.370 --> 02:10:33.470
<v Speaker 4>We recently discovered a possible </v>
<v Speaker 4>explanation team study the hormone.</v>

2795
02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:38.530
<v Speaker 4>Angiotensin angiotensin helps regulate </v>
<v Speaker 4>your blood pressure when it binds to a </v>

2796
02:10:39.351 --> 02:10:44.070
<v Speaker 4>receptor called [inaudible] are and </v>
<v Speaker 4>turns it on the 81.</v>

2797
02:10:44.150 --> 02:10:49.150
<v Speaker 4>Our molecules in your cells of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>kidneys continuously regulate the levels</v>

2798
02:10:49.311 --> 02:10:54.311
<v Speaker 4>of sodium in the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This relationship can be overactive in </v>

2799
02:10:54.311 --> 02:10:54.380
<v Speaker 4>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which leads to high blood pressure.</v>

2800
02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:59.360
<v Speaker 4>There's hope in the forms of a drug </v>
<v Speaker 4>called 81 are blockers,</v>

2801
02:10:59.860 --> 02:11:02.840
<v Speaker 4>a true to their name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These drugs block Ngo,</v>

2802
02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:08.860
<v Speaker 4>angiotensin from binding with our </v>
<v Speaker 4>thereby keeping blood pressure lower to </v>

2803
02:11:09.321 --> 02:11:14.321
<v Speaker 4>make these drugs even more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Researchers want to understand the </v>

2804
02:11:14.321 --> 02:11:14.321
<v Speaker 4>molecular structure of 81 arm.</v>

2805
02:11:14.670 --> 02:11:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is still important.</v>

2806
02:11:17.571 --> 02:11:20.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the number one thing.</v>

2807
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:22.960
<v Speaker 1>So it's not giving it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you have it,</v>

2808
02:11:22.961 --> 02:11:24.550
<v Speaker 1>it may be a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2809
02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:27.360
<v Speaker 1>So if you wonder what their levels are </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about.</v>

2810
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:29.430
<v Speaker 1>So like when you're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels that didn't,</v>

2811
02:11:29.431 --> 02:11:34.431
<v Speaker 1>that test when they were given it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rats and you give it 500 grams off song </v>

2812
02:11:34.431 --> 02:11:34.431
<v Speaker 1>wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2813
02:11:34.431 --> 02:11:36.000
<v Speaker 1>you definitely die from eating that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

2814
02:11:36.090 --> 02:11:41.090
<v Speaker 1>So I think that we just need more </v>
<v Speaker 1>transparency and honesty and it comes to</v>

2815
02:11:43.021 --> 02:11:46.560
<v Speaker 1>what people actually know versus what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're claiming to know.</v>

2816
02:11:46.890 --> 02:11:49.440
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're talking to a doctor</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's giving you shit advice.</v>

2817
02:11:49.441 --> 02:11:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to,</v>

2818
02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:55.640
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to a ton of doctors and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can get everything you want </v>

2819
02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:55.920
<v Speaker 1>from the average American diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no need to take vitamins.</v>

2820
02:11:55.921 --> 02:11:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Your pm out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's straight up.</v>

2821
02:11:58.730 --> 02:12:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take b a to k,</v>

2822
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:04.890
<v Speaker 1>take be twelfth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take [inaudible] you know,</v>

2823
02:12:04.891 --> 02:12:08.310
<v Speaker 1>you're probably not really vague and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

2824
02:12:09.410 --> 02:12:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to be healthy.</v>

2825
02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:17.180
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care where it comes from them </v>

2826
02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:17.180
<v Speaker 1>this as long as a good sauce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel good.</v>

2827
02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Baby eyelids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

2828
02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:19.680
<v Speaker 1>babies should have defended themselves.</v>

2829
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Those babies are here for a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you,</v>

2830
02:12:24.650 --> 02:12:29.650
<v Speaker 1>do you have like a main staple like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you like say if you're at home and </v>

2831
02:12:29.650 --> 02:12:33.021
<v Speaker 1>you cook it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there like a main thing that you </v>

2832
02:12:33.021 --> 02:12:33.021
<v Speaker 1>utilize?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like wild rice,</v>

2833
02:12:33.021 --> 02:12:35.430
<v Speaker 1>wild rice or pasta?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chemo was great and uh,</v>

2834
02:12:35.610 --> 02:12:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Chemo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chemo is one of those rare plants that </v>

2835
02:12:40.610 --> 02:12:40.610
<v Speaker 1>as like a full amino acid profile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2836
02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:43.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like hemp and a few other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2837
02:12:43.801 --> 02:12:45.390
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a few of those,</v>

2838
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:47.830
<v Speaker 1>a protein rich plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2839
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:51.150
<v Speaker 1>like some plants that have good amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of protein in them.</v>

2840
02:12:51.210 --> 02:12:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I put hemp seeds in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my,</v>

2841
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:54.960
<v Speaker 1>in my smoothies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

2842
02:12:55.260 --> 02:12:58.010
<v Speaker 1>And Chia seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chia seeds are great too.</v>

2843
02:12:58.050 --> 02:13:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That also cleans your pipes out.</v>

2844
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:01.830
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2845
02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I put Kale in them so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2846
02:13:05.250 --> 02:13:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you use coconut oil at all?</v>

2847
02:13:06.910 --> 02:13:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cook with it or use it for other shit.</v>

2848
02:13:10.140 --> 02:13:12.750
<v Speaker 1>It's good to add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you make smoothies and shit like</v>

2849
02:13:12.751 --> 02:13:17.751
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good to add because the Fascia put </v>

2850
02:13:17.751 --> 02:13:17.751
<v Speaker 1>something in there and helps the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absorption of the vitamins.</v>

2851
02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I had to learn that one the hard way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not the meat.</v>

2852
02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:25.860
<v Speaker 1>This adding mct oil to a shakes makes it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just makes it more nutritious,</v>

2853
02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.910
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to be careful because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will shit yourself.</v>

2854
02:13:30.210 --> 02:13:31.560
<v Speaker 1>You have to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

2855
02:13:31.590 --> 02:13:36.000
<v Speaker 1>you can't go too hard with the mct oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can get like a few tablespoons in</v>

2856
02:13:36.001 --> 02:13:39.210
<v Speaker 1>a big glass of,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Your body's like just released the </v>

02:13:51.230 --> 02:13:51.230
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It almost feels.</v>

2898
02:15:30.890 --> 02:15:34.401
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be using like some cheap ass </v>

2948
02:17:54.001 --> 02:17:55.720
<v Speaker 1>something which is probably what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to think right back in the day when</v>

02:17:55.721 --> 02:18:00.721
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought you were possessed by the </v>

<v Speaker 1>killed them,</v>

2955
02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:09.820
<v Speaker 1>killed them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or throw them in a dungeon.</v>

2956
02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Bright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're having a fucking lockup </v>

<v Speaker 1>to cross the believing in the devil </v>

2960
02:18:25.770 --> 02:18:25.770
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

02:18:25.770 --> 02:18:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean believing in it?</v>

2962
02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Talking about it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like he crossed the line.</v>

2966
02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:40.230
<v Speaker 1>People are afraid of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people talk about God keep be </v>

2967
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:43.860
<v Speaker 1>talking about God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you usually can't have one without </v>

2968
02:18:43.860 --> 02:18:43.860
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The devil is in the Bible,</v>

2969
02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:44.670
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

2970
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it shows this the slow cultural </v>

2971
02:18:49.950 --> 02:18:53.251
<v Speaker 1>evolution that we were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've realized how ridiculous it is to </v>

2972
02:18:53.251 --> 02:18:54.700
<v Speaker 1>think that some dude in a fiery pit with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pitchfork,</v>

2973
02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:56.980
<v Speaker 1>unless you have one of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>listens to this,</v>

2974
02:18:57.580 --> 02:18:58.840
<v Speaker 1>still believes in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

2975
02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not telling you right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be right,</v>

2976
02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:04.870
<v Speaker 1>but for most people that's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>

2977
02:19:04.871 --> 02:19:06.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>

2978
02:19:06.370 --> 02:19:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

2979
02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:08.980
<v Speaker 1>He's going to torture you in the fires </v>
<v Speaker 1>of hell forever,</v>

2980
02:19:09.430 --> 02:19:14.020
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of religious belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a package deal.</v>

2981
02:19:14.021 --> 02:19:19.021
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying is it's a weird </v>

2982
02:19:19.021 --> 02:19:19.840
<v Speaker 1>thing that will allow people to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the package.</v>

2983
02:19:19.841 --> 02:19:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to buy the wax.</v>

2984
02:19:21.281 --> 02:19:23.560
<v Speaker 1>You can just get the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the armor,</v>

2985
02:19:23.561 --> 02:19:27.040
<v Speaker 1>all the tires and you don't have to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wax part.</v>

2986
02:19:27.050 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 1>But this is where</v>

2987
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:33.070
<v Speaker 5>the devil comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The devil comes in to help scare people </v>

2988
02:19:33.470 --> 02:19:38.470
<v Speaker 5>into Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you're a preacher or a jail was </v>

2989
02:19:39.351 --> 02:19:42.140
<v Speaker 5>witnessed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what somebody like,</v>

2990
02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:46.190
<v Speaker 5>if I'm going to scare you into being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like scared straight.</v>

2991
02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:48.590
<v Speaker 5>If I'm going to scare you into being </v>
<v Speaker 5>good,</v>

2992
02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:51.940
<v Speaker 5>I gotta take you to prison so you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>see what prisoners.</v>

2993
02:19:51.980 --> 02:19:56.980
<v Speaker 5>Like if I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Part of being a Christian is not just </v>

2994
02:19:56.980 --> 02:19:57.920
<v Speaker 5>being good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

2995
02:19:57.921 --> 02:20:02.921
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I got to give you these stories of </v>

2996
02:20:02.921 --> 02:20:07.451
<v Speaker 5>people in Hell and paint this picture so</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you make this choice that I want </v>

2997
02:20:08.091 --> 02:20:13.091
<v Speaker 5>you to make.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the devil is a very important thing </v>

2998
02:20:13.091 --> 02:20:14.210
<v Speaker 5>in making people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Christians</v>

2999
02:20:14.290 --> 02:20:16.750
<v Speaker 3>used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now things are getting more and more</v>

3000
02:20:16.751 --> 02:20:21.751
<v Speaker 3>slippery because it's more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous because more and more people </v>

3001
02:20:21.751 --> 02:20:25.051
<v Speaker 3>are making fun of Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now it's like you don't bring up the </v>

3002
02:20:25.051 --> 02:20:25.051
<v Speaker 3>devil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3003
02:20:25.051 --> 02:20:26.320
<v Speaker 3>So like if the president could go on on </v>
<v Speaker 3>television,</v>

3004
02:20:26.321 --> 02:20:29.610
<v Speaker 3>say God bless America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are a nation governed by God.</v>

3005
02:20:29.630 --> 02:20:30.420
<v Speaker 3>Everybody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3006
02:20:31.090 --> 02:20:33.250
<v Speaker 3>but if he says we have located the </v>
<v Speaker 3>devil,</v>

3007
02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:35.570
<v Speaker 3>he's in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're sending troops to that area.</v>

3008
02:20:35.571 --> 02:20:36.520
<v Speaker 3>And people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3009
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:39.580
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man?</v>

3010
02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:41.560
<v Speaker 3>You can't say the devil is a real thing.</v>

3011
02:20:41.770 --> 02:20:42.460
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

3012
02:20:42.490 --> 02:20:43.360
<v Speaker 5>It's like a.</v>

3013
02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:46.700
<v Speaker 3>The problem is the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If trump got on TV,</v>

3014
02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:52.180
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying when I said grab them by the </v>

3015
02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:52.180
<v Speaker 3>Pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was not me.</v>

3016
02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:55.040
<v Speaker 3>That was the devil speaking through me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now I understand and everybody would</v>

3017
02:20:55.041 --> 02:21:00.041
<v Speaker 3>clap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The devil is in our heart and our soul </v>

3018
02:21:00.041 --> 02:21:03.221
<v Speaker 3>and we need to stop him from ruining </v>
<v Speaker 3>life on earth before Jesus returns and </v>

3019
02:21:03.441 --> 02:21:07.370
<v Speaker 3>offers us eternal salvation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3020
02:21:07.371 --> 02:21:12.371
<v Speaker 3>You could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could almost imagine someone saying </v>

3021
02:21:12.371 --> 02:21:14.921
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not someone saying something like </v>

3022
02:21:14.921 --> 02:21:14.921
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not quite.</v>

3023
02:21:14.921 --> 02:21:18.550
<v Speaker 5>They would like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always think like you ever seen those </v>

3024
02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:20.180
<v Speaker 5>core cases where somebody said they </v>
<v Speaker 5>heard voices.</v>

3025
02:21:20.330 --> 02:21:21.890
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they killed somebody,</v>

3026
02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:22.640
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3027
02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:25.880
<v Speaker 5>So that's a of schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that person's on trial.</v>

3028
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:31.150
<v Speaker 5>That person's on trial and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's looking at that person like </v>

3029
02:21:31.150 --> 02:21:31.580
<v Speaker 5>they're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3030
02:21:31.610 --> 02:21:32.510
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3031
02:21:32.540 --> 02:21:37.540
<v Speaker 5>But before that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people who testified against that </v>

3032
02:21:37.540 --> 02:21:41.681
<v Speaker 5>guy testified they have to put their </v>
<v Speaker 5>hand on the Bible and swear to God that </v>

3033
02:21:41.681 --> 02:21:45.560
<v Speaker 5>they can't see to give testimony that </v>
<v Speaker 5>this person is crazy.</v>

3034
02:21:46.010 --> 02:21:48.830
<v Speaker 5>What is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said he heard voices.</v>

3035
02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:51.380
<v Speaker 5>Your swearing to something you can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>see.</v>

3036
02:21:51.410 --> 02:21:53.150
<v Speaker 5>So help me God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So help me God.</v>

3037
02:21:53.151 --> 02:21:54.220
<v Speaker 5>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

3038
02:21:54.290 --> 02:21:55.370
<v Speaker 5>What's the difference?</v>

3039
02:21:55.500 --> 02:21:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3040
02:21:55.921 --> 02:22:00.921
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're swearing to an imaginary make </v>

3041
02:22:00.921 --> 02:22:00.921
<v Speaker 3>believe person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3042
02:22:00.921 --> 02:22:02.850
<v Speaker 3>That may or may not have created the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire universe and six days.</v>

3043
02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:06.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they might not be crazy,</v>

3044
02:22:06.090 --> 02:22:07.260
<v Speaker 3>but this guy's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3045
02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:08.910
<v Speaker 3>This guy's hearing voices to tell them </v>
<v Speaker 3>to kill.</v>

3046
02:22:09.100 --> 02:22:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Fall off from this guy or you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3047
02:22:11.970 --> 02:22:13.680

<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

3048
02:22:13.890 --> 02:22:18.030
<v Speaker 3>I have a personal relationship with God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to God every night.</v>

3049
02:22:18.690 --> 02:22:20.730
<v Speaker 3>That was the thing about Bush to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>drive me crazy.</v>

3050
02:22:20.731 --> 02:22:22.320
<v Speaker 3>When you say talked to God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3051
02:22:22.321 --> 02:22:27.321

3052
02:22:27.321 --> 02:22:30.140
<v Speaker 3>God's talking back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not really having a conversation </v>

3053
02:22:30.140 --> 02:22:32.750
<v Speaker 3>because people could be telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to Joe Rogan every night </v>

3054
02:22:32.750 --> 02:22:32.750
<v Speaker 3>because you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you listening to the podcast goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>God Damn.</v>

3056
02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:36.570
<v Speaker 3>You can tell that story again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not really talking to me,</v>

3057
02:22:36.571 --> 02:22:37.230
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3059
02:22:37.980 --> 02:22:42.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last thing George did was talk to </v>

3060
02:22:42.980 --> 02:22:43.830
<v Speaker 3>God every night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last thing he did,</v>

3061
02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:47.970
<v Speaker 3>every evening I talked to God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gives me my plans.</v>

3062
02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to Ian Edwards every evening.</v>

3063
02:22:51.090 --> 02:22:53.430
<v Speaker 3>I listened to his podcast about soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me.</v>

3064
02:22:53.431 --> 02:22:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean football and I started screaming </v>
<v Speaker 3>at them.</v>

3065
02:22:56.250 --> 02:22:57.690
<v Speaker 3>So there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3066
02:22:57.691 --> 02:23:02.691
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't hear too many people saying </v>

3067
02:23:02.691 --> 02:23:02.970
<v Speaker 3>they actually heard from God because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where it gets slippery.</v>

3068
02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:05.460
<v Speaker 3>Like you could talk to God all crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3069
02:23:05.461 --> 02:23:06.780
<v Speaker 3>You sound like a nut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3070
02:23:07.090 --> 02:23:12.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a bit that I've been doing lately </v>

3071
02:23:12.090 --> 02:23:12.090
<v Speaker 3>about how no one likes new miracles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3072
02:23:12.090 --> 02:23:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that.</v>

3073
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:16.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if I heard that bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're right.</v>

3074
02:23:16.350 --> 02:23:21.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like we like old man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He believed the ones that happened in </v>

3075
02:23:21.350 --> 02:23:24.081
<v Speaker 3>the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If somebody says this miracle happened </v>

3076
02:23:24.081 --> 02:23:24.081
<v Speaker 3>to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were crazy,</v>

3077
02:23:24.081 --> 02:23:24.081
<v Speaker 3>but don't you believe in God?</v>

3078
02:23:24.081 --> 02:23:25.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll get to like Joseph Smith,</v>

3079
02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:30.560
<v Speaker 3>Joseph Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the bounds of incredulity cause </v>

3080
02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:31.230
<v Speaker 3>that's the 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 18,</v>

3081
02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:32.850
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it 18?</v>

3082
02:23:32.860 --> 02:23:37.860
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's found the golden tablets that </v>

3083
02:23:37.860 --> 02:23:41.421
<v Speaker 3>contained the work of the last work of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus and only he could read them </v>

3084
02:23:41.421 --> 02:23:43.350
<v Speaker 3>because he had a magic seer stone that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he would look through.</v>

3085
02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:49.080
<v Speaker 3>The angels came and took it away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all of it was like crazy miracle </v>

3086
02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:52.311
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's all just long enough just long </v>

3087
02:23:52.311 --> 02:23:52.830
<v Speaker 3>enough ago where people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3088
02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:54.630
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was still going on back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3089
02:23:54.631 --> 02:23:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3090
02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:57.870
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not in 2017.</v>

3091
02:23:57.920 --> 02:23:58.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't come.</v>

3092
02:23:58.621 --> 02:24:01.860
<v Speaker 3>You can come with that unless you got </v>
<v Speaker 3>some super proof.</v>

3093
02:24:02.130 --> 02:24:07.130
<v Speaker 3>But now people are not going to believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that super proof anymore because of all </v>

3094
02:24:07.130 --> 02:24:07.830
<v Speaker 3>this three d rendering software and </v>
<v Speaker 3>adobe photoshop.</v>

3095
02:24:07.831 --> 02:24:09.210
<v Speaker 3>And have you seen that thing?</v>

3096
02:24:09.210 --> 02:24:11.730
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about it yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're able to,</v>

3097
02:24:11.731 --> 02:24:16.731
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could talk for 20 minutes and </v>

3098
02:24:16.731 --> 02:24:19.191
<v Speaker 3>they'll take your voice and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially over 20 minutes they find </v>

3099
02:24:19.191 --> 02:24:23.750
<v Speaker 3>everything you've ever said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the noises that you can make in 20 </v>

3100
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:24.120
<v Speaker 3>minutes or 40 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 minutes.</v>

3101
02:24:24.121 --> 02:24:26.160
<v Speaker 3>Actually they could do it in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they prefer 40.</v>

3102
02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:30.270
<v Speaker 3>So they could make you say words you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>never said before.</v>

3103
02:24:30.390 --> 02:24:32.250
<v Speaker 3>Like you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3104
02:24:32.310 --> 02:24:33.420
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe and Jamie,</v>

3105
02:24:33.450 --> 02:24:35.910
<v Speaker 3>let's do a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they could say,</v>

3106
02:24:35.911 --> 02:24:40.911
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe and Jamie and Mike and Steve and </v>

3107
02:24:40.911 --> 02:24:40.911
<v Speaker 3>Debbie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do a podcast.</v>

3108
02:24:40.911 --> 02:24:41.070
<v Speaker 3>And he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

3109
02:24:41.071 --> 02:24:42.450
<v Speaker 3>I never said Mike and Steven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Debbie,</v>

3110
02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:45.830
<v Speaker 3>they can make your voice say those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things with,</v>

3111
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:48.060
<v Speaker 3>with new computer software and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't.</v>

3112
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:50.310
<v Speaker 3>So what evidence is evidence now in </v>
<v Speaker 3>court?</v>

3113
02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:55.400
<v Speaker 3>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point is it's getting so close to </v>

3114
02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:56.340
<v Speaker 3>being impossible to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If something's fake.</v>

3115
02:24:56.490 --> 02:24:58.230
<v Speaker 3>Like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can still kind of tell,</v>

3116
02:24:58.290 --> 02:25:03.290
<v Speaker 3>like still a little clunky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a few years away from being </v>

3117
02:25:03.290 --> 02:25:04.620
<v Speaker 3>indiscernible you're not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to tell me,</v>

3118
02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:06.600
<v Speaker 3>get manufacturer anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3119
02:25:07.260 --> 02:25:08.170
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3120
02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:13.220
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be really interesting </v>

3121
02:25:13.220 --> 02:25:15.260
<v Speaker 3>because they're also going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have people like you won't have to like </v>

3122
02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:17.610
<v Speaker 3>bring John Wayne back to life to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>John Wayne movie.</v>

3123
02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:23.000
<v Speaker 3>You could have a fake John Wayne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have hours and hours of John Wayne </v>

3124
02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:23.000
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take that,</v>

3125
02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.130
<v Speaker 3>you throw it into a computer</v>

3126
02:25:24.430 --> 02:25:29.430
<v Speaker 4>and it can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could write a script like you could </v>

3127
02:25:29.430 --> 02:25:31.660
<v Speaker 4>write a script or John Wayne is in some </v>
<v Speaker 4>new high tech Western movie.</v>

3128
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Didn't they make a star wars rogue one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they do some shit like that?</v>

3129
02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:41.450
<v Speaker 1>They added a princess Leia in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was after she was dead.</v>

3130
02:25:41.490 --> 02:25:45.050
<v Speaker 1>She was and they made her younger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>she already was one of the guys.</v>

3131
02:25:45.051 --> 02:25:48.500
<v Speaker 1>The admiral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it good alert by the way,</v>

3132
02:25:48.810 --> 02:25:52.370

<v Speaker 4>are mocking social justice warriors.</v>

3140
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:20.770
<v Speaker 4>There was an article in huff post which </v>
<v Speaker 4>is like the Super Liberal Rag,</v>

<v Speaker 1>grateful for being on Star Trek.</v>

3152
02:26:52.690 --> 02:26:54.010
<v Speaker 1>But he's like,</v>

3174
02:27:45.551 --> 02:27:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Came from some show called outlander.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3177
02:27:53.090 --> 02:27:55.791

<v Speaker 4>fascinating in a way that only fandom </v>

3178

<v Speaker 1>Stop back up.</v>

3208
02:29:27.550 --> 02:29:32.550

<v Speaker 4>resume is belittled by same feminists </v>

3209
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:35.500

<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 86.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that he's going to </v>

3211

<v Speaker 1>I bet that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

3216
02:29:47.850 --> 02:29:49.110
<v Speaker 1>He's in his eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

3217

<v Speaker 1>It's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're that close to death,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but like what is that like wire.</v>

3222
02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Why are they going back and forth like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

<v Speaker 4>video games,</v>

3243
02:30:57.471 --> 02:31:02.471
<v Speaker 4>but they were concerned with sexism and </v>
<v Speaker 4>video games and they were trying to </v>

<v Speaker 2>just a show at a club and uh,</v>

3294
02:33:08.370 --> 02:33:10.130
<v Speaker 2>they pay for that.</v>

3296
02:33:12.450 --> 02:33:17.450
<v Speaker 2>I got an offer once and what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>offered me is if I came down there and </v>

3297
02:33:17.450 --> 02:33:21.471

<v Speaker 2>go to all the shows and it was worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 1500 bucks.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3302
02:33:28.740 --> 02:33:33.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is just like one faction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this organization that thinks it's a </v>

3303
02:33:33.740 --> 02:33:35.610
<v Speaker 2>good idea to offer that to people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>small,</v>

3353
02:35:41.591 --> 02:35:44.770
<v Speaker 2>small venue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

3354
02:35:45.340 --> 02:35:46.600
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to organize that though</v>

3355
02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:49.090
<v Speaker 1>and I wouldn't want to like say no to </v>

3360
02:35:53.951 --> 02:35:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>

3361
02:35:55.420 --> 02:35:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I was talking to Al Magical about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3362
02:35:57.440 --> 02:35:59.350
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about putting together that</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy network.</v>

3363
02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:01.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of people on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy network.</v>

02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:01.800
<v Speaker 1>He's like</v>

3365
02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:07.330
<v Speaker 2>the fuck you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be careful,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Got To be careful putting together a </v>

3367
02:36:12.770 --> 02:36:12.770
<v Speaker 2>network of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3368
02:36:12.770 --> 02:36:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Because some people are either unaware </v>
<v Speaker 2>or just belligerently don't care.</v>

3369
02:36:17.111 --> 02:36:18.640
<v Speaker 2>They just want to get on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3370
02:36:18.641 --> 02:36:21.190
<v Speaker 2>And they'll try to force their way in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah.</v>

3371
02:36:21.570 --> 02:36:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's an issue with podcasts?</v>

3372
02:36:24.750 --> 02:36:26.580
<v Speaker 1>People try to force their way on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I get that shit all the time.</v>

3374
02:36:29.281 --> 02:36:34.281
<v Speaker 1>People that just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I would have them on the </v>

3375
02:36:34.281 --> 02:36:35.000
<v Speaker 1>corner me and want to get on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

3376
02:36:35.001 --> 02:36:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

3377
02:36:35.550 --> 02:36:38.790
<v Speaker 1>this way you think works and just get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I wanted you to be honest,</v>

3378
02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:40.920
<v Speaker 1>ask you they have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have nothing to lose.</v>

3379
02:36:40.990 --> 02:36:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3380
02:36:42.270 --> 02:36:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>

3381
02:36:43.140 --> 02:36:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I want you to watch her act with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was go over together,</v>

3382
02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:47.850
<v Speaker 1>sit down there with a yellow legal pad </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

3383
02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:50.820
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is,</v>

3384
02:36:51.300 --> 02:36:54.120
<v Speaker 1>it's just a personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conflict is a real problem.</v>

3385
02:36:54.121 --> 02:36:57.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not even like the material as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>as who they are.</v>

3386
02:36:57.810 --> 02:37:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Some people you just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are just not that aware.</v>

3387
02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:03.810
<v Speaker 1>They don't make good conversationalists </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be around them.</v>

3388
02:37:03.950 --> 02:37:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially some people like based on the</v>

3389
02:37:07.381 --> 02:37:12.381
<v Speaker 2>material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're not a good </v>

3390
02:37:12.381 --> 02:37:12.381
<v Speaker 2>conversationalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3391
02:37:12.381 --> 02:37:12.381
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking about that,</v>

3392
02:37:13.300 --> 02:37:14.840
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3393
02:37:14.841 --> 02:37:15.770
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

3394
02:37:15.771 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 2>People</v>

3395
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:17.960
<v Speaker 1>want to promote themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want things to go ahead,</v>

3396
02:37:17.961 --> 02:37:22.070
<v Speaker 1>but like sometimes it's like how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>should we be promoting yourself,</v>

3397
02:37:22.071 --> 02:37:24.260
<v Speaker 1>how much you should be working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>improving yourself.</v>

3398
02:37:24.290 --> 02:37:29.290
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was always those people that were </v>

3399
02:37:29.290 --> 02:37:30.630
<v Speaker 1>like really good promoters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have a really good </v>

3400
02:37:30.630 --> 02:37:32.531
<v Speaker 1>product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have enough of a good product </v>

3401
02:37:32.531 --> 02:37:34.430
<v Speaker 1>that the promotion sort of carry their </v>
<v Speaker 1>product and the enthusiasm behind it got</v>

3402
02:37:34.431 --> 02:37:36.580
<v Speaker 1>people into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it the Hustle Gino.</v>

3403
02:37:36.670 --> 02:37:39.960
<v Speaker 5>Oh wish I had more of the hustle gene,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3404
02:37:40.410 --> 02:37:45.410
<v Speaker 5>But then I wonder how much of my </v>
<v Speaker 5>creativity would have to sacrifice for </v>

3405
02:37:45.571 --> 02:37:47.760
<v Speaker 5>the wholesale Jean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

3406
02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:49.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a conundrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3407
02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:54.440
<v Speaker 1>it seems like the people who really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hustle aren't as good as the most </v>

3408
02:37:55.390 --> 02:37:57.390
<v Speaker 1>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it feels like.</v>

3409
02:37:57.420 --> 02:37:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it really feels like.</v>

3410
02:37:59.131 --> 02:38:01.860
<v Speaker 1>It does feel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the scary thing.</v>

3411
02:38:01.890 --> 02:38:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Especially the promotional gene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3412
02:38:04.050 --> 02:38:05.670
<v Speaker 1>The promotional genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Weird one,</v>

3413
02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:11.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those dudes that like early on open mic </v>

3414
02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:11.370
<v Speaker 1>nights they were starting their own open</v>
<v Speaker 1>mic and putting up flyers and say like,</v>

3415
02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:14.040
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you so confident?</v>

3416
02:38:14.910 --> 02:38:18.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not inviting anybody throw it out of</v>

3417
02:38:18.481 --> 02:38:22.020
<v Speaker 1>here out at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the last time you showed up at an</v>

3418
02:38:22.021 --> 02:38:24.480
<v Speaker 1>open mic into the set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

3419
02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:27.800
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went back to,</v>

3420
02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:30.020
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do a set.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We went to Madison,</v>

3421
02:38:30.021 --> 02:38:35.021
<v Speaker 5>Wisconsin to do the weekend at comedy on</v>
<v Speaker 5>state and then his pizza shop that has </v>

3422
02:38:36.771 --> 02:38:41.771
<v Speaker 5>an open mic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So after the show on I think Thursday </v>

3423
02:38:41.771 --> 02:38:44.180
<v Speaker 5>night we went to the pizza shop and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>put our names on a list.</v>

3424
02:38:44.690 --> 02:38:49.550
<v Speaker 5>But then they ended the show before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was like,</v>

3425
02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:51.590
<v Speaker 5>I want it to do it.</v>

3426
02:38:52.660 --> 02:38:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Was it too many people that signed up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it,</v>

3427
02:38:54.371 --> 02:38:56.800
<v Speaker 1>is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like we got there because we just</v>

3428
02:38:56.801 --> 02:39:01.801
<v Speaker 1>did a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got there towards the end of the few </v>

3429
02:39:01.801 --> 02:39:02.760
<v Speaker 1>audience members were leaving.</v>

3430
02:39:02.820 --> 02:39:06.090
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing about open mics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like some comics are new and they're not</v>

3431
02:39:06.091 --> 02:39:08.970
<v Speaker 5>that good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how much is the audience going to sit</v>

3432
02:39:08.971 --> 02:39:10.560
<v Speaker 5>through?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3433
02:39:10.561 --> 02:39:12.990
<v Speaker 5>they might've sat through five back </v>
<v Speaker 5>conferences,</v>

3434
02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.270
<v Speaker 5>lot to sit through and you might have </v>
<v Speaker 5>sat through more.</v>

3435
02:39:15.540 --> 02:39:20.540
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then they don't know who's coming up </v>

3436
02:39:20.540 --> 02:39:20.540
<v Speaker 5>next.</v>

3437
02:39:20.540 --> 02:39:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what's weird about the store</v>
<v Speaker 1>these days.</v>

3438
02:39:20.980 --> 02:39:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Even the open mic night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's packed.</v>

3439
02:39:23.350 --> 02:39:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you noticed it's crazy.</v>

3440
02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Go to open mic now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 100 people in the audience and </v>

3441
02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:31.400
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

3442
02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:32.470
<v Speaker 1>But they're putting some of the store </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics on those shows too.</v>

3443
02:39:33.270 --> 02:39:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're smart.</v>

3444
02:39:35.230 --> 02:39:40.230
<v Speaker 1>It is smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about a like a </v>

3445
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:42.320
<v Speaker 1>real regular open mic night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the.</v>

3446
02:39:42.580 --> 02:39:46.450
<v Speaker 1>This is the first sparks from a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>metal and a rock.</v>

3447
02:39:46.630 --> 02:39:51.630
<v Speaker 1>When you start a fire feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a thing where people try to make </v>

3448
02:39:51.791 --> 02:39:53.230
<v Speaker 1>fire kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang comedy.</v>

3449
02:39:53.770 --> 02:39:56.110
<v Speaker 1>That's like the first sparks and you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and you're like,</v>

3450
02:39:56.190 --> 02:39:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me nervous.</v>

3451
02:39:58.450 --> 02:40:00.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is kind of nerve wracking.</v>

3452
02:40:01.150 --> 02:40:06.150
<v Speaker 5>I used to do them a lot when I first </v>
<v Speaker 5>moved out here just to get stage time </v>

3453
02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:09.040
<v Speaker 5>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kind of refuse to like audition to get</v>

3454
02:40:09.041 --> 02:40:11.350
<v Speaker 5>in the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At first I was like,</v>

3455
02:40:11.740 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 5>I've already done TV spots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to audition to get</v>

3456
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:17.130
<v Speaker 2>in the store until,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until I really got it and they said,</v>

3457
02:40:17.131 --> 02:40:18.610
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to get them to the store and to</v>

3458
02:40:18.611 --> 02:40:23.611
<v Speaker 2>the laugh factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I was writing a lot so I was </v>

3459
02:40:23.611 --> 02:40:23.611
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

3460
02:40:23.611 --> 02:40:27.150
<v Speaker 2>But then when I realized that the night </v>
<v Speaker 2>I got into the store was like one of the</v>

3461
02:40:27.151 --> 02:40:30.150
<v Speaker 2>best nights in show business for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3462
02:40:30.151 --> 02:40:31.350
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3464
02:40:32.880 --> 02:40:33.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3465
02:40:33.540 --> 02:40:36.240
<v Speaker 2>I can work out in 15 minute chunks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3466
02:40:36.241 --> 02:40:41.241
<v Speaker 2>Material I call my manager has just </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten to stories like I've never heard </v>

<v Speaker 2>What's the big deal?</v>

3468

<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

3473
02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:58.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you pull into that parking lot and </v>

3474
02:40:58.040 --> 02:41:00.111
<v Speaker 4>you get out and you go say hi to </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody and you want it to those </v>

3477
02:41:00.111 --> 02:41:02.310
<v Speaker 4>And you go into the main rooms packed </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's crushing,</v>

3478
02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:05.530

<v Speaker 4>Someone's upstairs smashing.</v>

3482
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:18.030
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's so many up and coming </v>
